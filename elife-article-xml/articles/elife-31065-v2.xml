during the somite-forming stages. The molecular mechanisms regulating these complex processes are still largely unknown. We show that the Hippo pathway transcriptional coactivators Yap1 and Wwtr1 are specifically localized to the presumptive epidermis and notochord, and play a critical and unexpected role in posterior body extension by regulating Fibronectin assembly underneath the presumptive epidermis and surrounding the notochord. We further find that Yap1 and Wwtr1, also via Fibronectin, have an essential role in the epidermal morphogenesis necessary to form the initial dorsal and ventral fins, a process previously thought to involve bending of an epithelial sheet, but which we now show involves concerted active cell movement. Our results reveal how the Hippo pathway transcriptional program, localized to two specific tissues, acts to control essential morphological events in the vertebrate embryo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vertebrate embryo elongation</kwd><kwd>fin formation</kwd><kwd>Hippo pathway</kwd><kwd>Fibronectin</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM079203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kimelman</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Natalie L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>Jason Kuan Han</given-names></name><name><surname>Stainier</surname><given-names>Didier YR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of a double mutant in the Hippo pathway transcription factors Yap1 and Wwtr1 reveals novel roles for these factors in posterior body formation and epidermal morphogenesis in the vertebrate embryo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A key step in the development of the vertebrate embryonic body is the change from the roughly spherical-shaped embryo at the end of gastrulation to the elongated body present at the end of the somite-forming stages when the initial anterior-posterior body plan is fully established (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bénazéraf and Pourquié, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henrique et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimelman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). This process involves complex morphogenetic changes as cells migrate out of a bipotential neuromesodermal progenitor population located at the most posterior end of the embryo and into the presomitic mesoderm and posterior neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bénazéraf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanki and Ho, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawton et al., 2013</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McMillen and Holley, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Serwane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steventon et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The factors and mechanisms regulating these morphogenetic events are still largely unknown, but are an active area of research. The mesodermal transcription factors Tbx6/16 and Mesogenin play an essential role in this process as mutants in these genes fail to form the posterior body axis normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chalamalasetty et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapman and Papaioannou, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fior et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kimmel et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manning and Kimelman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nowotschin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yabe and Takada, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoon and Wold, 2000</xref>), although the relative importance of each factor is species specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimelman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nowotschin et al., 2012</xref>). The signaling factors Wnt and Fgf also play essential roles by controlling various aspects of cell movement at the posterior end of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bénazéraf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steventon et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>An additional factor that was shown to have a major role in overall early vertebrate body morphogenesis is the Hippo pathway transcription factor Yap1, a key mechanotransduction sensor whose activity is regulated both through protein degradation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Piccolo et al., 2014</xref>). In this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Porazinski et al., 2015</xref>), a medaka <italic>yap1</italic> mutant (<italic>hirame</italic>) was shown to have a severely distorted body form that was described as being a flattened embryo, although the specific role of Yap1 in forming the posterior body during somitogenesis was not examined. Yap1 was thus proposed to regulate tissue tension throughout the medaka embryo, thereby opposing the forces of gravity. Based on additional studies using 3D spheroids of human retinal epithelial cells, Yap1 was proposed to act by regulating the transcription of one or more Rho GTPase activating protein genes (<italic>arhgaps</italic>), although these genes were not shown to be functional targets of Yap1 in the medaka embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Porazinski et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Using zebrafish embryos, we show here that simultaneous loss of Yap1 and its paralog Wwtr1 (previously called Taz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hilman and Gat, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Piccolo et al., 2014</xref>), causes a severe defect in the elongation of the embryonic body during the mid-late somitogenesis stages. Surprisingly, we find that Yap1 and Wwtr1 are not ubiquitously expressed throughout the embryo but are specifically localized to the presumptive epidermis and notochord. Analysis of transcriptional changes in <italic>yap1<sup>-/-</sup>;wwtr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> double mutants reveals downregulation of a spectrum of genes expressed within the presumptive epidermis and notochord, but with little or no effect on the expression of <italic>arhgaps</italic>. Examination of the presumptive epidermis in <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants also revealed profound defects, leading to a new understanding of the basis of the initial steps in the formation of the median fin fold, the precursor to the dorsal and ventral unpaired fins. Importantly, we discovered that the <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants have aberrant Fibronectin (Fn) deposition, and show that interfering with Fn function results in embryos that appear similar to the <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants, with inhibition of posterior elongation and a failure of presumptive epidermal cells to move into the nascent fin fold. We propose that Yap1 and Wwtr1 regulate transcription programs specifically within presumptive epidermal and notochord cells, allowing them to adhere to the surrounding tissues and form the extracellular matrix that is necessary for both posterior body elongation and presumptive epidermal cell migration to produce the median fin fold.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants exhibit severe posterior body defects</title><p>We generated new mutant alleles of <italic>yap1</italic> and <italic>wwtr1</italic> using CRISPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lai et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>yap1<sup>bns19</sup></italic> contains a 41 bp deletion in exon 1, which encodes part of the TEAD binding domain, whereas <italic>wwtr1<sup>bns35</sup></italic> contains a 29 bp insertion in exon 2, which encodes part of the WW domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both frameshift mutations are predicted to lead to truncated proteins (p.Ile39Argfs*72 and p.Pro145Glnfs*15, respectively). <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double homozygous mutants (<italic>yap1<sup>-/-</sup>;wwtr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) exhibit a severe defect in forming the posterior body, first clearly visible at the 15–16 somite stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Although not studied, the same defect was observed previously in zebrafish double mutant embryos with different <italic>yap1</italic> and <italic>wwtr1</italic> mutations (Figure 1G in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miesfeld et al., 2015</xref>; Supplemental Figure 6I in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakajima et al., 2017</xref>), demonstrating that the defects we saw were not due to the particular alleles we had identified. Prior to the 15–16 somite stage we did not observe any differences among the embryos during gastrulation or early somitogenesis, indicating that the role of zygotic Yap1/Wwtr1 becomes essential as the tail begins to form. <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants formed normally proportioned somites, although the somites never obtained the chevron shape seen in wild-type or sibling embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

In medaka, only the temporal expression of <italic>yap1</italic> using PCR analysis was described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Porazinski et al., 2015</xref>). The expression of <italic>wwtr1</italic> mRNA in neither system has been reported during the somitogenesis stages. Since the protein distribution of these factors, whose levels and cellular localization are controlled post-translationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Piccolo et al., 2014</xref>), have not been analyzed during somitogenesis in any vertebrate embryo, we examined the expression of Yap1 and Wwtr1 in zebrafish at mid-somitogenesis, when the mutant phenotype first becomes clear, in the posterior of the embryo. Surprisingly, Yap1 was strongly expressed in the presumptive epidermis at the 18-somite stage, as well as along the axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In both cases, the staining was nuclear, which is indicative of active Yap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Piccolo et al., 2014</xref>). The presumptive epidermal expression of Yap1 was confirmed with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes for the previously characterized presumptive epidermal markers <italic>keratin4</italic> and <italic>keratin8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The expression of Yap1 protein in the notochord was ascertained using FISH with a probe for the notochord marker <italic>no tail</italic>, also called <italic>ta1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schulte-Merker et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, <italic>yap1</italic> mutants did not exhibit any Yap1 antibody staining, demonstrating that the antibody is specific to Yap1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly, Wwtr1 was also localized to the presumptive epidermis and notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), in keeping with the overlapping role of these two factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zanconato et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these findings we also examined the expression of Yap1 in medaka to determine if zebrafish and medaka were significantly different. As in zebrafish, medaka Yap1 is also predominantly expressed in the presumptive epidermis and notochord in the posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that Yap1 and Wwtr1 are not acting ubiquitously throughout the embryo but function in localized domains of the posterior body to control morphogenesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31065.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Yap1 is localized to the presumptive epidermis and axis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Yap1 protein is expressed in the presumptive epidermis (arrows) and midline (arrowhead) of an 18-somite stage embryo.

These lines are referred to here as <italic>HS:DN-yap</italic> and <italic>HS:CA-yap</italic>, respectively. Embryos were heat shocked at the 4-somite stage and then fixed at 18 somites. Inhibition of Yap1/Wwtr1 function with <italic>HS:DN-yap</italic> caused a downregulation of <italic>ecrg4b</italic> expression, although not as strongly as observed in the <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Intriguingly, enhancement of Yap1/Wwtr1 levels with <italic>HS:CA-yap</italic> caused an upregulation of <italic>ecrg4b</italic>, indicating that Yap1/Wwtr1 are not working to activate transcription to maximum levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). In contrast, while <italic>HS:DN-yap</italic> caused an inhibition of <italic>wu:fc23c09</italic> expression in the posterior notochord similar to that observed in the mutants, <italic>HS:CA-yap</italic> did not upregulate <italic>wu:fc23c09</italic>, indicating that Yap1/Wwtr1 already functions at maximal levels in this tissue, or at least for this target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,E</xref>). Interestingly, the increased expression of <italic>ecrg4b</italic> caused by CA-yap was restricted to the presumptive epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>), and the absence of <italic>wu:fc23c09</italic> expression caused by DN-yap was restricted to the posterior notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These observations indicate that Yap1/Wwtr1 must work with tissue-specific factors to control gene expression.</p><p>Since the analysis of a <italic>yap1</italic> mutant in medaka proposed that <italic>arhgaps</italic> were key targets of Yap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Porazinski et al., 2015</xref>), we examined <italic>arhgaps</italic> expression in our RNA-seq data. Of the many <italic>arhgaps</italic> found in zebrafish, only two weakly expressed <italic>arhgaps</italic> (based on the RNA-seq data), <italic>arhgap12a</italic> and <italic>arhgap27</italic>, were observed to change between siblings and mutants, with <italic>arhgap12a</italic> down 1.8-fold in the mutants and <italic>arhgap27</italic> down 1.9-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, we also found that many presumptive epidermal genes were decreased approximately 2-fold in the mutants, including all of the abundant <italic>keratins</italic>. For example, <italic>krt4</italic> was down 2.4-fold, <italic>krt8</italic> was down 2.7-fold, and <italic>krt18</italic> was down 1.8-fold. We also examined the expression of these two <italic>arhgap</italic> genes by in situ hybridization to determine where they were expressed and to look for possible changes in expression in the mutants. We found that both <italic>arhgaps</italic> are expressed in the presumptive epidermis, and found no obvious spatial difference in their expression between siblings and mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). One <italic>arhgap</italic> gene is expressed in the posterior notochord, <italic>arhgap17a</italic> (data from ZFIN.org), but this gene showed no change between siblings and mutants in our RNA-seq data. Our data suggest that <italic>arhgaps</italic> are not the key targets of Yap1/Wwtr1 in regulating posterior body morphogenesis in zebrafish (see Discussion), and instead identify a number of genes whose expression is highly regulated by these transcription factors in either the presumptive epidermis or notochord, which are the same tissues in which we found Yap1 and Wwtr1 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Notochord-less embryos show a weak posterior body defect</title><p>The localization of Yap1 and Wwtr1 to the presumptive epidermis and notochord, together with the changes in gene expression in these tissues, indicated that defects in one or both tissues were the source of the posterior morphogenetic defects.

From the 18-somite stage to the 24-somite stage (a period of 3 hr), the embryo undergoes a rapid change in the thickness of the presumptive epidermis along the dorsal and ventral midlines to form the nascent median fin fold (MFF) that ultimately gives rise to the dorsal and ventral unpaired fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), as was previously observed in histological sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dane and Tucker, 1985</xref>).

Embryos were injected with mRNA that encodes both a membrane GFP and a nuclear version of the photoconvertible protein Kikume (NLS-Kikume/EGFP-CAAX), which was photoconverted right before imaging in order to be able to follow membranes and nuclei in separate fluorescent channels, and then live imaged on a spinning disc confocal microscope between the 20- and 26-somite stages. Surprisingly, we found that in wild-type embryos the presumptive epidermal cells are highly active (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The cells were constantly changing shape as well as their interactions with neighbors, with new cells moving in at the basal side of the fin fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, arrowheads). By following the newly emerging cells backwards in time through different Z-planes, we could observe cells moving in from both lateral sides toward the midline. Once cells arrived at the midline they tended to stay there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, black lines). In <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants, the cells were still moving and changing shape (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>), although not as dramatically as in wild-type. New cells showed up at the midline over time, but other cells departed such that there was no net accumulation of new cells at the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), in contrast to what was observed in the siblings. Following the cells over time through different Z-planes, we could watch individual cells sliding across the midline and only occasionally staying in place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, red lines). We also observed that mutant cells moved faster than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), and remained in an elongated shape along the body axis (length) whereas wild-type cells extended along the apical-basal axis (height, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We conclude that formation of the MFF is normally a very active process with new presumptive epidermal cells constantly moving into the midline and staying there to build up the presumptive epidermal thickening, in contrast to the bending of a presumptive epidermal sheet envisioned from the static images. In <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants, the presumptive epidermal cells are highly motile, but are unable to coalesce at the midline, resulting in the failure to form the nascent MFF.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31065.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Dynamic movements of presumptive epidermal cells at the ventral fin fold.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon showing previous analysis of dorsal fin fold formation redrawn from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dane and Tucker, 1985</xref>.

A series of elegant studies has demonstrated that Integrin-Fibronectin interactions play an essential role in body elongation during the somitogenesis stages as well as forming the boundaries between somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jülich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koshida et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McMillen and Holley, 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, Fn is present ubiquitously but it assembles specifically at the border between somites, at the interface between the somites and presumptive epidermis, and at the border between the somites and notochord, due to the activation of Integrins within the somitic and presomitic mesoderm at these borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jülich et al., 2015</xref>). Within the rest of the mesoderm, Cadherins act to prevent integrin activation, leading to Fn assembly only at the borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jülich et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, the Fn underlying the presumptive epidermis and surrounding the notochord is proposed to provide the ECM necessary for body elongation by mechanically coupling the paraxial mesoderm to the presumptive epidermis and notochord (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McMillen and Holley, 2015</xref>).

We also found that <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants fail to form the nascent MFF, which was not mentioned for <italic>yap1/hirame</italic>, most likely because the flattening of the medaka embryo precluded conclusions about the state of the MFF. What we did not find similar was the flattening of the body in zebrafish <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E,F</xref>), which was the basis for the proposed key role of Yap in opposing the forces of gravity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Porazinski et al., 2015</xref>). Why these two species differ in this regard is not clear at this point but possibly due to the fact that medaka has a hard chorion whereas zebrafish has a very soft chorion, and thus medaka may have evolved to specifically resist the pressure of the embryo against the chorion.</p><p>We find that Yap1 and Wwtr1 are not present ubiquitously throughout the embryo but instead are both specifically localized to the presumptive epidermis and notochord. Intriguingly, we also find that medaka Yap1 is similarly localized, which was not previously known. The localization of the zebrafish proteins is in strong accord with our RNA-seq data, which shows major changes in gene expression in presumptive epidermal and notochordal genes. While these two tissues are very different in function and lineage, we see alterations in Fn assembly, which underlies the presumptive epidermis and overlies the notochord. Importantly, we do not see defects in Fn assembly between the somites, which supports the finding that Yap1 and Wwtr1 do not function within the mesoderm, and also shows that there is not a general defect in Fn assembly. Defects in Fn assembly were also seen in <italic>yap1/hirame</italic> mutant embryos between the lens and retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Porazinski et al., 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, altered Fn in <italic>yap1/hirame</italic> mutants was also reported throughout the neural tube whereas we do not find any Fn assembled in the neural tube in zebrafish, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dray et al., 2013</xref>), or in medaka, which is more in keeping with the normal assembly of extracellular matrix between tissues. The importance of Fn in zebrafish is shown with the use of a dominant-negative mutant, Fn∆C, that phenocopies both the extension defect and presumptive epidermal cell migration defects seen in <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants. These results, taken together with our evidence of decreased adhesion of the notochord and presumptive epidermis to the surrounding tissues, supports a model in which Yap1 and Wwtr1, functioning redundantly within the presumptive epidermis and notochord, work to promote posterior body elongation and presumptive epidermal morphogenesis necessary for MFF formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31065.027</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Role of Yap1/Wwtr1 in somite stage morphogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Yap1 and Wwtr1 are expressed specifically in the presumptive epidermis and notochord (light blue), where they promote cell adhesion and Fn assembly (orange).

(<bold>B</bold>) At the midline, cells are converging from either side and push against each other to form the dorsal (shown) and ventral MFFs.

Indeed, <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants remain in a curved conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Part of this defect can be attributed to defects in the notochord as we found that <italic>noto</italic> mutants also begin to show a phenotype at the 15–16 somite stage, but the defect is much less severe than that seen in <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants. These results point to the presumptive epidermis, the other major site of Yap1/Wwtr1 expression, as also being involved in formation of the posterior body. The key factor linking the presumptive epidermis and notochord to body extension is the ECM, and specifically Fibronectin (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McMillen and Holley, 2015</xref>). Fn couples the underlying mesoderm to the notochord and presumptive epidermis, which allows forces from convergence-extension within the paraxial mesoderm to allow the body to extend. The notochord also undergoes convergence-extension, and this helps the body extend as long as the notochord is coupled to the mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glickman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keller et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steventon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weliky et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilson and Keller, 1991</xref>). Finally, the spinal cord, which is connected to the presumptive epidermis, and the notochord undergo volumetric growth as the body extends, further assisting in the extension of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steventon et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>noto</italic> mutants, the notochord component is removed but the presumptive epidermis remains. When this process is disrupted such as in the case of our dominant-negative Fn injections, or when Integrin function is knocked down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dray et al., 2013</xref>), posterior extension is blocked. However, unlike in the Integrin knockdown experiments, <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants form normal somites because the intersomitic Fn deposition is unaffected. Intriguingly, the observation that the dose of dominant-negative Fn we used produced embryos with defective body extension but normal somites argues that body extension is more sensitive to disruption than the formation of somite boundaries. Possibly because the Fn underlying the presumptive epidermis and surrounding the notochord is under much more force from the convergence-extension movements of the presomitic mesoderm that extend the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steventon et al., 2016</xref>) than is the Fn that separates the somites, this pool of Fn may be much more sensitive to even minor perturbations.</p><p>We also found decreases in notochordal and presumptive epidermal cell adhesion in <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants. In living embryos we see a separation of the prospective epidermis from the underlying somitic tissue, which becomes progressively more pronounced as the overall phenotype of the embryos increases. In addition, the undulating notochord we observed in the mutants is indicative of decreased mechanical coupling between the notochord and paraxial mesoderm as is also seen in Integrin knockdown embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dray et al., 2013</xref>). Since we see no changes in <italic>fibronectin</italic> expression levels and little or no changes in <italic>integrin</italic> levels in our RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), our results suggest that there are defects within the presumptive epidermis and notochord that results in a failure to assemble Fn. While recent results have shown how Cadherins suppress Fibronectin assembly between adjacent cells within the paraxial mesoderm by keeping Integrins in an inactive conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jülich et al., 2015</xref>), the factors that regulate the activation of Integrin within the early embryo are not known. Our RNA-seq data of genes down-regulated in <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants provides a valuable dataset of genes worth further investigation, most of which have not been analyzed even at the level of in situ hybridization let alone functionally studied.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Presumptive epidermis morphogenesis in <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants</title><p>Our analysis of the presumptive epidermis in <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants has provided new insight into the mechanisms that form the nascent MFF from presumptive epidermal cells. We find that the presumptive epidermal cells are highly active and constantly changing shape when imaged in live embryos. They actively move toward the dorsal and ventral midlines as individual cells and then change their overall shape, with an increase along the apical-basal axis. At later stages, as laminin is used to stabilize the nascent MFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Webb et al., 2007</xref>) by forming connections between apposing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dane and Tucker, 1985</xref>), we expect that cell motility is reduced allowing the unpaired fins to extend away from the body. In <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants, the presumptive epidermal cells are still highly motile but they transit through the midline rather than staying there, and they remain in an elongated shape along the body axis with no increase in the apical-basal direction, all resulting in a failure to form the MFF. Intriguingly, we can largely recapitulate this effect by inhibiting Fn assembly using dominant-negative Fn injections. In these embryos, the body fails to elongate, the presumptive fin fold does not form, and the cells transit through the midline and remain in an elongated shape. Interestingly, inhibition of cell movement with the myosin inhibitor Blebbistatin did not result in defects in Fn assembly under the epidermis (or around the notochord), demonstrating that the Yap1/Wwtr1-dependent defects in Fn assembly cause migration defects, rather than defective migration of cells leading indirectly to altered Fn assembly (data not shown). These results suggest that in addition to its role in posterior elongation, the Fn matrix provides a substrate for the presumptive epidermal cells to adhere to, which allows them to converge from the right and left sides of the embryo and push against each other to initiate MFF formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). We call this process concerted migration, since the fin fold forms from the action of the presumptive epidermal cells migrating dorsally or ventrally and pushing against each other, creating the force to form the fin fold, and increasing the cells’ height. These processes then allow the basal surfaces of juxtaposed MFF cells to adhere to each other, with the resulting formation of cross-linking fibers to stabilize the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dane and Tucker, 1985</xref>). Thus, Fn does double duty in extending the body and creating the fins that the elongated body uses to swim.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The Yap1/Wwtr1 transcriptional program</title><p>Transcriptional analysis of the genes regulated in the tailbud by Yap1/Wwtr1 identified many genes with large changes in expression, including 8 of our top 12 hits which had not previously been analyzed by in situ hybridization in the early embryo. Importantly, all these genes were expressed in the presumptive epidermis or notochord, exactly the tissues in which we found Yap1 and Wwtr1 expressed. While many of the genes further down the list have not been characterized, those that have are also expressed in the notochord or presumptive epidermis. An outlier at position 36 on our list with a 4.4-fold change is myosin light chain (<italic>mylpfa</italic>). However, in the tailbud <italic>mylpfa</italic> is expressed specifically in the adaxial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">von Hofsten et al., 2008</xref>), the small population of future slow muscle cells that originate directly next to the notochord. Since adaxial cell formation depends on interactions with the notochord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackson and Ingham, 2013</xref>), the decreased <italic>mylpfa</italic> expression may be a secondary effect of alterations to the notochord.</p><p>Our results suggest that the <italic>arhgaps</italic> are unlikely to be the key genes regulated by Yap1/Wwtr1 in zebrafish. Two weakly expressed presumptive epidermal <italic>arhgaps</italic>, <italic>arhgap27</italic> and <italic>arhgap12a</italic>, are found far down on our list of dysregulated genes ordered by fold-change (positions 254 and 300, respectively), among a long list of genes that change approximately 2-fold. Moreover, the only notochord expressed <italic>arhgap</italic>, <italic>arhgap17a</italic>, is not changed in its expression levels in <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutant tails. In human 3D spheroids formed using a human retina pigmented epithelial cell line, <italic>ARHGAP18</italic> was identified as one of 40 genes down-regulated when YAP levels were reduced, and reduction of <italic>ARHGAP18</italic> by siRNA caused a similar phenotype to siRNA reduction of YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Porazinski et al., 2015</xref>). In medaka <italic>yap1</italic> mutants, however, <italic>arhgap18</italic> was reduced just 24% from control levels, and inactivation of <italic>arhgap18</italic> did not produce a recognizable phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Porazinski et al., 2015</xref>). In zebrafish, <italic>arhgap18</italic> is not expressed in the tailbud, nor is its closest relative, <italic>arhgap28</italic> (37% amino acid identity). Similarly, <italic>ARHGAP29</italic> was found to be down-regulated 50% in a human gastric cancer cell line after YAP1 knock out, but the levels of <italic>arhgap29</italic> were unchanged in the tailbud of zebrafish <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants. These results show that the Yap1 transcriptional program is context dependent and the results found in cell culture can not be inferred to be true in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qiao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our data also show that Yap1/Wwtr1 is mostly regulating a completely different suite of genes in the presumptive epidermis than in the notochord. Of the known genes expressed in both tissues, the highest scoring gene is <italic>laminin α5</italic> (position 86), which is decreased 3-fold in <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants. However, we previously identified a mutant in this gene and saw no effect on posterior body formation, and no effect on fin-fold formation prior to 30 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Webb et al., 2007</xref>). Our results suggest therefore that Yap1 and Wwtr1 are responsible for broad transcriptional regulatory networks within both the presumptive epidermis and notochord that allow these cells to adhere to the surrounding tissue and assemble the extracellular matrix.</p><p>Our results also reveal that Yap1/Wwtr1 do not activate a generic transcriptional program in the early embryo, and instead work in concert with tissue specific factors. This was clearly shown in the case of <italic>ecrg4b</italic> which is expressed in the epidermis but not in the notochord, whereas Yap1 and Wwtr1 are active in both tissues. Moreover, when a constitutively active Yap was ubiquitously expressed, <italic>ecrg4b</italic> expression increased only in the epidermis but was not activated in other tissues. Finally, well known Hippo pathway transcriptional targets such as <italic>cyclin D1</italic> and <italic>aurora kinase A</italic> were not down-regulated in the <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants according to our RNA-seq data, also supporting the idea that there is not a generic pathway activated by these factors. Instead, our data argue that Yap1 and Wwtr1 enhance the expression of particular genes in concert with tissue-specific transcription factors, but they themselves do not provide tissue specificity.</p><p>Intriguingly, a newly published paper has shown that YAP1, which is expressed in the murine presomitic mesoderm (PSM), has an essential role in repressing oscillations of the somite clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hubaud et al., 2017</xref>). Since this repression is a key part of the regulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hubaud et al., 2017</xref>), and since Yap1 (or Wwtr1) is not expressed in the fish PSM in either zebrafish or medaka, it raises the question of what factor might be playing a role in fish similar to that identified for YAP1 in mouse. As the key targets of YAP1 in the murine PSM are identified, it will be important to compare their regulation in fish.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>yap1; wwtr1</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>ZFIN_ID:ZDB-GENE-030131–9710; ZFIN_ID:ZDB-GENE-051101–1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background ()</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>yap1</italic>[bns19];<italic>wwtr1</italic>[bns35]</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td valign="bottom">CRISPR-mediated mutation. 41 bp deletion in exon 1. p.Ile39Argfs*72; CRISPR-mediated mutation. 29 bp insertion in exon 2. p.Pro145Glnfs*15</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td> <italic>Tg(hsp70:RFP-DNyap) zf621</italic></td><td>Source: Poss lab; Reference PMID:26209644</td><td/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>Tg(hsp70:RFP-CAyap) zf622</italic></td><td>Source: Poss lab; Reference PMID: 26209644</td><td/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>noto n1</italic></td><td>Source ZIRC; Reference PMID: 7477317</td><td/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td/><td>Whole tail from the tailbud to the third newest somite (S-III).16–18 somite-stage embryos.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior/Reviewing Editor.</p><p>While all of the reviewers are enthusiastic about the study, they also agree that major revisions are necessary to bring this to publishable form. In particular, additional data are needed to support the conclusion that the defects are due to fibronectin misregulation. Genetic mosaic experiments are needed to determine whether the fin defect is due to a migration defect. Also, more detailed presentation of the expression profiling data is in order. Included below are the detailed comments of all three reviewers for your reference.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors present the analysis of double mutant zebrafish embryos for <italic>yap</italic> and <italic>wwrt1</italic>. This represents one of the first substantial analyses of the role of Yap in the embryonic development of zebrafish and represents an important contribution to the field.</p><p>Despite opting for a genome wide analysis of the genes that are mis-regulated upon mutation in <italic>yap<sup>-/-</sup>;wwtr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutants, only a very limited analysis of this dataset is performed in the manuscript. At the very least it would be of interest to look into the top genes that are upregulated as well as downregulated. Although, it is not clear from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> whether the 'fold change' that is referred to is positive or negative. In addition, there are a number of other common targets for <italic>yap</italic> that have been found in other contexts (such as CTGF), it would be useful to see whether these are also modulated in the context of the zebrafish. I think that these analyses are necessary to support the conclusions made about notochord and ectodermal markers being the predominant sets of genes that we mis-regulated in the mutants.</p><p>In order to conclude about the role of the notochord phenotype in generating defects in posterior body development, it is necessary to include a more detailed comparison to the <italic>yap-/-;wwtr1-/-</italic> mutants. While the text states that the defects paralleled those of the <italic>yap-/-;wwtr1-/-</italic> mutant, it is not clear what aspects of the phenotype are the same or different. For example, the timing of somitogenesis and overall somite number, as well at the timing of axial truncation could easily be determined for both mutants and displayed alongside one another. As it stands, I am not sure that anything substantial is gained in this comparison. Furthermore, the fact that defects in <italic>yap<sup>-/-</sup>;wwtr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutants precede those in embryos where the notochord is absent suggest that there is an additional function of <italic>yap/wwtr1</italic> at earlier stages that precede both its role in the notochord and in fin formation. The authors could make use of their heat-shock inducible lines in order to temporally separate these events.</p><p>Similarly, a more detailed spatiotemporal analysis of the onset of disruptions in the Fn deficient embryos in comparison to the <italic>yap<sup>-/-</sup>;wwtr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutants is required in order to conclude that this is a phenocopy.</p><p>The authors claim on the basis of their live imaging experiments that the cells forming the ventral fin fold are 'highly migratory' and that these behaviours are moderately reduced in the mutants. It is not clear from the one control movie shown in the paper whether the cells are migratory, as it seems that only very little cell rearrangement is occurring. While the cells are undergoing some cell shape changes, this is not quantified or correlated with the formation of the fin fold in time and space. In order to attribute specific cell behaviours to fin fold formation, it is necessary to quantify these behaviours and compare them to ectodermal cells in regions that do not form a fin, or at stages preceding fin formation. These same parameters can be then compared to the mutant situation. At the very least the authors should check cell velocity, directionality and alterations in cell shape in order to support their conclusions. Also, the number of videos that have been analysed in each condition should be detailed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The study by Kimelman et al., addresses the timely question whether and how Yap signaling is involved in vertebrate body elongation. In recent years, Yap has been implicated in mechanotransduction. While a number of recent studies have examined the role of mechanics in body elongation, none have address the obvious question of how Yap signaling may operate during elongation. The results are surprising in that Yap signaling is required for normal zebrafish body elongation but that Yap's function is restricted to the notochord and epidermis. Moreover, Yap does not appear to function by regulated <italic>arhgaps</italic>, as suggested by studies in organoids, but rather perturbs the Fibronectin matrix. The current study is thorough, and includes the generation of zebrafish knockouts for Yap, its paralog <italic>wwtr1</italic>, and characterization of double mutants. Transcriptional profiling of dissected tailbuds is used to characterize changes in gene regulation. Heat shock dominant negative and constitutively active Yap transgenes provide corroborating evidence. Overall, the study is very interesting, the manuscript is clearly written and, in general, the conclusions are supported by the data presented. However, there are a few conclusions that need to be better substantiated, as detailed below.</p><p>Expression of the dn-Fn construct approximates the <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutant phenotype, but the authors should perform timelapse analysis of the dn-Fn fin fold morphogenesis to confirm that the phenotype is consistent at the level of cell behavior. The phenotypes could otherwise arise from slightly different mechanisms.</p><p>The proposition that adhesion of the ectoderm is reduced in the <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutant needs to be strengthened. The authors are correct that fixation/over-fixation may obscure this phenotype. It could be revealing to image live <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants expressing a membrane GFP/ and nuclear RFP. In transverse sections, one would predict that there would be evident separation of the ectoderm from the dorsal somite.</p><p>The major question that comes to mind, particularly with respect to the ectoderm phenotype, is whether the phenotype is due to failure to create a normal Fibronectin matrix, which is then affecting cell migration, or whether the cells migrate abnormally and this affects the morphology of the Fibronectin matrix? Genetic mosaics could potentially address this question.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors confirm previous findings from Medaka indicating that Yap and Wwtr1 are essential for posterior axis elongation. Whereas, previously it has been suggested that axis elongation in Yap/Wwtr1 loss of function is caused by an inability to combat gravity these authors suggest a role for Yap and Wwtr1 in ectodermal and notochord morphogenesis. They show that Yap and Wwrt1 are expressed specifically in tailbud ectoderm and notochord. Moreover, through RNAseq analysis they find that YAP and Wwrt1 control the expression of exrg4b and wu:fc23c09 in the tailbud. In contrast, Yap and Wwrt1 do not control <italic>arhgap12a/27</italic> expression as previously reported. The authors then investigate ectodermal morphogenesis in mutants and observe a loss of ectodermal thickening associated with dorsal fin formation. Through live imaging the authors note that, in WT embryos, ectodermal cells appear to migrate toward the midline. In contrast, mutant ectodermal cells do not accumulate in the midline despite behaving dynamically. As Fibronectin is an important factor in axis elongation and tissue adhesion the authors analyze FN deposition and find that FN is not maintained in newly forming somites where <italic>yap</italic> and <italic>wwrt1</italic> is expressed. Finally, they indicate that epithelial integrity is, therefore, lost in mutants.</p><p>This article is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> with major revisions.</p><p>Fin fold formation is thought to occur either through shape changes in static cells or movement of the whole epidermal sheet toward the midline. The authors attempt to clarify this controversy through live imaging. The authors find cells that enter the midline over time and determine that this occurs through cell migration. However, these data do not exclude that convergent extension like movements could be sufficient to move cells toward the midline. Here, the appearance of cells in the midline could be mistaken for cell migration when their appearance is actually the consequence of a cell rearrangement driven, perhaps, through t1 transitions. Their conclusions are therefore overstated and should be experimentally addressed for publication.</p><p>Although their data are highly correlative with a role for FN downstream of Yap and <italic>wwrt1</italic>, these data do not confirm this interaction. An epistasis experiment is required to determine whether FN is downstream of Yap and Wwrt1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31065.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p></disp-quote><p><italic>[…] Despite opting for a genome wide analysis of the genes that are mis-regulated upon mutation in yap<sup>-/-</sup>;wwtr1<sup>-/-</sup>mutants, only a very limited analysis of this dataset is performed in the manuscript.

All are in the presumptive epidermis (a term we are now using in place of ectoderm) or notochord, as in our previous conclusion.</p><p>2) As the reviewer suggested, we collated known target Yap1/Wwtr1 genes from two large scale analyses in other systems and present this information in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. All except one of these known Yap targets are expressed in the presumptive epidermis or notochord. The one exception is one weakly expressed gene in the ventral mesoderm, which although we did not obviously detect Yap1/Wwtr1 in the ventral mesoderm, suggests that it regulates a very limited subset of genes in this tissue.</p><p>3) We have now added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) that provides Gene Ontology analysis of all of the genes that we see significantly changed in the <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> mutants (as provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Interestingly, Biological Process analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) identifies genes in the epidermis or fin (the fin is primarily an epidermal structure), again supporting our idea that the prospective epidermis is a key target tissue.</p><p>4) Because the changes in known Yap1/Wwtr1 genes (in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) are more modest than our top hits, we validated the changes in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> genes by qPCR and provide that data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>5) We now make clear that the changes we see are all decreases in expression.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer pushing us to extend the data analysis.</p><p><italic>In order to conclude about the role of the notochord phenotype in generating defects in posterior body development, it is necessary to include a more detailed comparison to the yap<sup>-/-</sup>;wwtr1<sup>-/-</sup>mutants.

We also don’t raise it in the text, but we have done careful examination of somite number between controls and mutants and see no differences. Since this is essentially a negative result we have not included it as we feel it would distract from the paper. Finally, as a note of clarity, we do see defects in the <italic>noto</italic> mutants at the same time (~16 somites) as when we see defects in the <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants so we don’t think that <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> has an earlier role than seen in <italic>noto</italic> mutants, just a much more severe role.</p><p><italic>Similarly, a more detailed spatiotemporal analysis of the onset of disruptions in the Fn deficient embryos in comparison to the yap<sup>-/-</sup>;wwtr1<sup>-/-</sup>mutants is required in order to conclude that this is a phenocopy.</italic> </p><p>It was a mistake on our part to use the word phenocopy. What we intended to say was that the Fn deficient embryos that make it through gastrulation appear remarkably similar to the <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants. Because mRNA injection is quite variable, a number of the embryos exhibit gastrulation defects because of a role for Fn in gastrulation but survivors have a clear morphogenetic defect. We now show pictures of the whole embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), not just the posterior as in the initial version of the manuscript, to make the comparison to the <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim on the basis of their live imaging experiments that the cells forming the ventral fin fold are 'highly migratory' and that these behaviours are moderately reduced in the mutants.

In the revised version we now provide measurements of speed, as well as the time spent at the midline, and changes in cell shape. What is very interesting and that has emerged from this data is that not only are the wild-type presumptive epidermal cells migrating, but that the mutant cells are actually moving faster. In addition, whereas the wild-type cells move into the midline and stay there, the mutant cells move to the midline and then cross to the other side, which is why the fin fold fails to form. Finally, whereas the wild- type cells become square shaped over time, the mutant cells retain the elongated (migratory) morphology. All of this data is now presented in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. We did, as the reviewer suggests, examine the lateral surfaces of the embryo and do see the presumptive epidermal cells moving there as well. Thus, there is an overall movement of presumptive epidermal cells both dorsally and ventrally, causing the accumulation at the dorsal and ventral surfaces with the resulting extension of the fin folds. We now call this concerted migration since the wild-type cells are moving from both sides to the midline and pushing against each other to cause the fin to extend dorsally or ventrally, with a concomitant shape change in the epidermal cells. In contrast, in the mutants, with defective Fn, the cells are just moving around but cannot create the forces to form the fin fold, and so they transit across the midline and do not undergo cell shape changes. We have incorporated all this information into the revised manuscript. The major point we want to make is that the formation of the fin fold is not just a static bending process as had previously been assumed, but involves actively migrating cells.</p><p>The number of videos examined is now provided in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Expression of the dn-Fn construct approximates the yap1;wwtr1 double mutant phenotype, but the authors should perform timelapse analysis of the dn-Fn fin fold morphogenesis to confirm that the phenotype is consistent at the level of cell behavior. The phenotypes could otherwise arise from slightly different mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a very good point about the dn-Fn. Accordingly, we have now filmed dn-Fn embryos to compare the cell behavior. Because the dn-Fn is injected as mRNA, the results are more variable because the mRNA is not distributed equally among all cells in zebrafish embryos. Nonetheless, we see similar trends as in the mutants, with cells transiting through the midline, some cells moving faster than wild-type ones (and none moving slower), and cells having a longer height-length ratio, as with the mutants. We present the new speed and cell dimension data in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, which we feel helps strengthen the similarity between the mutant and Fn∆C injected cells. We appreciate the recommendation to examine this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The proposition that adhesion of the ectoderm is reduced in the yap1;wwtr1 double mutant needs to be strengthened. The authors are correct that fixation/over-fixation may obscure this phenotype. It could be revealing to image live yap1;wwtr1 double mutants expressing a membrane GFP/ and nuclear RFP. In transverse sections, one would predict that there would be evident separation of the ectoderm from the dorsal somite.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the reviewer’s suggestion and live imaged embryonic development in wild-type and mutants using a membrane tagged GFP (we also had a nuclear RFP as suggested but the data is easier to see with just the GFP). Just as the reviewer predicted, we see a very clear separation of the presumptive epidermis from the somites as the severity of the overall mutant phenotype increases. We think this is a much better result than the data we had in the initial manuscript with lightly fixed embryos, so we have replaced the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> with this new result (which is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> since we added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion that we pursue this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major question that comes to mind, particularly with respect to the ectoderm phenotype, is whether the phenotype is due to failure to create a normal Fibronectin matrix, which is then affecting cell migration, or whether the cells migrate abnormally and this affects the morphology of the Fibronectin matrix? Genetic mosaics could potentially address this question.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting question as to whether cell migration is affecting the Fn assembly. Because Fn is secreted by all cells, and because the cells are moving (including presumptive epidermis and somites) it would be very difficult to get a convincing result using genetic mosaics. However, we found that treating embryos with 40 μm Blebbistatin at the 12-somite stage prevents movement of the cells and consequently prevents formation of the fin fold, recapitulating the <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutant phenotype. We then examined Fn assembly in the Blebbistatin treated embryos. Interestingly, while the Fn staining in the boundaries was completely absent, the staining under the epidermis (and around the notochord) was completely intact. Thus, it is the absence of Yap1 and Wwtr1 that is affecting the Fn assembly and not the aberrant migration of the cells. This is an interesting result and we have added it to the Discussion subsection “Presumptive epidermis morphogenesis in <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] This article is appropriate for publication in eLife with major revisions.</p><p>Fin fold formation is thought to occur either through shape changes in static cells or movement of the whole epidermal sheet toward the midline. The authors attempt to clarify this controversy through live imaging. The authors find cells that enter the midline over time and determine that this occurs through cell migration. However, these data do not exclude that convergent extension like movements could be sufficient to move cells toward the midline. Here, the appearance of cells in the midline could be mistaken for cell migration when their appearance is actually the consequence of a cell rearrangement driven, perhaps, through t1 transitions. Their conclusions are therefore overstated and should be experimentally addressed for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern. We have accordingly done a lot more filming to look at this issue. Filming is quite tricky in this system compared to the beautiful studies done in <italic>Drosophila</italic> since the whole embryo is changing shape during this period as it is extending along the A-P axis. Despite this, we have looked very carefully and not seen anything that looks like the t1 transitions as seen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (there are a lot of cell movements and shape changes, but they do not follow any typical order). We also do not believe that this is convergence-extension behavior since we see no evidence of mediolateral intercalations. Instead, we see a gradual movement of new cells into the fin fold, and we now provide measurement of the speed of their movement (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We also now show (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) that whereas the wild-type cells move into the fin fold and stay there, mutant cells transit through the fin fold. If this was a convergence extension defect we would not expect this behavior and instead expect that while the fin fold would not form, cells at the midline would stay in place.</p><p>We also showed our data to an expert in epidermal morphogenesis (Celeste Berg), who said it was unlike what is seen in other systems, including <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Our new interpretation is that the cells have an inherent migratory capacity as seen when Fn is disrupted (either in the <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants or with the dom-neg Fn); but when Fn is assembled normally, the cells moving to the midline from the left and right sides push against each other, thus limiting their movement, causing them to change shape to a much more square morphology, and thus to extend the fin fold. We have included this new data in the revised manuscript and appreciate the reviewer encouraging us to provide a better description of cell movements.</p><p>Finally, one of our main purposes in describing in some detail the epidermal morphogenesis of the fin fold was to get researchers to understand that the fin fold does not just form from the bending of an epidermal sheet as has long been thought, but to realize it is a much more dynamic process, with very interesting properties. Our hope is that our description will catalyze more studies in this area that will further refine the exact movements involved in this process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although their data are highly correlative with a role for FN downstream of Yap and wwrt1, these data do not confirm this interaction. An epistasis experiment is required to determine whether FN is downstream of Yap and Wwrt1.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point. Since Yap1 and Wwtr1 are mechanosensors, not only could a lack of Yap1/Wwtr1 cause changes in Fn as we showed (i.e. Fn is epistatic to Yap1/Wwtr1) but changes in Fn could alter Yap1/Wwtr1 (i.e. Yap1/Wwtr1 is epistatic to Fn). To test this, we examined Yap1 using our Yap1 antibodies in embryos expressing the dominant-negative Fn compared to uninjected embryos. We found that the expression of Yap1 was unaffected by disruptions in Fn, and thus we can say that Yap1 is not epistatic to Fn. We appreciate the reviewer raising this point and have added this to the last paragraph of the subsection “Yap1/Wwtr1-dependent Fibronectin assembly is required for body extension and morphogenesis of the presumptive epidermis”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
