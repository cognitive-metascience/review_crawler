Intriguingly, the ApoE receptor LRP4 and APP are also required for normal formation and function of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). In this study, we show that APP interacts with LRP4, an obligate co-receptor for muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK). Agrin, a ligand for LRP4, also binds to APP and co-operatively enhances the interaction of APP with LRP4. In cultured myotubes, APP synergistically increases agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering. Deletion of the transmembrane domain of LRP4 (LRP4 ECD) results in growth retardation of the NMJ, and these defects are markedly enhanced in APP<sup>−/−</sup>;LRP4<sup>ECD/ECD</sup> mice. Double mutant NMJs are significantly reduced in size and number, resulting in perinatal lethality. Our findings reveal novel roles for APP in regulating neuromuscular synapse formation through hetero-oligomeric interaction with LRP4 and agrin and thereby provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern NMJ formation and maintenance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00220.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00220.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00220.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease is the formation of plaques in the brain by a protein called β-amyloid. This protein is generated by the cleavage of a precursor protein, and mutations in the gene that encodes amyloid precursor protein greatly increase the risk of developing a familial, early-onset form of Alzheimer’s disease in middle age. Individuals with a particular variant of a lipoprotein called ApoE (ApoE4) are also more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease at a younger age than the rest of the population. Due to its prevalence—approximately 20% of the world’s population are carriers of at least one allele—ApoE4 is the single-most important risk factor for the late-onset form of Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>Amyloid precursor protein and the receptors for ApoE—in particular one called LRP4—are also essential for the development of the specialized synapse that forms between motor neurons and muscles. However, the mechanisms by which they, individually or together, contribute to the formation of these neuromuscular junctions are incompletely understood.</p><p>Now, Choi et al. have shown that amyloid precursor protein and LRP4 interact at the developing neuromuscular junction. A protein called agrin, which is produced by motor neurons and which must bind to LRP4 to induce neuromuscular junction formation, also binds directly to amyloid precursor protein. This latter interaction leads to the formation of a complex between LRP4 and amyloid precursor protein that robustly promotes the formation of the neuromuscular junction. Mutations that remove the part of LRP4 that anchors it to the cell membrane weaken this complex and thus reduce the development of neuromuscular junctions in mice, especially if the animals also lack amyloid precursor protein.</p><p>These three proteins thus seem to influence the development and maintenance of neuromuscular junctions by regulating the activity of a fourth protein, called MuSK, which is present on the surface of muscle cells. Activation of MuSK by agrin bound to LRP4 promotes the clustering of acetylcholine receptors in the membrane, which is a crucial step in the formation of the neuromuscular junction. Intriguingly, Choi et al. have now shown that amyloid precursor protein can, by interacting directly with LRP4, also activate MuSK even in the absence of agrin, albeit only to a small extent.</p><p>The work of Choi et al. suggests that the complex formed between agrin, amyloid precursor protein and LRP4 helps to focus the activation of MuSK, and thus the clustering of acetylcholine receptors, to the site of the developing neuromuscular junction. Since all four proteins are also found in the central nervous system, similar processes might well be at work during the development and maintenance of synapses in the brain. Further studies of these interactions, both at the neuromuscular junction and in the brain, should shed new light on both normal synapse formation and the synaptic dysfunction that is seen in Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00220.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00220.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neuromuscular synapse</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>nervous system development</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>LRP</kwd><kwd>ApoE</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL20948, HL63762, NS055028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Weichun</given-names></name><name><surname>Herz</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Health Assistance Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herz</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lupe Murchison Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herz</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Consortium for Frontotemporal Dementia Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herz</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herz</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herz</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Brightfocus Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herz</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alzheimer’s Disease Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cain Foundation in Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Weichun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteins implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, including amyloid precursor protein and ApoE receptors, interact with each other and with a signalling molecule called agrin to influence the development of the neuromuscular junction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 genotype is the strongest and most prevalent risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corder et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmechel et al., 1993</xref>).

APP and its pathogenic cleavage product, β-amyloid, physically and functionally interact with ApoE receptors on multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kounnas et al., 1995</xref>), by regulating the trafficking and processing of APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ulery et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pietrzik et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pietrzik and Jaeger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marzolo and Bu, 2009</xref>), mediating amyloid clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deane et al., 2008</xref>) and by preventing amyloid-induced synaptic suppression at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durakoglugil et al., 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, APP is also expressed at the neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akaaboune et al., 2000</xref>) and APP family members are required for normal formation and function of the neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Torroja et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2009</xref>), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. APP family members have also been shown to contribute to synaptic function in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weyer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although APP occupies such a central role in the pathogenesis of AD, its physiological functions and how they relate to the disease process on the molecular level remains poorly understood. ApoE ε4 genotype strongly predisposes to an earlier age of AD onset, increasing the relative risk in individuals &gt;65 years of age by approximately 10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corder et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmechel et al., 1993</xref>). APP and ApoE interact with LRPs, thus suggesting a role of ApoE receptors in AD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herz and Beffert, 2000</xref>). Besides serving as cargo receptors that can mediate the endocytosis of ApoE containing lipoprotein particles, ApoE receptors have also been shown to function as signal transducers that regulate essential signaling pathways during development and in the adult organism, where they control glutamate receptor function, synaptic plasticity, memory and learning (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herz and Chen, 2006</xref>). Examples include brain development (LRP8, VLDLR), vascular development and maintenance (LRP1), kidney and neuromuscular junction formation (LRP4), and others (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dieckmann et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The NMJ is a specialized peripheral cholinergic synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall and Sanes, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanes and Lichtman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Impaired cholinergic neurotransmission has been implicated in AD and this forms the conceptual basis for the therapeutic use of cholinesterase inhibitors. Both APP and LRP4 are required for normal NMJ formation, and the LRP4 ligand agrin is abundantly expressed in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Connor et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stone and Nikolics, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, MuSK localizes to excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ksiazek et al., 2007</xref>) and has been shown to mediate cholinergic responses, synaptic plasticity and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garcia-Osta et al., 2006</xref>), while agrin was found to regulate synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCroskery et al., 2009</xref>) and prevent synapse loss in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ksiazek et al., 2007</xref>). These intriguing similarities between MuSK, agrin and ApoE receptors in synaptic maintenance and function prompted us to explore the NMJ as a model system on which potentially novel functional interactions between APP and ApoE receptors could be investigated. We found that LRP4 and APP physically bind to each other and that APP can also bind agrin. Ligation of LRP4 by immobilized APP can activate MuSK in the absence of neural agrin. Simultaneous and stoichiometric interaction of the three proteins favors the formation of a hetero-oligomeric complex, which may serve to focus the formation of the NMJ at the surface of the myotube.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NMJ formation in mice lacking membrane-anchored LRP4</title><p>A common mechanism by which ApoE receptors directly transduce or indirectly modulate extracellular signals involves the interaction of adaptor proteins with their intracellular domain (ICD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trommsdorff et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gotthardt et al., 2000</xref>). We therefore generated three mutant <italic>Lrp4</italic> alleles in mice to test which domains of LRP4 are required for NMJ development. Consistent with the previous report that mice with point mutations in <italic>Lrp4</italic> die at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weatherbee et al., 2006</xref>), mice carrying a novel <italic>Lrp4</italic> null allele, which we generated by deleting exon 1 of murine <italic>Lrp4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), also die perinatally from a complete failure to form NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By contrast, mice carrying an <italic>Lrp4</italic> allele encoding a truncated receptor consisting of only the extracellular domain (ECD), but lacking the transmembrane segment and intracellular domain (ICD), are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>), indicating that at least partially functional NMJs must form and that thus neither membrane anchoring of the LRP4 ECD nor its ICD is absolutely required for the formation of the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dietrich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gomez and Burden, 2011</xref>). To further test this hypothesis, we first set out to determine to what extent membrane anchoring of the LRP4 receptor is required for NMJ formation. We examined NMJs of <italic>Lrp4</italic><sup>ECD/ECD</sup> mice, in which we introduced a stop codon immediately before the transmembrane segment. This results in the expression of LRP4 with the extracellular domain, but without the transmembrane domain or the intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00220.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Targeting vectors.</title><p>Diagrammatic representation of gene replacement strategies used to generate <italic>Lrp4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (null allele, <bold>A</bold>), <italic>Lrp4</italic><sup>ECD/ECD</sup> (hypomorphic allele without membrane anchor, <bold>B</bold>), and <italic>Lrp4</italic><sup>ΔICD/ΔICD</sup> (<bold>C</bold>) mice.

To test for this possibility, we exposed isolated myotubes to recombinant dimeric APP-Fc or RAP-Fc, an ER chaperone that binds the extracellular domains of ApoE receptors, that is LDL receptor family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fisher et al., 2006</xref>) including LRP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohazama et al., 2008</xref>), with high affinity and thereby prevents the binding of most cognate ligands to this class of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herz et al., 1991</xref>). To facilitate MuSK ligation, the Fc fusion proteins were immobilized on protein A beads and beads were incubated with isolated myotubes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> shows that APP-Fc beads, but not RAP-Fc beads, significantly increased AChR clustering in the absence of exogenous neuronal agrin. When the same experiment was performed in the presence of a low concentration of agrin (0.1 ng/ml), again only APP-Fc, but not RAP-Fc, significantly increased AChR clustering. These results indicate that APP and agrin function synergistically through LRP4 to stimulate AChR clustering and NMJ formation. Interestingly, soluble APP-Fc not bound to beads was also able to promote AChR clustering, suggesting that focal clustering of APP on opposing beads is not required, but that the interaction of APP, either in a dimeric (APP-Fc) or monomeric (APP-FLAG) form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), with the myotube surface is sufficient to induce initial clustering. The soluble LRP4-ligand binding domain (MBP-LRP4) was also capable of inducing clustering, alone or together with the APP-ectodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Moreover, the failure of RAP-Fc to induce AChR clustering suggests that LRP4 dimerization alone is not sufficient, but that possibly the formation of an extracellular scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bromann et al., 2004</xref>) through interactions with other surface proteins, which can be mediated by APP and LRP4 ECD, is required.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00220.010</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>APP activates MuSK and promotes AChR clustering.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) C2C12 myotubes were incubated with the indicated beads preloaded with APP-Fc or RAP-Fc, respectively, in the absence or presence of 0.1 ng/ml agrin for 24 hr prior to labeling AChRs.

To test this hypothesis, we determined whether APP, LRP4 and MuSK form a stable complex in muscle in vivo. Wild-type embryonic muscle proteins were precipitated with antibodies against LRP4, as well as Apoer2 and LRP1, two other LDL receptor family members that are expressed in muscle and are known to interact with APP.

To this end, LRP4-Fc, APP-Fc and RAP-Fc fusion proteins were prepared and incubated with a fixed concentration of agrin (100 ng/ml). LRP4-Fc efficiently bound agrin at much lower concentrations than was required to achieve comparable binding to APP-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), while RAP-Fc did not interact with agrin at all. To test whether the ability of APP to bind agrin, albeit at much lower affinity than LPR4, translates into a cooperative enhancement of the interaction of APP with LRP4, we incubated a fixed concentration of APP-Fc (100 ng/ml) with a fixed amount of LRP4-MBP (100 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of agrin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, agrin dose-dependently enhanced the interaction of LRP4 with APP at 10 ng/ml (1.3-fold) up to an optimal concentration ratio of 30 ng/ml (threefold higher binding than in the absence of agrin). Higher concentrations of agrin potently inhibited the interaction of LRP4 with APP to 60% of baseline at 100 ng/ml and 10% at 300 ng/ml, respectively. At 1000 ng/ml, which equates to an approximately 15-fold molar excess of agrin, LRP4 binding to APP was completely abolished. This finding suggests that LRP4 and APP may bind agrin through different epitopes. Independent binding of different agrin molecules to LRP4 and APP may thus induce steric inhibition, which prevents the formation of the favored hetero-oligomeric complex consisting of LRP4, APP, agrin and, on the surface of the myotube, MuSK.</p><p>Agrin occurs in multiple splice forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">McMahan et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferns et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess et al., 2000</xref>) of which the Z0 form is expressed by non-neural tissues such as muscle, while Z8 and Z19 are neural-specific.

Genetic epistasis experiments show that LRP4 and APP functionally interact to regulate NMJ development and maintenance. APP may accomplish this through several independent mechanisms: first, APP interacts directly with LRP4 and thereby is capable of activating MuSK (at a low level and independent of agrin) by ligating and clustering LRP4. Second, APP can also directly bind to agrin, albeit at lower affinity than LRP4. However, agrin cooperatively increases the stoichiometric interaction of APP with LRP4, which may serve to focus MuSK activation and thereby prevent aberrant AChR clustering. Third, APP and its homologues, which are expressed pre- and post-synaptically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), bind homomerically and heteromerically to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Soba et al., 2005</xref>), thereby generating or strengthening attachment sites for nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Torroja et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akaaboune et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Soba et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). By interacting simultaneously with LRP4 and agrin, APP and potentially APP-like proteins such as APLP2, which also participates in NMJ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), would further serve to recruit all components necessary for AChR clustering into an area of maximal density, thereby ensuring that AChR clustering is restricted in vivo to the site of nerve contact. A rendition of this model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00220.014</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model of the interactions of APP/APLP2, LRP4, agrin and MuSK during NMJ formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Our genetic, biochemical and functional results suggest that APP interacts with LRP4 and agrin to regulate NMJ formation. APP–LRP4 interaction in the absence of agrin may be able to activate MuSK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) at low levels to promote AChR clustering on the muscle fiber membrane, raising the possibility that nerve and muscle-derived APP and APLP2 homo- or heterodimerization may be able to cooperatively promote AChR clustering in the absence of agrin, which provides a potential mechanism for the earlier observation that initial AChR clustering is independent of agrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2001</xref>). Neural agrin (red) enhances the APP–LRP4 interaction and strongly activates MuSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7C and 8C</xref>), which is consistent with the role of agrin in the stabilization and maintenance of NMJs. Cooperative binding of APP and agrin to LRP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) would further strengthen LRP4–APP interaction on muscles, promoting synaptic differentiation and postnatal maintenance of NMJs (solid line with arrow in muscle fiber cytoplasm). By contrast, muscle agrin (gray), which cannot activate MuSK, would compete with decreasing concentrations of diffusible neural agrin at increasing distance from the NMJ and thus keep AChR clustering outside the nerve contact site suppressed.

The secreted LRP4 ectodomain that is encoded by our LRP4 ECD allele is presumably retained at the cell surface by simultaneous interactions with APP (possibly also APLPs), MuSK and agrin, but at levels that are insufficient to sustain the signal strength required for postnatal expansion of the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). Also supporting this model is the finding that initial AChR clustering is independent of neuronal agrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2001</xref>) and that rudimentary NMJs form in agrin-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gautam et al., 1996</xref>), which suggested the existence of a second nerve derived organizing signal.

Our finding that APP-Fc, but not RAP-Fc, can interact with LRP4 and induce MuSK phosphorylation at low level independent of agrin is consistent with both observations. Interestingly, however, and in contrast to our results with LRP4, the intracellular domain of APP appears to be required for normal NMJ development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests a role of these highly conserved C-terminal sequences in either signaling with APP serving as a co-receptor in the MuSK signaling complex, or a role in regulating the trafficking of all or part of the components of this complex.</p><p>It is conceivable that promotion of AChR clustering by homo- or heteromeric interaction of APP with itself or APLP2, and through inclusion of LRP4 and MuSK, requires an additional protein that interacts with the APP cytoplasmic domain, and that this requirement resembles the need for the interaction of rapsyn with the AChR and MuSK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bromann et al., 2004</xref>). In their study, Bromann and colleagues further showed that immobilized, but not soluble, agrin is able to aggregate MuSK and promote AChR clustering independent of MuSK’s kinase activity, suggesting that MuSK scaffolding plays an important role in AChR clustering. Our findings show that APP is independently capable of promoting AChR clustering, and that it further enhances clustering in the presence of agrin. Moreover, agrin potentiates the interaction of APP with LRP4. Thus, it is conceivable that APP cooperates with agrin and LRP4 to establish such an extracellular scaffold to promote MuSK aggregation and AChR clustering. AChR clustering can also be mediated by a variety of agrin independent mechanisms, including treatment with neuraminidase and VVA lectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin and Sanes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grow et al., 1999a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">b</xref>) and by defucosylation of muscle agrin, which unmask its ability to induce MuSK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2008a</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we have also obtained further evidence showing functional interaction of LRP4, APP and agrin during NMJ formation.

This would suggest that while APP and APLP2 are important for establishing trans-synaptic contact, LRP4 rather serves, through a hetero-oligomeric interaction with APP, MuSK and likely APLP2, to integrate agrin through cooperative binding into a spatially restricted signaling complex that focuses the molecular instructions required for AChR clustering at the surface of the muscle fiber.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00220.015</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Survival analysis of <italic>Lrp4</italic><sup>ECD/ECD</sup>;<italic>Aplp2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> double mutant pups</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00220.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00220.015</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Genotype</th><th>Expected</th><th>Observed</th><th>Chi-square test</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>Lrp4</italic><sup>+/ECD</sup>;<italic>Aplp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">68</td><td align="char" char=".">82</td><td>n.s.</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Lrp4</italic><sup>+/ECD</sup>;<italic>Aplp2</italic><sup>−/−</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">69</td><td align="char" char=".">75</td><td>n.s.</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Lrp4</italic><sup>ECD/ECD</sup>;<italic>Aplp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">58</td><td align="char" char=".">51</td><td>n.s.</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Lrp4</italic><sup>ECD/ECD</sup>;<italic>Aplp2</italic><sup>−/−</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">54</td><td align="char" char=".">17</td><td><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">*</xref></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>n.s., not significant.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><label>*</label><p>Significant at p&lt;0.01.</p></fn><fn><p>Pups were genotyped at weaning (∼25 days of age) to determine postnatal survival rates.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>This oligomeric interaction of the LRP4 ECD may explain the residual function of the nonmembrane-associated soluble receptor in the LRP4 ECD mutants. While membrane anchoring firmly restricts LRP4 to the two-dimensional surface of the muscle fiber and thereby ensures its continued presence in the MuSK/agrin/APP/APLP2 signaling complex, the loss of the transmembrane segment can be partially compensated for by the combined interactions of APP, APLP2, MuSK and agrin with the LRP4 ECD. The reduced signal strength that results in impaired NMJ size and number can be explained by the inevitable reduction of LRP4 ectodomain at the NMJ and relative dilution of secreted ECD throughout the muscle surface and the interstitial space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This in turn is partially compensated for by the increased expression of LRP4 ECD in the heterozygous and homozygous mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E,F</xref>).</p><p>We have further found that the non-neural Z0 as well as the neural Z8 and Z19 splice forms can bind to APP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Interaction of Z0 (muscle) agrin, which cannot efficiently promote AChR clustering at physiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2008a</xref>), may have nevertheless physiological importance in this context by negatively regulating the recruitment of the MuSK activating, neural agrin isoforms outside of nerve contact sites, where their concentrations would be reduced. In doing so, muscle agrin would serve to potently suppress the formation of aberrant signaling complexes by blocking LRP4 and APP family proteins with the inactive form. This inhibition would be overcome by the higher concentrations of neural agrin at the nerve terminals.</p><p>On another note, we have previously shown that LRP4 can interact with several modulators of the Wnt pathways, that is Wise, Dkk, and Sost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dietrich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karner et al., 2010</xref>). These modulators bind to the homologous β-propeller domain in LRP5. It is intriguing to speculate that these interactions can also contribute to the modulation of NMJ development or function.</p><p>In summary, the findings we have reported here reveal new insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern the formation of the neuromuscular synapse and that are consistent with the recent findings from the Burden and Mei laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yumoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zong et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, they raise interesting new questions about the interplay of agrin, MuSK, APP and LRP4 in the CNS where all these proteins are also expressed. There they might, in principle, work together in an analogous or similar manner to regulate synaptogenesis and promote neuronal survival. LRP4 belongs to an evolutionarily conserved class of ApoE receptors with essential functions in the regulation of neurotransmission at glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herz and Chen, 2006</xref>). We have recently shown that ApoE in an AD-associated, isoform-specific manner impairs ApoE receptor recycling at central synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2010b</xref>) and that this impairs the ability of ApoE receptor-dependent signals to prevent β-amyloid induced synaptic suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durakoglugil et al., 2009</xref>). The findings we have reported here, together with those by Wang et al., who have proposed that perturbed APP synaptic adhesion activity may contribute to synaptic dysfunction and AD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), reaffirm the NMJ as a versatile and useful experimental model system on which the cell biology of ApoE, APP and ApoE receptor trafficking and its pathobiology at peripheral and central synapses can be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Recombinant rat agrin C-terminal fragment, Ala1153 Pro1959 (Pro1788-Ser1798del), with an N-terminal Met and 6xHis tag (Cat. # 550-AG) was purchased from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). <italic>Lrp4</italic><sup>ECD/ECD</sup> and <italic>Lrp4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karner et al., 2010</xref>).

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers. The Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that reports the novel finding that APP participates in the signaling that underlies the formation of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), together with agrin, LRP4 and MuSK. Although the role of APP in this context was suggested in several previous publications, this is the first study that combines molecular genetics, cell biology and biochemical methods to delineate its involvement in agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling. A number of points need to be addressed by the authors to substantiate the model they propose.</p><p>1) The authors propose that APP participates in the anchoring of the LRP4 extra-cellular domain at the NMJ. However, although the APP/LRP4 interaction is shown and although the deletion of APP worsens the LRP4 ECD phenotype, no direct evidence supports this hypothesis. The demonstration would be more convincing if muscle immunostaining showed the localization of LRP4 ECD at the NMJ in the presence and absence of APP. One would expect LRP4 ECD accumulation to decrease in the absence of APP. Alternatively LRP4ECD-GFP fusions could be expressed in WT and APP<sup>-/-</sup> muscles. LRP4 ECD retention at the membrane, and/or colocalization with MuSK, could also be evaluated in cultured myotubes expressing APP, or not.</p><p>It would also be informative to know more about the expression patterns of APP and LRP4. A previous study suggested that the expression of APP in muscles starts at E16 and is concentrated at NMJs progressively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akaaboune et al. 2000</xref>, MCN 15:355). It is unclear if APP and LRP4 are expressed in a spatially and temporally correlated manner. The authors should provide a developmental expression profile of these two proteins in both motoneurons and muscles.</p><p>2) In vitro studies seem to suggest that APP is sufficient to induce AChR clusters in cultured muscles. However, there was no discernible phenotype of the APP<sup>-/-</sup> mutant, until the transmembrane domain of LRP4 was truncated. Because APP could bind both muscle and neuronal agrin, an interesting question is if APP acts by aggregating agrin. The conclusion in the text and in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) that APP-LRP4 interaction in the absence of agrin can activate MuSK to promote AChR clustering is not supported by the data shown. C2C12 cells express muscle agrin, which binds to APP as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. APP's effect could be studied in agrin<sup>-/-</sup> or KD muscle fibers. Alternatively, if APP overexpression could rescue the agrin null phenotypes in vivo that would be ever better. The authors should also check ectopic AChR cluster formation induced by agrin under LRP4<sup>ECD/ECD</sup> and LRP4<sup>ECD/ECD</sup> APP<sup>-/-</sup> conditions; again, this could be done in isolated muscle fibers.</p><p>3) The authors propose that APP could constitute the factor through which neuromuscular contacts initially form independently of agrin. This hypothesis is very interesting but requires additional proof, such as showing that, in the absence of agrin, APP is required for these initial contacts to form. It would be time consuming to cross APP<sup>-/-</sup> and agrin<sup>-/-</sup> mice, but the authors could already evaluate the implication of APP and APLP2 in the initial steps of neuromuscular junction formation by evaluating the requirement of these proteins for the prepatterning of AChR clusters that precedes nerve-muscle contact, i.e., by analyzing muscle prepatterning in APP<sup>-/-</sup> and APLP2<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><p>4) The demonstration of the interaction between APP and LRP4 is strong and convincing. In light of the recent results published by Steve Burden and colleagues showing that LRP4 constitutes the attraction signal for motoneurones, it is tempting to speculate from the present data that APP could constitute the neuronal ligand of LRP4. Primary motoneuron cultures from APP<sup>-/-</sup> mice could be cocultured with LRP4 beads to challenge this hypothesis.</p><p>5) In one set of binding assays, the LDB fragment was used. There was no data to show that this domain was required for fl LRP4 interaction with APP. This could be tested in experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Furthermore there were no data that showed the LRP4-APP interaction was necessary for NMJ formation or maturation. Ideally it should be shown in vivo that LRP4 without the LBD cannot rescue, but LRP4 wt can rescue the null phenotypes. At the very least, in vitro studies should be performed to see if APP-induced AChR clustering and MuSK activation requires the LBD. Moreover, description of this domain should be included in the Results rather than within the Methods. This domain, aa 27–349, has been shown to interact with MuSK. Perhaps the authors can comment in the Discussion on whether this domain interacts with WISE, DKK, and SOST?</p><p><italic>Other points of presentation that need attention</italic>:</p><p>a) The conclusion that “membrane anchoring of the receptor is required to maintain the level of signal strength necessary for postnatal maturation of the synapse” seems to be a misinterpretation. Many “maturation” events at ECD/ECD NMJs were apparently normal, including synapse elimination, subunit switch, etc.</p><p>b) There is some concern regarding the conclusion that “the failure of RAP-Fc to induce AChR clustering suggests that LRP4 dimerization alone is not sufficient, but that possibly the formation of an extracellular scaffold”. No data to show that RAP-Fc binds to LRP4 is presented in this paper. It binds to ApoE, but this does not suggest that it also binds LRP4. If it does, where in LRP4 does it bind? The LBD?</p><p>c) Based on the fluorescent images presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the impairment of postsynaptic differentiation, as illustrated by AChR clusters, in APP/LRP4<sup>ECD</sup> double mutant is subtle. A quantitative analysis is required to show if the double mutant significantly affects postsynaptic differentiation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00220.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The authors propose that APP participates in the anchoring of the LRP4 extra-cellular domain at the NMJ.

We have carried out immunostaining using antibodies against the LRP4 ectodomain. As expected and envisioned by the reviewer, we found that anti-LRP4 immunostaining was more diffuse in LRP4<sup>ECD/ECD</sup> and in APP/APLP2 double knockout muscle compared to WT muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). These results impressively show that LRP4 and APP family members are co-expressed and stabilize each other at the NMJ, as also demonstrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>.</p><p>We have investigated the localization of LRP4 and APP during NMJ synaptogenesis at E14.5, E16.5 and E18.5, using anti-LRP4 and anti-APP antibodies. We found that both LRP4 and APP were localized at the NMJ at E18.5. However, at E14.5 or E16.5 the staining was diffusely distributed across the muscle surface. These requested data are now included in the manuscript as part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. Additionally, we have carried out immunostaining on embryonic spinal cord sections (E14.5, E16.5 and E18.5), using anti-LRP4 or anti APP antibodies. However, we were unable to detect specific staining for both antibodies in the spinal cord at all three stages.</p><p><italic>2) In vitro studies seem to suggest that APP is sufficient to induce AChR clusters in cultured muscles.

For the time being, they have not given us conclusive in vitro results. We will need to pursue this point further by generating agrin<sup>-/-</sup>;APP<sup>-/-</sup>;APLP2<sup>-/-</sup> triple mutant mice. This is a challenge magnified by the low viability of the compound mutants. We have toned down our statements in the text and the discussion accordingly.</p><p><italic>3) The authors propose that APP could constitute the factor through which neuromuscular contacts initially form independently of agrin.

We have initiated the experiment by breeding agrin mutant mice with APP and APLP2 mutant mice. Because of the redundancy of APP and APLP2, we will need to study agrin/APP/APLP2 triple mutant mice to properly evaluate the effect. Due to the time required for this extensive breeding we have not obtained the triple mutant mice. However, we have evaluated the implication of APP and APLP2 in the prepatterning of AChR clusters in E14.5 APP/APLP2 double mutant muscle. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, AChRs are clustered along the central region of E14.5 APP/APLP2 double mutant muscle. Intriguingly, individual AChR clusters appear less robust compared with those in the wild type, APP null or APLP2 null muscles. These results demonstrate that prepatterned AChR clustering can occur in the absence of APP and APLP2.</p><p><italic>4) The demonstration of the interaction between APP and LRP4 is strong and convincing. In light of the recent results published by Steve Burden and colleagues showing that LRP4 constitutes the attraction signal for motoneurones, it is tempting to speculate from the present data that APP could constitute the neuronal ligand of LRP4. Primary motoneuron cultures from APP</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> <italic>mice could be cocultured with LRP4 beads to challenge this hypothesis</italic>.</p><p>We thank reviewers for this insightful comment. It is interesting that the results published by Steven Burdenʼs group (Yumoto, et al., Nature 2012) and Mei Linʼs group (Wu, et al., Neuron 2012) have shown that LRP4 expressed in non-muscle cells can induce presynaptic differentiation by aggregating presynaptic markers such as synapsin and SV2. Furthermore, studies from Lin Meiʼs group (Wu et al., Neuron, 2012) have shown that muscle specific deletion of LRP4 impairs both pre and postsynaptic development of the NMJ and that LRP4 in motor neurons is necessary for presynaptic differentiation of motor axons. It is tempting to speculate that APP, APLP2, or both, may serve as the neuronal ligand for LRP4 in inducing presynaptic differentiation. However, in vivo evidence indicates that APP/APLP2 is unlikely to be the major player in inducing presynaptic differentiation, because presynaptic differentiation is only mildly affected in neuronal specific deletion of APP/APLP2 (Wang et al., J Neuroscience 2009).</p><p><italic>5) In one set of binding assays, the LDB fragment was used.

Moreover, description of this domain should be included in the Results rather than within the Methods. This domain, aa 27-349, has been shown to interact with MuSK. Perhaps the authors can comment in the Discussion on whether this domain interacts with WISE, DKK, and SOST</italic>?</p><p>We show that the LBD fragment is sufficient for interaction with APP. We therefore did not test specifically whether the β-propeller portion of LRP4 also contributes to the interaction or not. Although this would ultimately provide additional structural detail to the demonstrated interaction between LRP4 and APP, it would not change the biological significance of the present study or the conclusions. We agree that in a future study one might address whether the interaction of LRP4, APP, agrin and MuSK can also be regulated by the various signal modulators (Wise, Dkk, Sost) that we have previously shown to bind to LRP4. Incidentally, Wise, Dkk and Sost all interact with the homologous β-propeller domain in LRP5/6. We ask for the reviewers’ and the editors’ understanding that to conclusively address this question would be more suitable for a full-fledged study in its own right.</p><p>Other points of presentation that need attention:</p><p><italic>a) The conclusion that “membrane anchoring of the receptor is required to maintain the level of signal strength necessary for postnatal maturation of the synapse” seems to be a misinterpretation. Many “maturation” events at ECD/ECD NMJs were apparently normal, including synapse elimination, subunit switch, etc</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for these clarifying comments. Synapse elimination and subunit switch proceed normally at the NMJ in the LRP4ECD/ECD mice and we have revised the manuscript accordingly.</p><p><italic>b) There is some concern regarding the conclusion that “the failure of RAP- Fc to induce AChR clustering suggests that LRP4 dimerization alone is not sufficient, but that possibly the formation of an extracellular scaffold”.

It universally binds to the ligand binding domains of ApoE receptors, i.e. the LDL receptor gene family. The structural basis for this has been nicely worked out by Steve Blacklow and colleagues (Structure of an LDLR-RAP Complex Reveals a General Mode for Ligand Recognition by Lipoprotein Receptors.
