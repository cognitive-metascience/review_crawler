premature stop-codons or short upstream open reading frame (uORFs). Our transcription start sites (TSSs) analysis of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells deficient for RNA degradation pathways revealed that about half of the pervasive transcripts are degraded by NMD, which provides a fail-safe mechanism to remove spurious transcripts that escaped degradation in the nucleus. Moreover, we found that the low specificity of RNA polymerase II TSSs selection generates, for 47% of the expressed genes, NMD-sensitive transcript isoforms carrying uORFs or starting downstream of the ATG START codon. Despite the low abundance of this last category of isoforms, their presence seems to constrain genomic sequences, as suggested by the significant bias against in-frame ATGs specifically found at the beginning of the corresponding genes and reflected by a depletion of methionines in the N-terminus of the encoded proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06722.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06722.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06722.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Eukaryotes such as animals, plants and fungi store their DNA within the nucleus of each of their cells. Genes within this DNA contain the instructions needed to make molecules of RNA; some of which can leave the nucleus and be decoded to build proteins. However, not all of the DNA that is copied into RNA actually codes for proteins. Instead, some RNA molecules are important parts of the cell's protein-making machinery in their own right, and others help to regulate the expression of genes as RNAs or proteins.</p><p>Nevertheless, many non-coding RNAs don't have such clear roles. Often these RNAs—which are called ‘pervasive transcripts’—are quickly destroyed within the nucleus, but it is likely that some molecules will escape this quality-control mechanism. If the cell's protein-making machinery decodes these RNAs, it could lead to the production of faulty or harmful proteins. Recent research suggested that another quality-control mechanism, which typically eradicates incorrectly processed protein-coding RNAs, could also destroy unneeded or harmful pervasive transcripts. But it was not clear how common it was for this process—called ‘nonsense-mediated decay’—to be used for this purpose.</p><p>Now Malabat, Feuerbach et al. have engineered yeast cells that lacked either the genes required to carry out nonsense-mediated decay or the ability to destroy RNA molecules in the nucleus. Experiments with these yeast cells revealed that about half of all pervasive transcripts can be destroyed via nonsense-mediated decay; this suggests that this mechanism serves as a fail-safe to prevent the build-up of these potentially harmful molecules.</p><p>Malabat, Feuerbach et al. also revealed that the enzyme complex that copies gene sequences to make RNA molecules will often also copy some extra DNA sequence from before the start of the gene. On the other hand, it is also common for this enzyme complex to miss the start of the gene and produce an RNA molecule that lacks some of the instructions needed to build the correct protein. Further experiments showed that in yeast these two kinds of incorrectly made protein-coding RNAs could both be identified and destroyed by nonsense-mediated decay as well. The next challenge will be to see to what extent these phenomena are conserved in other eukaryotes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06722.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06722.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>non-coding RNA</kwd><kwd>RNA quality control</kwd><kwd>non-sense mediated mRNA decay</kwd><kwd>nuclear RNA degradation</kwd><kwd>transcription initiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003762</institution-id><institution>Institut Pasteur</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malabat</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacquier</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-2011-BSV6-011-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacquier</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-14-CE-10-0014-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacquier</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RNA polymerase II generates numerous transcript isoforms, including transcripts initiating downstream of the START codon, that are efficiently degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent advances in sequencing technologies led to the detection of a wealth of new RNA transcripts and revealed that eukaryotic genomes are pervasively transcribed. In human cells, roughly 75% of the genome gives rise to RNA transcripts of various length but only an estimated 2% corresponds to protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Djebali et al., 2012</xref>). Even in a compact genome such as the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), hundreds of such pervasive non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) were identified in addition to the stable ncRNAs such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (sn(o)RNAs), and ribosomal RNA (rRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Dijk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geisler et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Yeast ncRNAs are transcribed from nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) present throughout the genome, most often at gene promoters and terminators, and part of these RNAs represent by-products of divergent transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). Different mechanisms of RNA quality control prevent their accumulation in wild-type cells. In the nucleus, transcription from bidirectional promoters is restricted by early termination-coupled RNA degradation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arigo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thiebaut et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ntini et al., 2013</xref>). In the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, degradation-coupled transcription termination of pervasive transcripts relies on the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, which interacts with the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) phosphorylated on serine 5 and triggers termination upon recognition of short sequences on the nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arigo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thiebaut et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gudipati et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vasiljeva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schulz et al., 2013</xref>). Early termination of these transcripts (named CUTs for cryptic unstable transcripts) is coupled with the recruitment of the Trf4-Air2-Mtr4 (TRAMP) complex and the Rrp6-containing nuclear RNA-exosome for rapid degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wyers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis and Ares, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tudek et al., 2014</xref>). However, a significant proportion of the pervasive transcripts can escape this early nuclear quality-control step and be exported to the cytoplasm where they are targeted for degradation by the cytoplasmic 5′-3′ exonuclease Xrn1 (XUT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Dijk et al., 2011</xref>). Some pervasive transcripts seem to be immune enough to both surveillance pathways to be detectable in wild-type cells and are called SUTs (stable unannotated transcripts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). The distinction between these different classes of transcripts is not very stringent. Their behavior can be similar, as illustrated by the fact that in the absence of Xrn1p the average levels of SUTs and CUTs increase by 7.9-fold and 3.6-fold respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Dijk et al., 2011</xref>). What makes pervasive transcripts (XUTs in the first instance) highly sensitive to Xrn1p-dependent cytoplasmic degradation remains to be determined but may be linked to the presence of small spurious open reading frames (ORF) in these transcripts that will make them substrates for the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) as has been recently demonstrated for a new class of unannotated transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Originally described more than two decades ago as a quality-control pathway targeting for degradation mRNAs containing a premature termination codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leeds et al., 1991</xref>), NMD is a translation-coupled quality-control pathway affecting cytoplasmic transcripts with restricted coding capacities (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012</xref>). NMD targets include mRNAs harboring ‘upstream open reading frames’ (uORFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</xref>) and unspliced or incorrectly spliced transcripts exported to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sayani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawashima et al., 2014</xref>) accounting for roughly 10–15% of mRNAs in yeast as well as in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012</xref> and references therein). This number may be an underestimate since recent studies underscored the structural heterogeneity of most mRNAs at both their 5′ and 3′ -ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ozsolak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waern and Snyder, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Transcript heterogeneity at the 5′-end is particularly relevant for NMD targeting since the use of different transcription start sites (TSSs) will generate, for a given gene, mRNAs with different 5′-UTRs that may include uORFs. Although NMD targets were previously analysed genome-wide using NMD-deficient strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the techniques used to perform these analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawashima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2014</xref>) did not allow monitoring such individual transcript isoforms and were thus susceptible to have missed a large number of transcripts degraded by this pathway. In order to address this question in a global and systematic manner, we used a modified 5′-RACE approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hashimoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</xref>) to perform a genome-wide analysis of TSSs in wild-type <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells as well as in cells deficient for nuclear and NMD RNA quality-control pathways. Minor transcript isoforms targeted for degradation by NMD were identified for almost half of yeast protein-coding genes, underscoring the low specificity of TSS selection by RNAPII. In particular, our study revealed for the majority of protein-coding genes the use of TSSs downstream the ATG start codons. This phenomenon has the potential to generate N-terminally truncated proteins if the first ATG encountered by ribosomes translating this 5′ truncated transcript is in the right reading frame. Such an undesirable outcome seems, however, to be counteracted by the significant depletion of in-frame relative to out-of-frame ATGs at the beginning of protein-coding genes in yeast. This bias increases the probability of such transcripts to have very short coding regions and be efficiently degraded by NMD.</p><p>Our analysis also showed that NMD restricts the accumulation of cryptic transcripts initiating inside transcribed ORFs as a consequence of altered chromatin structure and provides a fail-safe control mechanism for the removal of pervasive transcripts that escaped degradation by the nuclear quality-control pathway, reminiscent of what has been previously shown for some unspliced pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sayani and Chanfreau, 2012</xref>). This includes not only a large fraction of the XUTs and SUTs but also a fraction of the CUTs and previously unannotated transcripts, which accumulate to substantial levels only when both pathways are inactive.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TSS sequencing technique</title><p>To identify TSSs genome-wide and with high specificity we used a modified genomic 5′-RACE approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hashimoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</xref>) that we called TSS sequencing, which involves a biotin purification step and allows the selective enrichment of the 5′-ends of capped transcripts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and ‘Materials and methods’). We evaluated the ‘false-discovery’ rate of the method for the identification of TSSs (that is, the proportion of sequencing reads not actually mapping to the 5′-end of capped RNAs) by comparing libraries made using samples treated or not with the tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP), which is required for efficient and specific ligation of the biotinylated primer to the 5′-end of capped-RNAs. To extend this analysis to transcripts that are unstable in wild-type cells, we prepared libraries using RNAs extracted from <italic>upf1∆rrp6∆</italic> double mutant strains. To minimize polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification biases and provide an internal control, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNAs, treated or not with TAP, were mixed with an equal amount of TAP-treated poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNAs from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> just prior to the ligation step. After normalization using the <italic>S. pombe</italic> sequencing reads and removal of the ribosomal DNA ones, these experiments generated 2,844,877 reads when TAP was used compared with 72,435 reads when TAP was omitted. The ratio between these two numbers provides an upper limit for the false-discovery rate of TSS identification of 2.5%. Analysis of the cumulative 5′-end read counts per nucleotide around the start codon for all protein-coding genes showed that, genome-wide, 77% (2,190,211) of the reads obtained for TAP-treated samples could be mapped within a 200 nucleotide region upstream of the start codons with a maximum at around 30 nucleotides upstream from ATGs, while only 22% mapped to the same region when this treatment was omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, even in the latter case, the number of mapped reads also peaked at around 30 nucleotides upstream of the ATGs, suggesting that a substantial proportion of these sequences likely correspond to genuine TSSs even though they were generated in the absence of TAP treatment. These data suggest that the real false-discovery rate for TSS is substantially less than 2.5%.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06722.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcription start site sequencing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic view of the methodology used to produce the transcription start site (TSS) sequence-tag libraries (RNA molecules are in blue, DNA molecules in red).

The vertical arrows pointing to an A indicate the fact that the +1 nucleotide position, a pyrimidine in the genome, corresponds to a mismatched A at the first position of the cDNA. Up to 30% of the cDNA 5′-ends mapping on a pyrimidine actually conform to this consensus. Note that the presence of a conserved A at position −7 while it is located at position −8 in the general consensus and the presence of the pyrimidine to A mismatch suggests that transcription may not start at the pyrimidine but rather at the following A. Indeed, if one would remove the base at the 5′-end of the cDNA reads and align these to the genome, they would then perfectly conform to the general consensus, including the A at position −8, suggesting that an extra A is added at the 5′-end of the transcript during its synthesis. (<bold>D</bold>) Schematic model depicting how a one nucleotide ‘backward-shift’ relative to the template occurring during the transcription of the first three consecutive As might lead to the incorporation of four As at the beginning of the transcript.

Analysis of the TSSs and their surrounding sequences using the Web-LOGO algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crooks et al., 2004</xref>) identified a consensus sequence around TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) similar to the previously reported one derived from a smaller data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang and Dietrich, 2005</xref>). In particular, we observed a very strong bias to start at a purine (88% of mapped TSSs), usually following a pyrimidine (76% of the mapped TSSs), and the enrichment for an A at position −8 relative to the TSS (A(N)<sub>6</sub>Py<underline>Pu</underline> consensus). Surprisingly, 58% of TSS reads starting with a pyrimidine when aligned on the genome (12% of the mapped TSSs) show a mismatch at their first nucleotide, most of the time an A instead of the encoded pyrimidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Moreover, in 32% of these cases the surrounding genomic sequences exhibited a specific consensus, A(N)<sub>6</sub><underline>Py</underline>AAA (where the underlined base is the mapped TSS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These observations suggest that, in these cases, transcription actually initiates on the A following the pyrimidine and that an additional A is added at the 5′-end of the transcript, possibly by a back-tracking mechanism as proposed in the model described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>. This may also apply to other TSSs mapped on a pyrimidine and showing a mismatched first nucleotide. It thus appears from this observation that, even though 12% of the TSSs mapped on a pyrimidine, transcription initiation actually occurred on a pyrimidine in less than 5% of cases (42% of non-mismatched cDNAs out of 12% of cDNAs aligned on a pyrimidine).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA degradation pathways cooperate in the removal of pervasive transcripts</title><p>To assess the relative contributions of the cytoplasmic NMD and nuclear RNA control pathways in shaping the yeast transcriptome, the genes encoding Upf1, an RNA helicase essential for NMD, or Rrp6, a nuclear exosome catalytic subunit, were deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wyers et al., 2005</xref>). Since, for a given gene, several closely spaced TSSs can be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>), we used a peak-calling procedure to define, in three biological replicates, TSS clusters corresponding to transcript isoforms with closely spaced 5′-ends (TSSCs; see ‘Materials and methods’). This analysis allowed us to identify 17,812 TSSCs, among which 5927 could be assigned to 5′-ends of mRNAs corresponding to 5231 ORFs (O category in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), as previously defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>).

In contrast, only 23% of the CUT-TSSCs increased significantly in the absence of Upf1.

Collectively, 39% and 54% of the pervasive transcripts (CUTs, SUTs and XUTs) were significantly sensitive to the absence of Upf1 in a wild-type or <italic>rrp6∆</italic> background, respectively, indicating that NMD targets about half of the pervasive transcripts. The absence of both Rrp6 and Upf1 had an additive effect on the stabilization of pervasive transcripts. In the double mutant, 76% and 92% of the XUTs/SUTs and CUTs, respectively, were significantly stabilized, suggesting that NMD provides a fail-safe control mechanism for pervasive transcripts that escaped degradation in the nucleus, reminiscent of what has been previously shown for some unspliced pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sayani and Chanfreau, 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06722.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Differential effect of <italic>UPF1</italic> and/or <italic>RRP6</italic> deletion on mRNAs and pervasive transcripts.</title><p>Frequency distribution of the ratios of transcription start site clusters (TSSCs) read counts in <italic>upf1</italic>∆ (red), <italic>rrp6</italic>∆ (blue), or <italic>upf1</italic>∆<italic>rrp6</italic>∆ (purple) compared with wild-type (WT) for mRNAs (<bold>A</bold>), cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) (<bold>B</bold>), Xrn1-sensitive transcripts (XUTs) (<bold>C</bold>) and stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs) (<bold>D</bold>).

Indeed, all XUTs and SUTs carry spurious ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and some of them have been identified in ribosomal profiling experiments and shown to encode short peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). However, the high sensitivity to NMD of XUTs and SUTs compared with mRNAs suggests the presence of specific features. Assuming that the first encountered ORF is translated, XUTs and SUTs carry, on average, much shorter ORFs and longer 3′-UTRs than mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The presence of both a long 3′-UTR and a short ORF increases NMD efficiency in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Decourty et al., 2014</xref>) and thus explain why these transcripts are efficiently targeted for degradation by this pathway. Furthermore, the few XUTs and SUTs found not to be sensitive to NMD have on average significantly shorter 3′-UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which is in agreement with the recently published observation that, in ribosomal profiling experiments, the length of RNA downstream of the ribosome protected region is significantly longer for NMD-sensitive compared with NMD-insensitive unannotated RNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Identification of additional pervasive transcripts</title><p>Amongst the 17,812 TSSCs identified in this study, 7739 could not be assigned to previously annotated transcripts (ORFs, stable ncRNAs or pervasive transcripts) and were only detected in mutants cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Since NMD is a translation-coupled RNA degradation pathway, the stabilizing effect seen upon <italic>UPF1</italic> deletion on pervasive transcripts indicated that once these transcripts reached the cytoplasm they associate with the translation machinery. Indeed, once they reached the cytoplasm the pervasive transcripts (being capped and poly-adenylated) cannot be distinguished from normal mRNAs and associate with the translation machinery. However, since they usually have short ORFs followed by relatively long 3′ UTR regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), a hallmark of NMD substrates in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Decourty et al., 2014</xref>), they will be targeted for degradation by this RNA quality-control pathway. This is supported by the identification of pervasive transcripts (mainly XUTs and SUTs) in ribosomal profiling experiments performed in wild-type cells and the recent discovery of a new class of unannotated transcripts (uRNAs) associated with polyribosomes and encoding short peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The association of so-called ‘non-coding’ transcripts with the translation machinery and their ensuing high sensitivity to NMD has also been observed in multicellular organisms. In mouse embryonic stem cells, many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were found to be associated with translating ribosomes and an estimated 17.4% of lncRNAs were found to be upregulated in the absence of <italic>UPF1</italic>, compared with only 4% for protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ingolia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our results also showed that XUTs, originally described as Xrn1-sensitive transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Dijk et al., 2011</xref>), are in fact primarily targeted by NMD by virtue of their poor coding capacities, with the Xrn1 exonuclease acting as a downstream effector of this pathway. Thus, we propose to redefine the various classes of pervasive transcripts identified in yeast into transcripts primarily degraded in the cytoplasm (SUTs and XUTs) and transcripts more sensitive to the nuclear exosome (CUTs) even though each of these degradation pathways similarly affect some transcripts and can show a synergic effect (see below).</p><p>Our analysis also revealed the prevalent role of NMD in the removal of cryptic transcripts initiating from intragenic promoters either in sense (here called B) or in antisense orientation (here called A). The strong impact of NMD inactivation on these transcripts indicated that they are exported to the cytoplasm and associate with the translation machinery, as is the case for the pervasive transcripts (see above). Even though we cannot rule out an indirect effect of the <italic>UPF1</italic> deletion on chromatin structure, the high number of intragenic transcripts (whether sense or antisense) identified in the <italic>upf1</italic>∆ single mutant suggests that the inhibition of transcription initiation by transcription-coupled chromatin modifications is not fully efficient and thus that some of these transcripts are produced as part of the normal transcription cycle in wild-type cells, with NMD playing an important role to eliminate them.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cooperation between nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA quality-control pathways</title><p>Deletions of <italic>UPF1</italic> and <italic>RRP6</italic> had an additive effect on the accumulation of CUTs, SUTs and XUTs. However, a number of pervasive transcripts, in particular ‘A’ and ‘intergenic’ ones, were stabilized to substantial levels only when both the nuclear and the cytoplasmic RNA quality-control pathways were compromised, suggesting that they can act synergistically.</p><p>Two mechanisms of transcription termination have been reported in yeast. One depends on the cleavage and poly-adenylation complex (CPF-CFI/II), which generates the poly-adenylated mRNAs that get exported and translated in the cytoplasm, and another, which involves the NNS complex and is shared by CUTs and sn(o)RNAs precursors (see ‘Introduction’). However, the demarcation between the two modes of termination is far from being strict as some terminators can often be recognized by both pathways depending on their distance from the TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Porrua et al., 2012</xref>). In the early phase of transcription elongation the RNAPII CTD repeats are mainly phosphorylated at Ser5, which favor recruitment of the NNS complex; while transcription proceeds, Ser2 gets phosphorylated at the expense of Ser5, promoting the recruitment of the CPF-CFI/II complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2004</xref>). For some pervasive transcripts, these two termination pathways may compete and generate transcripts terminated by the NNS pathways and degraded by the nuclear exosome, as well as transcripts terminated by the CPF-CFI/II pathway and exported to the cytoplasm where they are targeted for degradation by the NMD. The produced RNAs would thus accumulate to detectable levels only when both RNA quality-control pathways are inactivated. Since the nuclear exosome has recently been shown to act with the NNS complex to promote early transcription termination at specific targets in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fox et al., 2015</xref>), we cannot rule out that in wild-type or <italic>upf1</italic>∆ cells transcription will normally be terminated by the NNS complex and the synthesized transcripts degraded by the nuclear exosome, while in <italic>rrp6</italic>∆ cells transcription will proceed until the polymerase encounters the next CPF-CFI/II termination signal giving rise to longer transcripts exported to the cytoplasm and targeted for degradation by the NMD.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>NMD removes numerous transcripts arising from the low specificity of transcription initiation</title><p>NMD was previously shown to target a few hundred uORF-containing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</xref>). However, the use of NMD-deficient cells allowed us to identify 22% of the active genes for which a fraction of their transcript isoforms carried at least one uORF and were significantly sensitive to NMD. Moreover, 35% of the expressed genes generated transcript isoforms initiating at iTSSs and significantly stabilized in the absence of Upf1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Some transcripts initiated at iTSSs were previously described in wild-type cells and shown to allow the synthesis of N-terminal variants of proteins exhibiting differential stabilities or localizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu and Tzagoloff, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gammie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>) but their number was vastly underestimated, probably because of their sensitivity to NMD (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These two observations reveal an important role for NMD in getting rid of numerous undesired transcripts, the majority of which likely resulted from the low specificity of TSS selection by RNAPII. Yet, we cannot rule out that some of these transcripts have a biological function. For example, the use of alternative TSSs giving rise to transcripts with very different sensitivity to NMD could be used for regulatory purposes, in a way similar to that described for some genes of the nucleotide biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuehner and Brow, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thiebaut et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, transcript isoforms carrying a uORF or starting at an iTSS and targeted by NMD constituted the major transcript isoforms for only 446 mRNAs and minor transcript isoforms for almost half of the expressed genes. Therefore, although not quantitatively impacting the overall mRNA levels substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig7">Figures 2A, 7C</xref>), NMD affects qualitatively a large fraction of the mRNA transcription units. NMD also has a strong impact on the accumulation of pervasive and cryptic transcripts and thus appears as a major player shaping the yeast transcriptome. In addition, we observed that transcripts initiated at iTSSs are significantly depleted in ATGs in the +1 frame, precluding the synthesis of N-terminally truncated proteins and ensuring their efficient NMD degradation. It thus suggests that this phenomenon might be important enough to have imposed an evolutionary constraint on the methionine content of the N-terminus of the yeast proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and culture</title><p>All the strains are a derivative of BY4741 and were obtained directly from the Euroscarf deletion collection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.uni-frankfurt.de/fb15/mikro/euroscarf/">http://web.uni-frankfurt.de/fb15/mikro/euroscarf/</ext-link>) or generated by crossing with a <italic>can1∆</italic> derivative of BY4741 (LMA1057, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

We choose a SNR limit of 0.55.</p><p>TSS accuracy was defined as the proportion of TSSs within a TSSC mapped on a purine preceded by a pyrimidine vs the total count of TSSs mapped within the TSSC. We choose a minimum TSS accuracy of 80%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-7"><title>Distribution of individual TSSs around start codons</title><p>Individual TSS counts and read counts were used to determine the repartition of the TSSs around the ATGs of annotated ORFs (−200 to +100 nucleotides around ORFs ATGs). We used the ORF ATG positions retrieved from the SGD and corrected as described above in the ‘Identification of TSSCs’ section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-8"><title>Identification of ORFs following individual TSSs</title><p>For each TSS identified in the region from −200 to +100 nucleotides around ORF ATGs, we looked for the two subsequent ATGs. When the TSS was upstream of the annotated ATG start codon, we determined whether or not it was the first encountered one. When the TSS was within the ORF, we determined whether the ATGs were in the same phase as the natural ORF or not.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-9"><title>Determination of ORF and 3′-UTR sizes for the different features</title><p>For mRNAs, ORF start, ORF end and 3′-end coordinates obtained, as described above in the ‘Identification of TSSCs’ section, were used to calculate the sizes of the ORF and the 3′-UTR. For XUTs and SUTs, ORF start was determined as the coordinate of the first ATG after the annotated start obtained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al. (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Dijk et al. (2011)</xref>. ORF ends were determined as the coordinate of the first in phase stop codon encountered after the previously selected ATG start codon. The region between the end of this potential ORF and the end of the XUT or SUT was considered to be the 3′UTR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-10"><title>Nucleotide use</title><p>We determined the proportion of A, T, G, and C at each position in the region spanning −200 to +100 nucleotides around the ATGs of ORFs according to the annotation found in the SGD and corrected as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-11"><title>Codons and amino acids use</title><p>We determined the number of ATGs within the first 1000 nucleotides after the ORF start codon based on the information available in the SGD. To avoid the overrepresented value of the start ATG codon, the first three nucleotides were not included in the analysis. The ratios between phased ATG and total ATG counts were computed in a window of nine nucleotides. The same method was applied for all other codons. To estimate the differential use of a codon between the start and the body of the ORFs, we normalized the value for each codon taking into account the mean ratio for this particular codon in the region comprised between 500 and 1000 nucleotides after the start codon.</p><p>We used the protein sequences retrieved from SGD and omitted the first methionine of the proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-12"><title>Transcripts expression levels</title><p>We used the coverage of LT_01 and LT_02 libraries to calculate transcript expression levels of mRNAs, SUTs and XUTs. The coordinates of the different types of transcripts were obtained as described above. We calculated the expression levels for the four samples of both libraries and then used DESeq2 for normalization, estimation of fold change and mean signal calculation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-13"><title>Mean NFR density</title><p>The mean NFR density has been calculated using a nucleosome definition in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaplan et al.

We collected the nucleosome signal in regions from −1000 to +1000 nucleotides around each TSS, aligned on TSS position and calculated means for each position.</p></sec><sec

Since transcripts with 5'ends originating downstream of their annotated TSSs (B-TSSC, iTSS) are identified, it seems crucial to control for the efficiency of the phosphatase treatment, as many of these transcripts may otherwise represent degradation intermediates rather than transcripts with alternative 5'ends. Finding the same consensus sequence motif as at canonical TSSs helps, but do the authors have any direct means to control for the effective exclusion of such species from the libraries</italic>?</p><p>We agree that, in order to use the mapping of RNA 5’-ends as marks of transcription start sites, it is critical to control that they originated from capped-RNA ends. Even though we have not controlled the efficiency of the phosphatase treatment step specifically, we think that the best control for this is the experiment we performed comparing the results obtained with or without treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. The reads from the minus-TAP experiment were used to measure the background of reads originating from 5’-mono phosphate RNAs remaining after phosphatase treatment, which was estimated as being, overall, lower than 2.5% (see end of the Results section “TSS sequencing technique”). The genome-wide data for this experiment, deposited in the GEO database, were used to filter out a few possible false positive TSSCs, as explained in the Materials and methods section “Filtering TSSCs”. Note that, concerning iTSSs, we purposely showed a zoom of the corresponding regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, which clearly demonstrates that the vast majority or reads mapped just after the START codons do originate from capped-RNAs since they are observed only after the TAP treatment. We have now added an appropriate sentence when first describing iTSSs to mention this point (see “Almost half of the coding genes produced transcript isoforms sensitive to NMD”).</p><p><italic>2) Differential expression analysis should be done according to today's best practice, which includes normalization of the data that accounts for differences in sequencing depths between samples (i.e. size factor normalization [see DESeq2] rather than rpkm)</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this comment (even though we did not use rpkm for size factor normalization). We have now re-analysed all the data using DESeq2. This allowed more rigorous statistical analyses of the data and all figures and numbers were changed accordingly. In particular, we now use the standard Wald-test provided in DESeq2 with the usual threshold for the p-value of 0.05, instead of a log<sub>2</sub> threshold of 1, to determine the transcripts, TSSs or TSSCs significantly expressed differentially in the different strains. Note that, although to two approaches are markedly different, the results were very similar and using this more rigorous approach did not changed the overall conclusions drawn.</p><p><italic>Minor points</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The authors' seem somewhat biased towards the idea that every transcript that is repressed by some factor constitutes noise. Is this really always clear</italic>?</p><p>No, we certainly do not consider that all transcripts targeted for degradation by quality-control mechanisms constitute transcriptional noise. For example, in some cases, it has been clearly shown that the transcription of some non-coding RNAs can have a biological function, in particular for gene expression regulation by transcriptional interference. The analysis of such functions for the thousands pervasive transcripts identified in this work is out of the scope of this manuscript. Also, and as discussed in the manuscript, a substantial fraction of mRNAs is down regulated by NMD and it certainly does not correspond to transcriptional noise. The different use of TSSs has also previously been shown to be a mean of regulation. We have now added a short paragraph in the Discussion to mention this possibility (see “These two observations reveal an important role for NMD […] some genes of the nucleotide biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuehner and Brow, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thiebaut et al., 2008</xref>)”).</p><p><italic>2) The authors identify a consensus sequence, which basically is identical for all types of RNAPII transcripts: A(N)6PyPu, where the Pu is the TSS. Is it possible to investigate/estimate what fraction of such sites in the genome is functioning as TSSs based on the TSS sequencing data</italic>?</p><p>We identified 1,775,474 sites in the genome with the exact consensus A(N)6PyPu and 85,714 (4.8%) were used as transcription start sites. A sentence was added in the Discussion (“Importantly, this consensus sequence […] different classes of transcripts identified in this study”).</p><p><italic>3) The term “synergistic”, used in the subsection “Identification of additional pervasive transcripts” (“it had a synergistic effect on some ‘intergenic’…”): could this synergism simply be an additive effect that is hidden by the generally low expression of these RNAs</italic>?</p><p>Indeed, for a number of the pervasive transcripts, this can be true. Yet, for some of them, exemplified by the novel pervasive transcripts found antisense to MAL12/32 and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, there is a strong signal in the double mutant and no detected signal in the single mutants. We think that the most likely explanation for this observation is, indeed, that the effect of the two mutations is synergistic and not only additive. We have modified the corresponding sentence in the Results section to attenuate the statement and to more clearly point to the above-mentioned example (“Furthermore, the absence of both Rrp6 and Upf1 […] <italic>upf1∆rrp6∆</italic> double mutant (see for example the transcript 268 found antisense to MAL12/32 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>”).</p><p><italic>4) What is the reason for the overall rather low mapping rate of the sequencing data (sometimes as low as 30%)</italic>?</p><p>Before mapping there is a filtering step, as it is described in materials and methods. This step first collapse reads with the same sequence and the same 5’-end random tag to eliminate PCR duplicates. We added this information in Table1 in the revised version of the manuscript, to indicate the reads count after collapsing the reads. Duplication level can be high for some samples and sometimes only 30 % of the reads are really unique. On the contrary, mapping level, considering unique reads count as initial count, is around 95% for all the samples.</p><p><italic>5) Throughout the manuscript only few statistical tests are applied.

For example, the number of differentially expressed transcripts are not defined by a threshold anymore but by the Wald-test provided in DESeq2. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> (now 7C), we provided the requested p-value (ANOVA test) in the figure.
