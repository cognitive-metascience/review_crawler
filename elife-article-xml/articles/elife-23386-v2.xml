The neural pathways by which taste compounds influence innate and learned behaviors have not been resolved. Here, we identify three classes of taste projection neurons (TPNs) in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> distinguished by their morphology and taste selectivity. TPNs receive input from gustatory receptor neurons and respond selectively to sweet or bitter stimuli, demonstrating segregated processing of different taste modalities. Activation of TPNs influences innate feeding behavior, whereas inhibition has little effect, suggesting parallel pathways. Moreover, two TPN classes are absolutely required for conditioned taste aversion, a learned behavior. The TPNs essential for conditioned aversion project to the superior lateral protocerebrum (SLP) and convey taste information to mushroom body learning centers. These studies identify taste pathways from sensory detection to higher brain that influence innate behavior and are essential for learned responses to taste compounds.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23386.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23386.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>gustatory</kwd><kwd>chemosensory</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC013280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>Kristin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kirkhart</surname><given-names>Colleen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Taste pathways to higher brain are critical for learned responses to taste compounds.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to detect nutrients and toxins is critical for survival. In most animals, the gustatory system has evolved as a specialized sensory system to detect non-volatile chemicals in the environment. The taste system innately drives strong food acceptance or rejection behaviors. In addition, gustatory detection of nutrients can serve as a reward to impart positive valence to previously neutral stimuli whereas bitter detection can act as a punishment signal. The pathways by which gustatory detection drive innate feeding behavior and learned associations have not been resolved.</p><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, like other animals, uses the gustatory system to detect nutrients and toxins in potential food. Fly gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) are located on the proboscis labellum, internal mouthparts, legs, and wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stocker, 1994</xref>). Different GRNs detect different taste modalities, including, sugar, bitter, water, and pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cameron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thistle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thorne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Toda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Most sensory neurons on the legs and wings send axons to the ventral nerve cord (VNC), whereas those on the proboscis labellum and mouthparts project to the subesophageal zone (SEZ) of the central brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stocker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Activation of sucrose-responsive taste neurons triggers behavioral subprograms associated with feeding, including inhibition of locomotion, extension of the fly proboscis, and ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keene and Masek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thoma et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, activation of bitter-responsive sensory neurons triggers food rejection, including proboscis retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keene and Masek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marella et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, taste cell activation elicits responses in mushroom body learning circuits for sensory associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kirkhart and Scott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Second-order neurons that respond to taste stimuli and transmit this information for innate and learned behaviors have been challenging to identify. A recent study implicated a pair of neurons that projects from the SEZ to the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC) as candidate second-order taste neurons. These neurons respond to sugar stimulation of proboscis taste neurons and promote proboscis extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kain and Dahanukar, 2015</xref>). A different study identified local SEZ interneurons as candidate second-order neurons that sense sugar detection specifically of mouthpart sensory neurons. Inhibiting activity in these neurons selectively inhibited ingestion, and activating them prolonged ingestion without influencing proboscis extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yapici et al., 2016</xref>). The candidate second-order neurons identified to date show remarkable specificity in terms of the sensory neurons that activate them (proboscis versus mouthparts) and the behavioral subprograms they generate (proboscis extension versus ingestion). The model suggested by these findings is that taste information is processed by parallel labeled lines via several different neural streams that coordinate different aspects of feeding behavior. Consistent with this, a behavioral study of the function of different taste neurons on the legs found that some caused inhibition of locomotion whereas others promoted proboscis extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thoma et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To test the specialization of taste processing streams beyond the sensory neurons, we searched for candidate second-order neurons that might convey taste information from the legs or the proboscis to the higher brain. Here, we identify three classes of taste projection neurons (TPNs), distinguished by their morphology and taste selectivity, that reveal the existence of taste processing streams that are especially important for learned associations. Our studies demonstrate the existence of modality-selective taste pathways to higher brain, highlight similarities in the organization of second-order sensory neurons, and characterize taste processing streams required for learned taste aversion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of three candidate taste projection neurons</title><p>GRNs on the legs project to the leg ganglia of the VNC whereas those from the proboscis labellum and mouthparts project to the SEZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> contains genotypes for all experiments).

Both TPN2 and TPN3 axons run parallel to the olfactory projection neuron lateral antennal lobe tract (lALT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,I</xref>). TPN2 and TPN3 axons do not contact the MB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,F</xref>), but terminate predominately in the superior lateral protocerebrum (SLP), with a few synapses in and around the LH in close proximity to olfactory projection neuron axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,G</xref>).

As TPN2 and TPN3 arborize in a mushroom body association area, we hypothesized that they might participate in learned behaviors. We therefore sought to test the role of TPNs in mediating innate and learned gustatory behaviors.</p><p>The proboscis extension response (PER) is an innate gustatory-driven behavior: when gustatory neurons on the legs detect sugar, the fly extends its proboscis to eat, and extension is inhibited upon inclusion of bitter compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dethier, 1976</xref>). To examine whether TPN activation might influence this innate behavior, we selectively activated TPNs with the red-light-gated cation channel CsChrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) and examined the effects on PER. In the absence of a taste stimulus, activation of either TPN1 or TPN2 increased PER, whereas activation of TPN3 did not elicit PER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). To test whether activation of TPNs modulates PER in the presence of a moderately appetitive gustatory stimulus, we presented flies with sucrose on their legs while activating TPNs. Activation of TPN1 or TPN2 did not significantly increase PER in this context.

As activation of sugar-sensing TPN1 and TPN2 promotes PER whereas activation of bitter-sensing TPN3 inhibits PER, these experiments demonstrate that neurons that project to the SEZ (TPN1 and TPN2) as well as those that project to protocerebrum (TPN2 and TPN3) can influence SEZ sensorimotor circuits involved in proboscis extension.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23386.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Taste projection neurons influence proboscis extension.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PER to activation with CsChrimson, in absence of a taste stimulus.

As another strategy to ask whether TPN2 could act upstream of MB circuits, we asked whether TPN2 influenced activity in aminergic inputs into MBs.

We generated flies in which bitter GRNs express CsChrimson, allowing for exogenous activation with red light, and monitored calcium signals in both TPN3 and PPL1-MV1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>). A red indicator was also expressed, allowing for the visualization and laser-ablation of TPN3 axons along the lALT tract. Pre-nerve resection, activation of bitter GRNs activated both TPN3 and PPL1-MV1.

This organotopy suggests that taste detection from different organs serves different functions, consistent with studies identifying interneurons that sense sweet taste from the mouthparts and drive ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yapici et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, the lateralized sugar projections that we identified may allow sugar detection to be finely localized to the left or right legs, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kirkhart and Scott, 2015</xref>). In contrast, TPN3 responds to bitter taste on the legs and the proboscis, suggesting that aversion to bitter compounds may not require pinpointing location. The organ-specific and modality-specific connectivity of TPNs demonstrates a mechanism to encode taste location in addition to taste quality.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional separation of taste pathways for innate and learned responses</title><p>Feeding initiation begins with the proboscis extension response (PER), a rapid and innate behavior that occurs upon appetitive taste detection. Sensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manzo et al., 2012</xref>), and modulatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marella et al., 2012</xref>) neurons for PER all converge in the SEZ, suggesting that local circuits drive this behavior. Here, we show that activating sugar-sensing TPN1 or TPN2 promotes PER, whereas activating bitter TPN3 inhibits PER. As both TPN2 and TPN3 send axons to the SLP, this suggests that information from the higher brain feeds back onto sensorimotor circuits for PER.</p><p>These TPNs could be primary components of taste circuits or may play modulatory roles without being essential components of PER circuits themselves. Conditional inhibition of synaptic transmission in TPNs had little or no effect on proboscis extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These data argue that TPNs are not essential for proboscis extension and other neurons must contribute to this behavior.</p><p>Although they are not required for proboscis extension, TPN2 and TPN3 are essential for conditioned taste aversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Inhibiting synaptic transmission in sugar-sensing TPN2 during either training or testing decreased conditioned aversion, whereas inhibiting bitter TPN3 decreased aversion only if inhibition occurred during training. These behavioral results are most consistent with the notion that TPN2 carries the CS signal and TPN3 encodes the bitter US. The notion that TPN3 carries the bitter US is further supported by behavioral experiments showing that TPN3 activation is sufficient to replace bitter as the US and by calcium imaging experiments showing that TPN3 activates the PPL1 US punishment neurons that wrap around MB lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Our observation that bitter sensory neurons activate PPL1 when TPN3 is ablated argues that there are additional bitter pathways that lead to PPL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The requirement of TPN3 for conditioned taste aversion but not for PPL1 bitter activation is difficult to reconcile without greater understanding of the underlying pathways for the behavior.</p><p>How does sweet-sensing TPN2 contribute to conditioned aversion? Innate responses to sugar are unimpaired upon TPN2 silencing, whereas conditioned responses are impacted. If TPN2 conveys the sugar CS signal, we would predict that TPN2 transmits information to Kenyon cell dendrites similar to olfactory CS, but we were unable to observe this. Nevertheless, our calcium-imaging data show that TPN2 negatively regulates PPL1 activity, arguing that TPN2 can provide an input into MB circuits, although the significance for conditioned taste aversion behavior is not clear. An additional possibility is that TPN2 might provide a copy of sugar acceptance to the SLP that is then modified downstream of MB learning circuits. Although our studies clearly show that TPNs influence activity in MB inputs, they do not exclude the possibility that TPNs also send signals to additional neurons that act upstream or downstream of MB circuits.</p><p>Here, we show that TPN2 and TPN3, which arborize in the SLP and lateral horn, excite or inhibit MB extrinsic neurons, providing direct evidence for a functional link from TPNs to MB. This is consistent with the view that reciprocal and bidirectional interactions between the SLP and MBs are critical for learned associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Similarities in the logic of sensory processing</title><p>Studies of olfactory projection neurons set the paradigm for sensory processing in the fly brain, with odor representations in the mushroom bodies and lateral horn suggesting segregation of learned and innate pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wong et al., 2002</xref>). Examination of olfactory projection neurons that convey carbon dioxide detection suggested that innate signals for aversion project to the lateral horn and are conveyed to the MBs for context-dependent associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">BrÃ¤cker et al., 2013</xref>). Recent studies of thermosensory processing revealed that different classes of thermosensory projection neurons synapse in the MBs and others in the SLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frank et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). We find that taste projection neurons run parallel to the lateral antennal lobe tract (lALT) similar to a subset of thermosensory and olfactory projection neurons and terminate in the SLP with a few fibers in the lateral horn. The common routing of different sensory modalities to the SLP area suggests that this may be a site of sensory integration or action selection.</p><p>Our studies are consistent with the notion that the SLP is a multimodal sensory area that provides input to mushroom body learning centers. Representations in the SLP may also be modified by MB outputs and may feed back onto innate behavioral programs, like proboscis extension. The observation that the routing of gustatory information shares similarities to olfactory and thermosensory pathways suggests that sensory processing for innate and learned behaviors may be similar across sensory modalities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Flies were raised on standard fly food, except for experiments involving CsChrimson.

Flies were water-satiated before the experiment and in between trials, and presented with the tastant and red light for up to five seconds (or until a PER was observed).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Hugo Bellen as the Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.

In fruit flies, work in the olfactory, visual and gustatory pathways have provided a wealth of insights into how the sensory periphery extracts salient cues, and have exploited largely reflexive behaviors to unravel how this information can guide behavior. However, in the gustatory system, our understanding has been centrally limited by the fact that while genetic tools to characterize primary sensory neurons and output motor neurons have been spectacularly successful, efforts to go deeper into the circuit have met limited success.</p><p>In this work, Kim and colleagues identify and characterize three different types of second order taste projection neurons. By screening a number of Gal4 collections, they establish genetic access to these neurons, show that they have dendrites in close proximity to primary taste receptors, and use calcium imaging to show that these cells are taste responsive. They then use genetic tools to activate or silence synaptic transmission from these cells, and discover that while they are not required for innate, reflexive responses to bitter and sweet compounds, they do play critical roles in learned preferences.</p><p>Overall, the data in this paper are of high quality, and the overall conclusions of this work will be of interest to a broad audience. I am therefore supportive of publication, and have only one point that I would like the authors to respond to, likely in the text of the manuscript. In particular, I am puzzled by the variable, often extended, response latencies of the TPNs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors show stimulus evoked â calcium traces that sometimes only begin to rise above baseline after a period of 1-2 seconds, but can also be &quot;immediate&quot; (compare 3D top sucrose trace with the bottom trace). Conversely, thermal activation of the input neurons invariably produces immediate responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>), a result more in line with my expectation of the response of a second order neuron. While I could imagine that the time traces of sensory stimulation as marked in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> might be somewhat less precise than those of thermal activation, could they really be off by something like two seconds, making this a trivial technical issue? Or is it possible that there is something else of interest here, such as the possibility that processing of natural stimuli might be gated in time depending on the specifics of the trial structure (that is, whether the animal was previously exposed to water or bitter)? Or something else?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Kim et al. identifies three novel classes of taste projection neurons (TPN1-3) that convey gustatory information from primary gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) to other processing stations in the brain. The projection neurons were found in the expression patterns of enhancer fusion Gal4 lines, two of which (i.e. the ones for TPN1 and TPN2) are exquisitely selective, strongly expressing Gal4 only in the TPNs. The third class of projection neuron (TPN3) was identified as a pair of neurons common to two lines that otherwise overlapped little. The authors used these Gal4 lines to characterize the anatomy, projections, gustatory selectivity, functions, and functional connectivity of the three classes of TPNs. The analysis is elegantly presented, the data is compelling, and the conclusions are for the most part novel and of high interest. In particular, the finding that the TPN2 and TPN3 projection neurons are required for the learning and contextualization of gustatory information in a conditioned taste aversion paradigm is of great interest and not only sheds light on how gustatory experience is processed to influence future behavior, but also begins to reveal similarities in the processing streams of different sensory modalities.</p><p>Subsection âTPNs project to Superior Lateral Protocerebrum, near the Lateral Hornâ: The statement that TPN3 axons terminate &quot;exclusively&quot; in the higher brain seems at odds with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1I</xref> which shows anti-syt staining in the SEZ. Do the TPN3 neurons terminate in the SEZ?</p><p>Subsection âTPNs influence but are not required for proboscis extensionâ, last paragraph: The inconsistency referred to presumably is in the differing results obtained with the two TPN3 lines, one of which shows a significant difference and the other one of which doesn't. This, however, is not exactly clear and it would be helpful to have a more explicit explanation of this inconsistency.</p><p>Subsection âTPNs are essential for a learned behavior, conditioned taste aversionâ, first paragraph: I'm not a psychologist, but the description of sugar as a conditioned &quot;appetitive&quot; stimulus doesn't seem right here. Things are already confusing because sweet stimuli elicit robust unconditioned responses and sugar would typically be used as a US in classical conditioning experiments. In the taste aversion paradigm, however, sugar does qualify as a CS because of its acquired aversive properties. My impression is that in psych speak it is thus a &quot;conditioned aversive stimulus&quot; rather than a &quot;conditioned appetitive stimulus,&quot; as stated. I'm more than willing to be wrong, but it is probably worth checking. Also, this distinction might be more than semantics and may be relevant to the failure to find TPN2-mediated activation of the MB calyx.</p><p>Subsection âTPNs are essential for a learned behavior, conditioned taste aversionâ, last paragraph: The loss doesn't seem &quot;complete&quot; in that performance doesn't return to pre-test levels. That is, the responses seem significantly different from 100%. &quot;Substantial&quot; would be a better word than complete. (In this vein, I struggled a bit to understand that the p-values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref> reflected significance tests performed on the data in gray and red for each time point and not differences from 100%. A statement in the figure legend would be helpful.)</p><p>Subsection âManipulating TPN activity during training or testing suggests that TPN3 conveys the bitter US signal and TPN2 conveys the sugar CSâ, second paragraph: Again, the term &quot;completely&quot; seems inaccurate, and should be modified.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>: The data shown in the table for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> seems to actually be for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. (Note, for example, that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> legend says that UAS-cd-tdTom was used to locate arbors, but <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> says the red label is MB-dsRed.) In fact, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> data seems to be missing from the Table and the figure numbers seem to be offset afterwards. This should be fixed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes neurons in the fly that convey gustatory information to the brain to coordinate innate and learned behaviors. The figures are very nice and the story is well reasoned. I do not have major concerns and would support publishing as is.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Sensory neurons detect sweet and bitter tastes. This information is conveyed to higher areas of the brain to direct innate and learned behaviors. This study identifies the first &quot;Taste Projection Neurons&quot; (TPNs) that act between the sensory neurons and higher centers.</p><p>Candidate TPNs were identified by anatomical criteria: proximity followed by GRASP contacts with gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in the legs and proboscis. TPNs 1 and 2 show GCaMP responses to sugar and TPN3 to bitter compounds, and to genetic activation of GRNs.</p><p>Tastes can guide innate responses and learned associations. While the same sensory detectors are required for both behaviors, where the information diverges was unknown. Hunger and sweet taste can evoke proboscis extension (PER) while bitter tastes suppress it. Optogenetic activation of TPN1 or 2 triggers PER but blocking their activity does not inhibit innate PER, suggesting functionally redundant circuits. Blocking TPN2 or 3, however, does block a learned behavior, conditioned taste aversion.</p><p>The authors show that the TPNs project through the same tract as the olfactory projections to the Lateral Horn and Superior Lateral Protocerebrum. The SLP may have connections to the mushroom bodies, brain areas involved in learned associations. Activation of TPN3, the bitter responder, can evoke responses in the MB output PPL1 dopaminergic neurons, consistent with TPN3 carrying the aversive, unconditioned stimulus, while activation of TPN2, a sweet responder, reduces the PPL1 response.</p><p>Interestingly, blocking of TPN3 can affect the conditioned taste aversion behavior but does not fully suppress PPL1 activation in response to bitter taste, suggesting an alternative pathway for the learned response. Also interestingly, the TPN2 down regulation of PPL1 is not the expected mode of action for the sugar-conditioned inputs. There are clearly future experiments to do to explain these observations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23386.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[â¦] Overall, the data in this paper are of high quality, and the overall conclusions of this work will be of interest to a broad audience.

In tarsal (leg) stimulation protocols, the flyâs legs remain free to move and we use a micro-manipulator to manually advance the stimulus while visualizing the stimulus with a USB pen camera. Therefore, tastant presentation time therefore has two major sources of variability: first, the manual nature of our stimulus presentation adds some variability (but only on the order of 100s of ms); second, the flyâs volitional movement adds substantial variability (a fly that happens to be âreachingâ can touch the stimulus much sooner than a fly whose legs are more retracted, certainly adding variability on the scale of 1-2 s). Neither sources of variability are present with the thermal activation (which is initiated with a TTL pulse).

This, however, is not exactly clear and it would be helpful to have a more explicit explanation of this inconsistency.</italic> </p><p>We have edited the results to be more explicit about the inconsistency.</p><p><italic>Subsection âTPNs are essential for a learned behavior, conditioned taste aversionâ, first paragraph: I'm not a psychologist, but the description of sugar as a conditioned &quot;appetitive&quot; stimulus doesn't seem right here. Things are already confusing because sweet stimuli elicit robust unconditioned responses and sugar would typically be used as a US in classical conditioning experiments. In the taste aversion paradigm, however, sugar does qualify as a CS because of its acquired aversive properties. My impression is that in psych speak it is thus a &quot;conditioned aversive stimulus&quot; rather than a &quot;conditioned appetitive stimulus,&quot; as stated. I'm more than willing to be wrong, but it is probably worth checking. Also, this distinction might be more than semantics and may be relevant to the failure to find TPN2-mediated activation of the MB calyx.</italic> </p><p>Agreed, we removed the word âappetitiveâ to eliminate any confusion.</p><p><italic>Subsection âTPNs are essential for a learned behavior, conditioned taste aversionâ, last paragraph: The loss doesn't seem &quot;complete&quot; in that performance doesn't return to pre-test levels. That is, the responses seem significantly different from 100%. &quot;Substantial&quot; would be a better word than complete. (In this vein, I struggled a bit to understand that the p-values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref> reflected significance tests performed on the data in gray and red for each time point and not differences from 100%. A statement in the figure legend would be helpful.)</italic> </p><p><italic>Subsection âManipulating TPN activity during training or testing suggests that TPN3 conveys the bitter US signal and TPN2 conveys the sugar CSâ, second paragraph: Again, the term &quot;completely&quot; seems inaccurate, and should be modified.</italic> </p><p>We changed âcompletelyâ to âsubstantiallyâ for both instances. The figure legend has been modified to be more explicit about the statistical test.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>: The data shown in the table for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> seems to actually be for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. (Note, for example, that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> legend says that UAS-cd-tdTom was used to locate arbors, but <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> says the red label is MB-dsRed.) In fact, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> data seems to be missing from the Table and the figure numbers seem to be offset afterwards. This should be fixed.</italic> </p><p>Thank you! Table has been corrected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[â¦] Interestingly, blocking of TPN3 can affect the conditioned taste aversion behavior but does not fully suppress PPL1 activation in response to bitter taste, suggesting an alternative pathway for the learned response. Also interestingly, the TPN2 down regulation of PPL1 is not the expected mode of action for the sugar-conditioned inputs. There are clearly future experiments to do to explain these observations.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
