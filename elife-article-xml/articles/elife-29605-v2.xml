eradication. The biology of this quiescent form of the parasite is poorly understood which hinders drug discovery. We report a comparative transcriptomic dataset of replicating liver schizonts and dormant hypnozoites of the relapsing parasite <italic>Plasmodium cynomolgi</italic>. Hypnozoites express only 34% of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> physiological pathways, while 91% are expressed in replicating schizonts. Few known malaria drug targets are expressed in quiescent parasites, but pathways involved in microbial dormancy, maintenance of genome integrity and ATP homeostasis were robustly expressed. Several transcripts encoding heavy metal transporters were expressed in hypnozoites and the copper chelator neocuproine was cidal to all liver stage parasites. This transcriptomic dataset is a valuable resource for the discovery of vaccines and effective treatments to combat vivax malaria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>liver stages</kwd><kwd>hypnozoites</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>plasmodium</kwd><kwd>Plasmodium cynomolgi</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roma</surname><given-names>Guglielmo</given-names></name><name><surname>Kocken</surname><given-names>Clemens H M</given-names></name><name><surname>Diagana</surname><given-names>Thierry Tidiane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004167</institution-id><institution>Medicines for Malaria Venture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kocken</surname><given-names>Clemens H M</given-names></name><name><surname>Diagana</surname><given-names>Thierry Tidiane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kocken</surname><given-names>Clemens H M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diagana</surname><given-names>Thierry Tidiane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>This comprehensive transcriptomic resource of dormant and replicating malaria liver parasites highlights the dearth of pathways that operate in the hypnozoites and the need to investigate druggability (i.e. selectivity and safety) of core pathways in malaria parasites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> (<italic>P. vivax</italic>) is the major cause of malaria outside of Africa with an estimated 13.8 million malaria cases globally in 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">World Health Organization (WHO), 2015</xref>). Among <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasites’ most salient biological features are the persisting dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) that can cause relapse infections and compromise future eradication programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campo et al., 2015</xref>). Although in vitro hepatic cultures systems for hypnozoite-forming parasites have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">March et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zeeman et al., 2014</xref>) and rodent models of humanized liver stage infections constituted recent advances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mikolajczak et al., 2015</xref>), the search for new drugs targeting hypnozoites is hampered by our limited knowledge of this enigmatic dormant stage.</p><p>Microbes commonly employ cellular quiescence to survive environmental stresses such as starvation, immune surveillance, or chemotherapeutic interventions and for disease causing microbes, dormancy often underlies chronic infections that considerably complicate the clinical management of infected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rittershaus et al., 2013</xref>). Cellular quiescence generally requires a physiological response underscored by a global repression of cellular metabolism but the preservation of mitochondrial respiration for ATP homeostasis and the maintenance of genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rittershaus et al., 2013</xref>). Therapeutic interventions targeting some of these mechanisms have been proposed for a limited number of human pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andries et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rao et al., 2008</xref>) but it is not clear whether <italic>P. vivax</italic> hypnozoites rely on similar physiological responses to survive in hepatocytes.</p><p>Some of the new drug targets that have been identified in the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McNamara and Winzeler, 2011</xref>) have been shown to be critical in multiple stages of the parasite life cycle, such as PI4K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McNamara et al., 2013</xref>), DHODH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Phillips et al., 2015</xref>), eEF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baragaña et al., 2015</xref>), and pheT-RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kato et al., 2016</xref>). However, none has yet been shown to be a valid target for malaria radical cure and elimination of the hypnozoite in vivo. Little is known about the expression pattern of these drug targets during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> life cycle in the liver and more specifically, it is not clear whether these genes are expressed at all in dormant parasites.</p><p>Transcriptomics approaches to assess genome-wide gene expression levels of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> liver stage parasites are inherently challenging given the low infection grade ratios and the higher abundance of host cell transcripts. While previous reports have emerged providing a first glance of gene expression in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> liver stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cubi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vaughan et al., 2009</xref>), we provide here a comprehensive dataset derived from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged <italic>Plasmodium cynomolgi</italic> (<italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Voorberg-van der Wel et al., 2013</xref>) — the nonhuman primate sister taxon of <italic>P. vivax,</italic> known to form hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dembélé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krotoski et al., 1982</xref>). We have collected samples from multiple independent in vitro hepatocyte infections, containing thousands of purified hypnozoites and liver schizonts for RNA-Seq. The sequenced reads were mapped on the new high quality, completely annotated <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> genome covering 7178 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pasini et al., 2017</xref>). Using different approaches, we provide some preliminary validation of our comparative analysis of the transcriptome of replicating and quiescent liver-stages parasites that will constitute a valuable resource for the development of <italic>P. vivax</italic> vaccines and therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hypnozoites express a smaller set of genes than schizonts</title><p>Six to seven days after <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> sporozoite infection of primary simian hepatocytes, we FACS-purified hepatocytes containing hypnozoites and liver schizonts and prepared RNA for high-throughput sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). After quality control, we excluded three samples due to their low number of parasite reads, resulting in a dataset containing three independent schizont samples and four independent hypnozoite samples for analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To quantify parasite-specific expression for each <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> gene, we determined the number of sequencing reads aligned to genes and computed gene expression values as the number of Fragments Per Kilobase per Million fragments mapped (FPKM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schuierer and Roma, 2016</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref> respectively provide the list of reference genomes used and the analysis statistics. Overall, the raw gene expression values of the schizont samples are ~14 fold higher than those of the hypnozoite samples (<italic>p</italic>-value 1.1e-3). This global difference in gene expression between multi-nucleated schizonts and uni-nuclear hypnozoites could be partly attributed to differences in the number of parasite transcriptionally active units per hepatocyte, however it is not possible to determine this exact number. In order to account for this difference, we normalized the gene expression values against the total number of host reads per sample which we posit to represent a constant host RNA content across all samples (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). All data reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> show FPKM values after such normalization. A threshold of FPKM greater than one is deemed equivalent to one transcript copy per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mortazavi et al., 2008</xref>). Using this threshold, hypnozoites generally express a lower number of genes compared to schizonts (respectively, 3308 vs 5702 genes at average FPKM per group ≥1). In addition, the expression level of these genes in schizonts is higher than in hypnozoites (average expression 89.14 and 9.88 FPKM, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To further validate this finding, we carried out RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) to quantitatively evaluate the expression of abundantly expressed genes at the single-cell level in liver stage cultures. In agreement with the RNA-Seq results, the RNA-FISH staining with probes for <italic>gapdh</italic> and <italic>hsp70</italic> showed a markedly lower level in hypnozoites compared to schizonts’ expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29605.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptomics of relapsing malaria liver stage parasites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of experimental approach for purification and RNA-sequencing of cultured <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> M malaria liver stage schizonts (Sz) and hypnozoites (Hz).

The schizonts data from Cubi <italic>et al</italic>. showed a high correlation of 0.95 and a large consensus between the two replicates, which compared with a slightly lower but equally high correlation (average correlation 0.88) and high overlap between the triplicates profiled in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In stark contrast, while gene expression data reported here showed a high concordance between the four biological replicates of hypnozoites (average correlation 0.68) and a large overlap of 2804 out of 4198 genes expressed in at least two samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), the data from Cubi <italic>et al.</italic> showed a lower correlation for the two hypnozoite samples (correlation of 0.38; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and a scarse consensus between the two replicates (204 out of 1147 genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of these 204 genes, 175 overlap with at least one of our hypnozoite samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and can thus be considered true hypnozoite transcripts. Compared to the here reported 2804 hypnozoite transcripts, this indicates that many genes and pathways expressed in hypnozoites were not captured in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cubi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although the transcription level in hypnozoites appears to be generally reduced, we found evidence that there is ongoing active transcription in hypnozoites, up to day 7, as demonstrated by the positive staining with antibodies recognizing the acetylated H4K8 protein, a marker of open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, when compared to proliferating liver schizonts, ‘dormant’ hypnozoites express only less than half of the parasite genome and the rate of transcription of individual genes also appears to be very low.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Comparative transcriptomic analysis allows the identification of differential markers of <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> liver stages</title><p>We further explored the liver stage transcriptomes to identify those genes with significantly different expression levels between hypnozoites and schizonts (&gt;2 fold-change absolute value, 10% false discovery rate (FDR); <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Our results indicate that the expression of only a dozen genes might be enhanced in quiescent hypnozoites as compared to growing liver schizonts, while the expression of thousands of genes is significantly lower in hypnozoites than in schizonts. To determine whether protein expression follows the RNA differential expression observed, we selected a few genes that were upregulated in either stage and raised antibodies against recombinant predicted proteins. Using these antibodies, we then performed immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) on cultured liver stages.</p><p>Unexpectedly, antibodies against PcyM_0533600 (ETRAMP, amino acids Q30-K145), one of the most up-regulated genes in the hypnozoite samples, failed to detect the protein in day 6 <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> liver stage parasites. The same antibodies strongly reacted with <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> blood parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) but failed to detect the protein in sporozoites (data not shown). Sequence analysis of RT-PCR products from different parasite stages revealed that only blood stage parasites express the predicted full-length PcyM_0533600 mRNA, while alternatively spliced transcripts (including premature stop codons) were found in sporozoite, schizont, and hypnozoite samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), explaining our inability to detect the predicted protein in these stages.</p><p>To further validate our dataset, antibodies were raised against three other proteins, PcyM_0515400 (HSP70), PcyM_1419800 (Ferredoxin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miotto et al., 2015</xref>) and PcyM_1442700 (Glideosome Associated Protein GAP45). These antibodies did react with <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> day six liver stage parasites showing staining of liver schizonts (Ferredoxin), primarily hypnozoites (GAP45) or both schizonts and hypnozoites (HSP70), mirroring precisely the RNA-seq data for these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Antibodies against GAP45, an inner membrane complex (IMC) marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kono et al., 2012</xref>) and a member of the glideosome motor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harding and Meissner, 2014</xref>), stained the periphery of 6 days old hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> middle and lower panels). In contrast, the staining pattern in schizonts was weaker and sparsely distributed (early schizonts) or absent (large mature schizonts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> middle panel). These data concur with previous reports describing the progressive loss of the IMC during conversion of the motile sporozoite into a replication-competent metabolically active liver stage form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jayabalasingham et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, we could still detect GAP45 in hypnozoites at day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The long-term presence of GAP45 may be due to low protein turnover in hypnozoites or a functional requirement of this protein for hypnozoite maintenance. Taken together the RNA-FISH and immunofluorescence experiments confirmed the general trends we observed in the RNA-seq dataset and we anticipate that further mining of this gene list will yield differential markers of schizont development and hypnozoite maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Hypnozoites express few core pathways including the physiological hallmarks of dormancy</title><p>To investigate the physiology of <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> liver stages, we performed a pathway analysis in schizonts and hypnozoites. Through orthology mapping, <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> genes were assigned to 257 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aurrecoechea et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">7</xref>). Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses highlighted that hypnozoites express genes related to translation, RNA processing and epigenetic processes (<italic>e.g.</italic> histone acetylation and methylation) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). These pathways and processes were also enriched in the schizonts, which however expressed more processes related to the cell nucleus, hinting at the differences in transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). Schizonts clearly express a much higher number of pathways than hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Of all the pathways included in this analysis, only ~34% (88 out of 257 pathways) express more than half of their constituent genes above the threshold of 1 FPKM in the hypnozoite while the equivalent is true for ~91% (233 out of 257) of the pathways in schizonts. In the schizonts, energy and glucose metabolism pathways, such as pentose phosphate cycle enzymes, CoA biosynthesis pathways and mannose/fructose metabolism are all highly expressed with nearly all genes in those pathways detected above 1 FPKM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, those pathways are nearly absent in the hypnozoite, which is consistent with the quiescence and low metabolism that may be expected in dormant forms.</p><p>Interestingly, some but not all erythrocytic invasion pathways are expressed only in schizonts, suggesting that already at day six the parasites express some of the genes required for merozoite function and red blood cell invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Hypnozoites mostly express core housekeeping pathways such as those involved with nucleus and chromatin maintenance, transcription, translation and mitochondrial respiration, but no DNA replication enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, genes known to be required for ATP homeostasis in non-replicating dormant <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rao et al., 2008</xref>), such as various components of the F0-F1 ATPase complex, are similarly significantly expressed in hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Collectively, our analyses reveal that hypnozoites express pathways previously associated with quiescence and required for the maintenance of chromosome integrity and ATP homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Expression pattern of potential drug targets in <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> liver stages</title><p>In the liver schizonts and hypnozoites transcriptomic dataset, we looked at the expression FPKM values for clinically and chemically validated drug targets (reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). While all drug targets are expressed in the schizonts above the threshold level of 1 FPKM, only a few of them are detectable above this level in the hypnozoites. For example, we could not detect PI4K transcripts in day six hypnozoites while this gene is abundantly expressed in schizonts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which is consistent with previously published data on <italic>Plasmodium</italic> PI4K inhibitors having prophylactic but not radical curative activity in the <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeeman et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the antifolate drug target DHFR is detectable above 1 FPKM in hypnozoites, yet antifolates do not exhibit radical cure in the <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmidt et al., 1982</xref>). Likewise, DHODH, the target of the clinical candidate DSM265, is detectable in hypnozoites while this compound shows poor activity against hypnozoites in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Phillips et al., 2015</xref>). Although the <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> ATP4 ortholog, the clinically validated target of KAE609, is detectable in schizonts at low level, it is not critical as PfATP4 inhibitors are not active in liver stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiménez-díazDíaz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rottmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vaidya et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it appears that function could not be directly inferred from the liver stages expression data.</p><p><italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite survival and replication depends on the import of nutrients and solutes from its host cell and some transporters have been proposed to be tractable drug targets for malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hapuarachchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Slavic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weiner and Kooij, 2016</xref>). Consistently, we observe high FPKM values for a broad range of transporters in both liver schizonts (35 putative transporters with FPKM values &gt; 10) and hypnozoites (seven transporters with FPKM values &gt; 10 and 25 transporters with FPKM values &gt; 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). Heavy metal homeostasis has been shown to be critical to liver stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kenthirapalan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sahu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stahel et al., 1988</xref>) development and consistently we found several heavy metal transporters to be expressed in all liver stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Remarkably, two putative copper transporters (PcyM_1331900 and PcyM_1277100) showed high FPKM values for both liver stage schizonts and hypnozoites (highlighted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting a role for copper homeostasis in liver stage development and quiescence. To determine whether copper was critical to <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> liver stages, we treated infected hepatocytes with a copper chelator, neocuproine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choveaux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kenthirapalan et al., 2014</xref>). Neocuproine treatment, initiated 1–2 hr after infection with sporozoites and continued for 6 days, indeed showed pronounced cidal effects on the viability of both liver schizonts and hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) at the highest concentration tested. In one of the three assays we noted a limited effect on hepatocyte viability at this concentration, as concluded from from hepatocyte nuclei counts in the analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). These data provide some preliminary chemical validation of the hypothesis that copper homeostasis may be critical for schizonts replication and hypnozoites survival.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Because malaria liver stage parasites are more difficult to culture in vitro, the parasite hepatic life cycle has been neglected and our collective knowledge of those stages remains sparse. The need for new pre-erythrocytic vaccination strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Longley et al., 2015</xref>) and novel drug therapies to combat relapsing malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campo et al., 2015</xref>), recently fueled much interest for further investigations of the biology of liver stage parasites. As a significant contribution to these efforts, we report here a comprehensive comparative transcriptomics dataset of both developing and dormant liver stage <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> malaria parasites. Using this dataset, we identified two protein markers that differentiate quiescent from actively dividing parasites and demonstrate that copper homeostasis is critically required for <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> parasites replication and survival in hepatocytes. It is our hope that through multi-disciplinary collaborative efforts the research community will further mine this dataset to gain further insights in the biology of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> dormancy.</p><p>Recently, a first <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> hypnozoite transcriptomic dataset has been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cubi et al., 2017</xref>), which reports about 120 differentially expressed genes of which 69 are more than 3-fold upregulated, while we report here a much smaller number of upregulated genes in hypnozoites. It is important to note that Cubi <italic>et al.</italic> applied a uniform normalization that assumes that signals from different samples should be scaled to have the same median or average value thus not taking into account the size differences of replicating and dormant liver stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mikolajczak et al., 2015</xref>). This could have potentially biased their comparative analysis towards an over-estimation of the gene expression levels in hypnozoites. In contrast, we applied a group-wise normalization to the expression data in order to keep the expected difference in absolute level of gene expression between schizont and hypnozoite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s3sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 3—source data 1</xref>). Cubi <italic>et al.</italic> proposed that the gene PCYB_102390 (PcyM_1014300 in our dataset) encodes an ApiAP2 transcription factor AP2-Q (for quiescence) which could act as a master regulator of the hypnozoite fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cubi et al., 2017</xref>). However even after normalization, we failed to detect expression of this gene in four hypnozoite samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notwithstanding we detected transcripts for nine other Api-AP2 genes in hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). None of the AP-AP2 genes, including PcyM_1014300, are, however, exclusive for relapsing malarias, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cubi et al., 2017</xref>). Only further functional characterization, like the studies that revealed the role of the AP2-G and AP2-G2 genes in gametocyte commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>), will reveal the possible role of these AP2 transcription factors in hypnozoite identity and survival.</p><p>We have previously shown that hypnozoite physiology evolves over time and while PI4 kinase (PI4K) inhibitors are protective when administered shortly after the initial malaria liver infection, they fail to radically cure monkeys when administered several days after parasite inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeeman et al., 2016</xref>). In agreement with our previous reports, we found that at least as early as day six post-infection, the <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> PI4K gene is not expressed in hypnozoites. The current in vitro liver stage drug assays cannot distinguish compounds only active against developing hypnozoites from those with activity against established hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeeman et al., 2016</xref>). The identification of markers specific to established hypnozoites would inform the design of parasites with transgenic reporter genes that would greatly assist the development of in vitro drug screening platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campo et al., 2015</xref>). We found few upregulated genes in hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) and unfortunately the most highly differentially expressed gene, PcyM_0533600, a member of the <italic>etramp</italic> family, was not translated in hypnozoites and sporozoites. The presence of such unproductive alternatively spliced transcripts in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is not uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sorber et al., 2011</xref>) and translational repression, including that of a member of the etramp family, UIS4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Silvie et al., 2014</xref>), has been shown to be involved in transitions between developmental stages of the life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lasonder et al., 2016</xref>). We showed nonetheless that the comparative transcriptomic dataset from this work can help select suitable proteins to produce monoclonal antibodies that differentially label specific liver stages. Further experiments are ongoing to expand the malaria liver stage research toolbox with selective and specific antibodies for replicating and quiescent liver stages.</p><p>Dormancy is a physiological response which is relevant to various chronic human infectious diseases and shared by a wide range of pathogens expressing physiological hallmarks characteristic of microbial quiescence. Our dataset suggests that several of these hallmarks are present in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> hypnozoite—namely the maintenance of membrane potential, ATP biosynthesis and preservation of genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rittershaus et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, pathway analysis reveals that most mitochondrial electron flow genes and ATP production enzymes are robustly expressed in hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, nucleus and chromatin maintenance genes are highly expressed in hypnozoites, and while canonical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA-repair pathways are not present in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gardner et al., 2002</xref>), we detected most of the homologous recombination repair (HR) enzymes as well as genes required for the maintenance of epigenetics marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the transcriptomics data together with the FISH validation experiments, suggest that hypnozoites display a significant reduction in transcriptional rate both qualitatively and quantitatively which is another hallmark of quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). All of these physiological hallmarks do theoretically provide proven therapeutic approaches for killing quiescent organisms with the targeting of pathogens’ RNA polymerase(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sala et al., 2010</xref>), proton-motive force enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andries et al., 2005</xref>) and DNA repair or epigenetic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dembélé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sala et al., 2010</xref>). Establishing selective inhibition of these essential physiological processes in the parasite without significant toxicity to the host cells will be the key challenge for such approaches to be successful.</p><p>In order to survive, malaria parasites utilize membrane transport proteins that allow the uptake of nutrients, disposal of waste products and maintenance of ion homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weiner and Kooij, 2016</xref>). While some of these transporters have been implicated in drug resistance, recent experimental work has also supported their potential as anti-malarial drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weiner and Kooij, 2016</xref>). Recent evidence has emerged for important roles of heavy metal homeostasis in sporozoite transmission and liver-stage development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kenthirapalan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sahu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Slavic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stahel et al., 1988</xref>).

We report here that <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> liver stage parasites express transporters for heavy-metals, including copper that in these preliminary experiments seems to be crucially needed for liver stages. Targeting such essential import pathways will again require selective inhibition of the parasite transporters for such approaches to be viable therapeutically.</p><p>Taken together the RNA-seq data indicate that drug target liver stage expression is necessary but clearly not sufficient for an inhibitor to show anti-parasitic liver stage activity. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), the target of Fosmidomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Umeda et al., 2011</xref>), and the Elongation Factor 2 (eEF2), the target of the recently discovered drug candidate DDD107498 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baragaña et al., 2015</xref>), are both expressed in the hypnozoite at day 6. This may warrant further investigations of the potential of these compounds for vivax malaria radical cure. Although we did not identify pathways or drug targets specific to hypnozoites, our data collectively show that the hypnozoite expresses a core set of genes required for its basic cellular function. Identifying those essential functions that could be safely targeted with small molecule inhibitors should reveal the Achilles’ heel of the elusive hypnozoite.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Nonhuman primates were used because no other models (in vitro or in vivo) were suitable for the aims of this project. The local independent ethical committee constituted conform Dutch law (BPRC Dier Experimenten Commissie, DEC) approved the research protocol (agreement number DEC# 708) prior to the start and the experiments were all performed according to Dutch and European laws. The Council of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC International) has awarded BPRC full accreditation. Thus, BPRC is fully compliant with the international demands on animal studies and welfare as set forth by the European Council Directive 2010/63/EU, and Convention ETS 123, including the revised Appendix A as well as the ‘Standard for humane care and use of Laboratory Animals by Foreign institutions’ identification number A5539-01, provided by the Department of Health and Human Services of the United States of America’s National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Dutch implementing legislation. The rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, either gender, age 4–7 years, Indian or mixed origin) used in this study were captive-bred and socially housed. Animal housing was according to international guidelines for nonhuman primate care and use. Besides their standard feeding regime, and drinking water ad libitum via an automatic watering system, the animals followed an environmental enrichment program in which, next to permanent and rotating non-food enrichment, an item of food-enrichment was offered to the macaques daily. All animals were monitored daily for health and discomfort. All intravenous injections and large blood collections were performed under ketamine sedation, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Liver lobes were collected from monkeys that were euthanized in the course of unrelated studies (ethically approved by the BPRC DEC) or euthanized for medical reasons, as assessed by a veterinarian. Therefore, none of the animals from which liver lobes were derived were specifically used for this work, according to the 3Rrule thereby reducing the numbers of animals used. Euthanasia was performed under ketamine sedation (10 mg/kg) and was induced by intracardiac injection of euthasol 20%, containing pentobarbital.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Transgenic <italic>Plasmodium cynomolgi</italic> sporozoite production</title><p>Blood stage infections were initiated in rhesus monkeys by intravenous injection of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> M strain PcyC-PAC-GFP<sub>hsp70</sub>-mCherry<sub>ef1α</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Voorberg-van der Wel et al., 2013</xref>) parasites from a cryopreserved stock.

Prior to sorting, cells were passed through a 100 µM cell strainer to exclude clumps. First, a sample of uninfected hepatocytes was analysed to enable gate settings. Subsequently, infected hepatocytes were sorted with a BD FACSAria flowcytometer equipped with a 488 nm Coherent Sapphire solid state 20 mW Laser. Data analyses were performed using FlowJo Version 9.4.10 (TreeStar, Inc., Ashland OR, USA). The device was equipped with a 100 µM nozzle for sorting. Gate settings were essentially the same as reported previously, except that an extra gate ('GFPdim') was included to ensure a strict separation of 'GFPlow' and 'GFPhigh' parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Sorted samples were collected in 300 µl Trizol (Invitrogen). For the series of experiments relating to this paper, we performed six blood stage infections. In two out of six blood stage infections, parasitemia was low (&lt;0.2%) at the time of mosquito feeding. This resulted in poor sporozoite yields and not enough liver stage forms for FACSsort.

All samples were stored in TRIzol (Invitrogen) and total RNA extracted using the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) including on-column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA amplification was performed using the TargetAmp 2-Round aRNA Amplification Kit 2.0 (Epicentre, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). The quality of the RNA samples (before and after the amplification) was assessed with the RNA 6000 Pico and Nano kits using the Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). RNA-seq cDNA libraries were prepared from the amplified RNA samples using the TruSeq mRNA Sample Prep kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).

On average, a range of 38% (minimum) to 84% (maximum) of total reads were mapped to the parasite and host genomes, and between 17% and 65% were aligned to the parasite and host exons (expressed reads). A QC inspection of the aligned sequencing reads showed an expected coverage bias towards the 3’ end of the transcripts that is due to the use of the amplification kit.

The correlation plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref> were generated on log10 normalized CPMs after the addition of a pseudo-count of 0.1. The Venn diagram plots were generated on genes expressed above the cut-off of 1 FPKM in the hypnozoite and schizont samples, and drawn using the on line tool available at the following website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/.">http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/.</ext-link></p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Data availability</title><p>The raw RNA-sequencing reads are available in the NCBI Short Read Archive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra</ext-link>) under accession number SRP096160.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Giovanni D’Ario for bioinformatic support, Els Klooster, Richard Vervenne, Nicole van der Werff and Niels Beenhakker for technical assistance and Francisca van Hassel for preparing graphical representations, and Martin Beibel for statistical support.

The local independent ethical committee constituted conform Dutch law (BPRC Dier Experimenten Commissie, DEC) approved the research protocol (agreement number DEC# 708) prior to the start and the experiments were all performed according to Dutch and European laws. The Council of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC International) has awarded BPRC full accreditation. Thus, BPRC is fully compliant with the international demands on animal studies and welfare as set forth by the European Council Directive 2010/63/EU, and Convention ETS 123, including the revised Appendix A as well as the 'Standard for humane care and use of Laboratory Animals by Foreign institutions' identification number A5539-01, provided by the Department of Health and Human Services of the United States of America's National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Dutch implementing legislation. The rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta, either gender, age 4-7 years, Indian or mixed origin) used in this study were captive-bred and socially housed. Animal housing was according to international guidelines for nonhuman primate care and use. Besides their standard feeding regime, and drinking water ad libitum via an automatic watering system, the animals followed an environmental enrichment program in which, next to permanent and rotating non-food enrichment, an item of food-enrichment was offered to the macaques daily. All animals were monitored daily for health and discomfort. All intravenous injections and large blood collections were performed under ketamine sedation, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Liver lobes were collected from monkeys that were euthanized in the course of unrelated studies (ethically approved by the BPRC DEC) or euthanized for medical reasons, as assessed by a veterinarian. Therefore, none of the animals from which liver lobes were derived were specifically used for this work, according to the 3Rrule thereby reducing the numbers of animals used. Euthanasia was performed under ketamine sedation (10 mg/kg) and was induced by intracardiac injection of euthasol 20%, containing pentobarbital.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6"

The information contained in the manuscript provides a valuable set of tools and genomic resource of dormant malaria liver parasites that will be instrumental for the identification of drug targets for hypnozoites. The datasets generated are cautiously curated and analyzed with a clear explanation of the methods used.

This study is of interest because relapsing malaria parasites, such as <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>, form a small, non-replicating dormant form of the parasite in the liver called hypnozoite that can reactivate and initiate relapsing malaria infection. The authors report the transcriptomes of replicating schizonts and persisting hypnozoites, which they are able to differentially separate using FACS sorting and a transgenic parasite strain expressing GFP. They identify several pathways expressed in the hypnozoite and validate expression of a few genes both by RNA FISH and translation at the protein level using antibodies. Interestingly, two copper transporters were robustly expressed in the hypnozoite as well as schizont. Treating cultures with a copper chelator reduced the number of hypnozoites and schizonts in a dose-dependent manner when dosed prophylactically. While the work presented is important to the malaria field, the authors do not identify any transcripts specific to the hypnozoite. Furthermore, a <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> hypnozoite transcriptome has already been published recently (Cubi et al. 2017). Therefore, the work might be suitable for a more specialized journal.</p><p>1) To identify differentially expressed genes in <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> schizonts compared to hypnozoites the authors normalized the RNAseq FPKM's to the amount of host RNA present in the host hepatocyte because schizonts have many more genome copies and as such many more transcriptionally active units than hypnozoites. There are three major concerns with this method. 1) Schizonts will all have differing numbers of transcriptionally active units dependent on maturation stage. 2) It is expected that dramatic changes will occur between day 6 and 7 timepoints of analysis) during the schizont life cycle as the parasite prepares for segmentation and cytokinesis. 3) Most importantly, the quantity of host hepatocyte RNA is expected to be dramatically different in hypnozoite-infected hepatocyte versus a massive schizont-infected hepatocyte, with the latter containing much less host RNA. In consequence, any claims about transcriptional repression in hypnozoites cannot be supported by the data and should be removed from the manuscript or a convincing analytical strategy should be presented that fully supports the conclusions.</p><p>2) The authors next conduct FISH to support their differential transcript abundance analysis conclusions drawn from RNAseq data. There are two issues with the FISH conclusions. First, FISH is not a quantitative method and in consequence cannot validate quantitative conclusions from RNAseq. Second, even if FISH would allow quantitative analysis, the schizont versus hypnozoite comparison is problematic in that the former contains thousands of transcriptionally active genome copies whilst the latter contains one active genome copy.</p><p>3) Do the genes listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> meet any criteria for being differentially expressed? For example, an FDR or FC cutoff? If not, this analysis should be included. Do the authors expect the reported number of genes to be expressed in the liver stages of the parasite and are the transcripts not identified in either liver form expressed in blood stage schizonts?</p><p>4) For the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> pathway expression analysis, were any of the pathways determined to be significantly expressed? That is, are the pathways identified in the hypnozoite significantly expressed in hypnozoites compared to other pathways and are those pathways differentially present compared to schizonts? The statistical significance of the enriched pathways should be determined and reported.</p><p>5) Much of the authors’ results are contradictory to a recently published <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> liver stage transcriptome study (Cubi et al., 2017). It is important to give an honest assessment regarding the root causes for these discrepancies. Also move the comparative analysis into the Results section and discuss in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent paper that describes a significant advance in malaria relapse biology, through the description of the transcriptome of replicating and dormant liver stages of the monkey malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium cynomolgi</italic>. Although this is not the first study to undertake a transcriptome analysis of purported hypnozoites, it represents a significant body or work and set of tools and genomic resources that has the potential to accelerate discovery of antimalarial drugs that target the hypnozoite. <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> is an excellent model system for the study of the <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> hypnozoite because of the degree of biological and genomic similarity between the species.</p><p>1) The authors mention that their work represents a second such analysis of the hypnozoite transcriptome, since the first analysis performed using laser capture and using the same strain of Pcynomolgi was published by Cubi et al. earlier this year. A direct comparison of the 120 transcripts described in that study with the transcripts identified in this study as a supplementary table in the Results section of the paper, and not just as a paragraph in the Discussion, would be very useful and contextualize the findings.</p><p>2) How can the authors distinguish between Pcyno-infected liver cells that never matured into schizonts and/or dying trophozoites, and hypnozoites? Because such parasite stages could complicate the differences seen in the transcripts between hypnozoites and schizonts. Is there a control analysis that could be used for this?</p><p>3) Some description of the success rate of the various infections would be really informative. For example, how many Pcyno infections of primary simian hepatocytes were done and how many successful? What was the approximate yield of Sz and Hz after cell sorting? Also, for each biological replicate, what was the concordance in identified transcripts, i.e. how much overlap between the replicates?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29605.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Several comprehensive transcriptomic analyses have been performed and reported on all malaria stages, however this has been more problematic for the hardly accessible hypnozoite stage.

These experiments present a number of methodological challenges, one of which being that drug treatment is likely to result in a rapid developmental arrest that will reduce the number of cells available at day 7. As a result it might be difficult to extract interpretable RNAseq data that could be compared to the available dataset. Nonetheless we believe it is a good suggestion and this could be the scope of additional follow-up studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data on copper chelator neocuproine was cidal to all liver stage parasites is preliminary and would deserve more robust investigation towards eradication of hypnozoites.</p></disp-quote><p>To further substantiate the neocuproine data we have now included the data of a third separate neocuproine drug test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We did these drug tests with the copper chelator neocuproine, because the high FPKM values in the RNAseq dataset for two putative copper transporters in both hypnozoites and schizonts suggested a role for copper in liver stage biology. Indeed the results show cidal activity of neocuproine in line with an important role for copper homeostasis in the liver stages. We included these data as a chemical validation step of the RNAseq data, which illustrates how our RNAseq data may point to biological processes important for hypnozoites. We feel that further validation of this compound as a drug for the elimination of hypnozoites is out of scope of this paper. We agree with the reviewer that indeed that would require much more drug testing at different time points and careful testing of toxicity both in vitro an in vivo.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> is updated; legend amended; Text in manuscript updated (subsection “Expression pattern of potential drug targets in <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> liver stages”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript describes the transcriptomes of P. cynomolgi liver stages grown in primary Simian hepatocytes.

In consequence, any claims about transcriptional repression in hypnozoites cannot be supported by the data and should be removed from the manuscript or a convincing analytical strategy should be presented that fully supports the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer expressed some legitimate concerns regarding the robustness of our claim of an intrinsically lower level of transcriptional activity for the hypnozoite. We recognize that there are confounders that substantially complicate the differential comparison of the transcriptome of the liver stages (e.g. higher number of transcriptional units in the schizont, heterogeneity of schizonts population in terms of number of nuclei). For that reason, we have indeed refrained to perform an extensive analysis of the relative changes in expression between schizont and hypnozoite and instead chose to describe the data as atlas of the genes expressed (or not) in schizonts and hypnozoites, rather than inferring functional role for genes based on their differential expression in liver-stages.</p><p>We found that 78.4% of the total RNA-seq reads of schizont-infected hepatocytes map to the host genome while 98.3% do so for the hypnozoite-infected hepatocytes. Because it is not possible to determine the actual number of active transcriptional units in the schizont and in order to control for the lower RNA content in the hypnozoite which could possibly be attributed to its lower number of transcriptional units, we decided to take a very conservative normalization approach and normalize the data against the host RNA content (a similar approach has been proposed by Westermann et al., PLoS Pathog. 2017). This approach is based on two main assumptions, first we assume that we capture the RNA content of a single host cell with each FACS event and second that the total RNA content of a host cell does not differ significantly between cells that are infected either with a schizont or a hypnozoite.</p><p>The reviewer states that the schizont-infected hepatocytes express much less host RNA. We are aware of relative changes in host cell gene expression upon infection and as the parasite matures in the hepatocytes as reported in several studies (<underline>PMC3619000</underline>, <underline>PMC4096771</underline> and <underline>PMID:17981117</underline>), but to our knowledge there are no report of changes in total RNA content in response to the different developmental stages of the parasite in the hepatocyte. After normalization we found the average gene expression in the hypnozoite to be lower than in the schizont and we were able to confirm the general directionality of these observations using RNA-FISH.</p><p>To recognize the caveats highlighted by this reviewer, we have acknowledged all of those throughout the revised manuscript and soften the statement we made regarding the lower level of transcription observed in the hypnozoites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors next conduct FISH to support their differential transcript abundance analysis conclusions drawn from RNAseq data. There are two issues with the FISH conclusions. First, FISH is not a quantitative method and in consequence cannot validate quantitative conclusions from RNAseq. Second, even if FISH would allow quantitative analysis, the schizont versus hypnozoite comparison is problematic in that the former contains thousands of transcriptionally active genome copies whilst the latter contains one active genome copy.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer suggests that FISH is not a quantitative method. We would like to point out that there are many methods for performing FISH, each with different characteristics (reviewed in Gaspar I, Ephrussi A. Strength in numbers: quantitative single‐molecule RNA detection assays. Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews Developmental Biology. 2015;4(2):135-150.)</p><p>We have chosen an RNA-FISH technology, RNAscope from Advanced Cell Diagnostics, which has been validated as a quantitative method by Battich et al., who has performed RNAscope FISH analysis of more than 900 different human transcripts (Battich N et al. Image-based transcriptomics in thousands of single human cells at single-molecule resolution. Nat. Methods 2013 Nov; 10 (11):112733.). Battich et al. compared the quantities of most transcripts detected by RNAscope and showed excellent correlation with those obtained by RNAseq.</p><p>As stated above we have taken a conservative approach and chosen to perform a group-wise normalization procedure for the RNAseq data and the FPKM values after normalization procedure seem to generally agree with our FISH data. Indeed, the observed differences in RNA levels between schizonts and hypnozoites may be due to differences in cell size, differences in transcriptional units and/or by repression of transcription in (dormant) hypnozoites. As we cannot distinguish between these, we have now changed the wording in the revised manuscript to highlight those possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Do the genes listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> meet any criteria for being differentially expressed? For example, an FDR or FC cutoff? If not, this analysis should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the questions as they highlighted the need for us to be more specific on the content of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>. The previous version of this table presented the results of the differential analysis of all <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> genes regardless of whether their changes of expression were significant or not. In another words, all genes were listed in the table also those which did not meet the criteria for being differentially expressed. Now, we modified <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> to list only genes that meet the criteria to be differentially expressed between hypnozoites and liver schizonts using a cut-off of &gt;2 fold change absolute value and a 10% false discovery rate.</p><p>See revised <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the authors expect the reported number of genes to be expressed in the liver stages of the parasite and are the transcripts not identified in either liver form expressed in blood stage schizonts?</p></disp-quote><p>To answer the second question: since these genes are found to be differentially expressed between hypnozoites and liver schizonts, they ought to be expressed in at least one liver stage (if not both). For completeness, along with the fold change and the p-value, for each differentially expressed gene we now report the average expression levels (e.g. avg FPKMs) in hypnozoites and liver schizonts with the scope to clarify whether the genes are expressed in one or both liver stages. Unfortunately we cannot report the expression levels of the same genes in the blood stage schizonts as we have not sequenced these samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For the Plasmodium pathway expression analysis, were any of the pathways determined to be significantly expressed? That is, are the pathways identified in the hypnozoite significantly expressed in hypnozoites compared to other pathways and are those pathways differentially present compared to schizonts? The statistical significance of the enriched pathways should be determined and reported.</p></disp-quote><p>To answer these questions, we performed overrepresentation analyses (enrichment via a hypergeometric test) on the genes that were highly expressed in hypnozoite and highly expressed in the schizont using annotation available in PlasmoDB and Gene Ontology (please see subsection “Pathway and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses” in Materials and methods and the first paragraph of the subsection “Hypnozoites express few core pathways including the physiological hallmarks of dormancy” in Results). The analyses revealed that while pathways related to RNA processing and ribosomal activity were enriched in both stages, pathways related to metabolic activity were only expressed in the schizont (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for all observations, <italic>p</italic>-values adjusted according to Benjamini-Hochberg procedure).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Much of the authors’ results are contradictory to a recently published P. cynomolgi liver stage transcriptome study (Cubi et al., 2017). It is important to give an honest assessment regarding the root causes for these discrepancies. Also move the comparative analysis into the Results section and discuss in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewers 2 and 3 raised criticisms pointing to the need for a more direct comparison of our data with the data reported by Cubi et al., we have compared the two data sets and found that there are substantial methodological and quality control issues with the Cubi et al. data. In addition, the direct comparison demonstrates the superior quality of the gene expression survey we report in our manuscript. See subsection “Hypnozoites express a smaller set of genes than schizonts”, second paragraph; Discussion, second paragraph; subsection “Comparison with published data”, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) The authors mention that their work represents a second such analysis of the hypnozoite transcriptome, since the first analysis performed using laser capture and using the same strain of Pcynomolgi was published by Cubi et al. earlier this year. A direct comparison of the 120 transcripts described in that study with the transcripts identified in this study as a supplementary table in the Results section of the paper, and not just as a paragraph in the Discussion, would be very useful and contextualize the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the review and will most definitely make all the data publically available through NCBI Short Read Archive with the accession number indicated as soon as the paper is accepted for publication.</p><p>We have carried out an extensive comparison of our dataset with that of Cubi et al. We found the quality of the previously reported data to be of lower quality as it is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. See subsection “Hypnozoites express a smaller set of genes than schizonts”, second paragraph; Discussion, second paragraph; subsection “Comparison with published data”, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How can the authors distinguish between Pcyno-infected liver cells that never matured into schizonts and/or dying trophozoites, and hypnozoites? Because such parasite stages could complicate the differences seen in the transcripts between hypnozoites and schizonts. Is there a control analysis that could be used for this?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the points raised by the reviewer. At this juncture we cannot rule out the possibility that a (minor) part of the GFPlow sample contains small parasites that are dying/have never matured into schizonts. One could in theory treat the parasites with atovaquone and then FACsort. This would eliminate all parasites but the hypnozoites, however the drug treatment may also have an effect on the transcriptome. These experiments would be quite complex and substantially reduce the number of total parasites accessible.</p><p>From previous atovaquone treatments, we do already know that the majority of the small parasites indeed are hypnozoites (Zeeman et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014;58(3):1586-95; Dembele et al., PLoS One. 2011 Mar 31;6(3):e18162). To further strengthen our data, we have performed a range of validation steps on several selected genes from the RNAseq dataset, both at the protein level and the RNA level. If GFPlow transcripts reflected the presence of nonhypnozoite populations, most likely this would have resulted in differential expression patterns in the small forms that are present in the cultures. During this validation process we have not come across any aberrant RNAseq data that could have resulted from the presence of non-hypnozoite forms.</p><p>Nonetheless, we do agree with the reviewer that this is an aspect of the analysis that should not be overlooked and this is why attempted to validate the RNAseq data set with orthogonal methods (e.g. IFA and RNA-FISH).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some description of the success rate of the various infections would be really informative. For example, how many Pcyno infections of primary simian hepatocytes were done and how many successful? What was the approximate yield of Sz and Hz after cell sorting? Also, for each biological replicate, what was the concordance in identified transcripts, i.e. how much overlap between the replicates?</p></disp-quote><p>For the series of experiments relating to this paper we performed six blood stage infections. In two out of six blood stage infections, parasitemia was low (&lt;0.2%) at the time of mosquito feeding. This resulted in poor sporozoite yields and not enough liver stage forms for FACSsort. The four other infections all resulted in successful liver stage infections with sufficient parasites for FACSsort. One of the infections was used for validation experiments. The events (yield of Sz and Hz) after cell sorting are presented in the existing <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and the results of the alignment statistics are shown in the existing <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. We have now included this text in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Flow cytometry and cell sorting”).</p><p>The concordance in identified transcripts in the biological replicates was good, with only &lt;16% of transcripts not shared between any of the Hz samples, and for Sz the concordance was even better as is shown in the Venn diagrams that we have now added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The concordance between the biological replicates is also shown by the correlation scores, ranging for Hz samples from 0.65 – 0.73 and for Sz samples from 0.86 – 0.92 as shown in the newly included scatter plots of the pairwise comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
