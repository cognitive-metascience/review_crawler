While individual metabolic routes are well characterized, the mechanisms ensuring crosstalk between pathways are poorly described, although they are crucial for homeostasis. Here, we establish a co-regulation of purine and pyridine metabolism in response to external adenine through two separable mechanisms. First, adenine depletion promotes transcriptional upregulation of the de novo NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis genes by a mechanism requiring the key-purine intermediates ZMP/SZMP and the Bas1/Pho2 transcription factors. Second, adenine supplementation favors the pyridine salvage route resulting in an ATP-dependent increase of intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>. This control operates at the level of the nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyl-transferase Nma1 and can be bypassed by overexpressing this enzyme. Therefore, in yeast, pyridine metabolism is under the dual control of ZMP/SZMP and ATP, revealing a much wider regulatory role for these intermediate metabolites in an integrated biosynthesis network.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>yeast genetics</kwd><kwd>metabolic regulation</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors declare that there was no funding for this work</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two distinct processes drive coordinated synthesis of purine and pyridine (NAD<sup>+</sup>) nucleotides in response to AICAR derivatives and ATP.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH) is a coenzyme mediating hydrogen exchange in a myriad of metabolic reactions and a co-substrate for several enzymes including the sirtuin protein deacetylases, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and the cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR)synthases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Verdin, 2015</xref>). In redox reactions, NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH are interconverted with no change in overall NAD amount. By contrast, NAD<sup>+</sup>-consuming reactions can affect NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration in the cell. In particular, NAD<sup>+</sup> was found to decline with ageing, possibly through limitation of recycling or increased consumption via PARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Imai and Guarente, 2014</xref>). This decline can be reversed by supplementation with nicotinamide (NAM), its riboside (NR) or mono-nucleotide (NMN) derivatives, that can result in health improvement and/or extended lifespan, although the underneath mechanisms are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rajman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshino et al., 2018</xref>). Increased de novo synthesis of NAD<sup>+</sup> was also found to improve health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katsyuba et al., 2018</xref>). However, the potential health-benefits of increasing NAD<sup>+</sup> are challenged by recent studies showing that increased expression of the NAD<sup>+</sup> recycling enzyme, NAM phosphoribosyl-transferase (NAMPT), results in treatment-resistance and invasive phenotypes for melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohanna et al., 2018</xref>), glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gujar et al., 2016</xref>) and colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lucena-Cacace et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, deciphering the mechanisms controlling NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis and consumption is fundamental to understand important biological processes tightly connected to metabolism. In budding yeast, orthologs of PARP and cADPR synthases have not been identified, but the Sir2 sirtuin proved to be a key player in conveying NAD<sup>+</sup> status as a signal in biological processes such as gene expression silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moazed, 2001</xref>), ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin and Guarente, 2003</xref>) or cell size homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moretto et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis requires a nicotinamide moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) that can be provided through salvage of preformed precursors such as nicotinic acid (NA) or nicotinamide, or alternatively be the result of de novo synthesis from tryptophan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gazzaniga et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, synthesis of NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) requires a ribose phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is incorporated from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). In yeast, this is achieved by two distinct phosphoribosyl transferases: Bna6 for the de novo pathway and Npt1 for the salvage pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The yeast de novo and salvage pathways converge to the precursor NaMN (nicotinic acid mononucleotide) which is then metabolized in two steps to NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The first step catalyzes the integration of an AMP molecule to NaMN to form NaAD<sup>+</sup> (nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide), the second consisting in an amination of NaAD<sup>+</sup> to generate NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Hence the final NAD<sup>+</sup> molecule contains a nicotinamide group, a ribose phosphate moiety and an adenine nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In human cells, NAM produced by sirtuins activity is directly recycled to NAD<sup>+</sup> via NAMPT, while in budding yeast, recycling of nicotinamide requires its conversion to nicotinic acid (by Pnc1) which is then metabolized to NaMN by nicotinic acid phosphoribosyl-transferase (Npt1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As a matter of fact, NA is the NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor commonly supplied in yeast-defined media.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43808.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the yeast pyridine and purine biosynthesis pathways.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) NAD<sup>+</sup> de novo and salvage pathways in yeast.

This regulatory process requires the sirtuin Hst1 which is thought to be a NAD<sup>+</sup> sensor. Hst1 associates with the transcription repressor Sum1 directly affecting the expression of the <italic>BNA</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bedalov et al., 2003</xref>). Beside this feedback repression mechanism, little is known on how yeast cells adapt NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis to growth conditions and connect it to other metabolic pathways. Here, by studying the physiological response of yeast cells to purine limitation, we show a tight co-regulation of purine and pyridine metabolism.</p><p>NAD<sup>+</sup> is one of the most abundant adenylyl-derivative (mM range) in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashrafi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2000</xref>) and as such is highly dependent on purine nucleotide metabolism for its synthesis. Indeed, as mentioned above, the adenylyl-backbone donor for NAD<sup>+</sup> is ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) whose synthesis is dependent on the purine de novo and salvage pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In yeast, utilization of adenine is preferred to de novo synthesis and availability of adenine in the growth medium results in transcriptional down-regulation of the de novo purine pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daignan-Fornier and Fink, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guetsova et al., 1997</xref>), as well as increased intracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gauthier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saint-Marc et al., 2009</xref>). Changes in ATP levels, associated with the availability of purine precursors, modulate the flux through the purine de novo pathway by allosteric inhibition of the first enzyme of the pathway (Ade4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rébora et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This feedback inhibition results in lowering intermediates in the pathway when adenine is available. In particular, two regulatory metabolites, ZMP (AICAR monophosphate) and its succinyl-precursor SZMP (SAICAR-monophosphate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), collectively named (S)ZMP hereafter, are at least 10 times more abundant under adenine-free growth conditions than under adenine replete conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daignan-Fornier and Pinson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hürlimann et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, (S)ZMP act as key signals in the transcriptional activation of several metabolic pathways including purine, histidine, one-carbon units and phosphate utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pinson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rébora et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rébora et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saint-Marc et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, variation of intracellular ATP, associated with availability of adenine, results in co-regulation of various metabolic processes. Understanding the consequences of fluctuations of purine nucleotide levels may thus give important clues on integrative processes resulting in metabolic homeostasis. Here, we reveal a key regulatory crosstalk between ATP and NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adenine affects abundance of several metabolites involved in NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis</title><p>To investigate the physiological consequences of extracellular adenine availability and associated ATP variations, we compared the metabolic profiles of a wild-type yeast strain grown in the presence or absence of the preformed purine base adenine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). A prototrophic strain was used to ensure that the observed effects do not result from metabolic interferences with the auxotrophic-markers commonly used to facilitate genetic studies. It should be stressed that doubling time was not affected by adenine feeding, while a significant effect on cell median volume was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), hence all metabolic quantifications resulting from metabolic profiling were normalized using both cell number and median cell volume.</p><p>We first focused our metabolic analysis on highly significant differences (p&lt;0.001). As previously reported, addition of adenine in the growth medium resulted in a significant increase of intracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gauthier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saint-Marc et al., 2009</xref>) and in a strong diminution of both ZMP and SZMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hürlimann et al., 2011</xref>). Fumarate, a by-product of ZMP synthesis from SZMP was also decreased when adenine was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results are consistent with the fact that the flux through the de novo purine pathway is lower in the presence of adenine, as a result of feedback inhibition of the first step of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rébora et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, adenosine, inosine and guanosine, as well as adenine and hypoxanthine, were more abundant in the adenine-replete condition revealing an increased interconversion by the salvage pathway of purine nucleobases and nucleosides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–I</xref>). By contrast, several peaks in the chromatograms, including the triphosphate nucleotides GTP, CTP and UTP were not significantly affected by adenine supplementation (p&gt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C,J,L</xref>). Similarly, pyrimidine derivatives, except uracil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), were not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3G–M</xref>). Finally, five other peaks varied significantly in our metabolic profiling when adenine was added to the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–O</xref>). Two of these peaks correspond to tryptophan and nicotinic acid, while the remaining three were identified as intermediates of the NAD<sup>+</sup> de novo synthesis pathway: kynurenine, 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine and 3-hydroxy-anthranilate, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results thus revealed an effect of adenine feeding on pyridine metabolism. Most importantly, NAD<sup>+</sup> itself, the final product of the pathway, was increased by adenine feeding in the prototrophic strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>; p=0.0015) and in two other reference-strains derived from BY4742 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Altogether these experiments led us to conclude that adenine feeding impacts on several metabolites directly participating to pyridine metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), including precursors (tryptophan and nicotinic acid), intermediates (kynurenine, 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine and 3-hydroxy-anthranilate), as well as NAD<sup>+</sup> itself.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43808.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NAD<sup>+</sup>precursors and biosynthesis intermediates respond to variations in extracellular purine availability.</title><p>The prototrophic wild-type strain FY4 was kept in exponential phase for 24 hr in SDcasaWU medium supplemented (red dots) or not (blue dots) with extracellular adenine.

To address more directly this question, we measured NAD<sup>+</sup> in yeast mutant strains known to affect ATP. We first used an adenylate kinase mutant strain (<italic>adk1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) known to have reduced intracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gauthier et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, the <italic>adk1</italic> knock-out had low ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and most importantly showed a concomitant low intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). On the contrary, a <italic>kcs1</italic> mutant, in which ATP production is stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Szijgyarto et al., 2011</xref>), had higher ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and higher NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In the same experiment, NADH varied similarly to NAD<sup>+</sup> in the <italic>adk1</italic> and <italic>kcs1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) indicating that the synthesis of pyridines rather than their redox interconversion was altered in these mutants. Of note, the NADH signal being much noisier than the NAD<sup>+</sup> signal, no significant difference was found in response to adenine availability, a condition leading to small variations of intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>. Together these results further supported the correlation between ATP and NAD<sup>+</sup> variations observed in response to adenine feeding. Furthermore, a confirmation came from the use of two additional conditions limiting ATP synthesis through other means. First, we took advantage of a <italic>prs3</italic> mutant affecting PRPP-synthetase the enzyme responsible for providing the nucleotide ribose moiety. The <italic>prs3</italic> mutant has a low nucleotide content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hernando et al., 1998</xref>), including ATP, but was still highly responsive to the availability of the purine base adenine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), although PRPP is required both for salvage and de novo synthesis of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In this genetic setup, which restricts ATP synthesis because of PRPP shortage, we again found a strong correlation between intracellular ATP and NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Finally, since intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> responded nicely to variations of the purine base (adenine) and sugar (PRPP), we asked whether this would be the case with the third moiety of the ATP nucleotide which is phosphate. In the ATP molecule, the first phosphate (alpha) is brought up with the sugar, the second one (beta) is added from pre-existing ATP via adenylate kinase (Adk1) and the third one (gamma) is added upon glycolysis (fermentation) or oxidative phosphorylation (respiration). Lowering phosphate availability in the growth medium down to 100 μM resulted in decreased intracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and simultaneously diminished intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

In glucose medium, not surprisingly, adenine feeding had a significant effect on AXP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), paralleling increased ATP, which is by far the most abundant adenylic nucleotide in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier, 2012</xref>). However, under the same conditions, adenylate energy charge was only slightly and not very significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, when cells were grown on non-fermentable carbon sources (glycerol/ethanol), the same effect of adenine on ATP, AXP and NAD<sup>+</sup> was found but no effect on adenylate energy charge nor cell volume was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). We conclude that the adenine effect on NAD<sup>+</sup> correlates nicely with ATP itself, as well as with AXP, but not with adenylate energy charge.</p><p>Our results revealed a robust correlation between intracellular ATP and NAD<sup>+</sup>, however, at this point it was unclear which of these two metabolites was driving the process. Indeed, ATP is required as a substrate for NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and NAD<sup>+</sup> is required during glycolysis at a key step for ATP synthesis (catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). To address this question, we first compared intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> and ATP in cells grown with or without nicotinic acid (the NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor commonly supplied in yeast defined media). In the absence of nicotinic acid, intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> was much lower than in cells grown in its presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Hence, de novo synthesis alone is not able to sustain high intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> and the contribution of the salvage pathway is predominant, as previously proposed by Bench and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sporty et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast to its effect on NAD<sup>+</sup>, nicotinic acid depletion had no effect on intracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), demonstrating that a substantial reduction in intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> does not necessarily reduce intracellular ATP. Strikingly, the same nicotinic acid feeding experiment carried-on with the low-ATP <italic>adk1</italic> mutant showed no effect on intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>, which remained low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), neither did it affect intracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). It thus appears that under these experimental conditions, NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis was highly dependent on intracellular ATP, while the reverse was not observed. In addition, these results identify the nicotinic acid utilization pathway as the major source of NAD<sup>+</sup> under our experimental conditions. We conclude that ATP stimulates NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis mostly <italic>via</italic> the salvage pathway. This conclusion was confirmed by combining a <italic>kcs1</italic> mutation, enhancing ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>), with a <italic>npt1</italic> mutation abolishing NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis from nicotinic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sandmeier et al., 2002</xref>) and resulting in low intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Importantly, in the <italic>kcs1 npt1</italic> double mutant, intracellular ATP was high, while intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> was low. Therefore, blocking nicotinic acid utilization, by the <italic>npt1</italic> mutation, was sufficient to abolish the ATP stimulation of NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis. Hence, under standard yeast growth conditions, intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> variations had no effect on ATP while ATP variations robustly affected intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>. Altogether, these data strongly support the idea that ATP controls intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> in yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Yeast cells respond to adenine limitation by turning-on transcription of the pyridine de novo pathway genes</title><p>Adenine depletion, by lowering ATP and increasing intracellular (S)ZMP, is known to transcriptionally upregulate expression of genes from several pathways including purine, histidine, one-carbon units and phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier, 2012</xref>). We thus asked whether some of the observed adenine-dependent metabolic effects could be the result of a transcriptional regulation of the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism genes. Revisiting our previous transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hürlimann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pinson et al., 2009</xref>) revealed an upregulation of the pyridine de novo pathway <italic>BNA</italic> genes (except <italic>BNA7</italic>) under all conditions leading to ZMP and/or SZMP accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left panel). This was observed whether (S)ZMP were accumulated from endogenous means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pinson et al., 2009</xref>) or through addition of the precursor AICAR riboside (sometimes noted AICAr in the literature) to the growth medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hürlimann et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, induction of the <italic>BNA</italic> genes by (S)ZMP was abolished in strains lacking the transcription factors Bas1 or Pho2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right panel), but not in a strain lacking Pho4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right panel). These three transcription factors were previously found to be responsible for the transcriptional response to ZMP, but only the Bas1/Pho2 pair was also responsive to SZMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pinson et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, the <italic>BNA</italic> genes were upregulated in an <italic>ade13</italic> mutant specifically accumulating SZMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> middle panel). By contrast, expression of the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway genes <italic>TNA1</italic> and <italic>NPT1</italic> as well as common genes downstream the de novo and salvage pathways (<italic>NMA1</italic>, <italic>NMA2</italic> and <italic>QNS1</italic>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) was not altered by (S)ZMP or mutations affecting Bas1 and Pho2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We conclude that (S)ZMP and the Bas1/Pho2 transcription factors modulate expression of the <italic>BNA</italic> regulon. This transcriptional regulation by Bas1 and Pho2 in response to adenine limitation was confirmed by northern-blot. Shifting wild-type cells from an adenine-replete medium to a medium lacking this nucleobase resulted in upregulation of <italic>BNA4</italic> and <italic>BNA6</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and this upregulation was abolished in the absence of Bas1 and Pho2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In opposite sense, down-regulation of <italic>BNA4</italic> and <italic>BNA6</italic> transcripts was found when adenine was added to the growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These transcriptional responses to adenine were similar to those previously reported for the <italic>ADE17</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gauthier et al., 2008</xref>) used as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, these transcriptional responses resulted in higher amount of the cognate proteins. Indeed, using GFP-tagged versions of Bna4 and Bna6, we found that these proteins were more abundant when adenine was absent and that this effect was dependent on Bas1 and Pho2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>), just as Ade4-GFP and Ade13, two purine synthesis enzymes used as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). Together, these results reveal a coordinate transcriptional upregulation of the pyridine de novo pathway genes, via Bas1/Pho2 and (S)ZMP, in response to purine precursor scarcity. This regulatory process could modulate the flux in the pathway and account for the decrease of the de novo pathway precursor (tryptophan) and the increase of pyridine intermediates (kynurenine, 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine and 3-hydroxy-anthranilate) when cells were grown in the absence of adenine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

As anticipated from previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hürlimann et al., 2011</xref>), both ZMP and SZMP were low in the wild-type strain, very high in the <italic>ade16 ade17</italic> mutant and not detectable in the quadruple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>), while ATP was not significantly different in the three strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Tryptophan, the initial substrate of the de novo pyridine pathway, was significantly lower in the (S)ZMP accumulating <italic>ade16 ade17</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and, at the same time, all measurable intermediates of the pathway were higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>) confirming an increased metabolic flux under conditions where (S)ZMP are high and transcription of the pathway genes is stimulated. Furthermore, addition of AICAR, the riboside precursor of ZMP, in the <italic>ade16 ade17 ade8 his1</italic> mutant resulted in a dose-dependent accumulation of ZMP as well as SZMP, kynurenine, 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine and 3-hydroxy-anthranilate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–K</xref>), while intracellular tryptophan was concomitantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). These results establish that (S)ZMP is necessary and sufficient to increase consumption of tryptophan and intracellular levels of intermediates of the NAD<sup>+</sup> de novo pathway. This (S)ZMP-dependent regulation recapitulated several of the metabolic variations observed in response to adenine shortage (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B–C,K,M–O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–L</xref>). Importantly, under conditions where the pyridine salvage pathway is functional, when external nicotinic acid is plentiful, (S)ZMP accumulation had no effect on intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>) and no effect on intracellular nicotinic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>), which is the precursor for the preferred NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis route in yeast (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sporty et al., 2009</xref>). However, in nicotinic-acid-free medium, intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> was increased in the <italic>ade16 ade17</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which accumulated ZMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), while intracellular ATP was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Similarly, overexpression of <italic>NMA1</italic> allowed the identification of the peak corresponding to NaAD<sup>+</sup> (nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>) the product of Nma1/Nma2 and the substrate for Qns1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Accumulation of NaMN, but not NaAD<sup>+</sup>, upon Npt1 overexpression indicated that the downstream enzymatic step (catalyzed by Nma1/Nma2) is limiting when Npt1 is overexpressed thus explaining why overexpression of Npt1 did not increase intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>. By contrast, <italic>NMA1</italic> overexpression resulted in both higher NaAD<sup>+</sup> and NAD<sup>+</sup> indicating that the downstream step catalyzed by Qns1 was not limiting for NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis under these conditions. Strikingly, we observed that NaMN accumulation resulting from Npt1 overexpression was greater when ATP was lower, that is when cells were grown in the absence of adenine, while at the same time intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). This observation, together with the Nma1 overexpression results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>), establish that the Nma1/Nma2 catalyzed step is a bottleneck for NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis in particular when ATP is lower. Most importantly, this bottleneck, revealed by overexpression experiments, operates in wild-type prototrophic yeast cells in response to nutrient availability. Indeed, intracellular NaMN was found more abundant in a prototrophic strain grown in the absence of adenine compared to the same strain grown in its presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Furthermore, in the same experiment, intracellular NaAD<sup>+</sup> was higher when adenine was added to the growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) a condition resulting in ‘high’ NAD<sup>+</sup> and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–D</xref>). These results demonstrate that nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase is limiting for NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis especially under conditions in which ATP is low. Similar results were obtained with a <italic>bna2</italic> mutant strain, establishing that this regulation process does not require a functional de novo pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In particular, we showed concomitant increase of several NAD<sup>+</sup> de novo synthesis intermediates when adenine was absent and an enhanced decrease of the precursor tryptophan, hence establishing that the de novo pathway is upregulated under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). By contrast, the pyridine salvage pathway was stimulated under adenine-replete conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), as indicated by lower amount of the salvage precursor nicotinic acid. It should be stressed that synthesis of NaMN from nicotinic acid is at the cost of an ATP molecule while synthesis of NaMN from tryptophan does not consume ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our data show that when ATP is lower, yeast cells stimulate NaMN synthesis via the de novo route which is less ATP-requiring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>). Using various combinations of growth conditions and mutants, we established that adenine depletion acted, via high (S)ZMP, to transcriptionally up-regulate the NAD<sup>+</sup> de novo pathway genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This regulatory process required the transcription factors Bas1p and Pho2p, the interaction of which is known to be directly enhanced by (S)ZMP in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pinson et al., 2009</xref>). This result is in good agreement with chromatin immunoprecipitation results from the Petes’ laboratory showing that Bas1 was bound to the promoters of the <italic>BNA2</italic> and <italic>BNA6</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mieczkowski et al., 2006</xref>). This finding thus extends our understanding of the adenine transcriptional regulon and establishes co-regulation of the pyridine de novo pathway with purine, histidine, glutamine and one carbon units pathways which are all responding to adenine availability <italic>via</italic> Bas1, Pho2 and (S)ZMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier, 2012</xref>). In parallel, we found that intracellular ATP was also critical for NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis independently of the de novo pathway and its activation by (S)ZMP. This critical role for ATP in NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis resulted in enhanced assimilation of nicotinic acid and higher intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>. Together our results point to a purine/pyridine inter-pathway regulation involving both (S)ZMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). The two responses appear quite distinct, as they can be separated by specific mutations, although they co-exist upon adenine supplementation conditions in wild-type cells. Thus, NAD<sup>+</sup>-synthesis integrates three metabolic parameters ZMP (via Bas1 Pho2), ATP (via Nma1) and NAD<sup>+</sup> itself (via Hst1); each of these parameters weighing on the final outcome in response to internal and external environment.</p><p>How does ATP affect NAD<sup>+</sup> abundance? Importantly, the adenine-effect on intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> was still found in mutants blocking the pyridine de novo pathway indicating that an important part of the adenine-effect is driven through the salvage pathway. Our results revealed an inverse correlation between intracellular ATP and nicotinic acid, thus pointing to nicotinic acid utilization as a limiting step in the NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis when ATP is decreased. NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis from nicotinic acid is the result of three enzymatic steps, each consuming an ATP molecule, although very differently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The first step is catalyzed by nicotinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase (Npt1), an enzyme belonging to the family of phosphoribosyl transferases that transfer a ribose phosphate from PRPP to a specific substrate. Strikingly, among yeast phosphoribosyl transferases, Npt1 is the only one known to necessitate ATP. Yet, ATP is not used as a co-substrate in the Npt1 catalyzed reaction but it is required to phosphorylate a key histidine residue in the enzyme and thereby to stimulate NaMN formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rajavel et al., 1998</xref>). The allosteric constant for ATP measured in vitro is around 70 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanna et al., 1983</xref>) and cannot simply account for the differences of substrate accumulation observed in vivo in response to intracellular ATP (mM range). Based on intracellular nicotinic acid measurements in the presence and absence of adenine, nicotinic acid metabolism via Npt1 appeared reduced when adenine was absent and ATP was lower. In the meantime, <italic>NPT1</italic> overexpression experiments resulted in accumulation of the reaction product NaMN. However, <italic>NPT1</italic> overexpression had no effect on intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>, while <italic>NMA1</italic> overexpression was sufficient to significantly increase intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>. Importantly, the effect of <italic>NMA1</italic> overexpression on intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> was found even when ATP was low (in the absence of adenine). Nma1 catalyzes the incorporation of an entire AMP molecule in the NaMN precursor resulting in synthesis of NaAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Of note, only the double <italic>nma1 nma2</italic> mutant is lethal under standard yeast growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kato and Lin, 2014</xref>) indicating that both isoforms contribute to the activity although Nma1 appears prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Croft et al., 2018</xref>). This step is clearly critical in terms of net purine consumption since the ATP molecule involved in this reaction is incorporated as a substrate and thus not recycled. The two enzymes have very different K<sub>m</sub> for ATP in vitro (0.1 and 1.4 mM for Nma1 and Nma2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emanuelli et al., 2003</xref>)) and, according to single mutant analysis, Nma1 contribution to the regulatory process appears much higher than that of Nma2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Based on overexpression studies and analyses of intracellular NaMN and NaAD<sup>+</sup>, we established that Nma1 is controlling NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis in response to adenine feeding and ATP variations. However, the K<sub>m</sub> for ATP of Nma1 (0.1 mM) is way below the intracellular ATP concentration (several mM), even in the absence of adenine. Hence, this catalytic constant measured in vitro cannot simply explain how ATP and Nma1 act conjointly to ensure NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis. More complex mechanisms such as allosteric regulation and/or post-translational modification are more likely to operate. Finally, the third step catalyzed by Qns1 requires ATP as a co-factor but did not appear to play a major role in ATP control of NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis as revealed by overexpression and metabolic analyses. It should be stressed that intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration is in the same range as that of ATP (mM) and thus NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis most probably very significantly weigh on ATP backbone consumption. Because NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism is tightly linked to major biological processes such as aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin and Guarente, 2003</xref>) or cell size homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moretto et al., 2013</xref>), the direct impact of ATP on intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> reported here will certainly open new perspectives in these fields. Strikingly, the adenine-effects on ATP and NAD<sup>+</sup> did not affect generation time under exponential growth, hence illustrating how metabolic plasticity can ensure proliferation robustness. However, the new metabolic balance associated with purine precursor availability was accompanied by variations of cell volume and hence biomass production. In a previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moretto et al., 2013</xref>), we documented a negative effect of nicotinic acid on cell volume but this was done under conditions where ATP was ‘low’ (in the absence of adenine) and constant. Cell size decrease under these conditions could reflect metabolic competition for PRPP, the synthesis of which is critical for cell size homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jorgensen et al., 2002</xref>). It thus seems that both purine (ATP) and pyridine (NAD<sup>+</sup>) levels are contributing to the complex cell size trait. Strikingly, when cells were grown on ethanol/glycerol as carbon sources, adenine feeding had no effect on cell size while the same effects as for glucose were found on intracellular ATP and NAD<sup>+</sup>. These results establish that cell size variations, although highly dependent on the medium richness, are not simply correlated to the cell content for these two key metabolites.</p><p>Based on results presented here, we propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>) in which synthesis of NAD<sup>+</sup> in yeast cells respond to adenine availability through a dual process involving dedicated regulatory molecules (S)ZMP and ATP. In the absence of adenine, ATP is ‘low’ and (S)ZMP are ‘high’ resulting in transcriptional activation of the <italic>BNA</italic> genes of the de novo pathway while downstream synthesis of NAD<sup>+</sup> is limited by intracellular ATP at the Nma1/2 step. Under adenine replete conditions, where ATP is ‘high’ and (S)ZMP ‘low’, the pyridine salvage pathway is favored and the Nma1/2 bottleneck is loosened, resulting in higher intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>. This regulatory role of (S)ZMP in several pathways could reflect the fact that the de novo pathways might be favored in the wild under low-nutrient conditions, that is when purine and pyridine precursors such as adenine and nicotinic acid are likely concomitantly low. Indeed, in the same low-nutrient conditions, phosphate utilization genes (the <italic>PHO</italic> regulon) are stimulated at the transcriptional level in response to ZMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pinson et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, the purine metabolic intermediates (S)ZMP stimulate transcription of the purine (<italic>ADE</italic>) and pyridine (<italic>BNA</italic>) de novo pathway genes via the transcription factors Bas1 and Pho2 and also stimulates the phosphate utilization (<italic>PHO</italic>) genes via the transcription factors Pho4 and Pho2. We propose that (S)ZMP perform as a general transcriptional signal in response to purine shortage reflecting the likely broader nutrient limitation encountered by yeast cells in their natural environment when purine precursors are scarce. (S)ZMP would thereby contribute to inform the cells on their nutrient status. Accordingly, we observed that yeast cells transferred from a poor to rich nutrient medium have a much longer adaptation time (lag) when (S)ZMP are high, although their doubling time following the lag was not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ceschin et al., 2015</xref>). In parallel to this (S)ZMP transcriptional response, we propose that ATP itself would be sensed by strategic metabolic enzymes and would thereby directly affect cell metabolism by modulating synthesis of key metabolites such as NAD<sup>+</sup>, inositol polyphosphates or (S)ZMP. These metabolites would in turn, directly (ZMP for Bas1/Pho2 and Pho4/Pho2) or indirectly (NAD<sup>+</sup> for Hst1/Sum1; IP7 for Pho81/Pho80-Pho85/Pho4) modulate specific transcription factors. While our work revealed strong co-regulation processes between purine and pyridine metabolisms, further regulatory interconnections between purine and phosphate pathways as well as pyridine and phosphate pathways had been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auesukaree et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gauthier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang and O'Shea, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu and Lin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pinson et al., 2009</xref>) hence unveiling the complexity of inter-regulatory processes between these three metabolic pathways. In conclusion, in the model proposed here, (S)ZMP act as a general transcriptional signal for purine shortage, while specific metabolites from each pathway would serve to signal ATP profusion. Whether this concerted cellular response to ATP status extends to other metabolic pathways or cellular functions remains to be explored as well as its conservation in other species.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast media and strains</title><p>SD is a synthetic minimal medium containing 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base (BD-Difco; Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), 2% glucose.

(2015)</xref>. For NaMN and NaAD<sup>+</sup> determination, an improved acetate gradient was used by starting with 85 mM acetate for the first 10 min followed by a linear gradient to reach 100 mM acetate in 20 min. The rest of the gradient was then identical to that described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ceballos-Picot et al. (2015)</xref>. Peaks were identified by their retention time as well as co-injection with standards and/or their UV spectrum signature (Ultimate-3000 diode array detector, Thermofisher). Peak area quantifications were done at the following wavelengths: 240 nm for fumarate, 260 nm for ADP, AMP, ATP, GDP, GTP, guanosine, hypoxanthine, inosine, NaAD<sup>+</sup>, NAD<sup>+</sup> Phenylalanine, UDP, UDP-NAG, uracil and UTP; 269 nm for adenine, NaMN, ZMP and SZMP; 272 nm for CDM, CMP, CTP and cytidine; 280 nm for Thiamine pyrophosphate and tryptophan; 295 nm for tyrosine; 340 nm for NADH and thiamine; 360 nm for L-kynurenine and 3-hydroxy-athranilate and 390 nm for 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine. For each strain and growth condition, metabolic extractions were performed on independent cell cultures (biological replicates) and sample normalization was done on the basis of cell number and median cell volume (using a Multisizer 4 (Beckman Coulter)). Number of biological replicates is indicated as N in the figure legends. Statistics were given as p-values determined by a Welch’s unpaired t-test assuming a bilateral distribution and unequal variances. Welch's t-test is more robust than Student's t-test and maintains type I error (rejection of the true null hypothesis) rates close to nominal for unequal variances. AXP content corresponds to the sum of ATP +ADP + AMP contents. Adenylate energy charge (AEC), was defined as AEC = (ATP + ½ ADP)/AXP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atkinson and Walton, 1967</xref>). AXP and AEC were calculated with each nucleotide content given in nmol/sample (inferred from standard curves using ATP, ADP and AMP pure compounds).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Northern blots</title><p>The transcript levels of <italic>ADE17</italic>, <italic>BNA4</italic>, <italic>BNA6</italic>, <italic>PHO84</italic> and <italic>ACT1</italic> were determined by northern blot analysis as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pinson et al., 2004</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Alan Hinnebusch as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor.

At low adenine levels, the de novo pathway for synthesizing NAD<sup>+</sup> from tryptophan is up-regulated transcriptionally, dependent on the transcription factors Bas1/Bas2 and their known metabolite co-activator, the adenine pathway intermediate SZMP. These factors/co-activator were already known to regulate adenine biosynthesis and other metabolic pathways in response to extracellular adenine levels; and this study extends their regulatory purview to include de novo pyridine production. At high adenine levels, in which the de novo pathway is transcriptionally repressed by low SZMP levels, NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis is stimulated apparently by increasing flux through the salvage pathway from nicotinic acid (NA); although the increased flux is only inferred from the reduced levels of NA and not shown directly. Other results from strains overexpressing or lacking enzymes of the salvage pathway suggest that the step catalyzed by Nma1 is rate-limiting for the pathway and is presumably stimulated by high ATP levels. This stimulation was not observed experimentally, but was deduced to exist, as opposed to ATP merely stimulating flux through the pathway by virtue of it being a substrate for two of the three reactions. Moreover, the mechanism for this stimulation, which could be allosteric or post-translational modification of Nma1, was not elucidated. Nevertheless, the study makes several novel findings about the regulation of NAD<sup>+</sup> by intracellular ATP levels through two distinct mechanisms, which required a very large number of metabolite measurements with very high precision and reproducibility using a strategic collection of yeast mutations to alter the intracellular levels of ATP, SZMP, or modulate the activities of de novo purine or NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic pathways or the salvage pathway for NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis to achieve.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– It should be shown that the increased expression of <italic>BNA</italic> regulon genes shown in Figure 4B and D are impaired in <italic>bas1</italic> and <italic>pho2</italic> mutants.</p><p>– Additional work is required to explore why the <italic>ade16 ade17</italic> mutant did not show the increased NAD<sup>+</sup> level in the results of Figure 5M predicted by their model.

It would improve the quality of the paper if they actually measured flux and show that it is stimulated at high intracellular ATP levels.</p><p>– The involvement of Bas1/Bas2 in up-regulating the de novo pathway enzymes relies entirely on previous expression microarray experiments. It would be advisable to confirm this conclusion here by showing that the expression increases shown in Figure 4B, C, or D are impaired in a <italic>bas1</italic> mutant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>ZMP and SZMP are intermediates of the purine de novo synthesis pathway. They also act as key signals in transcription activation of metabolic pathways including histidine, one-carbon units and phosphate utilization. In previous studies by Pinson et al., 2009, activation of NAD<sup>+</sup> de novo pathway <italic>BNA</italic> gene expression was observed in the purine de novo pathway mutants (<italic>ade16 ade17</italic>). This transcription activation appeared to require Pho2 and Bas1 transcription factors. Accumulated (s)ZMP in the <italic>ade16 ade17</italic> mutants enhances the protein-protein interaction of Pho2 and Bas1, leading to increased <italic>BNA</italic> gene transcription. These studies show a connection between de novo NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis and purine metabolism, which provides a foundation for current study.</p><p>Since NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis requires ATP whose synthesis is dependent on purine synthesis pathways, co-regulation of purine and NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism is anticipated. In this study, extracellular adenine availability and associated variations of ATP, NAD<sup>+</sup>, and various NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis intermediates were examined in yeast strains. Overall, the results indicate a dual control of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism by purine metabolites (ZMP/SZMP and ATP). In the first model, adenine depletion promotes transcriptional up-regulation of the de novo NAD biosynthesis <italic>BNA</italic> genes by (s)ZMP activated Bas1/Pho2. In the second model, adenine repletion/supplementation promotes NA/NA salvage mediated NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis via increasing ATP.</p><p>Analysis of metabolites was very extensive and rigorous. Both models appeared to be supported by major results. However, results supporting the first model were not as clear. For example, the <italic>ade16 ade17</italic> mutant showed increased (S)ZMP levels and <italic>BNA</italic> gene expression, but it did not show increased NAD<sup>+</sup> level (Figure 5M). Perhaps, the authors can try to determine NAD<sup>+</sup> levels of these mutants in NA-free media. In addition, although adenine depletion was able induce a small increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the <italic>npt1</italic> mutant (Figure 5O), it was not clear whether this increase was due to Pho2/Bas1 induced <italic>BNA</italic> gene expression. Adenine depletion, in addition to decreasing ATP, may draw PRPP into purine de novo pathway (Figure 1). This would limit NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis since PRPP is essential for <italic>NPT1</italic> and <italic>BNA6</italic> activity (Figure 1). In fact, Figure 3—figure supplement 2B showed <italic>prs3</italic> mutant (defective in PRPP synthesis) (Figure 1B) had lower NAD<sup>+</sup> level. Observed small NAD<sup>+</sup> increase shown in Figure 5O could be due to low NAD induced <italic>BNA</italic> gene derepression caused by loss of Hst1 activity. It is therefore not clear how to exclude the effect of Hst1 from proposed Pho2/Bas1 pathway in these experiments.</p><p>The adenine repletion model is very solid although it is anticipated that adenine repletion would restore ATP levels and thus support NAD synthesis. It is also known that NA salvage is the preferred NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis pathway as long as NA and NA salvage pathway are present. However, this study does provide direct evidence to support these anticipations. Identification of Nma1 as the limiting factor in NA salvage is interesting and is in line with another study that also shows Nma1 over expression is sufficient to increase NAD<sup>+</sup> levels.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>These authors examined the metabolic and regulatory intersection between the biosynthetic and salvage pathways for NAD<sup>+</sup> and purine nucleotides in <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>. Using metabolic profiling, they found that adenine supplementation increased intracellular ATP and NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and decreased metabolic intermediates of both pathways, suggesting co-regulation. They used several mutations and growth conditions to manipulate intracellular ATP and NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and examined relative levels of many metabolites in response.</p><p>The metabolic data are robust and the use of genetics manipulations to uncover regulatory responses is well thought-out. The interpretation of the data is justifiable and the writing to describe the complicated pathways and their regulation is clear. Additionally, this manuscript addresses critical metabolic processes that affect cellular function and have not yet been examined as deeply in any organism. In sum, a well-written manuscript that should be of interest to researchers who think about metabolism.</p><p>1) Subsection “ATP controls NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis”, first paragraph: The authors highlight that NADH levels varied similarly to NAD<sup>+</sup>, indicating that synthesis was altered (not redox). In either +Ade or -Ade growth conditions, NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH levels decreased in the <italic>adk1</italic> mutant and increased in the <italic>kcs1</italic> mutant. However, there is a difference in the response of the metabolites to adenine supplementation within each strain: NAD<sup>+</sup> levels significantly increased in all three strains but NADH levels were unchanged with adenine supplementation.</p><p>a) Is there an explanation for the difference in the response of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH to adenine supplementation within the strains?</p><p>b) This sentence should be clarified since they did not vary in the same way.</p><p>2) In Figure 5, it seems that the Welch's t-test for the quad mutant is relative to the <italic>ade16 ade17</italic> double mutant but not to the wild-type; shouldn't the comparison be of the quad mutant to the WT?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43808.066</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– It should be shown that the increased expression of BNA regulon genes shown in Figure 4B and D are impaired in bas1 and pho2 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewers, increased expression of <italic>BNA4</italic> and <italic>BNA6</italic>, in response to adenine limitation, was followed both at the transcript level (northern blot) and at the protein level (western blot) in the presence and absence of the Bas1 and Pho2 transcription factors.

When the salvage pathway is not active (NA-free medium), the synthesis of NAD<sup>+</sup> comes from the de novo pathway. Under these growth conditions, intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> was very significantly increased in the <italic>ade16 ade17</italic> mutant (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A) which accumulated ZMP (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B) while intracellular ATP was not significantly affected (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>In summary, in the <italic>ade16 ade17</italic> mutant when the salvage pathway is active, although the de novo pathway is stimulated at the metabolic (see Figure 5E-F) and transcriptional level (see microarrays in Figure 4A, 1 and 4 columns starting from the left), intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> is unaffected (Figure 5M). By contrast, when the salvage pathway is not active, intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> is increased in the <italic>ade16 ade17</italic> mutant (NA-free medium; Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). A simple explanation is that, when the salvage pathway is active, massive NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis through salvage masked the effect of the <italic>ade16 ade17</italic> mutant on the de novo pathway which is clearly not the major NAD<sup>+</sup> provider in the cell. This results are presented in the text (subsection “Yeast cells respond to adenine limitation by turning-on transcription of the pyridine de novo pathway genes”, last paragraph) and in a new figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is necessary to address the possibility raised by reviewer #2 that the NAD<sup>+</sup> increase shown in Figure 5O results from low NAD-induced BNA gene derepression caused by loss of Hst1 activity, rather than Pho2/Bas1-induced BNA gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>This point was first addressed by combining <italic>npt1</italic> with <italic>bas1</italic> and <italic>pho2</italic> mutations to establish that the transcription factors are involved in the observed response. However, under standard 48h-culture in the absence of adenine (the condition used for all metabolic profiling experiments throughout the paper including those shown in Figure 5O) the <italic>bas1</italic> and <italic>pho2</italic> mutants show a severe growth defect and very low intracellular ATP (down to 50%) as previously described (Gauthier et al., 2008; Servant et al., 2012) which is most likely due to the lack of activation of the purine de novo pathway in the absence of these transcription factors. Hence, this experiment could not be conclusively performed and compared to the one presented in Figure 5O. We then asked whether Hst1 was involved in this regulation process, as suggested by the reviewer. Of note, it is counterintuitive that Hst1 would be less active (and hence lead to derepression) in the <italic>npt1</italic> mutant specifically in the absence of adenine under conditions where intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> is higher. Indeed, Hst1 is known to repress expression of the <italic>BNA</italic> genes when NAD<sup>+</sup> is higher (Bedalov et al., 2003). Such an inverse response of Hst1 to NAD<sup>+</sup> levels would implicate that Hst1 itself would be directly regulated by adenine in a NAD<sup>+</sup>-independent way. To evaluate the role of Hst1 in the regulation of intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> in the <italic>npt1</italic> mutant, we measured NAD<sup>+</sup> in a <italic>hst1 npt1</italic> mutant strain in the presence and absence of adenine. As shown below, the <italic>hst1</italic> mutation resulted in higher intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> in both the absence and presence of adenine indicating that the pyridine de novo pathway is probably not fully deregulated in the <italic>npt1</italic> mutant. In the <italic>npt1 hst1</italic> mutant, NAD<sup>+</sup> was higher in the presence of adenine (when ATP was high) while in the <italic>npt1</italic> mutant, NAD<sup>+</sup> was higher in the absence of adenine (when ZMP was high). Thus it appears that the NAD<sup>+</sup>-synthesis system integrates three metabolic parameters ZMP (via Bas1 Pho2), ATP (via Nma1) and NAD<sup>+</sup> itself (via Hst1). How each of these parameters actually weigh on the final outcome apparently depends on the experimental setup.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43808-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>From these experiments, we do not exclude that Hst1, which is central to NAD<sup>+</sup> sensing, contributes to the regulation process observed in Figure 5O, however we have no evidence to suggest that the Hst1-driven response would be modulated by adenine via ZMP (or ATP). Indeed, all our results fit in a simpler model in which adenine feeding strongly impacts on intracellular (S)ZMP (Figure 2B) which stimulates expression of the <italic>BNA</italic> genes (Figure 4) and production of NAD<sup>+</sup> from the de novo pathway (Figure 2). It is clear that Hst1 plays an important role in the overall expression levels of the <italic>BNA</italic> genes, but at this point we have no evidence that it is involved in the adenine-regulation process per se.</p><p>This point is now raised in the Discussion section (Discussion, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Adenine depletion, in addition to decreasing ATP, may draw PRPP into purine de novo pathway (Figure 1).

Hence synthesizing AXP in the absence or presence of adenine comes at the same cost in terms of PRPP. To clarify this point, PRPP consumption upon adenine feeding is now shown in Figure 1B and mentioned in the text (subsection “ATP controls NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors must address the issue raised by reviewer #3, of why NAD<sup>+</sup> levels significantly increased whereas NADH levels were unchanged with adenine supplementation of the adk1 and kcs1 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for the apparent discrepancy between intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH is that NADH signal is much noisier than the NAD<sup>+</sup> signal and therefore small differences cannot be significantly revealed, while larger differences (WT vs. <italic>adk1</italic> or WT vs. <italic>kcs1</italic> are highly significant). We hence cannot conclude for the adenine effect on intracellular NADH in the WT strain but when the effects on ATP are strong (<italic>adk1</italic> or <italic>kcs1</italic> mutants) NADH clearly and significantly followed the NAD<sup>+</sup> pattern. The text has been clarified (subsection “ATP controls NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>– The increased flux through the salvage pathway for NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis is only inferred from the reduced levels of NA and not shown directly.

However, later in the paper (Figure 7) we identify the two metabolic intermediates (NaMN and NaAD<sup>+</sup>) between nicotinic acid and NAD<sup>+</sup> and we document in Figure 8A-D their response to ATP in a wild-type prototrophic strain. Together our results show that nicotinic acid consumption is indeed used to synthesize NAD<sup>+</sup>, via NaMN and NaAD<sup>+</sup>, and that this process is regulated by ATP at the step catalyzed by Nma1.</p><p>Moreover, to fully address the point raised by the reviewer and eliminate a possible contribution <italic>via</italic> the de novo pathway, we established that a similar regulatory pattern on all four metabolites (NA, NaMN, NaAD<sup>+</sup> and NAD<sup>+</sup>) was observed in response to adenine in the <italic>bna2</italic> mutant in which the pyridine de novopathway is totally blocked. This was done by compiling results obtained previously (partially presented in Figure 6A-B) and new results specifically obtained under conditions allowing to separate properly NA and NaMN. The two experiments were compiled for ATP, NaAD<sup>+</sup> and NAD<sup>+</sup> (total N=14). The new results were used to quantify NA and NaMN (N=8). The results are presented in a new figure (Figure 8—figure supplement 1) and in the text (subsection “Nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyl-transferase Nma1 controls synthesis of NAD<sup>+</sup>”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The involvement of Bas1/Bas2 in up-regulating the <underline>de novo</underline> pathway enzymes relies entirely on previous expression microarray experiments. It would be advisable to confirm this conclusion here by showing that the expression increases shown in Figure 4B, C, or D are impaired in a bas1 mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>Same point as above (first essential revision response).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Analysis of metabolites was very extensive and rigorous. Both models appeared to be supported by major results. However, results supporting the first model were not as clear. For example, the ade16 ade17 mutant showed increased (S)ZMP levels and BNA gene expression, but it did not show increased NAD<sup>+</sup> level (Figure 5M). Perhaps, the authors can try to determine NAD<sup>+</sup> levels of these mutants in NA-free media. In addition, although adenine depletion was able induce a small increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the npt1 mutant (Figure 5O), it was not clear whether this increase was due to Pho2/Bas1 induced BNA gene expression. Adenine depletion, in addition to decreasing ATP, may draw PRPP into purine de novo pathway (Figure 1). This would limit NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis since PRPP is essential for NPT1 and BNA6 activity (Figure 1). In fact, Figure 3—figure supplement 2B showed prs3 mutant (defective in PRPP synthesis) (Figure 1B) had lower NAD<sup>+</sup> level. Observed small NAD<sup>+</sup> increase shown in Figure 5O could be due to low NAD induced BNA gene derepression caused by loss of Hst1 activity. It is therefore not clear how to exclude the effect of Hst1 from proposed Pho2/Bas1 pathway in these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>See detailed response above (third essential revision response).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The adenine repletion model is very solid although it is anticipated that adenine repletion would restore ATP levels and thus support NAD synthesis.
