Whilst essential for meiosis and fertility, the molecular structure of the SC has proved resistant to elucidation. The SC protein SYCP3 has a crucial but poorly understood role in establishing the architecture of the meiotic chromosome. Here we show that human SYCP3 forms a highly-elongated helical tetramer of 20 nm length. N-terminal sequences extending from each end of the rod-like structure bind double-stranded DNA, enabling SYCP3 to link distant sites along the sister chromatid. We further find that SYCP3 self-assembles into regular filamentous structures that resemble the known morphology of the SC lateral element. Together, our data form the basis for a model in which SYCP3 binding and assembly on meiotic chromosomes leads to their organisation into compact structures compatible with recombination and crossover formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02963.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02963.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02963.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a sperm cell and an egg cell unite, each contributes half of the genetic material needed for the fertilised egg to develop. This creates opportunities for new and beneficial genetic combinations to arise. To ensure that each new sperm or egg has half a set of chromosomes, reproductive cells undergo a special type of division called meiosis.</p><p>During the early stages of meiosis, copies of each chromosome—one inherited from the mother, the other from the father—are paired up along the midline of the dividing cell. A protein complex known as the synaptonemal complex acts as a ‘zipper’, pulling the chromosomes in each pair closer together. The arms of the maternal chromosome and the paternal chromosome are so close that they sometimes cross over and swap a section of DNA. These crossovers perform two critical functions. First, they recombine the genetic information of a cell, so that offspring can benefit from new gene combinations. Second, they help to hold the chromosomes together at a key point of meiosis, reducing the chances that the wrong number of chromosomes ends up in a sperm or egg cell.</p><p>The zipper structure is essential for meiosis. Disrupting its formation causes infertility and miscarriage in humans and mice, as well as chromosomal disorders like Down's syndrome. Scientists have known about this zipper structure and its importance since 1956, yet limited information is available about its shape and how it works.</p><p>Syrjänen et al. used X-ray crystallography to take images of the part of the zipper structure that interacts with the chromosomes. These images, combined with the results of biochemical and biophysical experiments, show that rod-like structures on the zipper link together sites within each chromosome. This not only allows the paired chromosomes to be held together by the zipper, but also compacts them so it's easier for them to cross over and swap genetic information.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02963.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02963.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>chromosome structure</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>synaptonemal complex</kwd><kwd>self-assembly</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>084279/Z/07/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pellegrini</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Syrjänen</surname><given-names>Johanna Liinamaria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Isaac Newton Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10.26(h)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pellegrini</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Owen Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A structural and biochemical study of human SYCP3 provides the first molecular model for the three-dimensional organisation that is imposed upon chromosomal DNA during meiosis and is essential for genetic exchange and fertility.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Homologous chromosome synapsis and genetic exchange through crossing-over are central to the process of meiosis. Synapsis is achieved by the assembly of an elegant molecular structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC), which acts as a ‘zipper’ to bring in close apposition pairs of homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Page and Hawley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang and Wang, 2009</xref>). The functional architecture provided by the SC is essential for meiotic recombination and crossover formation; disruption of SC formation in mice leads to meiotic failure, infertility and embryonic death through aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yuan et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Vries et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kouznetsova et al., 2011</xref>). Defective SC formation in humans has been associated with cases of infertility and recurrent miscarriage, which overall affect 15% and 5% of couples respectively, in addition to non-lethal aneuploidies such as Down's syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matzuk and Lamb, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sierra and Stephenson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolor et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Since its discovery in 1956, the ultrastructure of the SC has been studied extensively by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moses, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Westergaard and von Wettstein, 1972</xref>). These studies have shown that the SC adopts the same characteristic tripartite structure in all sexually reproducing organisms in which it is found, from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moses, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Westergaard and von Wettstein, 1972</xref>). Thus, the SC is comprised of two approximately 50 nm wide lateral elements (LEs) that coat the chromosome axes, and a 100 nm wide central region that in almost all organisms contains a mid-line 20–40 nm wide central element (CE). The central and lateral elements are continuous along the entire chromosome axis (up to 24 μm in human spermatocytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Solari, 1980</xref>) and are joined together by a series of interdigitating transverse filaments, which provide the 100 nm distance between lateral elements that defines the central region. Whilst lateral elements are often amorphous in appearance, in a number of species they present a regular 20 nm pattern of repeating dark and light bands along the longitudinal axis, hinting at structural regularity in the assembly of its underlying protein constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Westergaard and von Wettstein, 1972</xref>). In recent years, the principal protein components of the mammalian SC have been identified and localised within the structure through immunofluorescence and immunogold staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fraune et al., 2012b</xref>). According to this initial map of the SC, the SYCE1, SYCE2, SYCE3 and TEX12 proteins form the central element, whilst SYCP2 and SYCP3 are the main constituents of the lateral element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schramm et al., 2011</xref>). The transverse filaments are formed by SYCP1, with its N- and C-termini located in the central and lateral elements respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmekel et al., 1996</xref>).

At this stage, homologous chromosomes are brought into a loose 400 nm-wide alignment, whilst lateral element proteins SYCP2 and SYCP3 are recruited to the chromosome axes in an inter-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pelttari et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). Their recruitment also depends on the prior assembly of a cohesin core that includes meiosis-specific components SMC1β, RAD21L, REC8 and STAG3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garcia-Cruz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Llano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winters et al., 2014</xref>). In zygotene, homologous chromosomes are ‘zipped’ together into 100 nm synapsis by interdigitation of SYCP1 transverse filaments. This process is dependent on a network of interactions that form within the central element between the SYCP1 N-terminal region, SYCE1-3 and TEX12, including the higher order assembly of the constitutive SYCE2-TEX12 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolcun-Filas et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2012</xref>). To achieve synapsis also requires axis protein HORMAD1, which assembles on unsynapsed chromosomes independent of SYCP2 and SYCP3 during leptotene to zygotene, and subsequently dissociates upon SYCP1 synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fukuda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). At pachytene, the SC is fully formed, enabling the completion of meiotic recombination with the formation of typically two crossovers per tetrad. The SC is disassembled in diplotene, leading to the re-association of HORMAD1 on desynapsed chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fukuda et al., 2010</xref>). At this stage, homologous chromosomes remain linked solely by crossovers, whose formation is essential for preventing aneuploidy. After disassembly, some SC components remain present at paired centromeres; additionally, SYCP3 is partially retained along chromosome arms until metaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bisig et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Disruption of SYCP3 in mice leads to a sexually dimorphic phenotype. In males, it causes complete infertility owing to apoptotic cell death during meiotic prophase, with failure of SC formation and synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yuan et al., 2000</xref>); in females, there is subfertility, with a high aneuploidy rate leading to embryonic death <italic>in utero</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yuan et al., 2002</xref>). SYCP3 deficiency has two intriguing structural consequences for the chromosome axis: a doubling of chromosome axis length with respect to wild type, and premature disassembly of the cohesin cores during diplotene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yuan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kouznetsova et al., 2005</xref>). These findings suggest a role for SYCP3 in chromosome compaction and stabilisation of the cohesin core. The ectopic expression of SYCP3 in somatic cells leads to the formation of fibre-like higher order assemblies that show a regular repeating pattern with a periodicity of approximately 20 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baier et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2007b</xref>). Their assembly is dependent on the presence of the last six amino acids of SYCP3, which have been well conserved throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baier et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fraune et al., 2012a</xref>). At the clinical level, several SYCP3 mutations have been identified in infertile men and women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolor et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, SYCP3 is ectopically expressed in a variety of primary tumours, which is associated with an increased rate of aneuploidy caused by inhibition of double-strand break DNA repair through homologous recombination by BRCA2 and RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hosoya et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the molecular structure and function provided by SYCP3 is essential for meiotic cell division but can lead to apparently pathological consequences in mitosis.</p><p>Here, we combine the crystallographic analysis of human SYCP3 with biochemical and biophysical evidence to propose a molecular model for the role of SYCP3 in the organisation of the meiotic chromosome. We determine that SYCP3 is a tetrameric protein and that its helical core folds in an elongated rod-like structure spanning 20 nm in length. We show that SYCP3 can bind DNA through the N-terminal regions extending from its tetrameric core. As the DNA-binding sites are located at both tetramer ends, SYCP3 can act as a physical strut to hold distant regions of DNA together. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SYCP3 undergoes self-assembly into regular striated filamentous structures of 23 nm periodicity that resemble the native SC lateral element. We conclude that concurrent DNA-binding and higher order assembly by SYCP3 on meiotic chromosomes lead to compaction and organisation of the chromosome axis, in a manner conducive to SC central region assembly, recombination and crossover formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A helical tetrameric core defines the underlying structure of SYCP3</title><p>In order to establish the molecular basis of SYCP3 function, we set out to find a robust means for its recombinant production. Although we were able to purify full length SYCP3 (SYCP3<sub>FL</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the protein suffered from proteolytic degradation and irreversible aggregation at physiological concentrations of salt. We found that the high-salt dependency could be eliminated by removing six amino acids from the C-terminal end of the protein that are known to be essential for fibre formation upon heterologous expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baier et al., 2007a</xref>). Unwanted proteolysis of the recombinant sample was alleviated by removing the N-terminal 65 amino acids that are predicted to be largely unstructured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We thus identified a core region of human SYCP3, corresponding to amino acids 66–230 (SYCP3<sub>Core</sub>), that is highly stable and can be purified in large quantities to near homogeneity.</p><p>Circular dichroism analysis showed an α-helical content of 93% (155 amino acids) and 66% (180 amino acids) for SYCP3<sub>Core</sub> and SYCP3<sub>FL</sub> respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and both proteins demonstrated co-operative unfolding during thermal denaturation with a melting temperature of approximately 65°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, the majority of secondary structure, and the overall stability of the protein, emanate from the 66–230 core region. We assessed the oligomeric state of SYCP3 by size-exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS). SYCP3<sub>Core</sub> and SYCP3<sub>FL</sub> eluted in single peaks of molecular weights 78.6 and 110 kDa respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), closely matching their theoretical tetramer sizes of 79.5 and 111 kDa. The tetrameric status of SYCP3<sub>Core</sub> was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), which further indicated a highly asymmetric structure with an estimated frictional ratio (f/f<sub>0</sub>) of 2.1 (data not shown).

The helical chains of the SYCP3 tetramer are arranged in an alternating anti-parallel fashion, such that each end of the tetramer contains two N-termini and two C-termini. The SYCP3 structure undergoes a left-handed 90° rotation along its length so that the two N-termini at each end of the tetramer lie in orthogonal planes. The tetrameric assembly is constructed from a combination of four-helix bundles and coiled-coil motifs. The two halves of the structure (hereafter referred to as arms) are formed of a four-helix bundle leading into a coiled-coil that zips together the C-terminal parallel chains, leaving the N-terminal ends to splay apart. In contrast, the centre of the molecule is asymmetrical, consisting of a coiled-coil between one pair of parallel chains that provides the left-handed 90° rotation of the molecule. A noticeable consequence of this asymmetrical assembly is that each of the four SYCP3 chains adopts a unique conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Assembly of the SYCP3 tetrameric arms</title><p>The most prominent structural feature driving the tetrameric assembly of SYCP3 chains is the presence of two four-helix bundles, one in each arm of the tetramer. The extensive network of hydrophobic and polar interactions within the two helical bundles is likely to be responsible for the high thermal stability of the SYCP3 structure. Each bundle contains a bipartite hydrophobic core consisting of a cluster of aromatic residues proximal to the middle of the tetramer and a more distal region centred around tryptophan W111 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). The proximal aromatic-rich core of the four-helix bundle results from the close packing of Y125<sub>A/C</sub>, F129<sub>A/C</sub> and F133<sub>A/C</sub> with Y179<sub>B/D</sub> and F182<sub>B/D</sub>; it is extended by hydrophobic contacts with I175<sub>B/D</sub>, L178<sub>B/D</sub>, I183<sub>B/D</sub> and M186<sub>B/D</sub>, and hydrogen bonding between Y125<sub>A/C</sub> and Q181<sub>B/D</sub>, and between S126<sub>A/C</sub> and Y179<sub>B/D</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The second hydrophobic region is built around the two W111<sub>A/C</sub> residues, surrounded by L100<sub>A/C</sub>, I107<sub>A/C</sub>, F204<sub>B/D</sub> and M208<sub>B/D</sub>. Interestingly, W111 adopts two distinct conformations in chains A and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>): in both cases, the indole ring packs against L197<sub>B/D</sub>, but engages in alternative hydrogen bonding with Q201<sub>B</sub> (W111<sub>A</sub>) or D194<sub>D</sub> (W111<sub>C</sub>). The two hydrophobic cores of the four-helix bundle are separated by a solvent-rich layer of polar residues, featuring at its centre R118<sub>A/C</sub>, bonded via salt link with E190<sub>B/D</sub>.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02963.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Structural details of the SYCP3 tetramer arm and central coiled-coil regions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) The SYCP3 tetramer arm is formed by a bipartite four-helix bundle of a proximal aromatic-rich core and distal W11 region, which becomes continuous with a C-terminal coiled-coil.

A hydrogen bonding network between highly-conserved glutamine residues Q157<sub>B/D</sub> and Q158<sub>B/D</sub> interrupts the continuity of the hydrophobic interactions at the heart of the coiled-coil, which features most prominently the aromatic stacking of phenylalanine residue F154<sub>A/C</sub> with F154<sub>B/D</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The boundaries of the central coiled-coil are marked by tryptophan residues W136<sub>A/C</sub> and W136<sub>B/D</sub>, which define points of conformational transition to a four-helix bundle in the two arms of the tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).</p><p>As the SYCP3 structure is constructed from four identical chains, central coiled-coil formation cannot favour one pair of parallel chains over the other. Instead, the central region likely oscillates between two conformations, in which the coiled-coil encompasses either chains B and D or chains A and C. In both conformations, the left-handed 90° rotation would be retained; interchange between conformations would require a transitory super-helical unwinding of the central region. This dynamic interchange is supported by the abundance of conserved glutamine residues and would allow torsional rotation around the longitudinal axis of SYCP3. In the crystal structure, torsional rotation is precluded by the crystal lattice, freezing the central coiled-coil in a single conformation. Nevertheless, the higher crystallographic B-factors of the backbone atoms in the central region relative to rest of the structure support a dynamic rather than fixed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The SYCP3 tetrameric ends interact with DNA</title><p>The known localisation of SYCP3 on the chromosome axis prompted us to test whether it interacts directly with DNA. Analysis by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and fluorescence anisotropy using SYCP3<sub>ΔCt6</sub> (amino acids 1–230) showed double-stranded DNA-binding, with the formation of a discrete protein-DNA complex at a K<sub>d</sub> of 0.20 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,H</xref>). DNA-binding was dependent on the N-terminal regions of SYCP3, as it was not detected for SYCP3<sub>Core</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The N-termini of SYCP3 contain two conserved basic patches, BP1 (52-KRRKKR-57) and BP2 (88-KRKR-91) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>): alanine mutation of BP1 or BP2 in SYCP3<sub>ΔCt6</sub> (ΔBP1 and ΔBP2, respectively) caused a substantial reduction in binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E,H</xref>), whilst mutation of both patches (ΔBP1+2) completely eliminated DNA-binding by SYCP3<sub>ΔCt6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,H</xref>). For all SYCP3<sub>ΔCt6</sub> basic patch mutants, the tetrameric structure was confirmed by SEC-MALS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We further detected DNA binding by a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 49–93 (GST-SYCP3<sub>BP1+2</sub>) spanning both basic patches; its significantly lower affinity than that of SYCP3<sub>ΔCt6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) indicates that the tetrameric architecture may be important to orientate correctly the DNA-binding regions of the protein. The difference in DNA-binding affinity between ΔBP1 and SYCP3<sub>Core</sub>, which includes BP2 but not BP1, suggests that additional amino acids surrounding the basic patch residues contribute to DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).

The striated appearance closely resembles the ultrastructures formed upon heterologous expression of SYCP3 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 1998</xref>) and the SC lateral element in a number of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Westergaard and von Wettstein, 1972</xref>). The comparable size of the repeating unit relative to the length of the SYCP3<sub>Core</sub> structure suggests that the fibre contains stacked layers of SYCP3 molecules brought into parallel alignment by self-associating interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Fibre formation is eliminated by removal of the last six amino acids of the protein (SYCP3<sub>ΔCt6</sub>), in agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baier et al., 2007a</xref>), or by alanine mutation of a short stretch of conserved amino acids, 69-EVQNML-74 (SYCP3<sub>ΔNt6</sub>) N-terminal to the SYCP3 core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4A, 5C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, self-assembly of SYCP3 is mediated by specific amino acid motifs in the N- and C-terminal tails of the tetrameric core structure.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02963.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>SYCP3 undergoes self-assembly into regular filamentous structures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transmission electron micrograph of SYCP3<sub>FL</sub>, loaded onto an EM grid at 1 mg/ml (32 μM) in buffer containing 250 mM KCl, with negative staining performed using uranyl acetate.

The proposed packing of SYCP3 molecules within the fibre would bring into juxtaposition the N- and C-terminal tails originating from tetramers located in adjacent layers. Thus, self-assembly may be driven by co-operative interactions of the terminal regions of the SYCP3 tetramers, extending recursively across the width of the fibre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Such an arrangement of SYCP3 molecules would explain the regular striation pattern of the fibre, with layers of dense protein packing at the interface and looser, conformationally dynamic regions in the centre of the molecule accounting for the alternating dark and light bands. The presence of self-association and DNA-binding motifs within tetrameric ends suggests that both processes must be closely integrated; accordingly, we find that the presence of DNA is compatible with higher order assembly in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The distinctive tripartite ultrastructure of the synaptonemal complex embodies the molecular structure-function relationship that underlies meiosis. The SC operates both as a physical scaffold for synapsis between homologous chromosomes and as a functional component of the recombination and crossover formation machinery. It is thus imperative to gain a detailed understanding of the molecular structure of the SC in order to elucidate the mechanistic basis of meiosis. Here we combine the crystallographic analysis of human SYCP3 with evidence of its DNA-binding properties and intrinsic propensity for self-assembly to propose a molecular model for meiotic chromosome organisation by SYCP3.</p><p>The ability of the SYCP3 tetramer to bind DNA via the N-terminal regions of its rod-like structure suggests that SYCP3 might act to tether together distant locations in chromosomal DNA. Thus, SYCP3 may impose the long-distance organisation of the chromosome axis by self-assembly in a three-dimensional lattice in which chromosomal DNA is looped between the 20 nm physical struts provided by each tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Acting as a molecular spacer, torsional rotation of SYCP3 may be critical in relieving strains in the DNA backbone that build during recombination and crossover formation. We envisage that SYCP3 assembly on the meiotic chromosome axis is initiated by interactions of individual tetramers with the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), ‘pinching’ short portions of chromosomal DNA at discrete locations. Co-operative loading of further SYCP3 molecules onto DNA would reinforce nascent loops, and then bridge between them through self-assembly interactions with SYCP3 molecules of adjacent loops. Completion of the self-assembly process would eventually link all loops in one continuous structure extending for the length of the chromosome axis. The resultant ultrastructure of the meiotic chromosome axis would contain discrete stretches of chromosomal DNA compacted in a concertina-like manner within the newly formed lateral element, interspersed with chromatin loops protruding from the SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02963.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for organisation of the chromosome axis by SYCP3 assembly.</title><p>Each SYCP3 tetramer contains two DNA-binding regions, separated by a distance of 20 nm owing to the central rigid rod-like structure. Upon binding to the chromosome axis, SYCP3 tetramers may pinch off portions of the axis such that short stretches of chromosomal DNA are looped back on themselves with a separation of 20 nm. The loading of further SYCP3 tetramers may bridge between the initial pinched-off portions, creating a continuous structure that extends along the chromosome axis. Thus, the final assembly consists of a three-dimensional lattice of SYCP3 tetramers that organise the chromosome axis in a concertina-like manner such that the length of the axis is shortened and the chromatin loops (that will flank the SC) are lengthened. For clarity, other meiotic factors that are known to perform important functions in the organisation of the chromosome axis, such as SYCP2, cohesin and condensin, are not depicted.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02963.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02963.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02963-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Our prediction of a central role for SYCP3 in meiotic chromosome organisation is supported by the known impairment of SC assembly and high rates of aneuploidy in embryos upon SYCP3 deficiency in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yuan et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2002</xref>). The model provides a molecular basis for the known increase in chromosome axis length in oocytes of SYCP3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yuan et al., 2002</xref>). It further predicts the formation of one chromatin loop for every two repeating units in the SYCP3 fibre (46 nm), closely matching the known evolutionarily conserved loop density of ∼20 per 1 μm of chromosome axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kleckner, 2006</xref>). We envisage that SC assembly depends upon the regular and compact meiotic chromosome architecture imposed by SYCP3, explaining the formation of only short fragmented SC structures upon SYCP3 deficiency in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yuan et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, all SYCP3 mutations reported in human male infertility and female recurrent pregnancy loss affect the C-terminal sequence of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nishiyama et al., 2011</xref>); our structural analysis shows that these mutations would block higher order assembly whilst retaining tetramer formation, confirming a key role for meiotic chromosome organisation by SYCP3 in human fertility.</p><p>EM studies of the mammalian SC have revealed that the lateral element is comprised of two parallel filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Comings and Okada, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dietrich et al., 1992</xref>). It is interesting to speculate that, instead of a single higher order structure, SYCP3 may compact chromosomal DNA into two parallel assemblies within the lateral element, separating sister chromatid DNA locally in the midline whilst retaining cohesion in the chromatin loops. In such a model, the structural organisation of sister chromatid DNA may inhibit inter-sister recombination whilst permitting inter-homologue recombination. A direct function of the SYCP3-dependent organisation of chromosomal DNA in recombination partner choice may also account for the tumourigenic effect of SYCP3 expression in somatic cells in which a high aneuploidy rate results from inhibition of DNA repair by inter-sister homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hosoya et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our in vitro analysis of SYCP3 suggests a molecular model in which meiotic chromosome compaction is driven by DNA-binding and self-assembly of SYCP3. In vivo, SYCP3 function depends upon SYCP2 and the meiotic cohesin core, as SYCP3 recruitment to the chromosome axis is abrogated upon disruption of SYCP2, STAG3 or REC8/RAD21L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Llano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winters et al., 2014</xref>). We propose that these factors perform functions that are essential within the cellular context to facilitate DNA-binding and self-assembly of SYCP3 on the chromosome axis. The intrinsic propensity of SYCP3 to self-assemble into higher-order structures in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 1998</xref>) suggests that its loading on the chromosome axis must be tightly regulated to prevent formation of unproductive cytoplasmic structures. This may be achieved by protein mediators, possibly SYCP2, that bind to SYCP3 and prevent its self-assembly until delivery onto chromosomal DNA. Whilst SYCP3 readily binds naked DNA in vitro, the meiotic cohesin core must present chromatin-bound DNA in a manner compatible with its binding and incorporation into SYCP3 assemblies. During assembly, additional interactions of SYCP3 with axis components may further facilitate necessary changes in local chromosome structure through sliding of cohesin and condensin rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuylen et al., 2011</xref>). The SYCP3 structure explains the constant loop density of compacted chromosomes, but it is presently unclear what determines the loop length and thus the chromosome axis length achieved by compaction. A role for meiotic cohesins is hinted at by the known shortening of the SYCP3-bound chromosome axis length upon disruption of SMC1β or REC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannister et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Revenkova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Novak et al., 2008</xref>). An understanding of the interactions of SYCP3 with other axis components will be essential to define fully the molecular basis of meiotic chromosome compaction.</p><p>Completion of recombination and crossover formation is accompanied by dissolution of the SC structure and SYCP3 removal, although some SYCP3 is retained on chromosome arms until metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parra et al., 2004</xref>). SYCP3 removal may require post-translational modifications or interacting partners that disrupt self-assembly through competitive binding.

Cor1 or SCP3), a 30-kD protein previously demonstrated to play an important role in the formation of meiotic chromosome axes and synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly in mouse meiosis. SYCP3 is conserved among vertebrates, but lacks apparent homologs in other species. Axis formation is a much more broadly conserved feature of meiosis; it is shared by all known sexually reproducing species. The axes are thought to be a platform for assembly of the structurally conserved SC, which holds together homologous chromosomes and regulates recombination.</p><p>A combination of crystallographic analysis of human SYCP3 with biochemical and biophysical evidence is used to propose a molecular model for the role of SYCP3 in the organization of the meiotic chromosome. SYCP3 has a crucial but poorly understood role in establishing the architecture of the meiotic chromosome. Previous work has demonstrated that ectopic expression of SYCP3 in non-meiotic cells results in the formation of striated fibers; the work here demonstrates that the 20-nm extension of the rod-like SYCP3 central core, plus interaction domains at the N- and C-terminus of SYCP3, may account for the 23-nm periodicity observed by transmission EM analysis of these fibers.</p><p>The reviewers all felt that the data are sound and very well presented. The structure is unusual and intriguing. However, there was some disagreement between the reviewers regarding the level of insights into the structure and function of the lateral elements and SC provided by this work, which appear to be preliminary and speculative. We ask that you address these in your revision, placing your work and speculations more appropriately in the context of current knowledge.</p><p>In particular, some of the ideas put forth are rather SYCP3-centric – the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> suggests that SYCP3 might suffice to organize naked DNA, but in fact cohesins are the most broadly conserved and essential axis components, SYCP3 normally only interacts with chromosomes in the presence of cohesins, so its organizational role presumably depends on this context. The statement that “A role in chromosome axis compaction would require an intrinsic capacity for SYCP3 to assemble into a higher-order structural scaffold” is problematic. Condensins compact chromosomes and yet are not thought to form a higher-order scaffold.</p><p>Furthermore, it has been found that the compaction of meiotic chromosomes may reflect the amount of cohesins present along the axis (e.g., depletion of Rec8 results in more compact chromosomes in S. pombe, while depletion of the cohesin regulator Pds5 has the reciprocal effect [Ding et al. (2006). J. Cell Biol. 174: 499-508]). The 23-nm repeating unit detected in fibers formed by pure SYCP3 may not reflect the organization of the protein within the chromosome core, although it is certainly interesting to speculate that it might. An understanding of the interactions of SYCP3 with other essential axis components, particularly cohesins and the HORMA domain proteins HORMAD1 and HORMAD2, will be essential to clarify the role of SYCP3 in this complex network of proteins.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) While the paper is very clearly written, some of the background may be misleading to non-experts in that it overgeneralizes many aspects of SC structure and function, recombination, etc. across all sexually reproducing species. For example, the existence of a distinct “central element” distinct from the transverse components of the SC may not be a general feature of this structure, although such a structural element has been documented by EM in mammals and insects. It should be more evident from the Introduction that SYCP3 is restricted to the vertebrate lineage. The central role of cohesins in axis structure and function, and in cohesion between homologs and sisters, should probably be made clearer. Additionally (this is really just a quibble), the Introduction seems to suggest that defects in SC structure and function contribute significantly to human infertility and birth defects, which is certainly not the case (only a small handful of cases have been attributed to genes encoding SC/chromosome structural components).</p><p>2) The statement that DNA-binding was dependent on the N-terminal regions of SYCP3, as it was not detected for the SYCP3 core, may need reconsideration, as the DNA binding assay seems to have been performed only with EMSA. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, it seems that the well contains DNA-bound protein, which does not pass the gel due to formation of larger aggregation, and there is less free DNA with the increased protein concentration.</p><p>3) If possible, it would be good to verify the oligomerisation state of the studied mutations by SEC-MALS or other methods, as was presented for SYCP3 FL and SYCP3 core constructs.</p><p>4) The authors described SEC-MALS of the full length SYCP3. It would be interesting to confirm unfolded states of the C and N -terminal regions in solution by SAXS if feasible.</p><p>5) To improve clarity and readability, some of the more detailed methods might be separated from a more streamlined description of the methods. A more concise and clearly stated description of the structure presented would also be helpful.</p><p>6) With respect to the alanine mutants of the basic patches – were the proteins soluble and well behaved as the other truncations? The resolution of the native structure may be a bit over estimated given the very high Rmerge of the highest resolution shell.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02963.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>In particular, some of the ideas put forth are rather SYCP3-centric – the model presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>suggests that SYCP3 might suffice to organize naked DNA, but in fact cohesins are the most broadly conserved and essential axis components, SYCP3 normally only interacts with chromosomes in the presence of cohesins, so its organizational role presumably depends on this context.

We have provided additional description of the known functions of meiotic cohesins and HORMA domain proteins in the Introduction. We have further included a substantial analysis of the potential role of axis proteins in SYCP3 function and meiotic chromosome organisation in the Discussion. We have not included the specific reference suggested as it relates to <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, an organism that unusually lacks an SC (and has no known SYCP3 homologue) and so may not relate to the mammalian system. Instead, we have described the known shortening in chromosome axis length upon disruption of either REC8 or SMC1β in mice, and discussed how this may relate to SYCP3 function.</p><p>We recognise that self-assembly is not the only possible mechanism whereby chromosomal material could be compacted, and have altered the statement accordingly.</p><p><italic>Minor comments:</italic></p><p><italic>1) While the paper is very clearly written, some of the background may be misleading to non-experts in that it overgeneralizes many aspects of SC structure and function, recombination, etc. across all sexually reproducing species.

Rev. Genet.</italic> 6 71-110. To the best of current knowledge, meiosis occurs in the absence of an SC in three organisms – <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>, <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. In the latter, a ‘linear element’ (LinE) forms on the chromosome axis, which is distinct from the SC although may be related to its lateral element (Loidl 2006 <italic>Chromosoma</italic> 115; 260-271). We have qualified in the Introduction that the tripartite structure is conserved in all organisms in which the SC is found.</p><p>We agree that SYCP3 orthologues are most easily identifiable in vertebrate organisms. However, recent studies suggest that key SC components such as SYCP1 and SYCP3 are widely conserved across metazoan organisms (Fraune et al. 2012 <italic>PNAS</italic> 109; 16588-93). We have clarified this point in the Introduction.</p><p>We have provided further details in the introduction regarding the role of meiotic cohesins in axis structure and function, as described above.</p><p>The proportion of cases of human infertility, recurrent miscarriage and aneuploidy that can be attributed to mutations in SC or related genes remains unknown, but in individual cases mutations in SC genes and/or defective SC assembly have been demonstrated. Furthermore, in mouse studies it has clearly been demonstrated that disruption of an individual SC gene is sufficient to induce infertility or embryonic death through aneuploidy. We have modified our comment in the introduction to clarify that SC defects have been associated with specific cases, with figures relating to the overall incidence of these conditions.</p><p><italic>2) The statement that DNA-binding was dependent on the N-terminal regions of SYCP3, as it was not detected for the SYCP3 core, may need reconsideration, as the DNA binding assay seems to have been performed only with EMSA. From</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref><italic>, it seems that the well contains DNA-bound protein, which does not pass the gel due to formation of larger aggregation, and there is less free DNA with the increased protein concentration</italic>.</p><p>We recognise that a small amount of aggregated material was retained in the well upon incubation of SYCP3 core with DNA. This most likely reflects non-specific aggregation of DNA with precipitated protein material, which is commonly observed in EMSA assays, rather than a <italic>bona fide</italic> protein-DNA interaction in which a discrete species would be observed migrating into the gel. Importantly, our conclusion that the N-terminal region is required for DNA-binding is confirmed by the abolition of DNA-binding upon targeted mutation of SYCP3 N-terminal region, demonstrated through EMSA and FP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F and 4H</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) If possible, it would be good to verify the oligomerisation state of the studied mutations by SEC-MALS or other methods, as was presented for SYCP3 FL and SYCP3 core constructs</italic>.</p><p>SEC-MALS data confirming the tetrameric nature of the SYCP3 mutants used in this study have been added as data supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) The authors described SEC-MALS of the full length SYCP3. It would be interesting to confirm unfolded states of the C and N -terminal regions in solution by SAXS if feasible</italic>.</p><p>We established that the N- and C-terminal regions of full length SYCP3 are largely unfolded through two methods. Firstly, CD analysis showed that almost all of the helical structure of SYCP3 is provided by its core domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). Secondly, limited proteolysis of full length SYCP3 revealed a trypsin resistant species with N-terminal cleavage at residue R57, corresponding to the final lysine/arginine site prior to the tetrameric core.</p><p><italic>5) To improve clarity and readability, some of the more detailed methods might be separated from a more streamlined description of the methods. A more concise and clearly stated description of the structure presented would also be helpful</italic>.</p><p>We feel that it is important for thorough and detailed methods to be provided to ensure our findings can be compared appropriately with future studies and so that the methods we have used can be replicated by other researchers. We appreciate that the architecture provided by the SYCP3 structure is both unusual and intricate, and that its description is necessarily detailed. We have provided a paragraph at the beginning of the structure section, in addition to the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, in which we concisely outline the key features of the structure.</p><p><italic>6) With respect to the alanine mutants of the basic patches – were the proteins soluble and well behaved as the other truncations? The resolution of the native structure may be a bit over estimated given the very high Rmerge of the highest resolution shell</italic>.</p><p>The alanine mutants of the basic patches were highly soluble and well-behaved, similar to the wild type SYCP3<sub>ΔCt6</sub> protein.</p><p>The X-ray diffraction data were extremely anisotropic and we defined the high resolution shell as I/σ = 2.5. Whilst the Rmerge value was high (1.094), the precision indicating R-value Rpim (0.403) and mean (I) half-set correlation coefficient (0.727) suggested that this was an appropriate cut-off. Importantly, we found that inclusion of these high-resolution data improved the quality of the electron density map and were beneficial in refinement.</p></body></sub-article></article>
