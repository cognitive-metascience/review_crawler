Yet, it is still unclear how genetic programs and mechanosensation interact during heart valve development. Here, we assessed the mechanosensitive pathways involved during zebrafish outflow tract (OFT) valve development in vivo. Our results show that the hippo effector Yap1, Klf2, and the Notch signaling pathway are all essential for OFT valve morphogenesis in response to mechanical forces, albeit active in different cell layers. Furthermore, we show that Piezo and TRP mechanosensitive channels are important factors modulating these pathways. In addition, live reporters reveal that Piezo controls Klf2 and Notch activity in the endothelium and Yap1 localization in the smooth muscle progenitors to coordinate OFT valve morphogenesis. Together, this work identifies a unique morphogenetic program during OFT valve formation and places Piezo as a central modulator of the cell response to forces in this process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>cardiogenesis</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>682938 -

These two processes require a tight and dynamic coordination between mechanical forces and tissue morphogenesis. Heart valve development is a great model for studying these interactions when considering that heart valve defects are common congenital cardiac malformation in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoffman and Kaplan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Øyen et al., 2009</xref>). The four-chambered heart contains two different sets of valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2012</xref>):</p><p>- Tricuspide valves including the two semilunar (SL) valves, the aortic valve and the pulmonary valve, as well as the tricuspide valve located between the right atrium and the right ventricle.</p><p>- A bicuspide valve called the mitral valve separating the left atrium from the left ventricle. Abnormalities of the arterial valve leaflets are the most-common congenital malformations, in particular bicuspid aortic valve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoffman and Kaplan, 2002</xref>). Aortic valves mainly derive from endocardial cushion progenitors with a potential contribution from other cellular sources (epicardial cells and neural crest) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Generally, valve formation depends on two main events: cell proliferation, which is mainly mediated by the <italic>vegf-nfat1</italic> pathway, matrix deposition and an endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (endMT) under the control of Gata transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laforest et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stefanovic et al., 2014</xref>), Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luxán et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>Smad/tgf-beta/Bmp</italic>, and <italic>Wnt-beta catenin</italic> signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Combs and Yutzey, 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that arterial valves develop differently from atrioventricular valves by differentiating directly from progenitors in the outflow wall independently from endMT in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eley et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Congenital valve defects may originate from developmental origins and/or abnormal haemodynamic forces between these two sets of valves, and it remains unclear how general these developmental programs are. Aortic valves are located in areas of high flow velocity and mechanical forces have a great impact on valve morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butcher et al., 2008</xref>). Abnormal blood circulation is widely recognized as a cardiovascular risk factor and abnormal mechanotransduction has been associated with valvulopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bäck et al., 2013</xref>). Congenital heart valve malformations are usually associated with genetic mutations in genes essential for heart valve development, such as signaling factors (Notch1, TGFβ) for the aortic valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bäck et al., 2013</xref>), and actin-binding proteins (FilaminA) for the mitral valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sauls et al., 2012</xref>). The reoccurring discovery of genetic mutations linking valve defects with genes involved in controlling developmental programs (e.g., in NOTCH1, TBX5, GATA4, TBX20, LMCD1, TNS1, and DCHS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">PROMESA investigators et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durst et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Richards and Garg, 2010</xref>), has spurred interest in valve morphogenesis. A key issue is to further define the genetic or environmental causes of valve malformation.</p><p>The zebrafish constitutes a powerful model to study cardiac valve development and the role of mechanical forces at the cellular scale. Zebrafish heart is two chambered and contains three sets of valves (the outflow tract (OFT), atrioventricular (AVC) and the inflow tract (IFT) valve [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>]) that are all bicuspid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tessadori et al., 2012</xref>). While the developmental programs driving mitral valve development in response to mechanical forces start to be well established in zebrafish, less is known about OFT and IFT valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paolini and Abdelilah-Seyfried, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Steed et al., 2016a</xref>). The cellular processes leading to valve formation are dynamic and are particularly challenging to address in vivo. Zebrafish heart valves originate from progenitors located in the ventricle and atrium that generate the valve leaflets through a coordinated set of endocardial tissue movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boselli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pestel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Steed et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steed et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vermot et al., 2009</xref>). The sequence of cellular events leading to AVC valve formation in zebrafish embryonic hearts is initiated through cell shape changes that lead to EC convergence towards the AVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boselli et al., 2017</xref>) and cellular rearrangements that will form a multilayered tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pestel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scherz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steed et al., 2016b</xref>). In the zebrafish AVC, blood flow and Klf2a control <italic>notch1b</italic> and <italic>bmp4</italic> expression, both of which are necessary for valve formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vermot et al., 2009</xref>). Klf2a regulates the deposition of matrix protein (in particular Fibronectin1) in the valve forming area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steed et al., 2016b</xref>), as well as Wnt signaling by controlling <italic>wnt9b</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goddard et al., 2017</xref>). The latter is consistent with the fact that canonical Wnt signals arise specifically in sub-endocardial, abluminal cells and that these Wnt signals are dependent upon hemodynamic forces in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pestel et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, Notch signaling is essential for aortic valve formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garg, 2016</xref>) and OFT development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">MacGrogan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The role of mechanical forces during OFT valve development at the cellular and molecular scale, however, is largely unknown.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44706.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The OFT develops from 56 hpf to form functional valves at 144 hpf.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: Z-section of the double transgenic line <italic>Tg(kdrl:nls-mCherry; myl7:GFP)</italic> showing the overall structure of the heart. Bottom: Scheme of the zebrafish heart with the endocardium, myocardium and smooth muscles and zoom on the OFT structure.

In zebrafish, the mechanosensitive channels Trpv4 and Trpp2 modulate endocardial calcium signaling and <italic>klf2a</italic> expression is necessary for valve morphogenesis and downstream pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heckel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steed et al., 2016b</xref>). Notch signaling is tightly involved in cellular mechanosensitive responses in human aortic valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Godby et al., 2014</xref>) and Notch1 is a potent mechanosensor in adult arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mack et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, it has been shown that stretch-sensitive channels from the Piezo family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murthy et al., 2017</xref>) are important for vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>) and lymphatic valve formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nonomura et al., 2018</xref>). In the embryo, Piezo channels exert essential roles during cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2018</xref>) and can affect lineage choice by modulating the nuclear localization of the mechanoreactive transcription coactivator Yap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pathak et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the role of Piezo-mediated mechanotransduction during cardiac development and its potential targets remain unclear.</p><p>In the developing cardiovascular system, biomechanics is key for modulating flow propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>). In the teleost heart, the OFT constitutes a specialized organ comprising the conus arteriosus (CA) and the bulbus arteriosus (BA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The BA dampens the pressure wave down the arterial tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 2003b</xref>). To perform its function, the BA expresses elastic fiber genes that are thought to provide the mechanical properties necessary for its physiological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keith et al., 1977</xref>). The BA is separated from the ventricle by the OFT valve and is composed of smooth muscle. The extracellular matrix (ECM) gene, <italic>elastin b</italic>, contributes to the development of the BA by regulating cell fate determination of cardiac precursor cells into smooth muscle via a process that involves the mechanotransducer Yap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moriyama et al., 2016</xref>). How these factors contribute to OFT valve development and interact with other mechanosensitive pathways remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the signaling events taking place during OFT valve formation and addressed their regulation by the mechanosensitive channels Piezo and transient potential channels (Trp) as well as the flow-responsive transcription factor Klf2a. We show that OFT valve formation proceeds via an initial stage of endothelial cell folding, which is associated with the generation of a cluster of smooth muscle cell progenitors surrounding the endothelial layer. Subsequent global tissue remodeling events result in the appearance of functional leaflets, which defines a unique process of valvulogenesis. Using live reporters to highlight the signaling changes accompanying these temporally coordinated cell-movement events and genetics, we identified Notch and Klf2 as key flow-dependent factors as well as Yap1 as necessary factors for the correct coordination of OFT valvulogenesis. We show that Piezo and Trp channels are key regulators of <italic>klf2</italic> activity in the endothelium and that piezo modulates Yap1 localization in the smooth muscle cells, providing a molecular link between mechanosensitivity and cell signaling in the multilayered valve structure. These data describe the cell responses that are coordinated by the mechanical environment and mechanotransduction via mechanosensitive channels in the endothelium.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Outflow tract valve morphogenesis is unique</title><p>In order to better understand the roles played by blood flow during outflow tract (OFT) valve development, we have developed imaging techniques to capture cardiac motion and analyze blood flow in the OFT. Live imaging of the double transgenic line <italic>Tg(gata1:ds-red; kdrl:EGFP</italic>) to follow red blood cells and endothelial cell wall movements reveal dramatic changes in intracardiac blood flow patterns during OFT valve development: as the heart matures, blood flow in the OFT is bidirectional until functional valve leaflets emerge in the OFT at 144 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Throughout development, the periods within the cardiac cycle in which reversing flow can be observed decrease in length until 144 hpf, the stage at which we could not observe reversing flow anymore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Using the <italic>Tg(fli:lifeact-EGFP; kdrl:nls-mCherry)</italic> line, which labels endothelial cells, we found that these flow profile modifications are linked to changes in OFT tissue geometry and the state of OFT maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At 56 hpf, the endothelium resembles a tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), maturing into cushions by 72 hpf, into premature leaflets by 96 hpf and finally into elongated, thin leaflets by 144 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).</p><p>To better characterize how the endothelium changes shape over time and how cells reorganize to form OFT valves, we performed photoconversion experiments using the <italic>Tg (fli:gal4FF;UAS:kaede)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We found that Fn1 deposition in the OFT is different from that in the AVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Steed et al., 2016a</xref>). At 72 hpf, cushions appear and Fn1 is observed in the cells around the endothelial cells, that are themselves surrounded at their base by myocardium in the posterior part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B,C,D,E</xref>). Fn1 expression level increases at 96 hpf and delineates a group of cells surrounding the OFT as well as in the basal side of a few endothelial cells that form the cushions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, arrows, E). In the developed leaflets at 120 hpf, Fn1 expression is maintained within the leaflets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). We found that most of the cells surrounding the endothelium expressing Fn1 also express Elastin b (Elnb, Eln2 or Tropoelastin), a marker of smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paffett-Lugassy et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B’, C’, D’</xref>). We could confirm that the cells surrounding the Fn1 cells are not myocardial cells as the myocardium stops just before the BA region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,E</xref>). To better characterize the smooth muscle identity and their activity, we performed a DAF-FMDA assay and counterstained with Fn1 at 72 hpf, 96 hpf and 120 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

One hypothesis could therefore be that they might have originated from epicardial precursors. Together, these results suggest a developmental sequence of OFT morphogenesis in vivo where endothelial cell reorganization is associated with changes in gene expression in the surrounding smooth muscle cell progenitors. This indicates that the OFT morphogenesis involves remodeling of not just the endothelium, but also of a group of smooth muscle cells that express Fn1 and Elnb, and are functionally active.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44706.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The OFT endothelium is surrounded by smooth muscle cell progenitors expressing fibronectin and elastin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Staining of Fibronectin1 (magenta) on <italic>Tg(myl7:GFP; fli1a:nls-mCherry)</italic>, highlighting the myocardium (white) and the endothelium (green) at 72 hpf. Scale bar: 20 μm.

In the group of ‘beating heart’ embryos (group1, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), we still observe stronger GFP expression in the posterior part of the valve for both reporters at every stage analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

In addition, <italic>notch1b</italic> is also necessary for proper valve formation since 30% (n = 6/20) of the <italic>notch1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos have a ‘delayed phenotype’ at 72 hpf, 35% (n = 7/20) at 96 hpf and 45% (n = 9/20) at 120 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) while almost all control embryos have proper valves at 72 hpf (n = 6/7), 96 hpf (n = 7/7) and 120 hpf (n = 7/7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

First, we evaluated the relative fractional shortening (RFS) at 72hpf in the atrium and in the ventricle of each mutant and their corresponding controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We did not observe any significant difference in the RFS between mutants and their respective controls neither in the atrium nor in the ventricle, suggesting that heart function in these mutants is normal. As another readout of flow forces and heart function, we quantified the retrograde flow fraction (RFF) at 72hpf and 120hpf in these mutants and the time windows for forward, reverse or no flow. We found that they are equivalent in all mutants when compared to their respective controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>), confirming that heart function is not different in these mutants. We looked at valve morphology at 120 hpf when leaflets are normally fully formed.

In the <italic>trpp2</italic> mutant embryos (n = 20), a stronger phenotype is observed with only 10% of normal valves.

In the AVC, endocardial cells experience both shearing forces and mechanical deformation due to the contraction of the heart and its associated blood flow. The situation is slightly different in the OFT because endothelial valvular progenitors are not surrounded by contractile cardiomyocytes but passive smooth muscle cells that can provide a counter force to flow and pressure. Here, we show that the main mechanosensitive pathways involved in AVC valve development are required for OFT valve development, even though the mechanical stimuli vary greatly between these two sets of valves. Previous studies have proposed that <italic>klf2a</italic> and <italic>notch1b</italic> are important during the formation of functional cardiac valve leaflets in zebrafish. Both are specifically expressed in the AVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pestel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steed et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vermot et al., 2009</xref>) and are transcriptionally misregulated in models of Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) where cardiac valve development is altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donat et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we show that both Notch signaling and <italic>klf2a</italic> are active in the endothelial cells of the OFT between 48 hpf and 120 hpf. During the process in which zebrafish cardiac AVC cushion remodel into valve leaflets, endocardial Klf2a expression and Notch activity are high on the luminal side of the developing valve leaflet, which is exposed to blood-flow, whereas their expression is lower on the abluminal side of the leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pestel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steed et al., 2016b</xref>). In the OFT, Klf2a expression and Notch activation follow a different pattern because we could not clearly identify abluminal cells in the OFT. This might reflect a complete lack of endothelial to mesenchymal transition in the OFT by comparison to the AVC. Nevertheless, the impact of both pathways on valve morphogenesis remains the same as we found that <italic>klf2a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>notch1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos show similar valve phenotypes and Notch signaling pathway is significantly decreased in <italic>klf2a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants. Even though the downstream players of the notch pathway remain to be established in the OFT, these results validate previous observations, suggesting that <italic>klf2a</italic> acts upstream of <italic>Notch</italic> signaling in the endocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Samsa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vermot et al., 2009</xref>). Considering that Notch has been proposed to be mechanosensitive in blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mack et al., 2017</xref>), an attractive hypothesis is that the Klf2-Notch axis could be a general mechanosensitive cascade in endothelial cells. In that case, it would be interesting to address <italic>notch</italic> activity in a flow related context, similarly to what is currently being done with Nf-kb, Klf2a, and other flow responsive pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feaver et al., 2013</xref>). This assumption is particularly interesting in the context of sprouting angiogenesis and other aspects of angiogenesis where Notch is broadly required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pitulescu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tammela et al., 2011</xref>). We further show that the expression of Fibronectin1 and Elastinb in the smooth muscle cells surrounding the OFT is not altered in the <italic>klf2a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>embryos. Considering that Piezo is emerging as an important contributor to human diseases related to blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zarychanski et al., 2012</xref>) and lymphatic diseases in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lukacs et al., 2015</xref>), our work should motivate the search of potential involvement of Piezo in cardiac pathologies such as valvulopathies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Piezo is necessary for proper OFT smooth muscle cell identity and endothelial <italic>klf2a</italic> expression in the OFT</title><p>Cardiac valve development is highly dependent on endothelial/endocardial cell mechanosentivity. Previous work identified the membrane-bound mechanosensitive channels (Trpp2 and Trpv4) and a calcium-activated intracellular signaling cascade leading to Klf2a expression and valve morphogenesis as key elements of the endocardial mechanodetection-signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heckel et al., 2015</xref> ) Consistently, we found that these Trp channels are also required for endothelial Klf2a expression and OFT valve formation. In addition, we identify another type of mechanosensitive channel belonging to the Piezo family. Piezo channel mutants show valve dysgenesis phenotype, suggesting their requirement during OFT valve morphogenesis. Interestingly, Piezo channels are important both for modulating Klf2a expression in the endothelium and for smooth muscle cell-specific expression of Elnb and Fn1. Piezo function in these two cell layers is consistent with the fact that Piezo1 is expressed in smooth muscle cells and is important for tissue remodeling in mouse arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Retailleau et al., 2015</xref>) as well as in endothelial cells in mouse vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>) and lymphatic valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nonomura et al., 2018</xref>). These studies along with our results suggest that Piezo1 might be necessary for both layers to regulate distinguishable functions: activation of signaling cascade upon shear stress in the OFT endothelium and proper cell identity acquisition in smooth muscles. Both tissue layers might be sensing different stimuli: shear plus strain for the endothelial cells and strain for the smooth muscle cells. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that Piezo is sensitive to stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ranade et al., 2015</xref>), compression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qi et al., 2015</xref>), and rhythmic mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lewis et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, Piezo-dependent mechanisms can transduce forces at the cell-cell or cell-matrix interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisenhoffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Poole et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, Piezo can have different mechanosensitive roles both in smooth muscle cells and endothelium to coordinate the expression of Klf2 and ECM proteins. An interesting hypothesis is that the smooth muscle cell layer participates in the shaping up of the OFT valve and that both tissue layers establish paracrine interactions to fine tune the morphogenetic process. Further work will be needed to identify if this is the case and how it affects OFT valve morphogenesis at the cellular scale.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Yap1 and hippo pathways are regulators of the OFT valve formation in the endothelium and smooth muscles</title><p>Our work shows that Yap1 is specifically localized in the OFT in both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells and is required for valvulogenesis. Accordingly, the Hippo pathway is active in smooth muscles and in the endothelium. Our work suggests that Piezo constitutes a plausible regulator of Yap1 localization as Piezo1 seems important for its localization in smooth muscle cells. Interestingly, Yap1 has been shown to translocate less in the nucleus in Piezo1 mutant mice neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pathak et al., 2014</xref>) and to induce proliferation in smooth muscles during cardiovascular development in mouse (Wang et al., 2014). Even though we were not able to assess Yap1 subcellular localization in vivo, the regulation of Yap1 activity and ECM assembly might be a general feature of Piezo function. The connection between Piezo and Yap1 is particularly interesting in the context of OFT development and function. In teleost, the OFT has an important biomechanical role for the control of flow propagation within the vascular networks by contributing to the dampening of the pressure wave down the arterial tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 2003b</xref>). In zebrafish, Yap1 is involved in the determination of cardiac precursor cells into smooth muscle cell fate via a process that involves the regulation of Elastinb expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moriyama et al., 2016</xref>). Besides the control of cell identity, ECM contributes to biomechanical properties of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dzamba and DeSimone, 2018</xref>). It is thus possible that Piezo acts as a regulator of tissue mechanical properties by regulating Yap1 expression both in the OFT and in the vascular system where Yap1 expression is flow inducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakajima et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this study reveals a novel function for mechanosensitive Piezo and Trp channels in modulating OFT valve development as well OFT smooth muscle cell maturation. It will be important to further investigate endothelial-smooth muscle cells interactions during OFT cardiac wall maturation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish strains, husbandry, embryo treatments, and morpholinos</title><p>Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experimentation Committee of the Institutional Review Board of the IGBMC (reference numbers MIN APAFIS#4669–2016032411093030 v4 and MIN 4669–2016032411093030 v4-detail of entry 1).

interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Mechanically activated Piezo channels control outflow tract valve development through Yap1 and Klf2-Notch signaling axis&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation is being overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Whilst all reviewers find merit in your work, two of the reviewers unanimously raise concerns regarding the low number of replicates in many experiments, both in those that use signalling reporters for klf2 and notch that are deemed inherently highly variable, and those that use mutants to assess phenotypes. Please see the details below.</p><p>Furthermore, the reviewers are concerned that the overall model is not sufficiently supported by the data, and that the phenotypic descriptions appear somewhat overstated. There is also a perceived disconnect between the described effects on the smooth muscle cells and the endothelial cells, with insufficient insight into how the mechanosensitive ion channels regulate the phenotypes of either of the two, and no information of potential collective effects or interaction in the morphogenic process.</p><p>The reviewers find that based on these weaknesses, the overall level of mechanistic insight is unsatisfactory.</p><p>The reviewers and the BRE have discussed extensively whether the necessary revisions will be feasible within the normal revision period. There is a consensus in that there could be benefits in delineating more carefully either the klf2a Notch axis or the mechanisms of the ion channels to provide focus and the level of detail required to substantiate the model.</p><p>For more information on the details, we have appended the full comments of the reviewers below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Duchemin and colleagues analyses the morphogenic events of outflow tract development during embryogenesis in the zebrafish. The authors are experts in this area and have a strong track record in studying flow dependent signalling and morphogenic regulation in the vasculature and the heart in fish. They exploit their excellent imaging skills to describe the changing shape of the outflow tract, tracking endothelial cells by photoconversion and imaging between 72 and 144hpf. The authors report that the endothelium shows a prominent tissue folding process without signs of delamination, likely driven by morphogenic events between both the endothelium and the surrounding smooth muscle cells, but unlikely involving the myocardium. Matrix labelling highlights prominent expression of fibronectin by the smooth muscle cells during the process.</p><p>The authors use klf2a and tp1 reporter lines to address when and where Klf2a and Notch signalling is activated, identifying a strong upregulation in the posterior part of the valve formation. Slowing heart function with hypomorphic Tnnt2a MO demonstrates that both signals are flow dependent, whilst mutants identify that klf2a is important for Notch activity, but not vice versa. The authors conclude that Klf2a regulates valve morphogenesis via Notch and show that Notch activity loses some of its polarity in klf2a mutants. Using Yap and tead reporter fish, the authors further show that hippo signalling is active in the smooth muscle cells and also some endothelial cells. Here the resolution is less clear in the Yap1-reporter, but the data do suggest that the smooth muscle cells show the strongest signal. Yap signal is also flow dependent, and YAP mutants like Klf2a mutants show delayed or defective valve formation at varying frequency. Searching for upstream activators of these mechanosensitive pathways in endothelial cells and smooth muscle, the authors finally investigate mutants for 4 mechanosensitive ion channels, Piezo1, Piezo2a, Trpp2 and TrpV4.</p><p>The results suggest some level of redundancy or cooperativity, with Piezo1 and Trpp2 important for endothelial folding, and Piezo1 involved in smooth muscle cell activation of Yap1 to modulate outflow tract development.</p><p>The work is overall very carefully executed, includes all relevant controls, beautifully illustrated and very comprehensively presented throughout. The details of endothelial morphogenesis, gene regulation, and the mechanosensitive signalling cascade provide for a much deeper understanding of this developmental process. The schematic illustrations accompanying the original imaging data is extremely helpful. Overall, this is an outstanding piece of work that is deemed of interest for not only the cardiovascular development community, but also for those interested in translational aspects given the importance of inherited cardiac defects associated with various mutations in pathways addressed in this work.</p><p>If I was to point out a weakness of the work, it would be the lack of commenting and possibly analysing the crosstalk between the smooth muscle cells and the endothelium in the process. The final concluding schematic places Piezo1 upstream of different components in both cell compartments, but given that the downstream effectors of Yap1 include modulators of matrix, Bmp and tgfb signalling etc., which will impact on mechanical properties of both endothelium and the smooth muscle cells, and that Notch activity also regulates similar targets, it would seem justified to comment on potential paracrine interactions between the two. I realize however that a full investigation here would go beyond the scope of the current work.</p><p>A second aspect that deserves a comment would be how Piezo1 inhibits klf2a whilst Trpp2 is deemed a positive regulator. How is this dichotomy achieved?</p><p>Finally, the kdrl:nls-mcherry line appears to label only very few endothelial cells in the posterior OFT and the images here do not really match the schematic. I assume the authors use the fli:lifeact GFP signal to delineate those kdrl negative cells, but this would seem important to comment for technical reasons. On a mechanistic level, it would be important to comment on this cellular heterogeneity in the posterior OFT?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the submitted manuscript, Duchemin and colleagues tackle the formation of the OFT valve in the zebrafish model and its dependency on mechanic stimuli. Their work indicates a first rudimentary pathway of mechanosensation-implicated players in the formation of the OFT valve, and describes the different morphogenesis of the OFT valve compared to the classically studied AV canal valve in the zebrafish heart.</p><p>Overall, the work raises general questions about the overall mechanism of flow-dependent morphogenetic processes. The study covers several valuable points, including the first analysis of piezo mutants in zebrafish. The figures include data points and schematics that will be valuable for future discussions and work in the field.</p><p>Nonetheless, at times, the manuscript makes strong conclusions based on small sample sizes (i.e. total embryos analyzed, see below) and the expression of isolated marker genes. Several mutant phenotypes have highly variable penetrance and expressivity (i.e. yap1 mutants, subsection “Klf2, Notch signaling, and Hippo pathways are active in the OFT in different cell layers and are all necessary for proper OFT valve development”), the analysis of which is again hampered by low sample sizes and ambiguous description as to how mutants are identified (assumed Mendelian ratio? Genotyping of individual embryos? etc.). Several statements of necessity and &quot;dramatic&quot; phenotypes need reassessment, as the phenotypes rather indicate the studied genes contribute to robust OFT valve formation rather than being necessary (i.e. <italic>notch1b, klf2</italic>; see also below). Further, OFT valve formation is a somewhat specialized developmental process, yet the authors seem tempted to draw broad-stroke generalizations about mechanosensing from their findings in the Discussion.</p><p>* The authors analyze several mutants and state necessity and importance for valve formation. Overall, however, the phenotype analysis is plagued by several issues as presented, and rather suggests the studied factors might be at times dispensable yet contribute to robust valve formation.</p><p>In all figures with box diagrams, at times vast variability is captured (i.e. Figure 8G'), yet individual data points not shown. Individual data points should be added. Further, the overall sample size in the majority of the mutant analyses seem low and spotty in the reported details, is shown in percent that are misleading in small sample sizes, and affects the phenotype interpretation. Percentage is used with exceedingly small sample sizes and becomes misleading in significance. Similarly for p-values, that are not sufficient to cover vastly incomplete penetrance of phenotypes. As examples:</p><p>a) The yap1 mutants have a seemingly increasing penetrance and expressivity of OFT valve phenotypes – yet the phenotype is reported for only 12 embryos (also, are these always the same 12 embryos?), resulting in 58% (6 or 7) of embryos with no valves at 120 hpf; that hardly seems to justify an &quot;important role&quot; but rather a contribution to robust valve formation.</p><p>b) Mutant <italic>notch1b</italic> embryos have a 30% incidence for valve issues, also not warranting the moniker &quot;necessary&quot; but rather contributing. Similarly, the authors state &quot;most&quot; <italic>notch1b</italic> embryos show proper klf2 expression, yet it's about half at only n=4 (Figure 7).</p><p>c) The authors state that a &quot;large fraction&quot; of piezo1 embryos have less Yap1 at n=7/10, again seeming like an overstatement (can also be called &quot;a bit more than half&quot;?).</p><p>Such examples go throughout all mutant analysis (also trpp2, etc.) and should be re-phrased and possibly remedied by increasing the sample size to achieve better insights into variability of the phenotypes.</p><p>Also, how do yap1, piezo, trpp2, etc. mutants look like overall? A description of other phenotypes (i.e. cardiac edema, endothelial problems, viability, etc.) would greatly help to gauge the non-autonomous impact of the described defects (or their dependence thereof).</p><p>* The authors conclude that loss of piezo function impacts smooth muscle &quot;identity&quot; of the BA based on downregulated Fn1 and Elnb staining. While interesting, Fn1 and Elnb are functional/differentiation markers and not necessarily determinants of fate/identity (i.e. Moriyama et al., 2016), yet these observations might rather indicate that flow has a functional contribution to BA maturation. The authors are encouraged to perform a functional BA assay, i.e. active NO metabolism using DAF-2DA (Grimes et al., 2006) to underline the functional impact on BA formation. Further, the claim of Fn1 expression in smooth muscle is not well-funded based on the provided images in Figure 3 and should be shown more clearly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses how mechanical forces and genetic programs interact to control valve morphogenesis. The authors assess in vivo morphogenesis of the OFT valve and how mechanosensitive pathways: Yap, Klf2, and Notch1b contribute to this process. Finally they test the role of mechanosensors from the Trp and Piezo family.</p><p>While the topic of the manuscript is very interesting and timely, the conclusions drawn from the data are not based on enough evidence.</p><p>Throughout, the number of independent experiments should be clearly stated; the n in most of the experiments is very low. This makes any rigorous assessment futile and greatly undermines the quality of the manuscript.</p><p>All the quantification/bar graphs should show individual data points wherever possible. The statistical tests should be clearly stated in the figure legends. The manuscript text would benefit from revision; e.g. the last sentence of the Introduction is not clear, or adjectives as reversing flow or tissular remodeling are used and are not correct English.</p><p>1) In the Introduction: &quot;The multichambered heart contains two different set of valves: arterial valves that are semilunar and mitral (atrioventricular) valves that are tricuspid.&quot; Where is the reference to that? Mitral valve is also called the left atrioventricular valve. Tricuspid valve is also called the right atrioventricular valve. Only mitral valve is bicuspid, all other valves are tricuspid in 4 chambered heart. In zebrafish all valves are bicuspid, they are at IFT, AVJ, and OFT. The authors do not mention IFT valve for some reason at all. The valve anatomy in 4 vs 2 chambered heart should be corrected and properly referenced; a simple schematic would be helpful for clarity.</p><p>2) &quot;… the developmental programs driving mitral valve…,less is known about arterial valves&quot; The reference Wu et al. cites more than 20 genes involved in arterial valve development. The rest of the Introduction mentions several signaling pathways involved in aortic valve formation. So meanwhile it is not entirely true that less is known about arterial valves. The Introduction would benefit if it is shortened and refocused on the current knowledge of the effect of mechanical forces on valvulogenesis.</p><p>3) Figure 1A-C: in the text a different transgenic is referred to then shown in the panels. What is the time point in Figure 1A?</p><p>4) Figure 2B: in the third panel, there are photoconverted cells anteriorly and posteriorly, where is the anterior cell located at 120 hpf? The photoconverted cells should be highlighted by a star in all panels, not just in one.</p><p>Consecutive panels for at least 3 embryos should be shown in the supplement.</p><p>5) The claim that AVC valve is delaminating should be referenced. Scherz et al., 2008, showed that in zebrafish AVC valve is forming by invagination and not via endocardial cushion formation, similarly to the process of OFT formation that the authors observe here. The conclusion that the OFT valve morphogenesis is unique is thus overstated. It is not clear what the authors mean when they say &quot;unique&quot;.</p><p>6) The rationale that invagination of the OFT endothelium might be aided by the adjacent tissue should be introduced more clearly. In Figure 1 and 2 only endothelial contribution is observed and shown, yet the authors claim that the cellular contribution of the valve lead them to the hypothesis of adjacent tissue contribution. What is the model?</p><p>In Figure 3, besides merged images, individual channels for Fibronectin, Elastin b, and endothelial marker should be shown. Counterstaining for Fibronectin and Elastin b should be performed together; from the images presented, not all fibronectin positive cells seem to be Elastin b positive, and the schematic is therefore misleading. If panel A' (Figure 3) is a zoom of panel A, and both are scale bar of 10 microns, why is the scale bar in panel A longer than in panel A'? it does not look like much of a zoom either. This should be revised.</p><p>The vascular smooth muscle cells of BA of the OFT are accrued to the ventricle after 48 hpf. This process was recently described e.g. by Felker et al., 2018. Even though the OFT valve formation is occurring concomitantly with the formation of BA, these two events should not be equated, as stated in the conclusions describing Figure 3. If the authors wished to compare OFT valve formation to AVC valve formation, they should provide additional panels of AVC valve for comparison or at least briefly recap the events of AVC valve formation.</p><p>7) What is the stage in Figure 4A and B? The reporters should be visualized with the markers for endothelium and elastin b. The channel for fli:nls-mCherry should be shown especially if the GFP/mCherry ratio is used for the quantification in 4D. How is anterior/posterior boundary defined at different stages for the purpose of the quantification in 4D if the endothelium is invaginating in the direction from posterior to anterior as the authors show in Figure 2? This seems to be arbitrary and misleading due to the dynamic nature of the forming valve. The division medial/lateral or luminal might be more appropriate. What are the individual data points in D? the n should be increased for 120hpf for klf2 reporter; n=2 is not enough! The description of how exactly the quantification was performed should be included, as this read-out is used in the subsequent experiments; is the intensity for both leaflets per embryo averaged? From a single section or z-stack?</p><p>Statistical test should be named in the figure legend.</p><p>8) In Figure 5, the GTIIC:d2GFP Yap reporter should be used together with the endothelial and nuclear marker and elastin b; from the images presented it is not clear how the dashed line was drawn in 5B. Furthermore, Yap reporter should be used together with the nuclear marker, and nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio should be quantified. The antibody staining for Yap appears to be cytoplasmic, which does not confer anything about its signaling activity.</p><p>The description of 5C should be rewritten; &quot;…a significant fraction of yap1 mutants displayed abnormal valves (17% at 72 hpf…&quot;, – 17% show normal valves, the text is misleading. The quantification of the phenotypes should be performed from at least 3 independent experiments, so that appropriate statistical test can be performed.</p><p>Yap1 mutants should be properly referenced.</p><p>If the Yap reporter is active in both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of BA, the statement that smooth muscle progenitors are likely to play a role in valve morphogenesis is a speculation and should be corrected. That Yap is essential for OFT valve development is an overstatement when 40% of the mutant embryos still form some sort of a valve structure.</p><p>Is the 5A' zoom of A? the ROI in A does not correspond to A'?</p><p>9) The myl7:GFP reporter line should be used to determine the heart morphology upon different tnnt2 MO doses. From the images presented nothing can be concluded about the MO effect, except perhaps a mild edema in B. The MO doses should be indicated either in the figure directly or figure legend. The BA size should be measured under these MO conditions; it is known that cardiac function may affect the BA size. What is the cut off for the heart rate in the &quot;slow-beating&quot; group? Also the authors should be consistent with the naming, use group 1/2 or beating/slow beating, but not both. The sample number of klf2 and notch reporter has to be increased; the reporters, especially the ones using destabilized GFP are very variable, n of 3 with the usual clutches of at least 100 zebrafish embryos under normal breeding conditions is just not acceptable. The activity of klf2 and notch reporter should be assessed at later time point – 120 hpf when the flow effects are more pronounced, assuming that the data presented are at 72 hpf; this information is missing.</p><p>In the experiments assessing the Fb1, Eln B and Yap abundance, both the smooth muscle cells of BA and endothelial cells have to counterstained, e.g. NO fluorescent indicator DAR4-AM is a reliable marker of the BA smooth muscle cells. It is not clear if the smooth muscles cells are present at all with the high dose of tnnt2 MO, and as such the &quot;missing&quot; staining can be simply a result of missing cells. In Figure 6D, at what time point the valve presence was quantified? n=9 for tnnt2 MO is very low; are the authors really injecting just 9 embryos?</p><p>The controls are completely missing in the experiments presented in Figure 6, with the exception of Figure 6D.</p><p>While the conclusion that klf2 and notch activity are flow-dependent is somewhat acceptable, as it also corroborates previously published data, the statement that BA smooth muscle cell identity depends on the mechanical forces is a speculation and not supported by any evidence. This should be corrected.</p><p>10) The penetrance of the phenotype of both klf2a and <italic>notch1b</italic> mutants is very low, so while these factors certainly contribute to OFT valve morphogenesis, the effect is mild. This fact should not be overlooked. What is the effect of the combined loss of klf2a and <italic>notch1b</italic>? n is very low, at least 3 independent experiments should be performed. The font of the graphs is too small and unreadable.</p><p>What do the numbers 64% and 56% represent at 48hpf regarding the <italic>notch1b</italic> expression in the manuscript text? From the graph it looks like about 70% of embryos do not show any <italic>notch1b</italic> expression in klf2a mutants at 48hpf. Similar issue is with 72hpf description of the effect. How do the authors define the difference between altered and absent expression? In the examples shown as altered no gene expression can be detected; the exemplary images for all groups should be shown. While loss of klf2a reduces <italic>notch1b</italic> expression it is not completely required.</p><p>In the absence of <italic>notch1b</italic>, the expression of klf2 is randomized and not mostly proper as concluded.</p><p>The n is too low in the experiments where notch signaling activity is assessed in klf2 mutants. Again at least 3 independent experiments should be performed. Individual data points should be presented. P values for Figures 7C, C' are wrongly written; (10-1 with 1 in superscript). What is the statistical test used?</p><p>The images of klf2a reporter expression in <italic>notch1b</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <sup>-/-</sup> should be shown.</p><p>The previous characterization of the mutants should be properly referenced.</p><p>The notch signaling activity seems to be reduced but not gone in the absence of klf2a.</p><p>The conclusion that klf2a regulates notch signaling in OFT valve endothelium is an overstatement, and should be corroborated. The data presented are not sufficient to claim this, and are based on assessment of 4 embryos of the reporter that is notoriously variable.</p><p>11) How many embryos were used to assess fractional shortening and RFF in the listed mutants? What is the time point for RFS? Individual data points should be plotted. Is the heart rate also unaffected? RFF is a measure for valve function not heart function, this should be corrected or explained better. RFF is assessed at 72 hpf when the valve only starts forming, what is the RFF at 120hpf when the valve leaflets formed?</p><p>The assessment of OFT valve morphology is performed in a low number of mutant embryos. Even in controls, 30% of embryos have still thickened valves, and thus the results should not be overstated; in a considerable percentage of the mutants or their combinations, the valves are still formed. The great variability of the phenotypes is especially apparent when the results of A and B are compared.</p><p>Therefore it is not evident that Trp and Piezo channels are necessary for the folding of the endothelium; they contribute to some extent to the process.</p><p>The data do suggest a redundancy between different channels though. What is the combined effect of trp and piezo channels? Especially the combination of trpp2 and piezo1 would be important to assess.</p><p>Where are these channels expressed, in the endothelium only or also in the vascular smooth muscle of the BA?</p><p>For the analysis of the Fn1, Elnb, and Yap markers again not sufficient number of embryos is assessed. Fn1 is also expressed in the endothelial cells as the authors show themselves in the Figure 3, and Elnb is a differentiation marker, thus using those two to conclude anything about the identity of the smooth muscle cells of the BA is not appropriate. The concerns here are similar as in the data presented in the Figure 6.</p><p>How do these markers look in trpp2 mutants?</p><p>The results of the experiments using klf2a reporter in piezo1 and trpp2 mutants are intriguing as they point out to the opposing effects of mechanosensors in regulating klf2a transcriptional activity.</p><p>There is not enough evidence that Piezo1 regulates the identity of smooth muscle cells of BA. What is the effect of loss of piezo1 on Yap reporter. Mere presence or absence of Yap in the cells is not sufficient to claim Piezo's role in Yap signaling.</p><p>12) The model in Figure 9 is speculative, and is not supported by enough corroborating evidence. The origin of the valve leaflets is tracked only by the optogenetic photoconversion of Kaede to endothelium, the authors do not trace any other cell type within the valve leaflets. While the presence of the vascular smooth muscle cells might affect the OFT valve morphogenesis, the authors do not test any active role of these cells in the valve formation. The role of mechanosensors of Trp an Piezo family in the process of OFT formation is overstated. The evidence points to the modulatory role; they certainly contribute but are not completely necessary for the process of OFT valve formation. There is not enough evidence presented that the mechanosensors play any role in the modulating cell fate or identity of the vascular smooth muscle cells of the BA. The Klf2a regulation of <italic>notch1b</italic> expression and its signaling activity in the valve endothelium is not supported by enough evidence and should be corroborated by functional assays; as presented now it is only a feasible hypothesis.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mechanically activated Piezo channel modulate outflow tract valve development through Yap1 and Klf2-Notch signaling axis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The critical issues have been adequately addressed and the reviewers believe the work will receive considerable attention in the field.

In particular, the increase in sample sizes for individual experiments is laudable. The finding that Fn1 and ElnB expression should be coupled with functional analysis should receive attention in the field as well.</p><p>Remaining points:</p><p>* Sample size: while the authors' issues with increasing the sample numbers due to embryo identification, the involved genotyping, etc. are understandable, stating that other papers did use similar numbers is not really a valid argument. Especially considering <italic>eLife</italic>'s emphasis on transparency and reproducibility, two repetitions of an experiment seem less than ideal. The authors should clearly state the full number of repetitions, etc. throughout the manuscript so the reader can make up her/his own mind about the numbers.</p><p>* Please check the issue with bicuspid/tricuspid valve architecture, as also raised by reviewer 3.</p><p>* The added schematic in Figure 1A is highly helpful. However, it has a remarkable resemblance (down to individual trabeculae shapes, color scheme, and labeling) to the schematic provided in Felker et al., 2018.

To assess if the localization of <italic>piezo1</italic> and <italic>trpp2</italic> mRNA could explain the differential function of these channels, we performed RNAscope assay at 72hpf (Figure 8—figure supplement 3A). We found that <italic>trpp2</italic> is ubiquitously expressed in the embryo, including in the different layers composing the OFT. Similarly, we found that <italic>piezo1</italic> is expressed in both endothelium and smooth muscles, albeit at a lower level than <italic>trpp2</italic>. To confirm these results, we generated a transgenic reporter line with 3kb of the <italic>piezo1</italic> promoter upstream of the start codon (<italic>piezo1:nls-Venus</italic>). We observed the expression of the reporter line mostly in smooth muscles at 72hpf (Figure 8—figure supplement 3B) and cells of the endothelium of the OFT valve. Trpp2 immunohistochemistry showed that Trpp2 is expressed in the endothelium and the smooth muscles confirming that <italic>trpp2</italic> is ubiquitously expressed in the OFT (arrow in Figure 8—figure supplement 3B). We agree that this point deserves more work to be clear. For clarity, we simplified the working model shown in Figure 9 since trpp2 and piezo1 may be active in both cell layers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the kdrl:nls-mcherry line appears to label only very few endothelial cells in the posterior OFT and the images here do not really match the schematic.

This point deserves more in-depth and proper quantitative analysis to make strong conclusions about the heterogeneity of <italic>kdrl</italic> expression and is beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, even though we are not sure if this <italic>kdrl:nlsmCherry</italic> line may display different expression levels because of the transgene insertion, it is possible that <italic>kdrl</italic> expression is heterogeneous in endothelial cells of the OFT.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) Z-section of the kdrl:nls-mCherry and fli1a:lifeact-eGFP in the OFT (<bold>B</bold>) Z-projection of the RNAscope of kdrl in the head and in the OFT (n=6 embryos).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44706-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] At times, the manuscript makes strong conclusions based on small sample sizes (i.e. total embryos analyzed, see below) and the expression of isolated marker genes. Several mutant phenotypes have highly variable penetrance and expressivity (i.e. yap1 mutants, subsection “Klf2, Notch signaling, and Hippo pathways are active in the OFT in different cell layers and are all necessary for proper OFT valve development”), the analysis of which is again hampered by low sample sizes and ambiguous description as to how mutants are identified (assumed Mendelian ratio? Genotyping of individual embryos? etc.). Several statements of necessity and &quot;dramatic&quot; phenotypes need reassessment, as the phenotypes rather indicate the studied genes contribute to robust OFT valve formation rather than being necessary (i.e. notch1b, klf2; see also below). Further, OFT valve formation is a somewhat specialized developmental process, yet the authors seem tempted to draw broad-stroke generalizations about mechanosensing from their findings in the Discussion.</p><p>* The authors analyze several mutants and state necessity and importance for valve formation. Overall, however, the phenotype analysis is plagued by several issues as presented, and rather suggests the studied factors might be at times dispensable yet contribute to robust valve formation.</p><p>In all figures with box diagrams, at times vast variability is captured (i.e. Figure 8G'), yet individual data points not shown. Individual data points should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight.

Percentage is used with exceedingly small sample sizes and becomes misleading in significance. Similarly for p-values, that are not sufficient to cover vastly incomplete penetrance of phenotypes. As examples:</p><p>a) The yap1 mutants have a seemingly increasing penetrance and expressivity of OFT valve phenotypes – yet the phenotype is reported for only 12 embryos (also, are these always the same 12 embryos?), resulting in 58% (6 or 7) of embryos with no valves at 120 hpf; that hardly seems to justify an &quot;important role&quot; but rather a contribution to robust valve formation.</p></disp-quote><p>N=12 corresponds to 2 independent experiments. These embryos were analysed and followed over time (i.e. at 72hpf, 96 hpf, 120hpf), so it is n=12 for each time point.

These embryo numbers are close to what has been published in the recent literature in other zebrafish cardiac studies recently published in <italic>eLife</italic>: See Guerra et al., 2018: Figure 5, n=17, n=12, n=7 or see Nguyen-Chi et al., 2015: Figure 1, n=12, n=3, n=11 or see Semmelhack et al., 2014: Figure 2, n=9).</p><p>We changed the text explanation and modified the sentence from “important” to “involved”.</p><p>To better quantify the penetrance of the <italic>yap1</italic> mutation, we now show both <italic>yap1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>yap1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> data in Figure 5B.

based on downregulated Fn1 and Elnb staining. While interesting, Fn1 and Elnb are functional/differentiation markers and not necessarily determinants of fate/identity (i.e. Moriyama et al., 2016), yet these observations might rather indicate that flow has a functional contribution to BA maturation. The authors are encouraged to perform a functional BA assay, i.e. active NO metabolism using DAF-2DA (Grimes et al., 2006) to underline the functional impact on BA formation. Further, the claim of Fn1 expression in smooth muscle is not well-funded based on the provided images in Figure 3 and should be shown more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify the expression domain of Fn1, we used DAF-FMDA assay (similar to the DAF-2DA assay, it reveals active NO metabolism) on wild-type embryos counterstained with Fn1 antibody. These co-stainings revealed the presence of DAF-FMDA activity and Fn1 in the same cells of the OFT at 72hpf, 96hpf and 120hpf, except for the Fn1 staining within the valves. These data are now provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We conclude that Fn1 is localized in smooth muscle cells of the OFT.</p><p>For clarity, we also changed the figure panel to provide inverted LUT images of Fn1 and Elnb to make this clearer (Figure 3B, C, D, B’, C’, D’).</p><p>To assess the functional impact of mechanical forces on BA formation, we performed the DAFFMDA assay on the <italic>tnnt2a</italic>-morpholino injected embryos and <italic>piezo1</italic> mutants. We also used this assay to measure the BA diameter. In <italic>tnnt2a</italic>-morpholino injected embryos with slow beating (n=6), we observed a smaller BA (diameter=36,1µm ± 4,5, p=10<sup>-3</sup>) and lower fluorescence intensity (intensity=1,4 ± 0,4, p&lt;0,05) than in the <italic>tnnt2a</italic>-morpholino injected embryos displaying normal heartbeat (n=7, BA diameter=47,4µm ± 3,7 and intensity=3,0 ± 1,6). By contrast, the BA size as well as the fluorescence intensity in the <italic>piezo1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos (n=8, BA diameter=50,5µm ± 4,1, intensity=2,7 ± 1,5) were not significantly different from the <italic>piezo1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (n=7, BA diameter=51,3µm ± 3,9, intensity=2,7 ± 1,4) measurements. We conclude that heart activity is required for BA maturation but not <italic>piezo1</italic>, even though <italic>piezo</italic> mutant display abnormal Fn1 and Elnb expression. We added these data to Figure 6E and Figure 8D and Figure 8—figure supplement 2B.

Mitral valve is also called the left atrioventricular valve. Tricuspid valve is also called the right atrioventricular valve. Only mitral valve is bicuspid, all other valves are tricuspid in 4 chambered heart. In zebrafish all valves are bicuspid, they are at IFT, AVJ, and OFT. The authors do not mention IFT valve for some reason at all. The valve anatomy in 4 vs 2 chambered heart should be corrected and properly referenced; a simple schematic would be helpful for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and clarified these issues in the text.

Scherz et al., 2008, showed that in zebrafish AVC valve is forming by invagination and not via endocardial cushion formation, similarly to the process of OFT formation that the authors observe here. The conclusion that the OFT valve morphogenesis is unique is thus overstated. It is not clear what the authors mean when they say &quot;unique&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing that out. Pestel et al., 2016; Grunewald et al., 2018 and Steed et al., 2016 have recently described AVC valve morphogenesis at cellular resolution and showed that the AVC valve forms via endocardial cushion formation. This has been extensively discussed in different research and review articles (Paolini et al., 2018; Donat et al., 2018, Steed, Boselli et al., 2016) and it is now well accepted in the field that zebrafish AVC valves do not form solely via invagination. This is why we consider OFT valve formation to be different from AVC valve formation. This is now clarified in the text. In addition, we have added a Figure 2—figure supplement 1B where we compare the valve formation in the AVC and OFT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The rationale that invagination of the OFT endothelium might be aided by the adjacent tissue should be introduced more clearly. In Figure 1 and 2 only endothelial contribution is observed and shown, yet the authors claim that the cellular contribution of the valve lead them to the hypothesis of adjacent tissue contribution. What is the model?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an exciting aspect of our findings. At this point we can only speculate about the contribution of the smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in the morphogenetic process. We are currently establishing protocols that allow us to follow OFT valve morphogenesis though time-lapse analysis. We hope that once established, live imaging will provide us with a better understanding of the contribution of these cell layers during OFT valve morphogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3, besides merged images, individual channels for Fibronectin, Elastin b, and endothelial marker should be shown. Counterstaining for Fibronectin and Elastin b should be performed together; from the images presented, not all fibronectin positive cells seem to be Elastin b positive, and the schematic is therefore misleading. If panel A' (Figure 3) is a zoom of panel A, and both are scale bar of 10 microns, why is the scale bar in panel A longer than in panel A'? it does not look like much of a zoom either. This should be revised.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show the individual channels. Fibronectin and Elastinb antibodies have been raised in the same organisms so it is not possible to perform co-labeling but we agree that it is possible that not all fibronectin positive cells are elastin b positive.

This process was recently described e.g. by Felker et al., 2018. Even though the OFT valve formation is occurring concomitantly with the formation of BA, these two events should not be equated, as stated in the conclusions describing Figure 3. If the authors wished to compare OFT valve formation to AVC valve formation, they should provide additional panels of AVC valve for comparison or at least briefly recap the events of AVC valve formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a comparison with AVC valve formation requires clarification and we have now added Figure 2—figure supplement 1B comparing the formation of AVC and OFT valves.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) What is the stage in Figure 4A and B? The reporters should be visualized with the markers for endothelium and elastin b. The channel for fli:nls-mCherry should be shown especially if the GFP/mCherry ratio is used for the quantification in 4D. How is anterior/posterior boundary defined at different stages for the purpose of the quantification in 4D if the endothelium is invaginating in the direction from posterior to anterior as the authors show in Figure 2? This seems to be arbitrary and misleading due to the dynamic nature of the forming valve. The division medial/lateral or luminal might be more appropriate. What are the individual data points in D? the n should be increased for 120hpf for klf2 reporter; n=2 is not enough!

From the images presented nothing can be concluded about the MO effect, except perhaps a mild edema in B. The MO doses should be indicated either in the figure directly or figure legend. The BA size should be measured under these MO conditions; it is known that cardiac function may affect the BA size. What is the cut off for the heart rate in the &quot;slow-beating&quot; group? Also the authors should be consistent with the naming, use group 1/2 or beating/slow beating, but not both. The sample number of klf2 and notch reporter has to be increased; the reporters, especially the ones using destabilized GFP are very variable, n of 3 with the usual clutches of at least 100 zebrafish embryos under normal breeding conditions is just not acceptable.
