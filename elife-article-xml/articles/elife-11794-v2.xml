conserved quality control pathway that targets the associated mRNA and nascent polypeptide chain (NC). In this pathway, the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) complex promotes the ubiquitylation and degradation of NCs remaining stalled in the 60S subunit. NC stalling is recognized by the Rqc2/Tae2 RQC subunit, which also stabilizes binding of the E3 ligase, Listerin/Ltn1. Additionally, Rqc2 modifies stalled NCs with a carboxy-terminal, Ala- and Thr-containing extension—the 'CAT tail'. However, the function of CAT tails and fate of CAT tail-modified ('CATylated') NCs has remained unknown. Here we show that CATylation mediates formation of detergent-insoluble NC aggregates. CATylation and aggregation of NCs could be observed either by inactivating Ltn1 or by analyzing NCs with limited ubiquitylation potential, suggesting that inefficient targeting by Ltn1 favors the Rqc2-mediated reaction. These findings uncover a translational stalling-dependent protein aggregation mechanism, and provide evidence that proteins can become specifically marked for aggregation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11794.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11794.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11794.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells use molecular machines called ribosomes to build proteins by connecting amino acids – the building blocks of proteins – together in a particular sequence. The chain of amino acids gradually lengthens as the protein forms, yet remains attached to the ribosome until the protein is complete.</p><p>While this process is underway, cells can check that a newly forming chain is not abnormal or damaged. If it is, a cell then essentially ‘decides’ on whether to correct or eliminate it. Such protein quality control processes are important for ensuring the health and fitness of cells and organisms. Recently, a new protein quality control mechanism was discovered that senses when a ribosome becomes jammed as it produces a new protein. This mechanism recycles the ribosome so it can make more new proteins. It also disposes of the stalled protein using a cell complex, called the ribosome-associated quality control complex, which is found in all eukaryotic organisms including yeast and humans. This protein complex consists of three subunits; one of which, called Rcq2, tags ribosome-stalled proteins with a “tail” that contains the amino acids alanine and threonine. However, the purpose of this tag was not clear.</p><p>Yonashiro, Tahara et al. now show that the tagging of ribosome-stalled proteins by Rqc2 in yeast cells induces the tagged proteins to clump together. This clumping probably prevents these proteins from inadvertently interfering with other molecules or processes within the cell. The formation of these clumps also correlates with the activation of a stress response in the cell, indicating that these clumps create a signal that prompts the cell to protect itself in response to the accumulation of more abnormal proteins.</p><p>Mutations in one subunit of the ribosome-associated quality control complex in mice cause a condition that resembles a neurological disease in humans, called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS for short. A future challenge is therefore to understand how much Rqc2-mediated tagging and clumping of ribosome-stalled protein has a role in this and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11794.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11794.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>RQC</kwd><kwd>CAT tail</kwd><kwd>listerin</kwd><kwd>ltn1</kwd><kwd>rqc2</kwd><kwd>NEMF</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202144/2011-9</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tahara</surname><given-names>Erich B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32AG039127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Savas</surname><given-names>Jeffrey N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM103533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yates</surname><given-names>John R</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH067880</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yates</surname><given-names>John R</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM31107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Craig</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mogk</surname><given-names>Axel</given-names></name><name><surname>Bukau</surname><given-names>Bernd</given-names></name><name><surname>Joazeiro</surname><given-names>Claudio AP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS075719</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joazeiro</surname><given-names>Claudio AP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA152103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joazeiro</surname><given-names>Claudio AP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rqc2-mediated modification of ribosome-stalled nascent chains with &quot;CAT tails&quot;

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Comyn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lykke-Andersen and Bennett, 2014</xref>). Ribosome stalling poses a problem, as it can both reduce the pool of translation-competent ribosomes and give rise to aberrant—and potentially toxic—nascent polypeptide chains (NCs). To prevent these undesirable consequences from taking place, stalled ribosomes are rescued by factors that split the subunits, releasing the mRNA (for degradation by the exosome), the 40S subunit, and the 60S subunit stalled with a nascent peptidyl-tRNA conjugate, which is then targeted by the RQC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Comyn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lykke-Andersen and Bennett, 2014</xref>). The RQC is minimally composed of the Ltn1 (Listerin in mammals), Rqc1, and Rqc2/Tae2 (NEMF in mammals) subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Defenouillere et al., 2013</xref>). How the RQC functions has only begun to be understood. According to the current model, Rqc2 first recognizes the stalled 60S and facilitates binding of the Ltn1 E3 ligase, which, in turn, ubiquitylates the aberrant NC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lyumkis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shao et al., 2015</xref>). Next, in a manner dependent on Rqc1, the Cdc48/VCP AAA ATPase and its ubiquitin-binding cofactors are recruited to the complex and facilitate NC delivery to the proteasome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Defenouillere et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Verma et al., 2013</xref>). It has been recently discovered that Rqc2 can, in addition, recruit Ala- or Thr-loaded tRNA to promote the C-terminal elongation of stalled NCs in a template- and 40S ribosomal subunit-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). Such 'CAT tails' have no defined sequence and are heterogeneous in length, forming a smear extending as much as 5 kDa above the unmodified reporter band in SDS-PAGE. The physiological relevance of this process has remained unclear, however, as so far it has only been reported for Ltn1- or Rqc1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, the fate of CATylated NCs has remained unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stalled translation can lead to the formation of nascent chain aggregates</title><p>We observed that, in <italic>ltn1</italic>△ cells, in addition to the previously described increased steady-state levels and 'CATylation' of stalling reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shen et al., 2015</xref>), a fraction of those reporters migrated very slowly in gel electrophoresis, close to the loading well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; in the experiments presented, smears due to CATylation often run close to the unmodified reporter band, and can be more clearly observed with the smaller molecular weight reporters, PtnA-NS and GRR; see also below).

In a second set of reporters, the Protein A ZZ domain (PtnA) is followed by a stop codon (STOP-Rz), by a wild type self-cleaving ribozyme sequence (NS-Rz), or by a mutant ribozyme (<italic>rz</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle panel, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>]). In the case of the NS-Rz reporter mRNA, translating ribosomes stall as they reach the 3’end of the cleaved mRNA with no stop codons present; on the other hand, with the mutant <italic>rz</italic> reporter, the mRNA fails to be cleaved, allowing translation to proceed through an in-frame GFP sequence without stalling. In a third set of experiments, a GFP-12(Arg)-RFP fusion protein (GRR) was utilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel, and ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ito-Harashima et al., 2007</xref>]). In this case, stalling occurs as a result of the presence of multiple unpreferred Arg CGN codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Letzring et al., 2013</xref>). Despite their unrelated encoded protein sequences and distinct stalling mechanisms, we were able to observe slow-migrating species for all stalling reporters examined, but not their respective parental controls (e.g., K0, STOP-Rz). The formation of slow-migrating reporter species thus appears to be translational stalling-dependent.</p><p>We next investigated the nature of these high-molecular weight species. Slow migration was not due to Ltn1-independent poly-ubiquitylation of stalling reporters, since migration was not shifted after treatment with the deubiquitylating enzyme, Usp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kaiser et al., 2011</xref>]). We reasoned that those species might instead correspond to insoluble aggregates. Consistent with this possibility, slow-migrating reporter species were efficiently sedimented by centrifugation under conditions normally used to pellet protein aggregates (see, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koplin et al., 2010</xref>]), in contrast to a soluble protein (Pgk1) or the bulk of high-molecular weight poly-ubiquitylated proteins in the extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The ability to observe aggregates of stalling reporter proteins by western-blot implies that those aggregates are resistant to solubilization by boiling in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), as samples for the experiments above were subjected to this treatment prior to gel running. Resistance to ionic detergents is characteristic of ordered fibrillar structures such as the amyloid formed by yeast prions or by expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Toyama and Weissman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liebman and Chernoff, 2012</xref>]). To our knowledge, this is the first report of E3 dysfunction leading to formation of aggregates sharing properties with amyloid.</p><p>However, in contrast to its effects on stalling reporters, deletion of <italic>LTN1</italic> failed to affect levels or stimulate aggregation of a Huntingtin exon 1 polyQ-GFP reporter carrying either a disease-associated expansion (Htt Q72) or a normal length tract (Htt Q25; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krobitsch and Lindquist, 2000</xref>]). Thus, loss of Ltn1 function is not associated with the increased formation of protein aggregates in general, but rather appears to be specifically associated with stalled NC aggregation.</p><p>To further verify that ribosome stalling is required for NC aggregation, we took advantage of the knowledge that the Hel2 protein is required for polybasic tract-mediated translational stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, in a <italic>hel2</italic>△ background, ribosomes translating a 12-Lys tract in a stop codon-containing reporter (K12) would be expected to translate through the tract, reach the stop codon, and terminate translation normally, releasing the NC; on the other hand, the stalling of ribosomes translating a <italic>bona fide</italic> non-stop mRNA (e.g., NS) would not be expected to be prevented by <italic>HEL2</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>).

As predicted by the hypothesis, while overexpression of wild type Rqc2 led to the quantitative conversion of the stalling reporter into aggregated forms, the Rqc2 D98Y mutant was unable to promote stalling reporter aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Overexpression of wild type Rqc2 also led to more quantitative conversion of monomeric to CATylated and aggregated forms of the stalling reporter in <italic>ltn1</italic>△ cells, suggesting that endogenous Rqc2 is limiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, differently from what we had observed for Hel2 requirement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the CAT tail synthesis requirement for aggregation was evident with all stalling reporters examined, including NS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Yet, this requirement appeared to be specific to stalling reporters, as <italic>RQC2</italic> deletion did not affect polyQ reporter aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>The hypothesis also predicted that hard-coding a CAT tail on a stop codon-containing reporter construct might bypass the requirements for both stalling and Rqc2 for protein aggregation. To test this possibility, we generated a construct in which a tract of 10 Ala-Thr repeats [(AT)10] was fused to the C-terminus of the control reporter K0 with the intent to mimic a CAT tail, followed by stop codons. The (AT)10 reporter has no stalling sequence, so its encoded protein is not expected to be a target of the RQC. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, (AT)10, but not homopolymeric constructs with 20 Ala (A20) or 20 Thr (T20), was indeed able to form aggregates. Given that homopolymeric Ala tracts have been previously implicated in amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht and Mundlos, 2005</xref>), we presume that polyAla sequences may need to be longer in order to form aggregates under the conditions utilized here. Thus, the combination of Ala and Thr as found in CAT tails appears to be more prone to aggregate, which can be observed with a sequence as short as 20 amino acids long. These results suggest that, in addition to being required, CAT tails can also be sufficient for aggregate formation.</p><p>Arguing against the possibility of reporter aggregation being a post-lysis artifact, mixing <italic>ltn1</italic>△ cells with K12-expressing <italic>ltn1</italic>△ <italic>rqc2</italic>△ cells immediately prior to cell lysis did not support aggregate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In order to obtain further evidence for the formation of NC aggregates in intact cells, we examined the distribution of the GRR stalling reporter under fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In the WT strain transformed with GRR, the low GFP signal was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, with 1–3 local accumulations of signal being observed; in contrast, <italic>LTN1</italic> deletion led to the appearance of numerous GFP <italic>punctae</italic>, characterized by foci with intense brightness over a low, diffuse cytosolic fluorescence background, in a third of cells [i.e., 15 out of 45 cells showing this phenotype; we note that aggregate formation in the <italic>ltn1</italic>△ strain is limited by endogenous Rqc2 levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> above)]. GFP <italic>punctae</italic> formation in <italic>ltn1</italic>△ cells depended on Rqc2-mediated CATylation, as evidenced by the finding that the phenomenon could be suppressed by <italic>RQC2</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and subsequently rescued by overexpression of Rqc2 wild type but not D98Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

We presume this could be due to a detection issue, since GFP K-less was expressed at lower steady-state levels compared to GFP, perhaps due to imperfect folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sokalingam et al., 2012</xref>) [see shorter exposure; indeed, Rqc2- and stalling-dependent K-less reporter aggregates became evident in wild type cells treated with proteasome inhibitor and after concentrating the samples by affinity purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>)].</p><p>The formation of stalling reporter aggregates in wild type cells was more conspicuous when analyzing a different set of reporters, based on Protein A ZZ domain-Rz construct (described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Wild type cells transformed with stop codon-containing controls or Rz-dependent stalling constructs were analyzed for PtnA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Regardless of whether or not they contained lysines, PtnA-STOP-Rz reporters exhibited a similar expression pattern, consisting of a major band of the expected size of the PtnA ZZ domain (lanes 1 and 3). As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the PtnA-NS-Rz construct additionally encoded a protein corresponding in size to the product of full-length, uncleaved PtnA-(Rz)-GFP (lane 2). In contrast, in wild type cells expressing the PtnA-NS-Rz K-less construct, a band corresponding to the PtnA ZZ domain was not evident; instead, smears corresponding to its CATylated and aggregated forms were conspicuous (lane 4; compare to lane 2). We interpret this result as indicating that stalled NC encoded by the truncated PtnA-NS-Rz mRNA are normally targeted for degradation (compare lanes 1 and 2), but targeted for CATylation and aggregation if lysine ubiquitylation sites are not readily available. Furthermore, we conclude that Rqc2-dependent CATylation and aggregation of stalled NCs can both be observed in wild type cells with a functional RQC complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Stalled NC metabolism has recently emerged as a paradigm for the understanding of co-translational quality control, and includes mechanisms for handling aberrant NCs along with their encoding mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Comyn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lykke-Andersen and Bennett, 2014</xref>). In the context of the RQC complex, while Ltn1 mediates stalled NC ubiquitylation, Rqc2 mediates their CATylation (in addition to playing a non-essential role in supporting Ltn1 function). Rqc2 residues implicated in CAT tail synthesis are conserved in evolution, suggesting an important function, but the fate of CAT tail-modified proteins had remained unknown. CATylation was not essential for Ltn1-mediated NC degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Rather, here we report that CATylation promoted formation of NC aggregates—yet another process operating in stalled NC quality control. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that proteins can become specifically marked for aggregation.</p><p>Although physical characterization of NC aggregates remains to be carried out, evidence presented here indicate shared features with amyloid, including their dependency on a low-complexity aminoacid sequence bearing similarity to polyAla tracts, detergent insolubility, and binding to the J protein, Sis1. With regard to the latter, accumulating evidence suggests that Sis1 may function as an amyloid-recognition factor that enables Ssa- and Hsp104-mediated disassembly or random fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harris et al., 2014</xref>). This proposed function provides a plausible explanation for our observation that Sis1 depletion led to increased NC aggregate levels, although it remains unclear whether and how regulation of presumably antagonistic Rqc2 and Sis1 activities controls steady-state levels of NC aggregates.</p><p>NC aggregation could have different functions, such as in sequestering aberrant NCs into forms less likely to interfere with cellular activities, or in mediating NC elimination <italic>via</italic> vacuolar degradation. Furthermore, NC aggregate formation correlates with the CATylation-dependent activation of Heat Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1) signaling observed in Ltn1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). As protein aggregation has been previously shown to elicit Hsf1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zou et al., 1998</xref>), another conceivable role for NC aggregation is therefore in inducing translational stress signaling. On the other hand, excessive aggregate production certainly has the potential to cause toxicity. With these possibilities in mind, it will be important for future studies to investigate the role of NC aggregation in the neurodegenerative phenotype of Listerin-mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were: anti-Protein A (Sigma, St. Louis, MI), anti-ubiquitin (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), anti-Sis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yan and Craig, 1999</xref>), anti-Ydj1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yan and Craig, 1999</xref>), and anti-Ssa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lopez-Buesa et al., 1998</xref>).

Peptide counts of co-IP’ed chaperones are shown. As represented in diagrams in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the K0 and K12 reporters consist of a GFP-Flag-<italic>HIS3</italic> backbone. Thus, <italic>HIS3</italic> peptide counts, which were the most abundant in the analyses, are presumed to be derived from the IP’ed reporter. We note that these analyses have limited ability to distinguish among homologous proteins with high degree of similarity, such as Ssa1/Ssa2, Hsc82/Hsp82, and Ssb1/Ssb2.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11794.012">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11794.012</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="msword" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-11794-supp1-v2.doc"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD2-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11794.013</object-id><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Strain genotypes.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11794.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11794.013</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="msword" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-11794-supp2-v2.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alberti</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Halfmann</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Kapila</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindquist</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2009">2009</year><article-title>A systematic survey identifies prions and illuminates sequence features of prionogenic proteins</article-title><source>Cell</source><volume>137</volume><fpage>146</fpage><lpage>158</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.cell.2009.02.044</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Albrecht</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mundlos</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2005">2005</year><article-title>The other trinucleotide repeat: polyalanine expansion disorders</article-title><source>Current Opinion in Genetics &amp;

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors describe the role of a ribosome quality control subunit Rqc2 in recruitment of alanine- and threonine-charged tRNAs to trigger the tagging of NCs with C-terminal Ala/Thr extensions (CAT tails). CAT tails foster the formation of SDS-resistant protein aggregates. This process is favored when ubiquitylation is inhibited by inactivation of Ltn1 or Rcq1. Importantly, they show aggregate formation of endogenous stalled NCs and provide evidence that CATylation and aggregation does also occur in wild-type cells. The manuscript is nicely written, the experiments are technically sound and support the authors’ conclusions. Altogether the work reveals an important novel aspect of ribosome-associated quality control.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Following discussion among reviewers it was agreed that two major points should be addressed to strengthen the role of aggregation and the chaperone Sis1 in this process.</p><p>1) The presence of Sis1 in the aggregates is intriguing. What happens to the RQC aggregate formation in cells lacking Sis1?</p><p>2) It would be nice to provide an explanation why the amount of free chain was not increased in the absence of aggregates – addition of poly-Lys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and depleting Rqc2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) abolished the aggregates formation. But why the free products (NS/K12) were not increased in a corresponding manner?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors study ribosome-associated quality control complex (RQC) that promotes the proteasomal degradation of ribosome-stalled nascent chains. It has been recently described that the lack of E3 ligase Ltn1, a subunit of ROC Rqc2 makes nascent chains modified with C-terminal Ala- and Thr-containing tails (&quot;CAT tails&quot;).</p><p>In this manuscript the authors nicely demonstrate that these CAT tails mediate the formation of amyloid-like nascent chain aggregates. It was proposed that Rqc2 acts as a CAT tail synthase that marks ribosome-stalled nascent chains for aggregation. CAT tails promote formation of insoluble nascent chain aggregates. Formation of NC aggregates was promoted after inactivating Ltn1 or by analyzing NCs with limited ubiquitylation potential, indicating that deficiency in Ltn1 promotes Rqc2-mediated NC CATylation and aggregation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript Yonashiro et al. investigate the role of the so-called CAT tail that is added to nascent polypeptide chains (NCs) on stalled 60S ribosomes. When ribosomes become stalled a ribosome quality control complex (RQC) comprising, Rqc1 and Rqc2 and the ubiquitin ligase Ltn1 is recruited to the 60S subunit. While Ltn1/Rcq1 are critical for the degradation of nascent chains by the UPS, Rqc2 was recently shown to recruit alanine- and threonine-charged tRNAs to trigger the tagging of NCs with C-terminal Alanine and Threonine extensions (CAT tail). So far, however, the fate of CATylated NCs has remained enigmatic.</p><p>Here, the authors provide evidence that CAT tails foster the formation of SDS resistant protein aggregates. Using different reporters they demonstrate translational-stalling dependent CATylation and aggregate formation. Moreover, they show that this process is mediated by Rqc2 and is favored when ubiquitylation is inhibited by inactivation of Ltn1 or Rcq1. Importantly, they show aggregate formation of endogenous stalled NCs and provide evidence that CATylation and aggregation does also occur in wild-type cells.</p><p>The manuscript is clearly written, the experiments are technically sound and do support the authors’ conclusions. Altogether the work reveals an important novel aspect of ribosome-associated quality control. Even though the function of NC aggregates remains to be fully elucidated, it could for example be linked to the observed neurodegeneration in Listerin-mutant mice as discussed by the authors. Given the novelty, significance and quality of the work I therefore do recommend its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) is an emerging topic with lots of surprises to be discovered. In this study, Yonashiro et al. reported that Rqc2 not only mediates the tagging of nascent chains with AT sequences, but also promotes their aggregation if the tagged nascent chains are not ubiquitinated or degraded. While the former finding was reported by Shen et al. (Science 347, 2015), the aggregation feature reported by this study is interesting and significant. In particular, it might shed light on the neurodegenerative phenotypes of mice lacking Ltn1.

What happens to the RQC aggregate formation in cells lacking Sis1?</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting question that we have addressed experimentally with successful results. Given that <italic>SIS1</italic> is an essential gene in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, in order to address the issue we have had to generate a Ltn1-deficient strain with <italic>SIS1</italic> expression under the control of a regulatable promoter (Tet-repressible, in our case). We show, using both biochemical and imaging data, that the <italic>ltn1</italic>∆ <italic>tetO7</italic>-Sis1 strain formed nascent chain aggregates under normal growth conditions, but that aggregate steady-state levels were greatly increased upon repression of Sis1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D and 3E</xref>). This finding is consistent with mounting evidence indicating that Sis1 enables the Hsp70 Ssa and Hsp104 to fragment or disassemble amyloid aggregates.</p><p> <italic>2) It would be nice to provide an explanation why the amount of free chain was not increased in the absence of aggregates – addition of poly-Lys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and depleting Rqc2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) abolished the aggregates formation. But why the free products (NS/K12) were not increased in a corresponding manner?</italic> </p><p>The reviewers’ statement addresses results obtained from two very distinct experimental conditions – the effect of poly-Lys addition to cell extracts (former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and the in vivo effect of genetically depleting Rqc2 (former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) – so we discuss those results separately below.</p><p>Regarding the poly-Lys issue:</p><p>It is indeed the case that, even though poly-Lys addition to cell extracts led to a marked decrease in aggregate signal, the amount of monomeric nascent chains was not obviously increased under these conditions as might have been expected. One possibility is that in aggregate levels in the extracts were very low relative to monomeric protein, but that the antibodies used recognize the epitope better in the aggregate form (e.g., due either to avidity or to “masking” proteins being less abundant in the higher molecular weight range). Another possibility is that poly-Lys addition leads to fragmentation of aggregates; the signal from those fragments would be spread over a wide range of molecular weights in the gel lane, thus making detection difficult. Finally, it is possible that aggregates precipitated with the addition of poly-Lys, although we do not think this is likely because we were attentive to vortex and load the entire sample into the gels.</p><p>We tested these and other possibilities experimentally, but have had limited success in generating conclusive data one way or the other. We have therefore decided to remove the experiments involving poly-Lys altogether, since the point made by those results was not central to our findings.</p><p>Regarding the Rqc2 deletion issue:</p><p>For some of the results reported, including those in the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, reporter aggregate levels appear to be low compared to reporter monomer levels, so a detectable increase in the latter would not necessarily have been expected as a consequence of aggregates failing to form. Furthermore, we present more clear-cut results involving Rqc2 wt or D98Y overexpression over the <italic>ltn1rqc2Δ</italic>background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); by comparing these conditions, one can observe that the amount of free chain was clearly increased in the absence of aggregates. Likewise, in the <italic>ltn1∆</italic>background (i.e., with endogenous Rqc2 present) overexpression of Rqc2 clearly led to more quantitative conversion of reporter monomers into both CATylated and aggregated forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3: Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) is an emerging topic with lots of surprises to be discovered.

See, for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> – the signal from endogenous aggregates detected via Sis1 immunoblot appears to be more intense in Rqc1-null cells. Although the reviewer raises an interesting possibility, in the short time available for review it was not possible to address this point experimentally. We hope the reviewer agrees that this point is beyond the scope of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, it is clear that only the sequence of AT10 is able to trigger the aggregation of the GFP reporter. But in WT cells, AT10-tagged GFP is evidently resistant to degradation. Is there any explanation about this discrepancy?</italic> </p><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer that there is a discrepancy in the data. The AT10 reporter does have stop codons and has no stalling sequence, so it is expected to terminate translation normally; it aggregates because of Ala-Thr repeats hard-coded in the reporter sequence. Given that AT10 is not an RQC substrate, its levels are not expected to be different in WT cells in comparison to RQC-deficient cells. We have revised the text to clarify these points.</p><p><italic>4) The authors provide strong evidence that aggregates of the nascent chain is due to the &quot;CAT&quot; tailing. But it is still suggestive at most. It would be ideal to demonstrate that the aggregates indeed contain the unique AT sequence. Mass spectrometry might be possible in this case.</italic> </p><p>We are pleased with the reviewer’s statement that we “provide strong evidence that aggregates of the nascent chain is due to the &quot;CAT&quot; tailing.” We agree it would be nice to show that the aggregates indeed contain the unique AT sequence. Examining this is feasible, but would take long to address – we presume that the mass spec. approach may turn out to be challenging because CAT tails are heterogeneous and low-complexity sequences.</p><p><italic>5) The presence of Sis1 in the aggregates is intriguing. But what is the role of Sis1 in this process? Sis1 has been reported to influence prion formation (Harris et al. PLoS Genet 2014). What happens to the RQC aggregate formation in cells lacking Sis1?</italic> </p><p>Please see response under “Essential revisions” above.</p><p><italic>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the authors pointed out K-less R12 reporter could be modified but failed to form aggregates. Is Sis1 still interacting with these species? This is important information that could explain the different behavior of this reporter in wild type cells.</italic></p><p>We presume that the inability to detect K-less R12 aggregates was due to a detection issue, given that levels of the GFP K-less R12 reporter were characteristically lower compared to the GFP-R12 reporter.</p><p>Properly addressing the reviewer’s question is also made difficult by this difference in expression levels among the various reporters. Nonetheless, using a different reporter set (based on the Protein A ZZ domain-Ribozyme fusion) we now show that the PtnA-Rz K-less reporter could both be CATylated and form aggregates in wild type cells, so stalled K-less proteins do not appear to have a problem aggregating in general.</p></body></sub-article></article>
