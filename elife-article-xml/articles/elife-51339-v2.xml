during NK cell ontology are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we reveal a novel role for T-bet in suppressing the immature gene signature during murine NK cell development. Based on transcriptome, we identified five distinct NK cell clusters and define their relative developmental maturity in the bone marrow. Transcriptome-based machine-learning classifiers revealed that half of the mTORC2-deficient NK cells belongs to the least mature NK cluster. Mechanistically, loss of mTORC2 results in an increased expression of signature genes representing immature NK cells. Since mTORC2 regulates the expression of T-bet through Akt<sup>S473</sup>-FoxO1 axis, we further characterized the T-bet-deficient NK cells and found an augmented immature transcriptomic signature. Moreover, deletion of <italic>Foxo1</italic> restores the expression of T-bet and corrects the abnormal expression of immature NK genes. Collectively, our study reveals a novel role for mTORC2-Akt<sup>S473</sup>-FoxO1-T-bet axis in suppressing the transcriptional signature of immature NK cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NK cell</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA-sequencing</kwd><kwd>mTORC2</kwd><kwd>T-bet</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>gene signature</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI102893</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malarkannan</surname><given-names>Subramaniam</given-names></name><name><surname>Thakar</surname><given-names>Monica S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA179363</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malarkannan</surname><given-names>Subramaniam</given-names></name><name><surname>Thakar</surname><given-names>Monica S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MACC Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HRHM Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malarkannan</surname><given-names>Subramaniam</given-names></name><name><surname>Thakar</surname><given-names>Monica S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Nicholas Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malarkannan</surname><given-names>Subramaniam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Gardetto Family</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malarkannan</surname><given-names>Subramaniam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MACC Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thakar</surname><given-names>Monica S</given-names></name><name><surname>Malarkannan</surname><given-names>Subramaniam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Blood Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>T-bet suppresses the expression of immature NK cell-defining genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>NK cells are type one innate lymphoid cells known for their function in mediating both cytotoxicity and cytokine production in response to transformed or virally-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun and Lanier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vivier et al., 2008</xref>). In the bone marrow (BM) of mice, the expression of IL-15/IL-2 receptor β chain (CD122) is the hallmark of commitment to the NK cell lineage from the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosmaraki et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, the canonical definition of NK progenitor (NKP) is a Lin<sup>−</sup>CD122<sup>+</sup> cell without cell surface expression of NK-lineage marker NK1.1. However, the Lin<sup>−</sup>CD122<sup>+</sup>NK1.1<sup>−</sup> cells are still a heterogeneous population as approximately only one in ten cells can give rise to NK cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vosshenrich and Di Santo, 2013</xref>). Recently, the definition of NKPs has been refined to Lin<sup>−</sup>Flt3<sup>−</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>2B4<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>CD122<sup>+</sup>NK1.1<sup>−</sup> cells which have a 50% chance to develop into NK cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carotta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fathman et al., 2011</xref>). The other lineage cell type in the heterogenous Lin<sup>−</sup>CD122<sup>+</sup>NK1.1<sup>−</sup> population is yet to be fully-defined.</p><p>Following commitment, NK lineage cells go through step-wise developmental process to become functionally mature NK cells. The Lin<sup>−</sup>CD122<sup>+</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>CD49b<sup>−</sup> population represents the least mature NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Santo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Williams et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arase et al., 2001</xref>). Subsequent to the expression of CD49b, the developmental stages of murine NK cells further classified into three stages based on two cell surface markers CD27 and CD11b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayakawa and Smyth, 2006</xref>). The relatively immature CD27<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>−</sup> (CD27 single positive, SP) NK cells develop into CD27<sup>−</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> (CD11b single positive, SP) terminally mature with a transitional stage of CD27<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> (double positive, DP) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiossone et al., 2009</xref>). The terminal CD11b SP NK cells are also marked with expression of KLRG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huntington et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The developmental process is controlled by temporal activation of stage-specific transcription factors. Ets-1 and PU.1 regulate the transition from CLPs to NKPs, while E4BP4 is critical in the induction of CD122 and NKP commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colucci et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gascoyne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamizono et al., 2009</xref>). E4BP4 also induces the expression of Id2 and Eomes, both of which are critical in immature NK cells development and the transition to the later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Male et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yokota et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delconte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>). T-bet and Zeb2 have been shown to be critical for terminal NK cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Townsend et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Helden et al., 2015</xref>). The signaling downstream of IL-15 receptors are essential for regulating the expression of these transcription factors. PDK1 is required for the induction of E4BP4 during early NK cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). We have previously reported that mTORC1 is required for the expression of Eomes and the transition from CD27 SP to DP NK stage, while mTORC2 is required for the terminal CD11b SP NK cell maturation through mTORC2-Akt<sup>S473</sup>-FoxO1 axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although the cell surface markers have been useful in studying the development of NK cells, there are inherent limitations associated with them. The spectrum of NK cell developmental heterogeneity is unlikely to be fully defined by the current cell surface markers-defined stages. Based on the CD27/CD11b-defined stages, NK cells deficient in Id2, Eomes or Gata3 all fail to progress from CD27 SP to DP stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delconte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2016</xref>). Currently no well-defined model clearly explains developmental differences between these three NK models. In addition, the altered expression of CD27/CD11b in genetically-engineered mice does not necessarily result from developmental changes. The recent breakthrough in the quantification of transcriptome at a single-cell level has offered an unprecedented methodology in determining the cell identity and exploration of cellular heterogeneity. The definition of cell identities based on the expression of thousands of transcripts seems more reliable than the detection of limited number of cell surface markers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crinier et al., 2018</xref> has explored the murine and human NK cells from spleen and blood using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology and identified a novel population in the mouse spleen and revealed the conserved NK subsets in human and mice. However, the developmental heterogeneity of NK cells in the BM, the critical anatomic location of murine NK cell development, has not been explored.</p><p>In this study, we define the heterogeneity of murine CD3ε−CD122<sup>+</sup> cell from BM of wide type (WT) mice using scRNA-seq technology. The single-cell transcriptome analyses revealed three major cell types from the CD3ε−CD122<sup>+</sup> compartment: conventional NK cells, innate lymphoid cells 1 (ILC1), and cells with high transcripts contents of <italic>Cd3d/e/g</italic>. We define five distinct NK developmental subsets: an immature NK (iNK) cell cluster, three transitional NK (transNK) cell clusters, and a terminally mature NK (termNK) cell cluster. We explored the transcriptome-based cellular stage of Raptor- or Rictor-deficient NK cells. Unexpectedly, half of the Rictor-deficient NK cells are classified into the least mature iNK cluster which only comprise 25% of the WT NK cell in the BM. This is contradictory to cell surface markers-defined maturity with only the loss of terminally mature NK cells in <italic>Rictor</italic> conditional knockout (cKO) mice. As we previously proposed that mTORC2 regulates terminal NK cell maturation through promoting the expression of T-bet via Akt<sup>S473</sup>-FoxO1 axis, we explored the maturation status of T-bet deficient NK cells using scRNA-seq. Strikingly, more than 65% of T-bet-deficient NK cells are classified into the least mature iNK cluster and the expression of immature NK signature genes are highly up-regulated in the T-bet-deficient NK cells. Finally, deletion of <italic>Foxo1</italic> successfully rescued the developmental impairment of Rictor-deficient NK cells defined by both cell surface markers and developmental transcriptome markers. These findings revealed previously unappreciated role of mTORC2-Akt<sup>S473</sup>-FoxO1-T-bet axis in suppressing the immature NK transcriptional signature during the development of NK cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell transcriptome-based heterogeneity among CD3ε−CD122<sup>+</sup> cells</title><p>The BM is the anatomic location where most conventional murine NK cells develop. Thus, we decided to study the developmental heterogeneity of BM NK cells at single cell level using the 10X Genomics single cell gene expression system. To cover the broad NK cell developmental stages, we sorted the CD3ε−CD122<sup>+</sup> population from BM of the <italic>Rptor<sup>fl/fl</sup> Ncr1<sup>Cre/WT</sup></italic>, <italic>Rictor<sup>fl/fl</sup> Ncr1<sup>Cre/WT</sup></italic>, or <italic>Tbx21</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse and the corresponding WT control mouse. The post-sorting purity ranged from 90% to 98% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To validate the NK cell development phenotype specifically in these six mice used, we detected the expression of CD27 and CD11b via flow cytometry using the cells from BM and spleen of these six mice. Consistent with our previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), in the BM, most of the NK cells from the <italic>Rptor<sup>fl/fl</sup> Ncr1<sup>Cre/WT</sup></italic> mouse were CD27 SP. The NK cells from the <italic>Rictor<sup>fl/fl</sup> Ncr1<sup>Cre/WT</sup></italic> mouse were unable to fully progress to the CD11b SP stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and the T-bet-deficient mouse completely lost the CD11b SP NK compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>). The expression pattern of CD27 and CD11b on NK cells in the spleen also matched with previous reports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). There was no difference in surface expression of CD27/CD11b among the three WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>After sequencing the libraries, the initial quality control (QC) analysis indicates successful library assembly, optimal sequencing and good cell viability. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We started our analyses with a focus on exploring the heterogeneity of CD3ε−CD122<sup>+</sup> cells from WT mice using principal component analysis (PCA). To increase the clustering efficiency, cells from three WT mice were combined for analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews and Hemberg, 2018</xref>). After initial quality control and clustering analysis, we filtered out the contaminating cells from other lineages, particularly those that did not express <italic>Il2rb</italic> (data not shown). The clustering analysis of the remaining pure CD3ε−CD122<sup>+</sup> cells revealed that the cells from <italic>Tbx21</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mouse ordered from the Jackson Laboratory clustered separately from the <italic>Rptor<sup>fl/fl</sup> Ncr1<sup>WT/WT</sup></italic> and <italic>Rictor<sup>fl/fl</sup> Ncr1<sup>WT/WT</sup></italic> mice housed at the Medical College of Wisconsin animal facility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). These data revealed that different housing conditions could result in alteration in the transcriptome profile that leads to individual-specific phenotype in scRNA-seq analysis of NK cells.</p><p>Therefore, we scaled the sample variance to ensure the cells from different WT mice cluster together. At low clustering resolution, we found five distinct clusters of CD3ε−CD122<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Through exploring the differential expressed genes (DEGs) of each cluster, we found that Cluster #1 were conventional NK cells with high expression of <italic>Ncr1</italic> and three subunits (<italic>Klrb1a</italic>, <italic>Klrb1b</italic>, and <italic>Klrb1c</italic>) of NK1.1 and comprised majority of the CD3ε−CD122<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

Unbiased clustering analysis revealed five distinct NK clusters as shown using a tSNE plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The three WT mice contributed relatively equal to each cluster, and each wild type had relatively similar proportions of each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Based on this information, we deemed Cluster #1 and #5 as immature NK (iNK) cluster and terminally mature NK (termNK) cluster, respectively. We further defined Clusters #2, 3, and four as transitional NK stages (transNK1, 2, and 3, respectively).</p><p>Next, we sought to explore the identity of the three transNK clusters. TransNK1 represented a unique NK sub-population with high expression of genes encoding proteins involved in ribosomal biogenesis including ribonucleoproteins (<italic>Nop10</italic>, <italic>Nhp2</italic>, <italic>Gar1</italic>, <italic>Npm1</italic>, <italic>Npm3</italic>), RNA modification enzymes (<italic>Mettl1</italic>, <italic>Ddx21</italic>, <italic>Fbl</italic>), and GTPase related to nucleocytoplasmic transport (<italic>Ran</italic>, <italic>Ranbp1</italic>). We also found high expression of genes encoding the ribosomal subunits in this cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed significantly enrichment of transcription factors MYC and E2F in transNK1 cluster compared to all other cells, both of which are involved in cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conacci-Sorrell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). We also found major metabolic pathways were enriched in this cluster including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Fewer up-regulated transcripts were identified within the transNK2 cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This cluster was featured with high expression of Ly49 family members especially <italic>Klra4</italic> (Ly49D) and <italic>Klra8</italic> (Ly49H) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). As for the transNK3 cluster, we found multiple genes that belong to the category of immediate early genes (IEGs) were up-regulated (<italic>Nr4a1</italic>, <italic>Nr4a2</italic>, <italic>Nr4a3</italic>, <italic>Dusp1</italic>, <italic>Junb</italic>, <italic>Nfkbia</italic>, <italic>Nfkbid</italic>, <italic>Nfkbiz</italic>, <italic>Egr1</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This cluster is transcriptionally similar to the novel NK_3 cluster defined previously in the mouse spleen with up-regulation of genes including <italic>Pim1</italic>, <italic>Gadd45b</italic>, <italic>Bhlhe40</italic>, <italic>Irf8</italic>, <italic>Ccl3</italic>, <italic>Ccl4</italic> besides the IEGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crinier et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To further elucidate the relative maturity of the three transitional NK clusters, we explored the transcriptomic progression along the maturation process. The Euclidean distance indicated transcriptional similarity between transNK1 and transNK2, both of which had higher transcriptional similarity to the iNK cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In comparison, the transNK3 had higher transcriptional similarity to the termNK cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As NK cells progress along the developmental stages, a gradual expression and loss of distinct set of genes are expected to occur temporally. Most of these genes are uniquely and abundantly expressed at the two developmental extremes: the immature and terminally mature stages. Therefore, we calculated the module score of all five clusters based on the up-regulated or down-regulated DEGs of the iNK and termNK clusters. When we ordered the five clusters as iNK→transNK1→transNK2→transNK3→termNK, the module score based on the up-regulated DEGs of the iNK cluster or the down-regulated DEGs of the termNK cluster gradually declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, the module score based on the up-regulated DEGs of the termNK or the down-regulated DEGs of the iNK cluster gradually increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This indicated a sequential developmental progression of these five clusters in the order listed above. To further validate this notion, we analyzed the bulk RNA-seq dataset of CD27 SP, DP and CD11b SP NK subsets published previously and defined the up-regulated DEGs from both CD27 SP and CD11b SP NK subsets as the target gene list (named as ‘CD27/CD11b gene sets’ here) to calculate the module score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delconte et al., 2016</xref>). The overall low module score yield indicated the low coverage of the transcriptome in the 10X-based scRNA-seq dataset. Nevertheless, we still found a trend in increasing expression of genes for terminally mature NK cells and decreasing expression of genes for immature NK cells validating the order of clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The relative maturity of the five distinct NK clusters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The transcriptome similarity among the five NK clusters was evaluated by the hierarchical clustering analysis and visualized via heatmap.

Based on the transcriptional information, each cell from the five clusters were assigned to the pseudotime trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The pseudotime progression indicated the maturation order. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, we picked the far-left side of the trajectory as the root point as we found cells from iNK and transNK1 clusters mostly resided here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Based on this root point, the pseudotime dictated that the far-right side of the trajectory was the most mature population which was dominated by the termNK cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). The cells in transNK2 and transNK3 clusters spread across the trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In conclusion, based on the transcriptome signature associated with each cluster and the unbiased analysis of the maturation trajectory, we define the relative maturity of this five NK clusters as iNK→transNK1→transNK2→transNK3→termNK. It is important to point out that this relative maturity does not necessarily imply distinct developmental stages that all NK cells follow. As an example, the high expression of IEGs in transNK3 cluster implies an activated state. In this regard, transNK3 cluster may be a heterogenous population consists of NK cells from different developmental stages. Nevertheless, this relative maturity is instrumental in characterizing the NK cells from the knockout mice as shown below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transcriptional alterations of raptor- or Rictor-deficient NK cells at single-cell level</title><p>The expression of cell surface markers has been conventionally used to define cellular identity.

Previously, we have characterized the development of Raptor- or Rictor-deficient NK cells that do not possess mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). We found differential maturation impairment with Raptor-deficient NK cells accumulating at the CD27 SP stage while Rictor-deficient NK cells are impaired in transition from DP to terminal CD11b SP stage. We profiled the BM CD3<sup>−</sup>CD122<sup>+</sup> cells using scRNA-seq in these transgenic mice to validate whether transcriptome-based cell stage classification match with previous cell surface markers-defined maturity. We combined the mutant cells with their corresponding WT cells and conducted PCA-based clustering analysis. Strikingly, nearly all the Raptor-deficient CD3<sup>−</sup>CD122<sup>+</sup> cells clustered distinctly from the WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As illustrated in the t-SNE plot, Cluster #1 through #5 were dominated by WT cells, while Cluster #6 and #7 were mostly Raptor-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

This is a drastic contradiction to the cell surface markers-defined maturity which revealed only terminal maturation defects of Rictor-deficient NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This result was consistent with the high expression of iNK signature genes in <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO NK cells and short Euclidean distance between the WT immature NK compartments and all the Rictor-deficient NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Unlike the <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO sample, we could still detect transNK3 and termNK clusters in <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO NK cells with a reduction in percentage of termNK clusters compared to the littermate WT mouse consistent with reduced CD11b SP cells in <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and E</xref>). In summary, through machine-learning based classification, we found new insights into the maturity of Rictor-deficient NK cells that were previously masked by the cell surface markers-based definition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>T-bet-deficient NK cells had a transcriptional profile similar to the iNK cluster</title><p>In our previous report, we proposed that mTORC2 regulates the terminal maturation of NK cells through Akt<sup>S473</sup>-FoxO1-T-bet axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). As the impaired expression of T-bet in Rictor-deficient NK cells is potentially responsible for the maturation defects, we reasoned whether a large proportion of the T-bet-deficient NK cells are also transcriptionally similar to immature NK cells in WT, a phenomenon seen in <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO NK cells. To test this, we conducted the scRNA-seq experiment using CD3ε−CD122<sup>+</sup> cells from BM of WT and <italic>Tbx21</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. The PCA-based clustering analysis of CD3ε−CD122<sup>+</sup> cells from WT and <italic>Tbx21</italic> KO mice resulted in 12 distinct clusters with nearly complete separation between WT and <italic>Tbx21</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Based on the expression of key markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we found that Clusters #1–7 comprised of NK cells. Clusters #8–10 were ILC1, <italic>Cd3</italic><sup>high</sup>, and inflamed clusters, respectively. Both Cluster #11 and #12 were cycling cells with high expression of <italic>Mki67</italic> (Ki-67) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The G2M.Score (module score of genes associated with G2M phase of cell cycle) and S.Score (module score of genes associated with S phase of cell cycle) indicated that cells in the Cluster #11 were mostly in the S phase while cells in the Cluster #12 were mostly in the G2M phase (data not shown).

All three T-bet-deficient NK cells-dominated clusters (#5, 6, 7) presented similar module score pattern as the immature cluster #1 in all up- or down-regulated DEGs of iNK or termNK cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This pattern was also present in the module scores calculated based on the CD27/CD11b gene set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The transcriptional similarity between the least immature WT NK cells (Cluster #1) and the bulk T-bet-deficient NK cells (Clusters #5, #6, #7) were further manifested by the hierarchical clustering analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The short Euclidean distance among these clusters was even more striking when compared to the Rictor-deficient NK sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). When we applied the machine-learning-based classifiers, more than 60% of the T-bet-deficient NK cells were categorized into the iNK cluster and there were only few cells in the transNK3 and termNK clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Collectively, these data revealed that T-bet-deficient NK cells were less mature than previously defined by cell surface markers. Direct comparison of the bulk WT and <italic>Tbx21</italic><sup>−/−</sup> NK cells in the scRNA-seq dataset revealed that T-bet deficiency resulted in up-regulation of immature NK signature genes and down-regulation of terminally mature NK genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Within the 14 up-regulated genes (average logFC ≥0.25) in the iNK cluster from three WT combined analysis, we found 10 of those genes with significantly increased expression in T-bet-deficient NK cells compared to WT NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Within the 56 termNK cluster signature genes (average logFC ≥0.25), we also observed decreased expression of 18 genes in T-bet-deficient NK cells compared to WT NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

The extent to which T-bet suppresses the expression of immature NK signature genes is still unknown. To achieve a fair comparison and in-depth coverage of the transcriptome, we conducted bulk RNA-seq analysis using only the CD27<sup>+</sup> NK cells from BM of both <italic>Tbx21</italic> WT and KO mice. We first validated the expression of those 28 genes identified in the scRNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). As demonstrated in the heatmap, indeed nearly all the 10 iNK signature genes were significantly up-regulated and the 18 termNK signature genes were significantly down-regulated in the T-bet-deficient NK cells comparing to the WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). To investigate whether this up-regulation of immature NK signature genes is intrinsic to the loss of T-bet, we conducted mixed bone marrow chimera experiment and performed bulk RNA-seq analysis using CD27<sup>+</sup> NK cells from BM. Consistent with previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Townsend et al., 2004</xref>), we found absence of CD11b SP NK cells and significantly reduced KLRG1 expression on NK cells developed from T-bet KO donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). RNAseq analysis indicated up-regulation of immature NK genes in the absent of T-bet, emphasizing cell-intrinsic defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Through analyzing the bulk RNA-seq dataset from Rictor-deficient CD27<sup>+</sup> NK cells we published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), we found a similar pattern when we evaluated the expression of these 28 genes, consistent with the immaturity of the Rictor-deficient NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Next, to obtain a larger immature NK transcriptional signature, we analyzed the CD27/CD11b bulk RNA-seq dataset and found genes that have highest expression in the CD27 SP NK subset with more than one-fold increased expression comparing to both DP and CD11b SP NK cells. In total, we found 796 genes representing the transcriptional signature of the relatively immature CD27 SP NK subset. GSEA revealed that these 796 immature NK signature genes were significantly enriched in the T-bet-deficient NK cells comparing to the WT counterparts, emphasizing that T-bet is required to suppress the expression of genes associated with immature NK cells to a large extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In summary, these data revealed the previously unappreciated role of T-bet in suppressing the immature NK transcriptional signature during the development of NK cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>T-bet is unlikely to directly bind and suppress the expression of the bulk immature NK genes</title><p>With the novel finding that T-bet is required for the suppression of immature NK transcriptional signature, we sought to explore the potential mechanisms for the induction of immature NK genes in T-bet-deficient NK cells. One potential explanation is that T-bet, as a transcription factor, directly binds to the regulatory elements associated with immature NK genes and actively suppresses the expression of these genes. we reanalyzed the recently published T-bet ChIP-seq dataset generated using splenic NK cells and assessed whether T-bet directly targets the immature NK genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shih et al., 2016</xref>). With q-value set at 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> and focus on the protein-coding genes, we found a list of 654 T-bet-binding genes. Next, we used the GSEA to determine whether the T-bet-binding genes were enriched in the signature genes associated with either iNK cluster or CD27 SP NK subset. We found a significant depletion of T-bet-binding genes in the iNK cluster compared to all other cells, indicating that T-bet does not directly bind to the majority of these iNK signature genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, left). On the contrary, we found the T-bet-binding genes were significantly enriched in the termNK cluster comparing to all other cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right). Similarly, when comparing the CD27 SP with the CD11b SP NK subset in the bulk RNA-seq dataset, we found significant enrichment of the T-bet ChIP-seq peaks in the CD11b SP NK cells compared to the CD27 SP compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These data were consistent with T-bet being the master transcription factor in driving terminal maturation of NK cells. Nevertheless, we found several immature NK signature genes that are up-regulated in T-bet-deficient NK cells with direct T-bet binding of the regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The expression of these genes might be subject to direct suppression from T-bet.

Next, we explored the GSEA and looked for enriched or depleted transcription factors in both T-bet- and Rictor-deficient NK cells. Interestingly, we found that transcription factor FoxO1 was enriched in the T-bet-deficient NK cells comparing to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), a phenomenon that we have previously established in the Rictor-deficient NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2018</xref>).

These data prompted us to hypothesize that Foxo1, which has the highest expression in the CD27 SP subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2015</xref>), is essential in driving the expression of immature NK signature genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Deletion of <italic>Foxo1</italic> rescues the maturation of Rictor-deficient NK cells</title><p>Previously we proposed that hyperactive FoxO1 suppresses the expression of T-bet in Rictor-deficient NK cells leading to the terminal maturation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Based on the data we presented above, we hypothesized that FoxO1 promotes the expression of immature NK genes in both T-bet- and Rictor-deficient NK cells. Therefore, we asked the question whether deletion of <italic>Foxo1</italic> in Rictor-deficient NK cells could not only rescue the impaired expression of T-bet and the terminal maturation defect, but also correct the abnormal induction of the immature NK transcriptional signature. To address this question, we bred the <italic>Rictor<sup>fl/fl</sup>Ncr1<sup>Cre/WT</sup></italic> mice with <italic>Foxo1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Ncr1<sup>WT/WT</sup></italic> mice. To ensure efficient generation of experimental mice with littermate control, we used <italic>Rictor<sup>fl/+</sup>Foxo1<sup>fl/+</sup>Ncr1<sup>Cre/WT</sup></italic> mice as the WT control mice since both Rictor and FoxO1 are haplo-sufficient to the development of NK cells (data not shown). Due to the mixed background of these mice, we had large variation among each genotype most pronounced in terms of the number of NK cells in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Nevertheless, consistent with previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), we found a decrease in both percentage and absolute number of NK cells in the spleen of <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO mice compared to the WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Specific to the maturation of NK cells, <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO mice had a smaller terminally-mature population compared to the WT control indicated by either the percentage of CD11b SP subset or the KLRG1<sup>+</sup> NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), although the difference is less pronounced compared to the previous report likely due to the fact that the mixed background mice had generally more mature NK cells than the pure B6 background mice at the age of eight weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

These data indicated that FoxO1 is the transcription factor suppressing the terminal maturation program in Rictor-deficient NK cells. To further explore whether the impaired expression of T-bet is the downstream of hyperactive FoxO1 in Rictor-deficient NK cells, we evaluated the expression of T-bet in the <italic>Rictor</italic>/<italic>Foxo1</italic> cDKO mice.

The rescue was incomplete in the terminal CD11b SP NK compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Foxo1</italic> alone resulted in almost a fold increasing of the T-bet protein level in all three developmental stages compared to the WT control.

Consistent with the rescue, we also found increased expression of termNK signature genes in the <italic>Rictor</italic>/<italic>Foxo1</italic> cDKO mouse compared to the <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The correction of the abnormal expression of iNK signature genes in the Rictor-deficient NK cells via deletion of <italic>Foxo1</italic> were further manifested with the reduced expression of a few mostly highly expressed iNK genes in the <italic>Rictor</italic>/<italic>Foxo1</italic> cDKO mouse sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Whether the restored expression of T-bet, complete loss of FoxO1, or potentially both are responsible for the correction of the iNK gene expression requires further dissection in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The transcriptional programs that regulate NK cell development is not yet fully understood. Specifically, the transcriptional activation or repression during NK cell ontology is poorly defined. Here, we used scRNA-seq technology and found five distinct NK clusters in the BM of WT mice. Based on the expression of known markers and transcriptional similarity, we delineated the relative maturity of these five NK clusters. Based on the transcriptome information of the WT clusters, we utilized the machine-learning classifiers to define the identity of Raptor- or Rictor-deficient NK cells and found maturation profiles of these mutant NK cells distinct from the cell surface markers-based definition that we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). The striking immaturity of the Rictor-deficient NK cells promoted us to evaluate the maturation of the T-bet-deficient NK cells with single-cell transcriptome analysis. We found a higher percentage of immature NK cells in <italic>Tbx21</italic> KO mice than the <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO mice and significant up-regulation of immature NK transcriptional signature in T-bet-deficient NK cells, a phenomenon that was not previously appreciated. Lastly, through deletion of <italic>Foxo1</italic>, we completely rescued the maturation defects of the Rictor-deficient NK cells defined by both cell surface markers and the transcriptome.</p><p>With the profiling of CD3ε−CD122<sup>+</sup> cells from the BM of WT mice, we found two distinct cell subsets, the ILC1 and <italic>Cd3</italic><sup>high</sup> cells, besides the conventional NK population. These two cell populations presumably contribute to the heterogeneity of CD3ε−CD122<sup>+</sup>NK1.1<sup>−</sup> cells, the original definition of the NKP subset. We believe the <italic>Cd3</italic><sup>high</sup> cells are related to the NK-T cell lineage as this population contains high transcripts level of Cd3d/e/g and is nearly absent in the <italic>Tbx21</italic> KO mice which have fewer NK-T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Townsend et al., 2004</xref>). Further investigation of these unique <italic>Cd3</italic><sup>high</sup> cells is warranted to determine their developmental and functional relevance. Specific to the five clusters formed by the conventional NK cells, besides the reliably identifiable least mature (iNK) and most mature (termNK) clusters, we named the rest three clusters as the transitional NK subsets. TransNK1 are transcriptionally closer to the iNK cluster and demonstrates a proliferative phenotype with high ribosomal contents and active metabolic profile. TransNK3 represents a unique NK subset with high expression of IEGs similar to the novel NK_3 cluster defined previously in the mouse spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crinier et al., 2018</xref>). This group may be upregulating IEG’s as a part of the developmental process or they may be a unique NK subset that branches off late in the developmental process.</p><p>Although we could not find reliable cell surface markers to faithfully define these five WT NK clusters, it provides an important dataset that we can utilize to profile the NK cells from mutant mice whose transcriptomic profiles are distinct from WT cells. Previously, we have reported the differential role mTORC1 and mTORC2 in regulating the development of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Based on the cell surface markers expression, we found mTORC1 is important for the early NK cell maturation from the CD27 SP to the DP stage, while mTORC2 governs the terminal maturation program, transiting from the DP to the CD11 SP stage. However, through utilizing machine-learning classifiers, we found more immature NK cells in the <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO mice as compared to the <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO mice, contradictory to the cell-surface markers-defined developmental maturity. We further profiled the T-bet-deficient NK cells as we previously proposed that the impaired expression of T-bet is responsible for the terminal maturation defect of Rictor-deficient NK cells. Strikingly, we found even more immature NK cells in the <italic>Tbx21</italic> KO mice and a significant up-regulation of immature NK signature genes in the T-bet-deficient NK cells, which reveals a previously unappreciated role of T-bet in suppressing the immature program of NK cells.</p><p>The further exploration of the mechanisms underlining the suppressive role of T-bet in regulating the expression of immature NK genes indicated that T-bet binds the regulatory elements of only a few immature NK genes and suppresses their transcription in mature NK cells. The increased expression of large number of immature NK genes implied additional transcription factors downstream of T-bet may play a role. We proposed that, in addition to the well-established role of FoxO1 in suppressing the expression of T-bet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2015</xref>), T-bet can also suppress the expression of FoxO1 as the expression and activity of FoxO1 are increased in T-bet-deficient NK cells, and that this negative feedback loop is part of what transcriptionally defines mature NK cells as a lineage. Based on this information, we hypothesized that hyperactive FoxO1 in both the Rictor- and T-bet-deficient NK cells drive the expression of immature NK genes. One evidence to support this hypothesis is that deletion of Foxo1 in Rictor-deficient NK cells not only rescues the terminal maturation defects but also corrects the abnormal expression of immature NK genes. Additional experiments are required to fully establish the reciprocal regulation between FoxO1 and T-bet during the development of NK cells and their precise role in regulating the immature and terminal maturation programs.</p><p>In conclusion, we utilized scRNA-seq technology to define the developmental heterogeneity of NK cells in the BM. We further utilized these transcriptome-defined developmental clusters to reveal a previously unappreciated role of mTORC2-Akt<sup>S473</sup>-FoxO1-T-bet axis in regulating the expression of immature NK genes during NK cell development. More importantly, through using machine-learning algorithms, we present a novel approach to define cellular differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and reagents</title><p> <italic>Rptor<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Rictor<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Foxo1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, and <italic>Tbx21<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). <italic>Ncr1<sup>iCre</sup></italic> mice were a generous gift from Dr. Eric Vivier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Narni-Mancinelli et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Rptor<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Rictor<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Tbx21<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, and <italic>Ncr1<sup>iCre</sup></italic> mice are in C57BL/6 background.

The libraries were quantified using NEBNext Library Quant Kit (NEW ENGLAND Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and sequenced via Illumina NextSeq 550 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>scRNA-seq data analyses</title><p>After the sequencing, the raw data from each sample was demultiplexed, aligned to mm10 reference genome, and UMI counts were quantified using the 10X Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline (v2.1.1, 10X Genomics). Then, we continued the data analysis with the filtered barcode matrix files using the Seurat package (v2.3.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler et al., 2018</xref>) in R (v3.4.3 or above). For initial quality control, we filtered out the cells that expressed less than 200 genes or more than 2500 genes. We also removed cells with more than 5% mitochondrial transcripts content. Gene expression values for each cell were log-normalized and scaled by a factor of 10,000. To prevent clusters from being biased by cellular library size and mitochondrial transcript content, gene expression values were scaled based on the number of UMIs in each cell and the cell mitochondrial transcript content. We combined cells from all three WT mice to increase the power of unsupervised clustering analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews and Hemberg, 2018</xref>). Based on the PCElbowPlot, we picked certain number of principal components (PCs) for the clustering analysis when that number reached to the baseline of the standard deviation of PC. Specific to the choice of cluster resolution, we used the ‘Clustree’ function to visualize the clustering progression and picked the highest resolution that still gave stable clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zappia and Oshlack, 2018</xref>). Cell clusters were visualized using t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding plots (t-SNE). For differential gene expression, we used Model-based Analysis of Single-cell Transcriptomics (MAST) test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finak et al., 2015</xref>) with genes detected in a minimum of 10% of all cells, a minimum of 0.25 average log fold-change (logFC), and a minimum of 0.05 adjusted p value. For gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we used fgsea function with gene sets from the Broad Institute’s molecular signatures database (MSigDB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liberzon et al., 2011</xref>). All the p-value shown in the figures were adjusted for multiple gene sets enrichment comparison. In order to predict cellular differentiation, cells were ordered in pseudotime using Monocle2 (v2.6.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>). All significant DEGs across five NK clusters with more than 0.25 average logFC were used to order the cells. Finally, to predict the developmental cluster of the cells from the knock out mice, we utilized one of several classifiers including: a generalized linear model, a gradient boosting model, a deep learning neural network model, and a extreme gradient boosting model, from the H2O Python Module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiello et al., 2018</xref>). Further, we used the Seurat wrapper for the random forest classifier from the ranger package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwarz et al., 2010</xref>). These classifiers were trained on a random sample made up of 80 percent of the WT NK cell non-scaled transcription data, using cross-validation and accuracy as a target end-point for the classifier to avoid overfitting. The accuracy and error of the machine-learning classifiers was measured by using the classifier to predict the developmental cluster of the remaining 20 percent of the WT NK cells which had a known cluster identity and had not been used in the initial training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Bulk RNA-sequencing and data analysis</title><p>The bulk RNA-seq experiment using the CD27<sup>+</sup> NK cells from <italic>Tbx21<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and the WT mice (n=4 per group) was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2018</xref>).

We utilized the global T-bet-deficient mice as this was commercially available to us. Our requests to obtain the conditional knockout mice are in the process and is taking more time than we expected. Meanwhile, we have obtained additional global knockout mice towards performing bone marrow chimeras as suggested by the Reviewer. Irrespective of this, we worry that: a) this delay may negatively affect the ability to publish our work in a timely manner and b) our work on this direction may only be validation and may not result in a different set of findings.</p><p>We request the Editor and the Reviewer to kindly assess our request. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How were the Bcl2 and BH3 only member impacted by loss of Rictor? Is Foxo1 rescuing this phenotype via regulation of Bcl2l11? Foxo1 has been shown to regulate Bcl2l11 in NK cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank review’s comment. The expression of BH3 only member Bim (encoded by <italic>Bcl2l11</italic>) is increased in Rictor-deficient NK cells which may results from hyperactive FoxO1 (see Author response image 1). However, the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 is also proportionally increased in Rictor-deficient NK cells (see Author response image 1). We did not observe increased cell death in Rictor-deficient NK cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B in Yang, 2018). In addition, we did not observe changes in the mRNA level of other BH3 only member proteins (Bid/Bad) or other pro-apoptotic regulators (Bax/Bak1) in Rictor-deficient NK cells (see Author response image 1). Therefore, we conclude FoxO1 did not rescue this phenotype via regulation of Bim (encoded by <italic>Bcl2l11</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Only one mouse per condition was sequenced for the single-cell analysis.

When we performed single-cell RNA-seq experiments, we only used the WT and KO littermates which reduces the biological variation. About 2,000 cells from each genotype were sequenced which ensures the full representation of the population. More importantly, we have bulk RNA-seq analyses of Rictor- or T-bet-deficient NK cells with at least three biological replicates that strongly support our single-cell analysis.</p><p>Regarding the batch effect, there is no batch effect in comparison of each individual <italic>Rptor</italic>, <italic>Rictor</italic> or <italic>Tbx21</italic> KO NK cells with the corresponding WT NK cells as the WT and KO is always done in the same experiments. When we analyze the WT NK cells only (Figure 1 and Figure 2), we combined cells from all three WT mice to increase the power of unsupervised clustering analysis. We scaled the sample variance among those three WT samples which in the same time scaled the batch variation.</p><p>The default LogFC threshold of scRNA-seq analysis in the Seurat package is 0.25. The typical 1.5 to 1.2 cut-off is used in bulk RNA-seq analysis.</p><p>In Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, we have showed the nUMI, nGene and percent.mito of all samples.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The consensus reached between us suggests that to reach a favourable decision, data from either the use of Tbx21-conditional mice, or mixed Tbx21 bone marrow chimeras, are needed to avoid any possible indirect and unforeseen effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted mixed bone marrow chimera experiment using BM cells from CD45.1<sup>+</sup> WT mice and CD45.2<sup>+</sup><italic>Tbx21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with sublethally irradiated CD45.2<sup>+</sup><italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup>Il2rg<sup>-/-</sup></italic> as recipient mice. Eight weeks later, BM CD27<sup>+</sup> NK cells from recipients were sorted and subject to bulk RNA-seq analysis (cells derived from the same donor were pooled.). Splenocytes were also collected for phenotypical analysis using flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and 2B, we have confirmed the terminal maturation defects indicated by the loss of CD11b SP population and diminished expression of KLRG1 on NK cells derived from <italic>Tbx21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> donors, consistent with previous report (Townsend, 2004).</p><p>The analysis of bulk RNA-seq data revealed up-regulation of immature NK signature genes and reduced expression of terminally mature NK signature genes as shown in heatmap from Figure 5-figure supplement 2C. The expression pattern is similar to what we observed in bulk RNA-seq data derived from global Tbx21 KO mice (Figure 5F). This data indicates that Tbet intrinsically suppresses the expression of immature NK genes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
