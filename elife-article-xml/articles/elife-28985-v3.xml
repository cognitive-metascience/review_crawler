This process is mediated by direct translocation across the plasma membrane. Here, we define the minimal molecular machinery required for FGF2 membrane translocation in a fully reconstituted inside-out vesicle system. FGF2 membrane translocation is thermodynamically driven by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-induced membrane insertion of FGF2 oligomers. The latter serve as dynamic translocation intermediates of FGF2 with a subunit number in the range of 8-12 FGF2 molecules. Vectorial translocation of FGF2 across the membrane is governed by sequential and mutually exclusive interactions with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and heparan sulfates on opposing sides of the membrane. Based on atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a mechanism that drives PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent oligomerization of FGF2. Our combined findings establish a novel type of self-sustained protein translocation across membranes revealing the molecular basis of the unconventional secretory pathway of FGF2.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28985.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28985.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

(FGFs) form a family of more than 20 potent mitogens that stimulate the growth of a wide range of cells including fibroblasts and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bikfalvi et al., 1997</xref>). They are of critical importance for physiological processes such as embryonic development, tissue regeneration, wound repair and hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bikfalvi et al., 1997</xref>). FGF2 is the prototype member of this family that, beyond the functions of FGFs in normal cell growth and differentiation, plays critical roles under pathophysiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akl et al., 2016</xref>). This is particularly evident in the context of cancer with FGF2 being a major mediator of tumor-induced angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Presta et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, FGF2 acts as a survival factor that inhibits tumor cell apoptosis by an autocrine secretion-signaling loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pardo et al., 2006</xref>). This process is believed to represent a frequent cause of tumor cell resistance against conventional anti-cancer therapies.</p><p>As opposed to other FGF family members, FGF2 lacks a signal peptide and is transported into the extracellular space by an ER/Golgi-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nickel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nickel and Rabouille, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2008</xref>). The term unconventional secretion has been used for four different pathways of protein transport towards the plasma membrane and the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rabouille et al., 2012</xref>). Two of these pathways concern soluble proteins derived from the cytoplasm that are transported into the extracellular space by either direct protein translocation across the plasma membrane (type I unconventional secretion) or vesicular mechanisms involving endosomal compartments (type III unconventional secretion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rabouille et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang and Schekman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Piccioli and Rubartelli, 2013</xref>). Based on compelling evidence from both cell-based FGF2 secretion experiments and biochemical in vitro studies, unconventional secretion of FGF2 was shown to follow a type I mechanism that is based on direct protein translocation across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang and Schekman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malhotra, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nickel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schäfer et al., 2004</xref>). This process depends on sequential interactions of FGF2 with the phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the inner leaflet and heparan sulfate proteoglycans at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nickel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nickel and Rabouille, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nickel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Temmerman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zehe et al., 2006</xref>). Recruitment by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> triggers oligomerization of FGF2 at the inner leaflet resulting in membrane insertion, a key step in FGF2 membrane translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steringer et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2015</xref>). The membrane inserted state of FGF2 oligomers has been proposed to be linked to a membrane pore with a toroidal architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steringer et al., 2012</xref>). This view is supported by the observation that membrane lipids undergo transbilayer diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steringer et al., 2012</xref>). It appears possible that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecules themselves redistribute between monolayers when FGF2 oligomers insert into the membrane as it has been reported in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bucki et al., 2000</xref>). Membrane insertion of FGF2 oligomers is stimulated by phosphorylation of tyrosine 81 in FGF2 mediated by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Tec, a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor that is associated with the inner leaflet through an interaction of its PH domain with PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steringer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ebert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">La Venuta et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, the integral membrane protein ATP1A1 has been identified as another <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor in unconventional secretion of FGF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zacherl et al., 2015</xref>) FGF2 was shown to directly interact with the cytoplasmic domain of ATP1A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zacherl et al., 2015</xref>), however, the precise function of ATP1A1 in FGF2 secretion is unknown. In addition to the <italic>cis</italic> elements that are important for FGF2 binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (K127/R128/K133) and heparan sulfates (K133) as well as Y81 being the target of Tec kinase, membrane insertion of FGF2 oligomers depends on two cysteine residues (C77/C95) on the molecular surface of FGF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, despite a high degree of overall amino acid conservation among FGFs, C77 and C95 are absent from all members of the FGF family carrying signal peptides. C77/C95 have been shown to form intermolecular disulfide bridges, a process that drives efficient oligomerization of FGF2 in a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller et al., 2015</xref>). Following membrane insertion, cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans are required to complete membrane translocation by disassembling FGF2 oligomers at the outer leaflet and trapping of FGF2 in the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nickel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zehe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seelenmeyer et al., 2005</xref>). The interaction between FGF2 and cell surface heparan sulfates is mediated by basic residues in the C-terminal part of FGF2 with K133 being an essential component of this binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nickel and Rabouille, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Temmerman et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, four <italic>cis</italic>-elements in FGF2 [K127/R128/K133 forming the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding pocket and K133 involved in FGF2 binding to both PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and heparan sulfates, Y81 being the target of Tec kinase and C77/C95 promoting FGF2 oligomerization] and four <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, ATP1A1, Tec kinase and heparan sulfate proteoglycans] have been identified to participate in unconventional secretion of FGF2 from cells. All known <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors are physically associated with the plasma membrane, the subcellular site of membrane translocation during unconventional secretion of FGF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanism by which FGF2 is secreted from cells might be similar to other proteins secreted by unconventional means. This includes HIV-Tat that has been demonstrated to be secreted from infected T cells in a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Debaisieux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rayne et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2010b</xref>). Consistently, HIV-Tat was recently found to bind to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> concomitant with the formation of membrane pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeitler et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study suggested a role for membrane pores in unconventional secretion of Interleukin 1β from macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martín-Sánchez et al., 2016</xref>). While Interleukin 1β on its own cannot form pores in the plasma membrane, its release from macrophages might be coupled to another factor that becomes activated in an inflammasome-dependent manner, gasdermin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2016</xref>). Since gasdermin is capable of forming membrane pores in a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent manner, it appears possible that at least one pathway of Interleukin 1β secretion exists that is based upon membrane pores that are formed by gasdermin oligomers upon activation of inflammasomes. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms of unconventional secretion of FGF2, HIV-Tat and even Interleukin 1β might be related in mechanistic terms.</p><p>In the current study, we tested key predictions of the FGF2 membrane translocation model as well as investigated the structure-function relationship of membrane-inserted FGF2 oligomers as intermediates in this process. Furthermore, we used atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to shed light on the initial steps of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> triggered FGF2 oligomerization and membrane insertion. Using both biochemical and structural approaches, we demonstrate binding to FGF2 of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> versus heparin to be mutually exclusive, a key aspect of the vectorial FGF2 membrane translocation model with heparan sulfates forming a molecular trap for FGF2 on cell surfaces. Furthermore, using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as a model system for the plasma membrane, we define the minimal molecular machinery required for FGF2 membrane translocation in a fully reconstituted inside-out system. These studies revealed only two <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors to be essential for FGF2 membrane translocation, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on GUV surfaces and long-chain heparins in the lumen of GUVs, the latter being used as mimetics of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Consistently, the corresponding <italic>cis</italic>-elements required for FGF2 binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and heparan sulfates as well as the two cysteine residues required for oligomerization and membrane insertion of FGF2 were found essential for FGF2 membrane translocation. In addition, using various kinds of single molecule techniques, we demonstrate membrane-inserted forms of FGF2 to represent highly dynamic oligomers with a subunit number in the range of 8–12 FGF2 molecules. These studies were complemented by molecular dynamics simulations gaining the first insights into the initial steps of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> induced oligomerization of FGF2. Most importantly, through simultaneous interactions of FGF2 monomers with multiple PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecules, a high affinity orientation of FGF2 was identified that favors FGF2 dimerization through a C95-C95 disulfide bridge along with additional electrostatic interactions within the dimerization interface. Our combined findings establish both the molecular basis and the minimal molecular machinery required for unconventional secretion of FGF2 from cells that consists of a surprisingly simple set of factors. Our findings further demonstrate the core mechanism of FGF2 membrane translocation to be thermodynamically driven by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent FGF2 oligomerization and membrane insertion without a requirement for additional energy sources such as ATP. The combination of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent FGF2 oligomerization, membrane insertion and heparan sulfate mediated trapping establishes a new type of self-sustained protein translocation across membranes that explains the molecular basis of how FGF2 is secreted from cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Binding to FGF2 of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> versus heparin is mutually exclusive</title><p>The current model describing the unconventional secretory pathway of FGF2 is based upon direct protein translocation across the plasma membrane. As a prerequisite for directional transport of FGF2 into the extracellular space, a key prediction of this model are sequential and mutually exclusive interactions of FGF2 with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the inner leaflet and heparan sulfates at the outer leaflet. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nickel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Steringer et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, employing both structural and biochemical methods, we tested whether interactions of FGF2 with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and heparin (mimicking cell surface heparan sulfates) are mutually exclusive. First, we conducted NMR spectroscopy to compare the binding epitopes in FGF2 for IP<sub>3</sub> [the headgroup of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] and a defined heparin disaccharide suitable for NMR measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). IP<sub>3</sub> and the heparin disaccharide were titrated with a variant form of FGF2 that is incapable of forming oligomers (FGF2-C77/95S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller et al., 2015</xref>]; 80 µM; <sup>15</sup>N-isotope-labeled). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B and C</xref>, addition of 900 µM IP<sub>3</sub> to <sup>15</sup>N-labeled FGF2-C77/95S (green contour lines) leads to large chemical shift changes for certain resonances as exemplified by G36, G135 and I145. Titration curves for individual residues within the binding epitope are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. The mean K<sub>D</sub> value derived from eight resonances was determined as 16.2 ± 4.8 µM. This value is within a range similar to previous data using isothermal titration calorimetry with a K<sub>D</sub> value in the low micromolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Temmerman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Temmerman and Nickel, 2009</xref>). In comparison, addition of the small disaccharide variant of heparin led to relatively small changes of an overlapping set of resonances, indicating a weak interaction. For example, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B and C</xref> (purple contour lines), the resonances G36, G135 and I145 are affected by heparin, however, to a significantly smaller extent than the chemical shifts caused by IP<sub>3</sub> (green contour lines). Furthermore, titrating IP<sub>3</sub> to FGF2 with a pre-bound heparin disaccharide resulted in similar chemical shift changes as for the titration of IP<sub>3</sub> to FGF2 alone. This strongly indicates that IP<sub>3</sub> is outcompeting the heparin disaccharide under these conditions. Consistently, titrating the heparin disaccharide to FGF2 with a pre-bound IP<sub>3</sub> does not outcompete the IP<sub>3</sub> binding. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows that the signal of Gly36 of FGF2 is shifting in opposite directions upon IP<sub>3</sub> or heparin disaccharide binding, respectively. Addition of the heparin disaccharide to FGF2 with pre-bound IP<sub>3</sub> (red contour lines) does not shift the Gly36 signal from ‘IP<sub>3</sub>’ bound (green contour lines) to ‘heparin bound’ (purple contour lines). When replacing the heparin disaccharide by equimolar amounts of a mixture of long-chain heparins in NMR experiments we obtained a significant loss of signal intensity, indicating slow exchange and strong binding of long-chain heparins to FGF2 (data not shown). Based on the assignment of FGF2 (BMRB code 18995) the binding epitope could be identified as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>. As anticipated, the two epitopes overlap and map to a region of the protein surface that is highly positively charged. These findings are in agreement with the known crystal structure of FGF2 bound to heparin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faham et al., 1996</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28985.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structural analysis of the FGF2 binding epitopes for IP<sub>3</sub> [head group of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] and heparin employing NMR spectroscopy.</title><p>Enlarged regions of exemplary resonance peaks from a two-dimensional <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H correlation spectrum that are shifted upon addition of IP<sub>3</sub> and Heparin or both are shown on panels (<bold>A</bold> to –<bold>D</bold>).

To challenge these findings using an independent method we conducted biochemical competition experiments. FGF2 was bound to liposomal membranes with a plasma-membrane-like lipid composition including PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Liposomes with FGF2 bound to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> were treated with increasing concentrations of either long-chain heparin molecules (consisting of a mixture with various numbers of disaccharide units with high affinity towards FGF2 similar to heparan sulfates on cell surfaces; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) or a defined low affinity heparin disaccharide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). For each condition, bound and unbound FGF2 was analyzed and quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). These experiments revealed that long-chain heparin molecules directly compete with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> for binding to FGF2 with a half-maximal effect at a concentration of ≈5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). By contrast, a defined heparin disaccharide was incapable of competing with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> for binding to FGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). These findings are consistent with the NMR experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> where the low affinity heparin disaccharide fails to replace pre-bound IP<sub>3</sub> and provide direct proof for mutually exclusive interactions of FGF2 with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> versus heparin. In a cellular context, similar to long-chain heparin molecules used in biochemical reconstitution experiments throughout this study, we conclude that high affinity heparan sulfates on cell surfaces [KD ≈ 100 nM; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faham et al., 1996</xref>)] outcompete PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> [KD ≈ 5–15 µM; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Temmerman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Temmerman and Nickel, 2009</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>] with regard to binding to FGF2. Thus, our data provide direct proof for a central prediction of the FGF2 membrane translocation hypothesis with sequential and competing interactions of FGF2 with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the inner leaflet and cell surface heparan sulfates at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28985.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Binding of FGF2 to PI(4,5)P2 and heparin is mutually exclusive.</title><p>Biochemical analysis employing plasma-membrane-like liposomes either lacking (PM) or containing 2 mol% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (PM +PIP2).

In addition, a small fluorescent tracer (Alexa647) was used to detect the formation of membrane pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steringer et al., 2012</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, two experimental conditions were compared analyzing GUVs that either contained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or lacked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) luminal long-chain heparin. In both cases, FGF2-Y81pCMF-GFP bound efficiently to the membrane surface due to the presence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. By contrast, only in case luminal heparin was included, FGF2-Y81pCMF-GFP membrane translocation into the lumen of GUVs was observed. This phenomenon was quantified based upon measuring GFP fluorescence intensity in the lumen, at the membrane and in the vesicle exterior as described in ‘Methods’. In the given example, the ratio between luminal and external fluorescence was 4.93 in the presence of luminal heparin (Note increased fluorescence intensity on the luminal side in sub-panel e of panel A) and 1.33 in the absence of luminal heparin (Note equal fluorescence intensities on the luminal and external side in sub-panel e of panel B). In panels C and D of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, cross sections of 3D reconstructions are shown visualizing the dependence of FGF2-GFP membrane translocation on the presence of luminal heparin with a spatial view into the interior of GUVs. Based on a threshold of 1.6, a statistical analysis of 20 to 120 GUVs from at least three independent experiments was conducted providing the percentages of GUVs with FGF2-Y81pCMF-GFP being enriched in their lumen for each experimental condition. This analysis revealed that FGF2-Y81pCMF-GFP membrane translocation occurred in about 23% of the GUVs with luminal heparin (Figure 9). By contrast, less than 2% of GUVs without luminal heparin contained FGF2-Y81pCMF-GFP in their lumen (Figure 9). Simultaneously, the small fluorescent tracer Alexa647 was used to monitor membrane pore formation as indicated by equal fluorescence intensities in the lumen and the exterior of GUVs. Under the two conditions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, membrane pore formation did not depend on the presence of heparin in the lumen of GUVs. As shown in Figure 9, membrane pore formation occurred in about 33% to 41% of all GUVs, both in the absence and the presence of luminal heparin. These results are consistent with previous findings demonstrating that membrane insertion of FGF2 oligomers concomitant with pore formation does not depend on luminal heparin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steringer et al., 2012</xref>).

These findings were corroborated by a statistical analysis depicted in Figure 9 revealing that only about 6% of GUVs were positive for FGF2-Y81pCMF-GFP membrane translocation when cholesterol was removed from a plasma membrane like lipid composition that included PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28985.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is required for both membrane pore formation and FGF2 membrane translocation.</title><p>Giant unilamellar vesicles were prepared with a plasma membrane-like lipid composition either containing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (panel <bold>A</bold>), containing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> but lacking cholesterol (panel <bold>B</bold>), lacking PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (panel <bold>C</bold>) or containing a Ni-NTA lipid substituting PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (panel <bold>D</bold>).

This in turn resulted in a lack of membrane pore formation (Alexa647 intensity ratio lumen/exterior = 0.05) and FGF2-Y81pCMF-GFP translocation into the lumen of GUVs (GFP intensity ratio lumen/exterior = 0.7). As shown in Figure 9, in the absence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, less than 2% of GUVs were characterized by membrane pores and FGF2 membrane translocation was undetectable (Figure 9). The fourth type of GUVs in this set of experiments was characterized by substitution of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with a Ni-NTA lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This experimental condition has previously been demonstrated to allow for efficient recruitment of His-tagged FGF2 to membrane surfaces. However, under these conditions, a substantial reduction of membrane pore formation was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steringer et al., 2012</xref>). This phenotype is not due to a general block in FGF2 oligomerization but is likely to be related to a requirement for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to facilitate FGF2-dependent formation of a toroidal membrane pore that is characterized by strong membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, in the example given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, the tracer intensity ratio (lumen/exterior) was found to be 0.05 demonstrating pore formation to depend on PI(4,5)P<sub>2,</sub> even under conditions where membrane recruitment of FGF2-Y81pCMF-GFP is mediated by other means. Consistently, in the statistical analysis shown in Figure 9, only about 10% of GUVs containing the Ni-NTA lipid to recruit His-tagged FGF2-GFP were found to contain membrane pores. This phenotype was accompanied by an almost complete failure of His-tagged FGF2-Y81pCMF-GFP to translocate into the lumen of GUVs when PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was substituted by a Ni-NTA lipid (GFP intensity ratio lumen/exterior = 1.15 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

The various forms of FGF2-Y81pCMF-GFP were characterized with regard to binding to both long-chain heparins immobilized on beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>) and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> as part of liposomes using a flow cytometry setup [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Temmerman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Temmerman and Nickel, 2009</xref>)]. In addition, the processed form of interleukin 1β fused to GFP (IL-1β-GFP) and GFP alone were taken along as control proteins. Binding of the various proteins to long-chain heparins and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was compared to the wild-type form of FGF2-Y81pCMF-GFP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, substitution of C77 and C95 by alanines (FGF2-Y81pCMF-C77/95A-GFP) did not affect binding to long-chain heparins. By comparison, FGF2-Y81-pCMF-C77/95A-GFP showed reduced binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This is caused by a reduction in binding avidity due to the inability of this FGF2 variant form to oligomerize. By contrast, the K127Q/R128Q/K133Q form of FGF2-Y81pCMF-GFP did neither bind to long-chain heparins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>) nor to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

In particular, we analyzed the subunit number of membrane associated FGF2 oligomers. In a first approach, we used supported lipid bilayers (SLB) containing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to determine the oligomeric state of membrane inserted FGF2 complexes. To obtain high contrast single molecule detection we used FGF2 variant forms carrying a Halo-tag. This allowed for protein labeling with a bright and photo-stable fluorophore (Abberior StarRed) with a degree of labeling of 0.9 per FGF2 monomer. A three-step protocol was used to analyze the oligomeric state distribution of FGF2 translocation clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; for details see ‘Materials and methods’). Two variant forms of FGF2, FGF2-Y81pCMF-HALO-StarRed and FGF2-Y81pCMF-C77/95A-HALO-StarRed were loaded onto SLBs containing 2 mol% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at a final concentration of 100 nM. While FGF2-Y81pCMF-HALO-StarRed efficiently bound to SLBs, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>), binding of FGF2-Y81pCMF-C77/95A-HALO-StarRed was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10J</xref>). These findings are consistent with the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and reflect the inability of FGF2-Y81pCMF-C77/95A-HALO-StarRed to oligomerize (see above). In a second step, following 10 min of incubation, SLBs were washed with a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl to remove unbound proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B,E,H and K</xref>). At this stage, fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) was used to determine the mobility of membrane bound FGF2 species (FRAP data available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 11—source data 1</xref>). This analysis revealed the majority (98%) of FGF2-Y81pCMF-HALO-StarRed to be highly mobile with a diffusion constant of D = 0.4 µm<sup>2</sup>/s. These findings indicate that after a short incubation with SLBs of only 10 min, most of FGF2-Y81pCMF-HALO-StarRed did not oligomerize into higher order structures which were integrated in the membrane. In a third step, the highly mobile fraction of FGF2-Y81pCMF-HALO-StarRed monomers bound to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was removed by high salt treatment (500 mM NaCl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,F,I and L</xref>). The remaining population of the protein was largely immobile suggesting membrane insertion of oligomers with contacts to the glass support of SLBs.

However, it is possible that additional residues play a role and the binding stoichiometry between FGF2 and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> has not been determined.

The <italic>high-affinity</italic> orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) observed in 3 out of 5 repeats is characterized by strong binding to the membrane surface. In this case, FGF2 orients in a manner where C95 is exposed in a way facilitating the formation of a C95–C95 disulfide bridge with a second monomer. In this orientation, C77 is not available to make a contact with a second FGF2 monomer. In this high-affinity orientation, all the three known binding site residues of FGF2 are involved in the interaction with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s2">Figure 13—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s3">3</xref>). The average binding energy for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is highest for K127 (–315.59 kJ/mol), followed by K133 (–301.25 kJ/mol) and R128 (–208.78 kJ/mol). However, the interaction strengths were observed to depend on the number of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> head groups interacting with the binding pocket region. In addition to the three key binding residues, a number of so far unidentified residues contributed to membrane binding: K34 (average interaction strength –113.65 kJ/mol), K137 (–244.72 kJ/mol) and K143 (–196.29 kJ/mol) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s4">Figure 13—figure supplement 4</xref>). The number of head groups of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> that were found bound to FGF2 varied between one and four with one to two head groups binding to the key residues in the primary binding site (K127, R128, K133) and one to two head groups bound to residues forming the second binding site (K34, K137, K143).</p><p>In the second <italic>low-affinity</italic> orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>) that was observed in 2 out of 5 simulation repeats, the N- and C- terminal ends of FGF2 are close to the membrane surface, and both C95 and C77 are available to form disulfide bridges with other FGF2 monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>). However, in this scenario, not all of the three key binding site residues interact with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> as they point away from the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> head groups. This is also evident from the average binding energies (K127 = –0.03 kJ/mol; R128 = –237.10 kJ/mol and K133 = –0.08 kJ/mol) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s5">Figure 13—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s6">6</xref>), which are considerably weaker compared to the high-affinity orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s7">Figure 13—figure supplement 7</xref>). Therefore, the weak interaction observed in the low-affinity orientation is likely to represent a transient binding intermediate at the membrane surface that is eventually stabilized when several PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecules are bound to FGF2.</p><p>Based on the above, the stability of FGF2-membrane binding is based partially on the FGF2 orientation, but also the number of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecules that simultaneously bind to a FGF2 monomer is critical for stable membrane interactions of FGF2. This view is supported by additional simulations (system M2), where FGF2 was allowed to interact with only a single PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecule (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s8">8</xref>). As expected, FGF2 was observed to bind to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with its key binding site residues, however during the course of the simulation the orientation of FGF2 fluctuated between high-affinity and low-affinity orientations. None of the two orientations was exceptionally stable as the inositol biphosphate ring (central in FGF2 binding) was too flexible to stabilize the structure of the complex. Thus, the simulations indicate that the surface area of FGF2 involved in binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is larger than previously assumed and renders interactions with more than one PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecule possible. This leads to strengthening the stability of FGF2 membrane binding suggesting that the high-affinity orientation is the most stable one.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-28985-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28985.034</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>FGF2 binding to a single PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (system M2).</title><p>FGF2 adhering to the membrane surface through binding to a single PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.

To identify possible dimerization interfaces along with the residues being involved, we conducted atomistic simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>). In previous FGF2 secretion assays and biochemical reconstitution experiments, FGF2 variant forms lacking both C95 and C77 were found defective in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent oligomerization, membrane pore formation and secretion from cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller et al., 2015</xref>). When single cysteine substitutions were analyzed, the C95A variant form was characterized by a more severe defect in all of these assays compared to a C77A variant form of FGF2 (Müller, Wegehingel, Steringer and Nickel, unpublished results). To identify the residues involved in dimerization, we carried out two simulations of FGF2 trimers (system T) since they correspond to the minimal aggregation unit we identified in single particle brightness analyses using supported lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>). To this end, FGF2 monomers were placed in different orientations at a distance of 0.5 nm above the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> head groups. The monomers were arranged such that two of them faced each other at a distance of 0.7 nm between their C95 residues. The third monomer resided 1.5 nm away from the other two monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the first simulation, the two monomers readily oriented themselves into the high-affinity orientation and then dimerized. The dimer was observed to remain stable for the rest of the simulation. A detailed analysis revealed that there were four ion pairs formed across the interface (two pairs of E86 – K118 and E99 – K85 each; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14B</xref>) that stabilized the dimer. At the same time, the third monomer diffused towards the dimer structure, however its orientation was closer to the low-affinity orientation than the high-affinity counterpart. Given this, it was quite expected that it bound to the dimer through an orientation where its C77 residue faced C77 in one of the FGF2 monomers in the dimer structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14C</xref>). The binding across this C77 – C77 interface was based on the R47 – D49, D45 – R41, and R80 – E53 ion pairs that rendered the formation of this complex possible. Moving on, the second simulation of system T also highlighted that FGF2 monomers tend to aggregate, thus supporting the view that there is a force driving FGF2 monomers to form oligomeric structures. However, the time scale needed for orientation changes through rotational diffusion turned out to be long, thus no stable interface for dimerization was found during this type of simulation.</p><p>Biochemical and structural experiments have shown that disulfide bridges from C95 – C95 and C77 – C77 residue pairs are present in membrane inserted FGF2 oligomers ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller et al., 2015</xref>]; Müller and Nickel, unpublished results). Consistently, in our simulations, we observed formation of FGF2 dimers characterized by the C95 – C95 and C77 – C77 pairs at the dimerization interface along with electrostatic interactions by additional residues in the dimer interface. Consequently, we used the dimer structure based on high-affinity FGF2 orientations with a stable C95 – C95 disulfide bridge in further simulations, where this link was established as a covalent bond to create a model of a full dimer (system D). The high-affinity orientation seen in simulations of system T was maintained during the simulations of system D. Importantly, with the dimer structure now fully stable due to the C95 – C95 covalent bond, the simulation of the dimer system D revealed several ion pairs (R80-D98; E86-K118 and R89-E99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s2">Figure 14—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s3">3</xref>). The extensive ion pairing formed at the interface as part of the high-affinity orientation suggests that the formation of FGF2 dimers containing the C95 – C95 disulfide bridge represents the initial step of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent FGF2 oligomerization and membrane pore formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current study is the first of its kind in which an unconventional mechanism of protein secretion has been reconstituted from purified components establishing the molecular mechanism by which FGF2 is secreted from cells. We define the minimal machinery required for FGF2 membrane translocation and provide novel insights into the structure function relationship of membrane inserted FGF2 oligomers, the key intermediates of this process. Finally, using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, this study puts forward a mechanism by which FGF2 monomers assemble into dimers and trimers on membrane surfaces in a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent manner, the rate limiting step for the formation of higher oligomers that form membrane pores.</p><p>The first part of this work provides direct proof for two critical predictions of a previously proposed model describing the molecular mechanism of unconventional secretion of FGF2 from cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nickel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nickel and Rabouille, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2008</xref>). The first predicted binding of FGF2 to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> versus cell surface heparan sulfates to be mutually exclusive to ensure directional translocation of FGF2 across the plasma membrane based on sequential interactions of FGF2 with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the inner leaflet and heparan sulfates at the outer leaflet. Here, using NMR spectroscopy we demonstrate an overlap of the binding sites on the molecular surface of FGF2 for IP<sub>3</sub> [the headgroup of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] and a defined low affinity heparin disaccharide. In addition, we provide direct biochemical proof that long-chain heparins (used as mimetics of cell surface heparan sulfates) directly compete with membrane incorporated PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> for the interaction with FGF2. Based upon the high affinity of FGF2 towards heparan sulfates and long-chain heparins [K<sub>D</sub> ≈ 100 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faham et al., 1996</xref>)] and the lower affinity towards PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the low micromolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Temmerman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Temmerman and Nickel, 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), our findings provide a direct explanation for vectorial translocation of FGF2 from the cytoplasm to the cell surface.</p><p>The second prediction of the FGF2 secretion model proposed the minimal machinery required for FGF2 membrane translocation to be composed of two <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and cell surface heparan sulfates. This in turn suggests a direct requirement for <italic>cis</italic> elements in FGF2 that mediate binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (K127/R128) and heparan sulfates (K133). In addition, the core mechanism involves FGF2 oligomerization and membrane pore formation, a process that depends on two cysteine residues on the molecular surface of FGF2 (C77/C95). Using GUVs with a plasma membrane like lipid composition along with a FGF2-GFP fusion protein, we demonstrate FGF2 membrane translocation into the lumen of GUVs to depend on the presence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on membrane surfaces and the presence of long-chain heparins in the lumen of GUVs. Beyond these <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, we demonstrate <italic>cis</italic>-elements in FGF2 required for binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and heparin as well as for FGF2 oligomerization and membrane pore formation to be essential for FGF2 membrane translocation in a fully reconstituted system. By contrast, the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor ATP1A1, even though required for FGF2 secretion from cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zacherl et al., 2015</xref>), apparently is dispensable for FGF2 membrane translocation under the conditions used in this study. This indicates that ATP1A1 has regulatory functions in FGF2 secretion from cells rather than belonging to the core machinery mediating physical translocation of FGF2 across the plasma membrane.</p><p>In the second part of this study, we used single molecule techniques to gain insight into the structure function relationship of membrane inserted FGF2 oligomers as key intermediates in membrane translocation. First, we used supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) and single molecule confocal microscopy to determine the oligomeric size distribution of membrane-inserted FGF2 species. Following short incubation times of 10 min during which the overall integrity of SLBs was fully maintained, three major oligomeric species could be detected represented by trimers, hexamers and higher oligomers in the range of about 10 to 12 subunits. These findings were corroborated by an independent single molecule system in which the average oligomeric state of FGF2 could be correlated with membrane insertion and pore formation in GUVs. Here, even after incubation times of several hours at high concentrations of FGF2, the average oligomeric state of FGF2 in GUVs leveled out in the range of 8 to 12 subunits. On the one hand, these experiments demonstrate membrane-inserted FGF2 oligomers to represent highly dynamic structures that are not characterized by a uniform number of subunits. On the other hand, our findings demonstrate that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent membrane recruitment does not result in the random formation of undefined FGF2 aggregates. Therefore, as discussed above, we propose that membrane inserted FGF2 oligomers serve as dynamic translocation intermediates by controlled assembly through PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent FGF2 oligomerization at the inner leaflet and controlled disassembly at the outer leaflet mediated by heparan sulfates. Previous evidence suggests that membrane inserted FGF2 oligomers are accommodated within a lipidic membrane pore with a toroidal architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">La Venuta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steringer et al., 2012</xref>). We propose that these translocation intermediates represent dynamic structures to which FGF2 subunits are constantly added at the cytoplasmic leaflet while FGF2 subunits are continuously removed at the extracellular side of the plasma membrane resulting in FGF2 translocation to the cell surface. It is currently unknown whether these assembly/disassembly units are monomers or disulfide bridged dimers of FGF2. Furthermore, it will be a challenge for future studies to elucidate the three-dimensional architecture of membrane inserted FGF2 oligomers to fully understand how these complexes are functioning as translocation intermediates in unconventional secretion of FGF2.</p><p>The third part of this study was concerned with the analysis of the initial events of FGF2 membrane translocation with a particular focus on the molecular mechanism of FGF2 interactions with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and the formation of dimers and trimers that initiate oligomerization of FGF2 in the context of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> containing membranes. Atomistic simulations revealed the key binding site residues that interact with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, which were found consistent with previous mutational analyses of FGF2 (6,17,19,25,33). Interestingly, the simulations predicted that there are additional previously unknown residues involved in membrane binding when several PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> head groups bind to FGF2 simultaneously. Therefore, the strength of FGF2 membrane interactions obviously depends on the number of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecules that simultaenously bind to FGF2. In addition, the simulations provided compelling evidence that the strength of FGF2 membrane interactions also depends on the orientation of FGF2 relative to the membrane. The identified high-affinity orientation of FGF2 indeed favors multiple interactions of FGF2 with several PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> head groups and also leads to the formation of stable FGF2 dimers that are characterized by C95 – C95 disulfide bridges and additional ion pair interactions between residues within the dimerization interface. By contrast, the low-affinity orientation of FGF2 tilts the protein in a way that impairs simultaneous interactions of FGF2 with several PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecules and also prevents the formation of the C95 – C95 bridge. Given the critical role of C95 in FGF2 oligomerization, membrane pore formation, and secretion from cells, the simulations stress that FGF2 dimerization depends on membrane bound FGF2 monomers in the high-affinity orientation, whose stability is provided by multiple interactions with several PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecules. Therefore, the combined findings from these simulations predict that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent oligomerization of FGF2 is initiated through dimerization that is driven by the formation of C95 – C95 disulfide bridges. These FGF2 dimers appear to assemble into higher FGF2 oligomers driven by C77 – C77 disulfide links.</p><p>In conclusion, this study defines the minimal machinery required for FGF2 membrane translocation providing direct proof for a previously suggested model of unconventional secretion that was derived from cell-based data. This process depends on sequential and mutually exclusive interactions of FGF2 with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and heparan sulfates and is thermodynamically driven by FGF2 oligomerization and membrane insertion. These translocation intermediates are dynamic structures with a subunit number in the range of 8 to 12 FGF2 molecules. Therefore, depending only on two essential <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and heparan sulfates, unconventional secretion of FGF2 is based upon a novel type of protein translocation across membranes with the cargo protein forming its own translocation intermediate by oligomerization and membrane insertion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>His-tagged variants of FGF2 (pQE30), FGF2-GFP and FGF2-Halo (both pET15b) were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> strains W3110Z1 or BL21 Star (DE3), respectively.

In some experiments, GUVs were used lacking cholesterol which was supplemented with PC. For visualization either 0.05 mol% rhodamine B-labelled PE for FGF2 membrane translocation assays or 0.001 mol% DOPE-Atto 633 for z-scan FCS were added. The dried lipid film was hydrated with a 300 mM sucrose solution (300 mOsmol/kg). Where indicated, either long-chain heparins (50 µM; based on disaccharide units s.a.) or a defined heparin disaccharide (Sigma H9267) were included to mimic heparan sulfates in the lumen of GUVs. Osmolality was determined for all three conditions using a Wescor Vapro 5600 instrument and found not to be affected by the addition of long-chain heparins or the heparin disaccharide. Swelling was conducted at 45°C [10 Hz, 1.5 V for 50 min (without heparin) or 70 min (with heparin), 2 Hz, 1.5 V for 25 min]. In order to remove excess amounts of heparin, GUVs were gently washed with buffer B (25 mM HEPES pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 310 mOsmol/kg) and collected via centrifugation (1200x g; 25°C; 5 min).

Briefly, a circle was drawn around a GUV in a way that the center of the circle matched the center of the GUV in the confocal plane being assessed. From this center point the intensity at any given distance along the radius of the circle is measured and processed resulting in a profile plot of normalized integrated intensities around concentric circles as a function of distance from the center. Luminal fluorescence of individual GUVs was measured and normalized to fluorescence intensity of the surrounding buffer. Per experimental condition, 20 to 120 individual GUVs were analysed as indicated in the corresponding Fig. legends. To allow for a statistical analysis of membrane pore formation and FGF2-GFP membrane translocation across the population of GUVs, thresholds were defined to classify individual GUVs. When the ratio of inside to outside fluorescence of the small Alexa647 tracer was ≥0.6, GUVs were classified as vesicles containing membrane pores. Similarly, when the inside to outside ratio of GFP fluorescence was ≥1.6, the corresponding GUVs were classified as vesicles where FGF2-GFP membrane translocation into the lumen had occurred.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>3D reconstruction of GUVs</title><p>3D reconstruction of GUVs (panels C and D of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) was based upon ImageJ software using the ‘3D Viewer’ plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/3d-viewer/index.html">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/3d-viewer/index.html</ext-link>). 3D images with a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels (0.07 µm pixel size) were made from z-stacks separated by a distance of 0.37 µm.

SLBs were formed by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 1 min using 40 µl of lipid mixture [1.2 mg/ml; 68 mol% POPC, 30 mol% Cholesterol, 2 mol% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and 0.1 mol% DPPE-OregonGreen in methanol/chloroform (1:1)]. Residual solvent was evaporated for 1 hr under vacuum. Lipids were hydrated with a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). This procedure resulted in supported bilayers without defects. Occasionally, patches of double membranes were observed and avoided when studying FGF2 binding and oligomerization. FGF2-Y81pCMF-HALO-StarRed and FGF2-Y81pCMF-C77/95A-HALO-StarRed, respectively, were added to SLBs (final concentration = 100 nM) and incubated for 10 min.

Fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching was performed by bleaching a 2 × 2 µm square with a 405 nm laser followed by measuring the diffusive recovery of FGF2 fusion proteins over time.

This effectively reduced the background from scattered laser light. The resulting images were processed in MATLAB to extract the peak brightness per cluster using a 2D Gaussian fitting procedure. The number of monomers in each immobilized FGF2 cluster was estimated by normalizing the cluster brightness to the brightness of a single HALO-StarRed. To determine the brightness of a single HALO-StarRed, we expressed, purified and labelled mEGFP-HALO with StarRed-HTL. mEGFP-HALO-StarRed was then passively immobilized on clean cover glass such that single diffraction limited spots could be clearly separated. Imaging and single molecule brightness determination was identical with the procedure used for FGF2-HALO-StarRed fusion proteins.

Therefore, by having a calibration solution with a given constant concentration of a dye, the actual concentration of FGF2-GFP at the membrane can be determined by the analysis of GUV fluorescence images. Both methods yielded similar results. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> were derived using the first method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations analyzing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent oligomerization of FGF2</title><p>For atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we used the truncated FGF2 monomer structure [PDB id: 1BFF; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kastrup et al., 1997</xref>)] from residue 26 to 154, without the flexible N-terminus. Cell based as well as biochemical experiments revealed that N-terminal truncations did not show defects in secretion nor oligomerization (André Engling, Julia Steringer, Hans-Michael Müller, Sebastian Unger and Walter Nickel, unpublished results). Here, we use the same residue numbering as in the PDB file (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kastrup et al., 1997</xref>), which is consistent with the numbering used in biochemical experiments. In preparation of the FGF2 structure for MD simulations, we processed the PDB structure with CHARMM-GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), where we modeled all lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues as positively charged, glutamic acid (E) and aspartate (D) as negatively charged, histidine (H) and glutamine (Q) as uncharged, and tyrosine 81 was phosphorylated.</p><p>For the lipid bilayer models, we used a POPC/Cholesterol/PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> mixture (details below). PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> had 18:0 and 20:4 chains. The double bonds in the arachidonic fatty acid were located between the carbons C5 = C6, C8 = C9, C11 = C12, and C14 = C15. The overall charge in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was –4e. The bilayer systems prepared using CHARMM-GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) were originally symmetric with respect to the transmembrane distribution of POPC and Cholesterol. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecules were then inserted to the cytosolic leaflet of a membrane by removing a sufficient number of POPC molecules from the cytosolic leaflet and replacing the vacant space by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, thus resulting in systems M1 and M2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). System M1 had a POPC/Cholesterol (70/30) mixture in the extracellular leaflet and a POPC/Cholesterol/PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (65/29.5/5.5) composition in the cytosolic monolayer. System M2 was designed to assess FGF2 binding in the dilute PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> limit, having only one PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on the cytosolic side (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28985.035</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Descriptions of model systems and their simulation details.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28985.035">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28985.035</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">System</th><th valign="top">No. of FGF2 molecules</th><th valign="top">No. of POPC molecules</th><th valign="top">No. of CHOL molecules</th><th valign="top">No. of PI(4,5)P2 molecules</th><th valign="top">No. of water molecules</th><th valign="top">Distance from membrane surface (nm)</th><th valign="top">No. of repeats</th><th valign="top">Simulation time (ns)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">M1</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">348</td><td valign="top">152</td><td valign="top">14</td><td valign="top">34783</td><td valign="top">1.5</td><td valign="top">5</td><td valign="top">1000 × 5</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">M2</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">177</td><td valign="top">76</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">15684</td><td valign="top">1.5</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">T</td><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">348</td><td valign="top">152</td><td valign="top">14</td><td valign="top">31575</td><td valign="top">0.5</td><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">1000 × 2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">D</td><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">348</td><td valign="top">152</td><td valign="top">14</td><td valign="top">29770</td><td valign="top">*</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">130</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><p>*The initial FGF2 dimer orientation and position on the membrane surface were the same as those in the final frame of the system T (repeat 2).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>In setting up the systems M1 (for five simulation repeats) with a single FGF2 monomer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), we placed the protein 1.5 nm above the membrane surface in five different orientations such that the key residues (K127, R128, K133) in the binding pocket for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> either faced the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> head groups or pointed away from them. For system M2, we placed a single FGF2 protein 1.5 nm above the membrane surface with the protein’s binding pocket residues facing the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> head group.</p><p>The FGF2 trimer systems (T; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) simulated through two repeats were prepared by placing three FGF2 monomers 0.5 nm above the membrane surface with the binding pocket residues (K127, R128, K133) facing the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> head groups, yet each of the monomers was positioned in a slightly different orientation with respect to the membrane surface. Here, the monomers were arranged such that two monomers faced each other with a C95 – C95 distance of 0.7 nm, and the third monomer was 1.5 nm away from the two other monomers.</p><p>For the FGF2 dimer system (D; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), the starting dimer structure was taken from the final frame of the trimer simulation (repeat 2) that demonstrated a stable dimer characterized by a C95 – C95 close-contact bridge with an upright orientation. We processed the dimer by creating a disulfide linkage between the two C95 residues by removing the hydrogen atom from the thiol groups. The C95 – C95 disulfide-linked dimer structure was energy minimized in vacuum with the membrane, thus not altering either the FGF2 dimer orientation or its interaction with the lipids.</p><p>The systems were neutralized by an appropriate number of potassium atoms. KCl salt at a concentration of 150 mM was added to mimic experimental conditions. Protein, lipids, and salt ions were described using the CHARMM36 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klauda et al., 2010</xref>). For water, we used the TIP3 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>All the systems were subjected to energy minimization using the steepest descent algorithm. After minimization, we ran 6 steps of equilibration runs where we gradually reduced the force constant applied to restrain the positions of the protein and the lipids. In the first stage of equilibration under NVT conditions, the Berendsen thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>) was used to regulate the temperature at 298 K with a time constant of 1.0 ps. In the second stage of equilibration under NpT conditions, we used the Berendsen algorithm for controlling the simulation temperature and pressure along with a semi-isotropic pressure coupling scheme and a time constant set to 5.0 ps. In equilibration under NpT conditions, the reference pressure was set to 1.0 bar and the isothermal compressibility to a value of 4.5 × 10<sup>–5</sup> bar<sup>–1</sup>. For neighbor searching, we used the Verlet scheme with a cut-off distance of 1.2 nm for short-range neighbor search. The electrostatic interactions were calculated using the PME method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darden et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Essmann et al., 1995</xref>). The cut-off length of 1.2 nm was used for both electrostatic (real space component) and van der Waals interactions. Hydrogen bonds were constrained using the LINCS algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hess et al., 1997</xref>) and periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions. For the production MD runs, we removed all the restraints applied to the proteins and the lipids and used the Nose-Hoover thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nosé, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoover, 1985</xref>) and Parrinello-Rahman barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>) instead of the Berendsen’s algorithm. The rest of the input parameters for production MD simulations were the same as those used under NpT conditions. The simulations were carried out using an integration time step of 2 fs with coordinates saved every 100 ps.</p><p>All simulations were performed using the GROMACS 5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>) simulation package and the analyses were done for the last 200 ns of the simulation trajectories using GROMACS tools and in-house scripts, except for system D, where the analysis was carried out over the last 30 ns. The images were rendered using VMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>). The rendering was done for the starting structures and for the most populated structures obtained from clustering analysis based on RMSD values with a cut-off of 0.1 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daura et al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Abberior StarRed-HALO-Tag ligand was generously provided by Vladimir Belov (MPI-BPC, Göttingen, Germany).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Minimal Machinery Required for Unconventional Secretion of Fibroblast Growth Factor 2&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see from the reviewer's comments, the biochemical reconstitution of FGF2 translocation is considered a biochemical tour de force. Discussion amongst the reviewers, however, resulted in a unanimous view that, at present, the manuscript largely confirms the molecular requirements for FGF2 translocation that were identified previously. The reviewers and I encourage you to continue this line of experimentation, and to this end, they make several suggestions that may help you to provide new information regarding the mechanism of FGF2 translocation. Specific questions that the reviewers felt were especially important to address and expand on regard the nature of the FGF2 translocation intermediate and PIP2 dynamics. Specifically, does FGF2 form a structural pore (versus simply rupturing the membrane) and, related, does PIP2 translocate with FGF2, or remain on the 'donor' leaflet? Though the reviewers concluded that suitable revisions to the manuscript would likely substantial effort, they expressed enthusiasm for considering a manuscript that does contain additional information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a superbly conducted study that investigates the translocation of FGF2 across a synthetic membrane bilayer using a GUV-based experimental system. The authors find that binding of FGF2-GFP to PIP2 is required to initiate translocation and that lumenal heparin is required to accumulate FGF2-GFP within the lumen of the vesicle. Long chain heparin is shown to effectively compete for binding to PIP2, providing an explanation for the vectoral transport (i.e., secretion) previously observed with cells. The results generally support the conclusions of the manuscript, though I think that the authors need to address a couple of points to raise the significance of the manuscript.</p><p>1) I commend the authors for a rigorous and convincing reconstitution of FGF translocation, though the manuscript essentially confirms requirements defined by published work using cell-based approaches without revealing anything fundamentally new about the mechanism of translocation. Two suggestions for enhancing the significance of the work are listed below.</p><p>2) The conclusion that FGF2-GFP forms a pore, revealed by diffusion of Alexa 647 across the GUV membrane, has important implications regarding the mechanism of translocation. The formation of a toroid intermediate was alluded to (subsection “Biochemical reconstitution of FGF2 membrane translocation with purified components”), but the results don't distinguish the formation of a bona fide pore, which in my mind is constituted by a structure of defined stoichiometry and dimensions, versus a less definite breach of membrane integrity (e.g., due to crowding on the membrane) that results in leakage of the dye across the membrane. I wonder if a systematic test of soluble tracers of varying size might reveal a size limit that would lend support to the conclusion that a pore is an intermediate structure formed during translocation.</p><p>3) The conclusion that ATP1A1 plays no core role in FGF2 translocation is not satisfying because it raises the question, does the observed translocation truly reconstitute the physiological mechanism? I realize that this is technically challenging to address, but defining the contribution of ATP1A1, be it a core role or a regulatory function, would, (a) provide new information, and/or (b) might bolster the conclusion that it is not required for translocation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting report that demonstrates a possible mechanism or at least a minimal system allowing translocation of FGF2 across a lipid bilayer based on FGF2 first binding and clustering on one side of a PIP-containing membrane and then flipping over to be captured by heparin on the other side. The in vitro results demonstrating feasibility are generally clear, and the mutational analysis, especially of mutants with perturbed binding to PIP2 but not heparin are consistent with the proposed cellular mechanism. Several issues should be addressed to strength the claim that this effect is what happens in the cell.</p><p>What is missing is discussion of how FGF2 traverses the hydrophobic part of the membrane or if it always travels with PIP2 and delvers it to the other leaflet. There is extensive literature about PIP2 flipping or enhancing flipping of other lipids by e.g. Sulpice and colleagues in platelets and other systems that seems highly relevant and should be cited and discussed in this context. E.g. Bucki R, Giraud F, Sulpice (2000) Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate domain inducers promote phospholipid transverse redistribution in biological membranes. Biochemistry 39: 5838-5844.</p><p>Is the only binding of FGF2 to PIP2 via the headgroup? If not, the competition between IP<sub>3</sub> and heparin disaccharide lacks the full binding energy and it's not clear how to distinguish binding from electrostatic competition.</p><p>How specific is the effect of heparin? Is there a similar effect of hyaluronic acid, which might be more commonly bound on the outer cell surface?</p><p>How much of the interaction in vitro is due to electrostatics? How dependent is the binding affinity on ionic strength or divalent cations?</p><p>A control is needed to determine if heparin in the vesicle lumen changes the osmotic pressure inside and consequently the membrane tension.</p><p>A most interesting test would be between two vesicle types that have the same amount of PIP2 with heparin in the lumen but with different cholesterol content to shift from fully mixed to demixed bilayers, since this process is implicated in trafficking. The other controls are required technical controls but have no direct biological relevance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In their study, the authors reconstitute membrane translocation of FGF2 in vitro, confirming roles for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, heparan sulfates, and FGF2 oligomerization in the process. Other factors that promote FGF2 plasma membrane translocation in vivo were not required, suggesting they function only in a regulatory manner. Overall, the study is beautifully performed, and the data presented are rigorous and quantitative. However, the major concern is that the work is largely confirmatory in nature. Please see below.</p><p>1) Sequential interactions with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and heparan sulfate was shown previously to be critical in FGF2 translocation across the plasma membrane. Also, the role for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in promoting FGF2 oligomerization and membrane pore formation was also defined previously. The work done here solidifies/confirms our understanding of FGF2 translocation, but does not really extend it. In light of this, can the authors provide any evidence as to the mechanism by which ATP1A1 regulates FGF2 translocation, even if it is not absolutely required?</p><p>2) To extend the study, could the author investigate whether the addition of appropriately positioned cysteine residues to other members of the FGF family members, which have signal peptides, enables them to be transported across membranes in vitro?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors resubmitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Key Steps in Unconventional Secretion of Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 Reconstituted with Purified Components&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved and the reviewers recommend publication. You will see from the reviews below, which include the opinion of a new reviewer, that there are several points that should be addressed with additional revisions. These require only modification to the text suggested by reviewer 1 (point #3), reviewer # 2 (figure and the legend) and 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The major issue raised during review of the original manuscript regarded the confirmatory nature of the manuscript, which confirmed specific requirements that were identified previously using cell based assays. In the revised manuscript, the authors now include several new findings that shed some light onto the mechanism of FGF2 translocation across a membrane. I find the most compelling of these to be the following:</p><p>1) Calibrated fluorescence measurements of labeled FGF2 was used to quantify the numbers of FGF molecules present in membrane-associated clusters. This provides some insight into possible mechanism of formation of an initial translocation intermediate.</p><p>2) Molecular dynamics simulations of FGF2 binding to PIP2, and FGF2 oligomerization, revealed possible new binding modes. Although these were not validated with 'wet' experiments, they provide some evidence to support the authors' speculation that FGF2 assembles into a larger pore-forming complex that mediates translocation.</p><p>3) The new data lead the authors to suggest a toroid translocation intermediate. I have a difficult time appreciating the manner in which FGF subunits might form a toroid intermediate, and especially how such a disulfide-bonded structure would be released from the cell, but the new data provide a foundation for this speculation. As this is not addressed in a substantial manner in the Discussion, the authors may wish to describe their thinking in a bit more detail.</p><p>Overall, my major concerns raised with the original submission have been substantially addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) participate in a cell signaling pathways that are required for essential biological functions such as embryonic development, hematopoiesis, and wound repair. The focus of this manuscript is FGF2 which functions in normal cell growth and when mis-regulated plays a role in tumor-induced angiogenesis that is thought to be associated with tumor cell resistance to treatment therapies. FGF2 lacks a signal peptide and is transported into extracellular space by an ER/Golgi-independent mechanism. Results from cell-based experiments and in vitro studies, translocation of FGF2 is proposed to happen by direct protein translocation across the plasma membrane. This process depends on FGF2 oligomerization and sequential interaction with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the inner leaflet and heparan sulfate proteoglycans at the outer surface.</p><p>In this report the authors use NMR, in vitro translocation studies, and molecular dynamic simulations to study the mechanism of FGF2 translocation across membranes. Using NMR titration and binding assays the authors show that FGF2 binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and long chain heparins are mutually exclusive and that FGF2 has higher binding affinity for heparan sulfates and long-chain heparins. Using GUVs the authors confirm that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and heparan sulfates are sufficient to drive some FGF2 translocation across the membrane). They also confirm that FGF2 must oligomerize for translocation. Using supported lipid bilayers and single molecule techniques FGF2, the authors find that FGF2 oligomers are heterogeneous containing a range of ~8-12 subunits. Molecular dynamic simulations of early steps of FGF2 binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> confirmed that residues identified in previous mutational analysis studies are important for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding and that there may be previously unknown residues involved in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding when several PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> head groups bind FGF2 at the same time.</p><p>The novelty of this manuscript is the establishment of an in vitro system that has allowed the authors to directly test the minimal components FGF2 translocation. However, the results appear to confirm previous finding about FGF2 translocation that were discovered using other approaches. While solid and important work, it may not be of high enough impact for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The paper would be significantly strengthened if the authors were able to show that their work has led to novel, or previously unknown mechanism of FGF2 translocation.</p><p>1) It would be helpful to see the entire HSQCs for the binding titrations. Are the residues that bind PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and Heparan the only ones that shift?</p><p>2) How did the authors confirm that the GUVs contained PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on their surfaces and contain long-chain heparins in their lumen?</p><p>3) How does the concentration of FGF2 used in the in vitro experiments compare to the amount of FGF2 present in cells. If the amount of FGF2 added to the GUVs is lowered does translocation still occur?</p><p>4) The last part of the paper present molecular dynamics studies that suggests that there are previously uncharacterized residues on FGF2 that are important for translocation. Were these tested in the in vitro system and in cells to confirm their importance?</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The revision of this manuscript makes important changes and adds significant new data involving the roles of cholesterol, the lack of effect of heparin disaccharide in translocation, and informative new single molecule studies. As a result this already strong report is further improved and will be of interest to a range of readers. Publication in its present form would be appropriate.</p><p>There are however, three points that might be considered. Not that they need to be fully resolved before acceptance of the work, but the issues might be worth taking into account for interpretation.</p><p>First, the inability of heparin disaccharides to mimic the effect of heparin might be interpreted differently. The result is analogous to a PIP2-binding protein that does not bind IP<sub>3</sub> well. If the competition between PIP2 and heparin were analogous to an enzyme inhibitor and a substrate, a charge-matched heparin construct should compete for PIP2 if the concentration is enough. The need for a heparin polymer suggests that polyelectrolyte effects in addition to or instead of lock-key binding is relevant here. That was the reason to ask if HA can mimic heparin if it's packed in the vesicle lumen at high concentration. Heparin has nominally twice the charge density of HA, but maybe high concentration of HA would work. Without more data about e.g. the hydration state of the lipid and heparin bound to the FGF, it seems hard to distinguish traditional &quot;specific&quot; binding from equally specific charge density and polyelectrolyte effects.</p><p>Second, the experiments here are all done with only monovalent cations in the buffers. But in vivo, heparin is in a medium with mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and perhaps more important mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Most likely addition of extracellular concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or even intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> makes the experiments intractable, but at least some mention of divalents and what they are known from literature to do to PIP2 and heparin would be useful.</p><p>Third, in principle some of the issues can be addressed by MD simulation, but the system here is too briefly described and possibly too limited to get into the atomic detail needed to get an accurate picture of the charge interactions. For example, when PIP2 or heparin bind FGF, are waters lost or retained at the interface of the negative oxygen of the ligand and the positive nitrogen of the protein? The fact that the net charge of PIP2 is –4 suggests that there are limits in the MD. Recent work from Radhakrishnan's group show that a fuller treatment of PIP2 under realistic conditions reduces the net charge closer to –3, which alters the way the lipid orients and binds ligands.</p><p>As mentioned above, none of these issues are probably easily resolvable and they need not delay this study. But perhaps addressing the issues would strengthen the interpretation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28985.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>As you will see from the reviewer's comments, the biochemical reconstitution of FGF2 translocation is considered a biochemical tour de force.

Beyond the reconstitution of FGF2 membrane translocation with purified components and the demonstration of mutually exclusive interactions of FGF2 with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> versus heparin, we have now added a series of single molecule studies that functionally correlate the oligomeric state of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> induced FGF2 oligomers with membrane insertion and pore formation. Furthermore, the manuscript now contains a series of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that provide novel insights into the binding mechanism of FGF2 to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> as well as into the molecular mechanism of the initial steps of FGF2 oligomerization triggered by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. With these modifications, the revised manuscript addresses the three major aspects that were raised by the reviewers:</p><p>1) We have added additional controls to the core part of the original manuscript. This concerns experiments addressing questions of specificity when different forms of heparin are used as luminal traps for FGF2 in GUVs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) as well as a potential role of cholesterol in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent FGF2 membrane translocation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>).</p><p>2) We have added an entirely new section providing a functional single molecule</p><p>analysis of membrane-inserted FGF2 oligomers (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figs. 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">12</xref>). Following the suggestions of the reviewers, these studies provide the first insights into the structure-function relationship of membrane-inserted FGF2 oligomers. Our findings demonstrate PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent FGF2 oligomers to represent dynamic structures in the range of 10 to 12 subunits that form membrane-inserted translocation intermediates during unconventional secretion of FGF2. These findings are discussed in the context of a toroidal membrane pore and the assembly/disassembly hypothesis of FGF2 membrane translocation we have put forward previously [reviewed in (1)].</p><p>3) We added a new section based upon atomistic molecular dynamics simulations providing clues about the molecular mechanism of FGF2 binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and the initial steps of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> induced oligomerization of FGF2 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplements 1</xref>-8 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplements 1</xref>-3 and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>). Key aspects of this part are (i) the identification of additional binding sites in FGF2 resulting in multiple interactions of one FGF2 molecule with several PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecules and (ii) the identification of a high affinity dimer interface in FGF2 highlighting a disulfide bridge connecting two cysteine 95 residues. These results are discussed in the context of the FGF2 membrane translocation model we are putting forward with the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>1.) Oligomeric state of membrane-inserted FGF2 forms and size limit of membrane</italic></p><p><italic>pores generated by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> induced FGF2 oligomers</italic></p><p><italic>In previous studies, we have conducted experiments analyzing a potential size cutoff of membrane pores generated by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent FGF2 oligomerization and membrane insertion (2). While we found an Alexa488 dye (1 kDa) to physically traverse the membrane, the same dye coupled to either a dextran molecule (10 kDa) or cytochrome c (12 kDa) did not. Furthermore, we have previously shown that, upon membrane insertion of FGF2 oligomers, transbilayer diffusion of membrane lipids occurs providing direct evidence for the formation of a toroidal pore (2). These findings suggest that FGF2 oligomers insert into membranes through electrostatic interactions with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> thereby opening up a lipidic pore with a toroidal structure. In the revised manuscript, we have now included a series of single molecule measurements using both GUVs and supported lipid bilayers functionally correlating the oligomeric state of FGF2 with membrane pore formation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">12</xref>). We find membrane-inserted FGF2 oligomers to represent dynamic structures with pore forming species characterized by about 10 to 12 FGF2 subunits. As discussed in the revised manuscript, these findings are consistent with a toroidal architecture and point to a dynamic structure that is continuously assembled at the inner leaflet and disassembled at the outer leaflet resulting in net transport of FGF2 molecules across the membrane.</italic></p><p> <italic>2) The role of ATP1A1 in FGF2 membrane translocation</italic></p><p>The fact that FGF2 membrane translocation can be observed in the absence of ATP1A1 does not imply that our reconstitution system is unrelated to the physiological mechanism. The most simple explanation would be that ATP1A1 is required in cells as a first physical contact to accumulate FGF2 at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane at sites that provide proximity to Tec kinase and/or PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. This requirement might be simply bypassed in the reconstitution system when the essential components are present in a purified form. However, provided ATP1A1 could be included in a proper way into our reconstitution system, it is possible that the efficiency of FGF2 membrane translocation would increase. Therefore, while ATP1A1 clearly is not essential for FGF2 membrane translocation to occur, we are indeed investigating ways of reconstituting ATP1A1 as part of our FGF2 membrane translocation assay. However, as noted by reviewer #1, reconstituting multi-subunit integral membrane proteins in a functional form is technically challenging and beyond the focus of the current manuscript.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p> <italic>[…] 1) How does FGF2 traverse the hydrophobic part of the membrane?</italic></p><p><italic>The results from various studies point at a toroidal architecture of FGF2 induced membrane pores where the FGF2 oligomer is located in the center with each monomer bound to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> [reviewed in (1)]. The combined findings led to the assembly/disassembly model of FGF2 membrane translocation where FGF2 subunits are added to membrane-inserted FGF2 oligomers at the inner leaflet followed by removal of FGF2 subunits at the outer leaflet. The latter step is mediated by heparan sulfates that outcompete PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with regard to binding to FGF2. This process results in directional transport across the plasma membrane along with FGF2 trapping in the extracellular space where FGF2 remains bound to heparan sulfates on cell surfaces. As also explained in our response to reviewer #1, this view is supported by several lines of evidence. First, a toroidal architecture of FGF2 membrane pores is indicated by transbilayer diffusion of membrane lipids observed following membrane insertion of FGF2 oligomers (2). These results were corroborated by findings demonstrating that FGF2 oligomers can be extracted from membranes using carbonate, a direct indication of electrostatic rather than hydrophobic interactions with the membrane (3). Finally, the assembly/disassembly model as part of a toroidal pore is strongly supported by the current study demonstrating mutually exclusive interactions of FGF2 with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and heparin, the latter mimicking cellular heparan sulfates outcompeting PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and thereby trapping FGF2 at the extracellular leaflet. In conclusion, all data from various studies point to a mechanism of FGF2 membrane translocation that is characterized by a lack of physical contacts of FGF2 with the hydrophobic core of the membrane. With regard to transbilayer diffusion of membrane lipids (2), it is indeed likely that this phenomenon includes PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> itself as part of the assembly/disassembly mechanism of FGF2 membrane translocation. As suggested by reviewer #2, in the revised manuscript these aspects are now discussed in more detail along with the relevant literature on domain induced PIP2 flipping in cellular membranes.</italic></p><p><italic>2) Does FGF2 exclusively bind to the headgroup of PI(4,5)P2 ?</italic></p><p>There is no evidence that FGF2 interacts with the hydrophobic parts of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we have further tested this possibility and, consistent with previous biochemical and structural data, found a high affinity binding site for the headgroup of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplements 1</xref>-8 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplements 1</xref>-3 and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>). Intriguingly, these studies revealed additional binding sites in FGF2 for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that FGF2 accumulates PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecules at the sites of oligomerization and membrane pore formation. These findings are of extraordinary relevance for the formation of membrane pores with a toroidal architecture as we have shown previously that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is required for FGF2 membrane insertion based upon its ability to stabilize the high membrane curvature that characterizes toroidal pores (2). The molecular dynamics studies included into the revised manuscript further provide clues on the molecular mechanism of the initial steps of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> induced FGF2 oligomerization which will be highly relevant for future studies analyzing the fine structure of FGF2 oligomers as part of toroidal pores.</p><p><italic>3) How specific is the effect of heparin? Could it be replaced by for example hyarulonic acid?</italic></p><p>FGF family members are well characterized with regard to their ligand binding specificities. FGF2 has been shown to interact exclusively with sulphated glycosaminoglycans as contained in heparan sulfate proteoglycans. As opposed to heparan sulfates and other sulfated proteoglycans, cellular forms of hyaluronic acid do not contain sulfate groups. In any case, reviewer #2 inspired us to systematically compare long-chain heparins with a defined heparin disaccharide (as used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) in FGF2 membrane translocation assays. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and quantified in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, replacing long-chain heparins by a heparin disaccharide does not have any impact on membrane pore formation, however, FGF2 membrane translocation is almost fully blocked. These findings are in line with the NMR data and biochemical experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> demonstrating long-chain heparins to be required to outcompete PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with regard to binding to FGF2. Our combined results therefore corroborate the proposed model for the molecular mechanism of directional membrane translocation of FGF2 based on sequential interactions with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and heparan sufates on opposing sides of the membrane.</p><p><italic>4) Does heparin change the osmotic pressure and, in turn, membrane tension?</italic></p><p>As explained in “Materials and methods”, the generation procedures of all types and batches of GUVs were controlled by osmolality measurements and demonstrated not to be affected by adding either long-chain or disaccharide heparins. Therefore, artifacts related to differences in osmotic pressure and membrane tension can be excluded.</p><p><italic>5) Does cholesterol play a role in FGF2 membrane translocation?</italic></p><p><italic>As suggested by reviewer #2, we have conducted reconstitution experiments with heparin-containing GUVs that either contained or lacked cholesterol. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and quantified in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, omission of cholesterol causes a substantial decrease of both membrane pore formation and translocation of FGF2. The experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> indicate that, in the absence of cholesterol, binding of FGF2 to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is strongly impaired. This is consistent with previous studies from our laboratory demonstrating strong binding of FGF2 to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in liposomes with a plasma membrane like lipid composition whereas binding was found poor when PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was reconstituted in pure PC liposomes (4,5). Our combined findings suggest that components of the FGF2 secretion apparatus such as PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> are organized in cholesterol dependent microdomains that are required for efficient recruitment, oligomerization and membrane translocation of FGF2. The new results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> in the revised manuscript and are discussed accordingly.</italic></p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>1) What could be the role of ATP1A1 as a novel aspect of FGF2 membrane translocation?</italic></p><p>In previous studies, we have demonstrated a direct interaction of FGF2 with the cytoplasmic domain of ATP1A1 (6). As explained in our response to reviewer #1, the function of ATP1A1 in FGF2 secretion from cells might be a first physical contact of FGF2 with the inner leaflet of plasma membranes. One possible explanation for a requirement of ATP1A1 in FGF2 secretion from cells might be a need to accumulate FGF2 in plasma membrane microdomains mediating proximity to additional components such as Tec kinase and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. In our reconstitution system, this function might be bypassed when the essential components are present in a purified form. While we do run projects analyzing the function of ATP1A1 both in a cellular context and in reconstitution systems, these studies are clearly beyond the focus of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Do cysteine residues transplanted to FGF family members with signal peptides promote membrane translocation similar to FGF<sub>2</sub>?</italic></p><p>We have done such experiments in the context of cells (7). As a model FGF protein carrying a signal peptide, FGF4 has been used as it is a close structural relative of FGF2. Following removal of the signal peptide of FGF4, secretion became undetectable, however, after transplanting the critical cis-elements including Cys77 and Cys95, the corresponding FGF4/2 hybrid protein was indeed found rerouted into the unconventional secretory pathway of FGF2 (7). Accordingly, a double cysteine mutant of FGF2 (C77/95A) was used in the current study and demonstrated to be strongly impaired in membrane translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>).</p><p>References:</p><p>1.

In the revised manuscript, the authors now include several new findings that shed some light onto the mechanism of FGF2 translocation across a membrane. I find the most compelling of these to be the following:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Toroidal translocation intermediate</italic></p><p>A lipidic membrane pore with a toroidal architecture containing the FGF2 oligomer in its center is supported by several independent lines of evidence from previous publications and data from our current work. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which membrane-inserted forms of FGF2 oligomers act as translocation intermediates is not fully understood. We have put forward the hypothesis that membrane-inserted FGF2 oligomers are dynamic structures to which FGF2 subunits are constantly added at the inner leaflet concomitant with the removal of subunits at the outer leaflet. In this way, at steady state, membrane-inserted forms of FGF2 have a dynamic oligomeric state in the range of 8 to 12 FGF2 subunits that are continuously remodeled by adding and removing subunits on opposing sides of the membrane. It will be a challenge for future studies to find out whether these assembly/disassembly units are monomers or disulfide-bridged dimers of FGF2, the latter being functional in FGF2 signaling as part of ternary complexes with heparan sulfates and FGF high affinity receptors. Furthermore, a big goal in our lab will be to elucidate the three-dimensional architecture of membrane inserted FGF2 oligomers to fully understand how these complexes are functioning as translocation intermediates in unconventional secretion of FGF2.</p><p>As requested by reviewer 1, we have modified the discussion to explain these aspects in more detail.</p><p><italic>2) Modifications to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref> and the corresponding legend</italic></p><p>We have streamlined <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> with a simplified labelling of its subpanels that makes this figure more self-explanatory. Furthermore, the lipid tracer is now shown for both variant forms of FGF2 which helps to better distinguish the two experimental conditions being compared. The legend has been adapted accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>1) HSQC data from NMR experiments</italic></p><p>The full set of HSQC data from the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> has been added to the source file with all raw data available to the reader.</p><p><italic>2) Measurements of PI(4,5)P2 and heparin incorporation into GUVs</italic></p><p>Luminal incorporation of heparin into GUVs was monitored by confocal microscopy in control experiments using a fluorescent derivative. Likewise, the presence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the bilayers of GUVs was analyzed using a recombinant fusion protein consisting of GFP and the PH domain of PLCδ1, a canonical PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> marker. The ‘Materials and methods’ section has been modified accordingly along with the corresponding references.</p><p><italic>3) How does the concentration of FGF2 in cells compare with FGF2 concentrations usedin reconstitution experiments?</italic></p><p>Though the precise intracellular concentrations of FGF2 in μM has not been reported in the literature, tumor cells massively overexpress FGF2 under pathophysiological conditions which drives an autocrine secretion/signaling loop of FGF2. In our reconstitution experiments, FGF2 is used at low concentrations between 50 and 200 nM (to allow for single molecule measurements) that are likely to be way below the intracellular concentration of FGF2 in tumor cells.</p><p><italic>4) Analysis of additional residues in FGF2 with affinity to PI(4,5)P2 as identified by MD simulations</italic></p><p><italic>The residues we have identified previously in biochemical experiments (K127, R128 and K133) form a high affinity binding pocket for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> [Temmerman et al., (2008) Traffic 9:1204-1217]. Consistent with both biochemical experiments and MD simulations, these residues are essential for interactions of FGF2 with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> containing membranes and are required for FGF2 secretion from cells. The identification of additional residues in FGF2 mediating PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> clustering as identified in MD simulations is a novel finding of the current work with important implications for future studies. However, their detailed analysis in reconstitution experiments and cell-based assays is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</italic></p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Electrostatic aspects of mutually exclusive interactions of FGF2 with various forms of heparin and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></italic></p><p><italic>The electrostatic determinants of FGF2 binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, heparin isaccharides and long-chain heparins are an important aspect with regard to the mechanism of FGF2 membrane translocation we are proposing. However, it is clear from the literature that all of these interactions are not merely based upon the number of electrostatic pairs. Rather, both the orientation of sugar subunits in the heparin backbone and the positioning of sulfate moieties along the ring structure are critical determinants for FGF2 binding. There are in fact examples for different kinds of heparin molecules that are identical in net charge but differ in the positioning of the sulfate groups resulting in strong binding versus a complete lack of FGF2 binding [Li et al., (2014) ACS Chem Biol 9:1712-1717) and papers therein]. Likewise, we have previously demonstrated that FGF2 binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is much stronger compared to PI(3,4,5)P3 [Temmerman et al., (2008) Traffic 9:1204-1217], pointing at a defined binding pocket for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in FGF2 as demonstrated by our NMR experiments. Therefore, hyaluronic acid that lacks sulfate groups even at high concentrations is very unlikely to outcompete PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with regard to binding to FGF2. As outlined in our manuscript, there are two defined and overlapping binding epitopes in FGF2 for heparin and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> resulting in mutually exclusive interactions, a key aspect of the translocation model we are proposing.</italic></p><p><italic>2) Potential effects of divalent cations on FGF2-heparin interactions</italic></p><p><italic>As indicated by reviewer 3, the use of divalent calcium and magnesium ions in biochemical reconstitution experiments employing GUVs is technically challenging. However, in cell-based FGF2 secretion experiments, we found that both calcium (1.8mM) and magnesium ions (0.8 mM) in the extracellular medium does not affect the ability of heparan sulfates to trigger FGF2 membrane translocation and to retain FGF2 on cell surfaces (Zehe et al., 2006, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103:15479-15484). These observations in intact cells demonstrate that the mechanism we are proposing is functional even in the presence of millimolar concentrations of divalent cations.</italic></p><p><italic>3) MD simulations of the interaction between FGF2 and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</italic></p><p>Reviewer 3 commented on the net charge of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and referred to recent work by the Radhakrishnan group [e.g., J Phys Chem B 117, 8322 (2013)]. Their quantum mechanical calculations indicated a net charge of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to be –4 around pH 7. This is fully consistent with our work. However, deviations from the net charge of –4 were suggested in the presence of divalent ions. While the effects of divalent salt and its influence on the net charge of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> could be explored in MD simulations, it would require a computational resource that is larger by a factor of 5–10 compared to the resources used for the present work. In addition, the nature of the results is not expected to change as both –3 and –4 are exceptionally large charges for a lipid head group and will be predominate over any other lipid in terms of electrostatic interactions.</p><p>Another aspect raised by reviewer 3 concerned the role of water molecules in the course of FGF2 binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.To address this question, we analyzed our simulation data carefully by computing radial distribution functions, solvent accessible surface areas, number of water molecules around the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding pocket in FGF2 and number of hydrogen bonds between FGF2 binding pocket residues and water molecules. The best overall picture is given by the number of water molecules around the binding pocket region (residues K127, R128, K133). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Author response image 1</xref>, the number of water molecules is about 95 when FGF2 is not in contact with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>:<fig id="fig15" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28985.036</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Number of water molecules in the vicinity of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding pocket in FGF2 in the course of time.</title><p>The PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> head group binds to the binding pocket at about 500 ns. Here, a water molecule is considered to be in the vicinity of the binding pocket if its distance from the main residues (K127, R128, K133) is 0.6 nm or less.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28985.036">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28985.036</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28985-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p>When PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>binds to FGF2 by occupying the binding pocket at about 500 ns, the number of water molecules around the binding pocket region decreases by ~25% to about 70. This is quite expected, since the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> head group blocks some of the water molecules away from the binding pocket region. Nonetheless, the binding pocket remains very hydrated, i.e. the hydration level does not change in any essential manner.</p></body></sub-article></article>
