No other synthetic polymer has been developed to date, with physical properties comparable to NR. Although more than 2500 plant species are known to biosynthesize NR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Metcalfe, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Beilen and Poirier, 2007</xref>), industrial production of NR depends solely on latex, the cytoplasm of highly specialized cells known as laticifers harvested from the Para rubber tree <italic>Hevea brasiliensis</italic>. Despite its long history of use as an industrially essential natural material, the molecular mechanisms underlying NR biosynthesis, especially those required for the backbone structure formation, remain to be elucidated.</p><p>NR exists in latex as rubber particles (RPs), which primarily consist of a hydrophobic rubber core enclosed by a lipid monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cornish et al., 1999</xref>). In the 1960s, the enzyme responsible for NR biosynthesis from RPs was reported to be rubber transferase (RTase) [EC.2.5.1.20] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archer, 1969</xref>), although its proteinaceous components and catalytic mechanism were not elucidated. The backbone structure of NR comprises of a <italic>cis</italic>-1,4-polyisoprene with two or three <italic>trans</italic>-isoprene units at the ω-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanaka et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eng et al., 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Generally, the basic backbone structures of <italic>cis,trans</italic>-mixed polyisoprenoid alcohols, polyprenols and dolichols (C<sub>30</sub>–C<sub>120</sub>), are biosynthesized via sequential <italic>cis</italic>-condensation of the C<sub>5</sub> isoprene unit, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), onto all-<italic>trans</italic> short-chain prenyl diphosphates such as geranyl diphosphate (GPP, C<sub>10</sub>) <italic>E,E</italic>-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP, C<sub>15</sub>), and <italic>E,E,E</italic>-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP, C<sub>20</sub>). This reaction is catalyzed by <italic>cis</italic>-prenyltransferase (cPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takahashi and Koyama, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koyama, 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The common structural unit of polyisoprenoid alcohols and NR suggests that RTase is a member of the cPT family, although the NR carbon chain length (C<sub>&gt;1500</sub>) is much longer than that of other <italic>cis,trans</italic>-mixed polyisoprenoid alcohols, such as dolichols which are indispensable as sugar carrier lipids during the protein glycosylations in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helenius and Aebi, 2004</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19022.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Biosynthetic pathways of backbone structures of <italic>cis,trans</italic>-mixed polyisoprenoids and natural rubber, catalyzed by <italic>trans</italic>- and <italic>cis</italic>-prenyltransferases.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19022.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19022.002</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19022-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p>We previously isolated two cPT homologues, designated <italic>HRT1</italic> and <italic>HRT2</italic>, from <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic>, which are predominantly expressed in latex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asawatreratanakul et al., 2003</xref>). Recombinant proteins of HRT1 and HRT2 expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> did not exhibit distinct cPT activity independently in vitro. While the recombinant proteins of HRT1 and HRT2, expressed in yeast and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> showed significant activity, producing C<sub>80–100</sub> polyisoprenoids, they failed to produce longer chain products corresponding to NR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, cPT homologues expressed in latex of other NR-producing plants, such as Russian dandelion (<italic>Taraxacum koksaghyz</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmidt et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmidt et al., 2010b</xref>), lettuce (<italic>Lactuca sativa</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qu et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Euphorbia characias</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spanò et al., 2015</xref>), have been isolated, although their recombinant proteins show no RTase activity in vitro. RNA interference-mediated knock-down of cPTs expressed in the latex of <italic>Taraxacum brevicorniculatum</italic> have been shown to decrease latex rubber content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Post et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting the involvement of cPT in NR formation. However, there is no direct evidence to date suggesting that the cPTs expressed in latex are RTases. Therefore, latex-specific cPTs are thought to require eukaryotic cell-specific factor(s) to exhibit cPT activity and additional factor(s) in the latex to modify these cPTs into RTases.</p><p>With regard to activation of eukaryotic cPTs, a family of Nogo-B receptor (NgBR) performs the role of regulator of cPT activity. NgBR from humans, originally identified as a receptor for the N-terminal portion of reticulon 4B/Nogo-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miao et al., 2006</xref>), contains three predicted transmembrane domains in its N-terminal region, and a domain exhibiting low similarity to cPT in the C-terminal half, although it does not have catalytic residues conserved among cPTs. In the cPT-like domain, NgBR can also interact with a human cPT HDS/hCIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shridas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Endo et al., 2003</xref>) to stabilize it on the ER membrane, resulting in cPT activity enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>). Knock-down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>) or a mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eng et al., 1994</xref>) of <italic>NgBR</italic> causes defects in protein <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation as a consequence of a reduction in the level of dolichyl phosphates and dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, indicating that NgBR is an HDS-interacting protein and this interaction is critical for its activity. <italic>NUS1</italic>, a yeast homolog of NgBR, is implicated to have an important role in <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation and cPT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2014</xref>). It has also been reported that a defect in <italic>LEW1</italic>, a counterpart of NgBR in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, results in reduced levels of dolichol contents and protein glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Despite its importance in the eukaryotic <italic>cis,trans</italic>-mixed polyisoprenoid biosynthesis, a precise role of NgBR in cPT activity is still unknown owing to a lack of in vitro studies on the function of NgBR family with purified proteins. Moreover, its role as an essential subunit of a deduced cPT-containing protein complex is controversial as various eukaryotic cPTs heterologously expressed in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> have shown distinct activity without co-expression of their partner NgBR family protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asawatreratanakul et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmidt et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shridas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Endo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cunillera et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Surmacz et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we identified a protein complex that function as the NR biosynthetic machinery on RPs. We identified the partner proteins of HRT1 by RP proteomics and interaction network assays, revealing the formation of a protein complex consisting of HRT1 and two RP-bound proteins, where one of the two was a <italic>Hevea</italic> NgBR homolog. To investigate functions of the partner proteins, we developed a cell-free translation-coupled recombinant protein introduction system on detergent-washed <italic>Hevea</italic> RPs (WRPs). This enabled de novo synthesis of NR in vitro by the recombinant protein, providing the first direct evidence that HRT1 is an RTase in <italic>H. brasiliensis.</italic> In this system, a heterologous cPT from another rubber-producing plant, introduced on <italic>Hevea</italic> RPs, also exhibited RTase activity comparable to that of HRT1, indicating that accurate introduction of cPT on the WRPs is key to the functional expression of RTase. Reconstitution assays of HRT1 and the partner proteins on WRPs illustrated that the formation of an HRT1-containing ternary complex is important for efficient rubber production via NR biosynthesis from RPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a Nogo-B receptor homologue from <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic> latex</title><p>Based on the hypothesis that the indispensable factor for RTase activity might be proteins on RPs, we undertook a comprehensive identification of proteins on RPs from <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic> latex. Before the proteomic analyses, proteins unnecessary for RTase activity were removed from RPs by washing with CHAPS as it was the best detergent for removing protein from the RPs and had a relatively low inhibitory effect on the RTase activity among the 15 detergents tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Stepwise washing with buffers containing CHAPS resulted in washing-out a lot of the RP proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), whereas 80% of the RTase activity was retained on the detergent-washed RPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Proteome analyses were conducted after removal of the protein bands corresponding to the well-studied RP-abundant hydrophobic proteins, REF (14.6 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dennis and Light, 1989</xref>) and small rubber particle protein (SRPP, 24 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oh et al., 1999</xref>), to detect low-abundance proteins. Peptides corresponding to HRT1 or HRT2 were identified among 137 proteins (115 subfamilies) assigned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">2</xref>); however, this result does not allow to discriminate between these two cPTs since some detected fragments correspond to the sequences shared by both enzymes. No other prenyltransferase or enzyme in the IPP biosynthetic pathways was detected from the proteome analyses of the detergent-washed RPs, in contrast with previous proteome analyses of non-detergent-washed RPs from <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic>, in which several homologues of cPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dai et al., 2013</xref>) and a homologue of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiang et al., 2012</xref>), one of late-limiting enzyme in the IPP biosynthetic pathway, were detected. However, we also identified a protein assigned as a homologous protein of NgBR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>). The NgBR homologue from <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic> showed greater similarity to higher plant orthologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) that have one predicted transmembrane domain in the N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brasher et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In parallel with the RP proteomics, we isolated the <italic>Hevea</italic> homologue of NgBR by screening REF-interacting proteins against normalized latex cDNA libraries using a split-ubiquitin-based yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system (see below). Several studies have suggested that REF may be involved in NR biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthelot et al., 2014a</xref>), although its precise function is unclear. Quantitative analyses of the transcript levels in various tissues showed predominant expression of the NgBR homologue in latex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), along with cPTs (<italic>HRT1</italic> and <italic>HRT2</italic>) and <italic>REF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2014a</xref>), and the transcript level of the NgBR homologue in latex was comparable to those of <italic>HRT1</italic> and <italic>HRT2</italic>, but 540-fold lower than that of <italic>REF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2014a</xref>). These results suggested that the NgBR homologue might possibly form a complex with HRT1/HRT2 and REF on RPs.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19022.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of a <italic>Hevea</italic> NgBR homologue.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Solubilization of proteins from RPs.

The fluorescence signals for mTq2-fused HRBP or REF showed network-like patterns, which almost overlapped with an mCherry (mChe)-HDEL ER marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that these proteins were predominantly localized at the ER. HRBP:mTq2-derived signals were also observed as small dots, which did not overlap with signals for an mChe-fused Golgi marker, N-terminal 49 amino acids of GmManI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saint-Jore-Dupas et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We could not detect distinct fluorescence signals for HRT1:mTq2 or HRT2:mTq2 when they were co-expressed with mVenus as an introduction marker. However, when HRT1:mTq2 was co-expressed with HRBP:mVenus, high HRT1:mTq2 fluorescence signals were detected at the Golgi, with weaker signals at the ER. Additionally, co-expression of HRT1:mTq2 changed the subcellular localization of fluorescent signals for HRBP:mVenus from the ER to the Golgi, which perfectly overlapped with those of the Golgi-localized HRT1:mTq2. These results indicate that HRT1 is stabilized in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cells by complex formation with the HRBP, which induces translocation of HRBP from the ER to the Golgi. In the co-expression system of HRT2:mTq2 and HRBP:mVenus, HRT2:mTq2-derived signals localized at the plasma membrane, showing a partial overlap with a marker protein mChe-AtPIP2A localized at the ER to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>). These results indicate that HRT2 is also stabilized by HRBP in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cells. Surprisingly, in this co-expression system, subcellular localization of HRBP:mVenus was clearly altered from the ER to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), concordant with the BiFC signals for the HRT2–HRBP interaction at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Taken together with the basic subcellular localization of HRBP on the ER, HRBP is assumed to assist incorporation or stabilization of HRT2 on the ER membrane and to be co-translocated to the plasma membrane with HRT2. Additionally, the different subcellular localization of HRT1 and HRT2 co-expressed with HRBP indicates that they have different roles. Considering that RPs are speculated to originate from the ER or Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrispeels and Herman, 2000</xref>), HRT1 may be more important in NR biosynthesis than HRT2. By contrast, the subcellular localizations of REF and HRBP were not influenced by co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although the fluorescence patterns of REF:mTq2 and HRBP:mVenus matched almost completely, formation of the REF–HRBP complex is considered to be limited to specific particles, possibly derived from the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The formation of homomeric complexes of REF and HRBP only on small bodies and/or particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) suggests that physical interactions among HRT1, HRBP and REF might correlate with the protein topology on the membrane of specified compartments derived from the ER or the Golgi.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19022.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Subcellular localizations of HRT1, HRT2, HRBP and REF.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescent images of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf epidermal cells expressing target proteins (indicated in each panel) fused with a fluorescent protein, mTq2, mVenus or mChe, at their C-terminus.

To prepare RPs with minimal endogenous proteins, 50kRPs were washed with 8 mM CHAPS for 1 hr (see Materials and methods), which was optimized to suppress irreversible coagulation of the resulting detergent-washed RPs (WRPs) during the cell-free translation reaction, probably caused by a loss of membrane-bound proteins important for RP stability. Washing in this condition resulted in removal of a lot of RP proteins, including REF and SRPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>), whereas 89% of the RTase activity was retained on the WRPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). After the cell-free translation reaction with WRPs, the WRP with exogenously expressed proteins can be easily separated by ultracentrifugation into the top layer (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Localizations of the exogenously expressed proteins on WRP were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Similar to the case of proteoliposomes, most expressed proteins tested were incorporated into WRPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). When these target proteins were expressed alone, some HRT1 proteins existed in the soluble fraction, whereas HRBP and REF were incorporated almost completely into WRP. However, the amount of HRT1 not incorporated on WRPs was decreased by co-expression of HRBP and REF, indicating that these proteins promotes the incorporation of HRT1 into WRPs, but are not necessary for anchoring HRT1 on WRPs. In this system, the WRP stability was influenced by introduction of exogenously expressed proteins. Detergent washing induced RP coagulation and increased the apparent average diameter; the average diameter of RPs before the detergent treatment was 222 nm whereas that of WRPs was 1244 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This effect was escalated by the in vitro expression of HRBP, HRT1 and a His-tag-containing peptide from the control vector. Interestingly, however, REF expression resulted in decreased WRP coagulation, lowering the apparent average diameter towards that of the non-detergent-washed RPs, indicating that REF stabilizes WRP by preventing aggregation. This effect was dominant for the coagulation-inducible proteins, HRBP and HRT1; coagulation of WRPs was inhibited when three proteins, HRT1, HRBP and REF, were co-expressed.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19022.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Cell-free translation-coupled protein introduction onto WRPs.</title><p>Immunodetection of HRT1, His6-tagged HRBP and REF with anti-HRT1/HRT2 antibody, anti-His6 antibody and anti-REF antibody, respectively.

The HRT1-derived RTase activity was enhanced by co-expression of HRBP and was markedly activated by additional introduction of REF. <sup>14</sup>C-IPP incorporation in the assays of WRPs carrying three proteins was increasing linearly during 20 hr of the reaction time, whereas for WRPs carrying HRT1 only or two proteins, HRT1 and HRBP, the incorporation was weakened after 8 hr, suggesting that co-expression of REF and HRBP stabilized HRT1 on WRPs. The RTase activity of WRPs carrying three proteins depended on the HRT1 and HRBP protein levels, and the activity reached a plateau when the HRT1 and HRBP levels were apparently equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The RTase activity of the triple components showed a strict allylic substrate dependency; the RTase was most active with FPP (C<sub>15</sub>) while the activity was low in the absence of an allylic substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Other allylic substrates showed comparable activities when the triple components were used for the reactions (e.g., GPP and GGPP showed 83% and 93% activities, respectively), and the patterns of allylic substrate dependency were quite similar to those of the control reactions using WRPs expressing REF only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) and WRPs alone as reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rojruthai et al., 2010</xref>). Gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) of the <sup>14</sup>C-IPP-derived reaction products revealed that the size distributions of polyisoprenoids synthesized in vitro with WRPs carrying HRT1 were similar to those with control WRPs, showing unimodal size distributions with a peak at &gt;10<sup>6</sup> as endogenous NR in WRPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), concordant with previous reports for small rubber particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rojruthai et al., 2010</xref>) that corresponds to the 50kRP in this study. The size distributions of the HRT1-derived polyisoprenoids were not influenced by co-expression of HRBP and REF, suggesting that complex formation on the WRPs does not affect the product chain-length regulation mechanism of HRT1. These results, together with the allylic primer requirement for the RTase reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), suggest a possibility that HRT1 on WRP catalyzes a de novo rubber formation using allylic primer substrates, GPP, FPP and GGPP, rather than addition of IPP onto the α-terminus of pre-existing rubber molecules in WRPs, which is concordant with the backbone structure of NR, a <italic>cis</italic>-1,4-polyisoprene with several <italic>trans</italic>-isoprene units at the ω-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanaka et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eng et al., 1994</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19022.023</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Enzymatic characterization of HRT1, HRBP and REF introduced on WRPs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vitro RTase activities of HRT1, HRBP and REF, introduced onto 1 µg of WRPs, in the reaction with FPP and <sup>14</sup>C-IPP as substrates.

However, practical, functional identification of RTase was not accomplished to date, owing to the absence of in vitro RTase activity distinctly exhibited by recombinant cPTs. In a previous study to elucidate activation mechanism of cPT as RTase, we showed that the refolded HRT2, which was heterologously expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified from its insoluble membrane fraction under denaturing conditions, was significantly activated by the addition of washed-bottom fraction (BF) of <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic> latex. This resulted in the formation of polyisoprenes with similar molecular size distributions as that of the NR in <italic>Hevea</italic> latex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asawatreratanakul et al., 2003</xref>). Whereas the refolded recombinant HRT1 was not activated. BF is the sediment fraction separated by ultracentrifugation of latex and consists mainly of membrane-bound polydisperse particles called lutoids and contaminated RPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moir, 1959</xref>), with lower RTase activity compared to that of RPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tangpakdee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wititsuwannakul et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it was suggested that HRT2 might function as a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of natural rubber, correlating with essential co-factor(s) included in the washed-BF. Likewise, eukaryotic long-chain cPTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takahashi and Koyama, 2006</xref>), responsible for formation of dolichols and/or long-chain (C<sub>&gt;70</sub>) polyprenols, such as Rer2p and Srt1p from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sato et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sato et al., 2001</xref>), DPS from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cunillera et al., 2000</xref>), and HDS from humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Endo et al., 2003</xref>), do not exhibit cPT activity in vitro when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. These eukaryotic cPTs were functionally identified by an in vitro assay with crude membrane or microsomal proteins from an yeast mutant strain of <italic>RER2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sato et al., 1999</xref>), expressing a heterologous cPT. This can be described as an almost solo authorised approach for the functional identification to date. In this yeast system, both HRT2 and HRT1 show distinct cPT activity, producing polyisoprenoids with chain-lengths ranging from C<sub>80</sub> to C<sub>100</sub> as general eukaryotic long-chain cPTs. However, their catalytic properties have never been successfully modified into RTase by the addition of any latex fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>). These facts suggest that both, HRT1 and HRT2 may require additional factor(s) present within the eukaryotic cell to exhibit cPT activity and other latex-specific factor(s) to exhibit RTase activity. Additionally, HRT1/HRT2 incorporated into the yeast microsome or membrane fraction may be established as a long-chain cPT even in the presence of latex-derived factor(s). Eukaryotic post-translational modifications such as glycosylations in the ER were considered to be potential candidates for a key activation factor of eukaryotic cPTs generally localised to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shridas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sato et al., 2001</xref>).

Recently, NgBR homologs on RPs were identified from other NR producing plants, lettuce, and Russian dandelion, using an RP proteomics approach, although no cPT homolog was detected in these proteomics analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Janina, 2015</xref>). These NgBR homologs were shown to interact with cPT(s) exclusively expressed in latex. A knockdown of these NgBR homologs results in significant decrease of rubber content, suggesting involvement of the NgBR homologs in the NR biosynthesis of these NR-producing plants. These observations correlate with former reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu et al., 2006</xref>), in which knockdown or mutation of the NgBR family proteins from humans and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> resulted in severe <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation defects, owing to decrease in contents of dolichyl phosphates, <italic>cis,trans</italic>-mixed polyisoprenoids formed by the action of long-chain cPTs. While cPT is encoded by one or two genes in yeasts and animals, in higher plats it is generally encoded by a multigene family, resulting in generation of the short-, middle-, and long-chain cPTs. Short- or middle-chain cPTs from <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>, heterologously expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, exhibit a distinct cPT activity independently in vitro, producing polyisoprenoids shorter than C<sub>60</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, the recombinant protein of a <italic>cis,trans</italic>-mixed heptaprenyl diphosphate (C<sub>35</sub>) synthase from <italic>A. thalina</italic>, also exhibits a cPT activity independently without corresponding NgBR family protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Surmacz et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, the NgBR family protein is considered to be a subunit protein of a long-chain cPT on the ER, responsible for the dolichol or NR formations, resulting in enhancement of cPT activity. However, it is unclear whether involvement of the NgBR family protein is a stringent requirement for cPT activation since various eukaryotic long-chain cPTs, including HRT1 and HRT2, expressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> show distinct activity without co-expression of a partner NgBR family protein. In vitro results in the present study emphasize that an NgBR family protein is not necessary for the catalytic activity of cPT to produce polyisoprenoids that correspond to NR; HRT1 and LsCPT3 showed a significant rubber-producing activity when introduced into WRPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">10</xref>). Due to low amino acid sequence identities between HRT1/HRT2, and LsCPT3 and between HRBP and LsCPTL2 (53% and 45%, respectively), it is unlikely that the small amount of HRBP retained on RPs after the detergent wash could have interacted with LsCPT3 as a surrogate partner for its activation. In practice, we have analysed cross-species interaction partnerships between cPT and NgBR family proteins from different plant species by BiFC in the <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> system, but no distinct interaction between LsCPT3 and HRBP can be detected (unpublished data). It is interesting that coexpression of LsCPT3-LsCPTL2 on WRPs caused a slight increase in efficiency of rubber production, whereas that of HRT1-HRBP did not produce such an effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Whether similar phenomena are observed using other cPTs and NgBR homologs from NR-producing plants remains to be determined. Taken together with the observation that distinct fluorescent signals for mTq2-fused HRT1 or HRT2 in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cells were detected only when they were co-expressed with mVanus-fused HRBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the NgBR family protein may play an important role in proper introduction and folding of cPT or its stabilization on the ER membrane, especially in a heterologous cell expression system, which may be conserved in the RTase in NR-producing plants.</p><p>The absence of any RTase activity by HRT1 introduced on liposomes by the cell-free translation-coupled system suggests that structural arrangements of RPs, a hydrophobic core of rubber molecules surrounded by a lipid monolayer, and/or membrane proteins on RPs may be required for HRT1 to exhibit RTase activity. It has been demonstrated that appropriate interactions between lipids and the proteins are required to facilitate accurate folding of membrane proteins during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cymer et al., 2015</xref>). To date, various methods for cell-free protein synthesis supplemented with biological membranes or membrane-mimicking structures, such as microsomes, micelles, liposomes, bicelles and nanodiscs, have been developed as a promising strategy to obtain functional membrane proteins. However, it has been pointed out that function and activity of the resulting proteins depend critically on properties of the membrane applied, such as lipid composition, phase, tension, fluidity and curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cymer et al., 2015</xref>). Although neither HRT1 nor HRT2 have any deduced transmembrane domains (predicted by TMHMM; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/</ext-link>), these cPTs may require the membrane environment of RPs or the ER for accurate and functional folding, which is considered to correlate with incorporation of HRT1 into WRPs after cell-free synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In our previous study, the refolded HRT2, heterologously expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified under a denaturing condition, was significantly activated by the addition of washed BF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asawatreratanakul et al., 2003</xref>). In this case, the partially unfolded HRT2 might be introduced into some membrane systems in BF, microsomal membranes or contaminated RPs, and refolded to exhibit RTase activity. In the present study, we tested a reconstitution of HRT2 in the WRP-based in vitro translation system. However, the protein level was very low compared to that of HRT1 for unknown reason. Also, the WRPs with recombinantly expressed HRT2 did not show distinct RTase activity (data not shown).</p><p>Of note was that the size distributions of rubber products from HRT1 and LsCPT3 were quite similar to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). These results suggest that the molecular size of de novo synthesised rubber by recombinant cPTs may be determined not by catalytic properties of each cPT but by structural properties of RPs, although further investigations will be needed to elucidate the mechanism for chain-length determination of rubber products. The architecture of RP is considered to be favourable for accommodation of extraordinarily long polyprenyl products formed by sequential condensation of IPP by an RP-localized RTase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). Whereas non-NR-producing eukaryotes also have organelles with a similar structural property, i.e., an ER-derived lipid droplet consists of a hydrophobic core of lipids, triacylglycerols and steryl esters, surrounded by a lipid monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrispeels and Herman, 2000</xref>). Srt1p was reported to be localized on lipid droplets in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sato et al., 2001</xref>), and Nus1p was also detected on lipid droplets using a proteomic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grillitsch et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting co-localization or interaction of these proteins on lipid droplets. The fact that yeast does not show RTase activity suggests that arrangement of a cPT with an NgBR family protein on an organelle with a hydrophobic core to accommodate extraordinarily long polyprenyl products may not be a determinant for modification of the cPT into active RTase.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19022.025</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Schematic models of the rubber biosynthetic machinery on RPs (A) and RP formation correlated with the interactions of proteins (B) in the latex of <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic>. RPs, rubber particles.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19022.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19022.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19022-fig11-v3"/></fig></p><p>In spite of high amino acid sequence identity between HRT1 and HRT2 (88%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), these cPTs showed different subcellular localizations in the <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> expression system; HRT1 in the Golgi or ER and HRT2 on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). While subcellular localizations of HRT1 and HRBP are altered from the Golgi to the ER by co-expression of REF, HRT2 is translocated to the plasma membrane, accompanied by HRBP regardless of REF co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting failure of REF to retain the HRT2-HRBP complex in the ER. These results suggest that cell biological roles of HRT2 in laticifer may be different from those of HRT1. Cell biological roles of cPT on the plasma membrane remain to be elucidated and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the identification of a plasma membrane-localised eukaryotic cPT. In addition, <italic>HRT1</italic> expression is severely restricted in the latex of <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic>, while <italic>HRT2</italic> transcripts are detected in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2014a</xref>). According to the functional characterizations of HRT2 heterologously expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asawatreratanakul et al., 2003</xref>) and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>), HRT2 essentially possess catalytic function as cPT or possibly as RTase. Nevertheless, above-mentioned evidences suggest a possibility that HRT1 may be the principal catalytic component of RTase responsible for NR biosynthesis in <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic>, although we still consider a possible involvement of other cPTs including HRT2 in the NR biosynthesis. Two mechanisms for the NR biosynthesis have been proposed so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rojruthai et al., 2010</xref>): the first one is de novo formation of NR via sequential <italic>cis</italic>-1,4-condensation of IPP onto short-chain allylic diphosphates as primer substrates; the second one is elongation or addition of IPP at the α-terminal reactive moiety of pre-exiting rubber molecules or polyprenyl diphosphates in RPs. The allylic diphosphate primer requirement for the RTase reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) and no detectable proteins responsible for the short-chain allylic diphosphate biosynthesis on the detergent-washed RPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">)</xref> suggest a possibility that HRT1 on WRP catalyzes a de novo rubber formation using allylic diphosphate as primer substrates. However, an alternative scenario that HRT2 on the WRPs functions as cPT to form polyprenyl diphosphates, which might be utilised by HRT1 as acceptor substrates in the latter NR biosynthetic mechanism, can not be ruled out.</p><p>For the next logical step, topologies of HRT1 and HRBP on membrane systems need to be discussed. HRBP is a distantly-related structural homolog of HRT1. The amino acid sequence of HRBP shows some similarity to that of HRT1 (sequence identity: 10.9%), although only HRBP is predicted to have a membrane-spanning region at its N-terminus. As the three-dimensional structure of HRT1 is not yet available, the most suitable templates for predicting the structure of HRBP are bacterial cPTs, which are shown to form homodimers within their crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujihashi et al., 2001</xref>). The results from the Y2H and BiFC assays show that HRBP interacts with HRT1, whereas HRT1 does not interact with itself; i.e., HRT1 may form a heteromeric complex with HRBP rather than form a homomultimeric structure on RPs, although HRBP also exhibited self-interaction in the Y2H and BiFC assays. Reconstitution experiments with the two components on WRPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) support this hypothesis: the reconstituted RTase activity is highest when these two components are expressed. Further experiments are needed to elucidate more precise stoichiometry of the complex.</p><p>We demonstrated that HRBP interacted with REF, a well-known RP-bound protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthelot et al., 2014a</xref>). The results of this study also revealed the function of REF as a module of the RTase machinery. Although we have no data for the stoichiometry of an HRBP-REF complex, specific interaction partnerships, HRT1-HRBP and HRBP-REF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), and probable formation of the ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) indicate that HRBP functions as a mediating protein between REF and HRT1 to form the ternary complex on RP. Additionally, only when REF was co-expressed with HRT1 and HRBP, the reconstituted RTase activity showed a significant increase. Taken together, the ternary complex including HRT1 may function as rubber-producing machinery on RPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of SRPP, another RP-abundant protein in <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic>, contains a REF-homology domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oh et al., 1999</xref>). To date, several homologous proteins of SRPP have been identified not only from rubber-producing plants but also non-rubber producing plants, designated as the SRPP family or stress-related protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthelot et al., 2014a</xref>). However, no counterpart of REF, a shorter protein than SRPP family, has been found from other species. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laibach et al. (2015)</xref> reported that silencing of a <italic>REF</italic>-related gene <italic>TbREF</italic> affected the rubber production in the RP of Russian dandelion, even though this gene is rather homologous to SRPP. It is unknown whether TbREF interacts with other component(s) such as an NgBR homologue of Russian dandelion. The system for in vitro translation-coupled introduction of hydrophobic proteins on RPs, developed in this study, also enables us to shed light on molecular function of REF and SRPP on RPs. Our observations of REF in modulating diameters of WRPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) represents the first direct evidence of REF being an important protein in the WRP stability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berthelot et al. (2014b)</xref> reported different behaviors of REF and SRPP on model membrane systems, where REF inserts into membranes and disrupts their integrity, whereas SRPP weakly interacts with membranes without any disruption. Since REF is likely to insert itself into RP, it is expected to interact with rubber molecules in RP. Our future plans include study of whether REF controls the turnover of RTase by interacting with the rubber molecule produced by HRT1 in a deeper region of the RP membrane.</p><p>Similarities between the structures of RP and the ER-derived lipid droplet (<italic>i.e.</italic> a hydrophobic core surrounded by a lipid monolayer) suggest that RPs may originate from the ER or Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrispeels and Herman, 2000</xref>). This speculation was bolstered by identification of various proteins homologous to vesicular trafficking-related proteins in the ER or Golgi apparatus, on WRPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). For example, Rab GTPases, RabB (ER to Golgi), RabD (ER to Golgi) and RabH (the Golgi), a Sar1-type coat GTPase (ER to Golgi), a YKT6 type R-SNARE (trans-Golgi network, TGN), and clathrins (TGN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nielsen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassham et al., 2008</xref>). However, the co-existence of marker proteins for other vesicles involved in different phases of membrane trafficking pathways, e.g. the endocytic/endosomal compartments (RabA, RabC, RabE, RabF, an ArfB-type coat GTPase and clathrins), vacuoles (RabG) and lipid-bodies (β-1,3-glucase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paul et al., 2014</xref>]), on RPs suggests that RP formation and maturation may be complicated by fusion of multiple vesicles. Different subcellular localization of the protein complexes HRT1–HRBP and HRBP–REF may partly reflect the stepwise formation of the HRT1–HRBP–REF complex on RPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). In addition, proteomics of the detergent-washed RPs did not identify any major lipid droplet proteins such as seipin, perilipins or oleosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murphy, 2012</xref>), consistent with a previous proteomics study of RPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dai et al., 2013</xref>). This implies that mechanisms for de novo formation from the ER and maturation of RPs may be different from those of lipid droplets.</p><p>In conclusion, this study represents important progress toward understanding the molecular machinery of rubber production on RP. Identification of the two partner proteins of HRT1 provides suggestions for possible formation of a ternary complex that functions as the RTase. Although the interactions between cPTs and NgBR homologs are generally assumed in other organisms, HRBP-REF interaction discovered in this study is specific to NR production. Cell biological analyses of the localization of the three components suggest that RPs can be generated by a fusion of various cellular vesicles. We demonstrated in vitro rubber production on WRP for the first time by heterologously expressing cPTs from the Para rubber tree and lettuce, although the assay system developed in this study still included a small amount of endogenous proteins sustained on WRPs. We also showed that HRBP and REF promoted efficient rubber synthesis in the same system when these two proteins were co-expressed with HRT1. Future work will include investigating the structures and functions of the two partner proteins of HRT1. In particular, the effect of REF on the alterations of specific membrane systems is a noteworthy observation. The in vitro translation-coupled protein reconstitution on WRPs is a versatile system for total elucidation of NR biosynthesis and may lead to molecular breeding of transgenic plants with enhanced NR biosynthetic activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials and total RNA extraction</title><p>Fresh latex was obtained from the Para rubber trees (<italic>H. brasiliensis</italic> clone RRIM 600) growing on a commercial plantation in Thailand by tapping of the bark of the tree trunks, performed basically as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kush et al.

Messenger RNA was synthesized in vitro using reagents, Transcription buffer LM, NTP mix and SP6 RNA polymerase, provided from the kit, and the plasmid described above or their empty vector as a template. The synthesised mRNA was purified by ethanol precipitation, and the mRNA pellet was resuspended in 25 µl of SUBAMIX SGC buffer (ENDEXT, CellFree Science). The volume of the mRNA solution added in the standard in vitro translation reaction were varied among each component as follows; HRT1, 3.75 µl; HRBP and REF, 0.75 µl, which were optimized to make the resulting protein expression levels almost even and to minimise negative effects on RP stability by the introduction of these exogenous proteins.</p><p>Liposomes (20 mg/ml in a SUBAMIX SGC buffer) were prepared from L-α -phosphatidylcholine (Soy PC, Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Alabaster, USA) by sonication for 5 min on ice. The sonicated liposomes were then treated by Mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc) equipped with a polycarbonate membrane of 0.1 µm pore size. WRPs were prepared by incubating 50kRP with 8 mM CHAPS for 1 hr at 4°C followed by ultracentrifugation at 50,000 ×g for 30 min.

After the reaction, the mixture of cell-free reaction was ultracentrifuged at 50,000 ×g for 20 min due to the partial purification of RPs. Then, the lower layer, a clear solution that contained wheat germ extract, was removed and the upper layer (RPs) was resuspended in original volume of SUBAMIX SGC buffer. Proteoliposomes were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended with SUBAMIX SGC buffer, and the resulting solution was sonicated for 10 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Enzymatic assay of rubber synthesizing activity</title><p>The RTase activity of recombinant proteins from cell-free system was measured by the modified method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takahashi et al. (2012)</xref>. The reaction mixture contains 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 15 µM FPP, 100 µM [4-<sup>14</sup>C]IPP (740 GBq/mol, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and a suitable amount of RPs or proteoliposomes partially purified from the cell-free reaction. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30˚C for 16 hr. After incubation, 0.2 ml of H<sub>2</sub>O saturated with NaCl was added to the reaction mixture, and then polyprenyl diphosphate products, apparently smaller than natural rubber molecular weight range, were extracted by 1 ml of 1-butanol saturated with H<sub>2</sub>O. The residual rubber in aqueous phase was extracted two times with 500 µl of toluene/hexane mixture (1:1 v/v) (T/H). The radioactivity of the T/H extract was measured with a liquid scintillation counter (PACKARD 1600TR) and the amount of <sup>14</sup>C-IPP incorporated into rubber molecules was calculated as rubber synthesizing activity. For determination of the relative RP (i.e., rubber) contents in each reaction, 15 µl of an aliquot of the RP solution, partially purified after the cell-free translation reaction, was diluted into 0.3 ml of H<sub>2</sub>O saturated with NaCl, and then washed with 1 ml of 1-butanol. After removing the 1-butanol layer, the residual rubber in aqueous phase was extracted two times with 500 µl of tetrahydrofuran (THF). The absorbance at 210 nm of the THF extract was used to estimate relative rubber content in each RP solution applied for the assay, which was used for normalization of the RTase activity. The relative rubber content in the RP solution, derived from the cell-free reaction to express HRT1, was taken to be 1.0. For substrate dependencies assays, following compounds were used as an allylic substrates: dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP, C<sub>5</sub>), <italic>E</italic>-geranyl diphosphate (GPP, C<sub>10</sub>), FPP and <italic>E,E,E</italic>-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP, C<sub>20</sub>). The concentration of each allylic substrate in the assay was 15 µM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of reaction products from the enzymatic assay</title><p>The T/H extracts from rubber synthesizing assay were subjected to gel permeation chromatography (GPC) which was carried out with Tosoh GPC-8020 (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan), equipped in tandem with a series of a TSK gel GPC columns, TSKguardcolumn MP(XL) and two Multipore H<sub>XL</sub>-M columns (Tosoh). The chromatography was carried out at 40˚C using THF as eluent, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluate was monitored by a refractive index detector RI-8020 (Tosoh) and subsequently collected as 1-ml fractions (1-min interval) to measure radioactivity. The molecular mass of the reaction products were estimated by comparison with the retention times of commercially available polyisoprene standards (Mw: 999000, 110000, and 9600, Polymer Standards Service, Mainz, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Western blotting</title><p>To detect the protein expression of HRT1 and REF, western blot analyses were carried out using custom polyclonal antibodies (anti-HRT and anti-REF antibodies, Eurofins Genomics, Tokyo, Japan) with ECL-Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). These antibodies were from a rabbit injected with conjugated peptides with specific sequences for HRT1/HRT2 and REF, respectively. The peptides used for productions of both antibodies are as follows; HRT1/HRT2: NH<sub>2</sub>-C+FAKKHKLPEGGGHK-COOH, REF: NH<sub>2</sub>-MAEDEDNQQGQGEG+C-COOH and NH<sub>2</sub>-C+RAAPEAARSLAS-COOH. As a secondary antibody for both anti-HRT1/HRT2 and anti-REF antibodies, anti-Rabbit IgG-HRP polyclonal antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) was used. For His6-tagged HRBP (His-HRBP), anti-6×Histidine monoclonal antibody (mouse, clone No. 9C11, Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) was used to detect its C-terminal His-tag. The secondary antibodies for the His-HRBP detection was ECL mouse IgG, HRP-linked whole ab (GE Healthcare).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Co-immunoprecipitation</title><p>To detect the protein complexes of HRT1/HRT2, HRBP and REF on RPs, proteins on 50kRP were solubilized by 8 mM CHAPS as the WRP preparation for the wheat germ-cell-free system. The 50-µl portions of the solubilized proteins were then mixed with the custom polyclonal antibody, anti-HRT1/HRT antibody or anti-HRBP antibody, which was prepared from a rabbit injected with two conjugated peptides with specific sequences for HRBP, NH<sub>2</sub>-C+YDSKGVLKTNK-COOH and NH<sub>2</sub>-C+EAVEKDVLLDQKQM-COOH (Eurofins Genomics, Tokyo, Japan), and incubated on ice for 1 hr. Then 10-µl potion of nProtein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) was added to the solution and incubated on ice for 1 hr with gentle agitations in every 15 min. After the incubations, the solution mixture was centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 2 min followed by removal of the supernatant. Then a precipitated Sepharose gel was washed by 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 and centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 2 min. This wash step was repeated at least three times. After the wash, the Sepharose gel was mixed with a sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and heated at 98˚C for 5 min.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identification and reconstitution of the rubber biosynthetic machinery on rubber particles from <italic>Heveabrasiliensis</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kazunori Okada as Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ewa Swiezewska (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers find that the paper describes de novo synthesis of NR on washed rubber particles with in vitro proofs of the protein complex HRT1-HRBP-REF, which is necessary for reconstituting the activity of long length <italic>cis</italic>-polyprenyl isoprenoids. This breakthrough accomplished by a newly designed experimental system using washed rubber particles coupling with wheat germ cell-free protein would have a large impact on industry, and will be a milestone in the production of the NR in vitro. This is basically a nice work worth for publishing in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The experimental data presented are solid and convincing, but some parts of descriptions are not detailed enough and the conclusions over reach the data. The novelty of the manuscript is based on the valuable in vitro system designed to confirm the involvement of three proteins (HRT1, REF and HRBP) in biosynthesis of rubber with WRP, detergent-washed <italic>Hevea</italic>RPs. However, the description of WRP is not detailed enough to follow the results perfectly. This could be explained more clearly and precisely in the manuscript; what was the actual compositions of WRP other than RP, discriminating possible contamination of the components HRT1, HRBP and REF in the assay, including comment on other possible <italic>cis</italic>-preyltransferase such as HRT2. It would be very helpful for the discussion if the authors could indicate the levels of the proteins (and preferably Rase activity) retained on WRPs used for the enzyme assay.</p><p>Another substantial concern raised by one of the reviewers is that formation of the tertiary protein complex HRT1-HRBP-REF has only been demonstrated based on the results of the BiFC and enzymatic assays. If technically possible in 2 months allowed for the revision, in vivo results obtained by the pull-down assay or immunocytochemical analysis could be a convincing argument of nature of the tertiary protein complex. Alternatively, substantive comments on the probability of the tertiary protein complex would help to strengthen the manuscript. To reiterate, the data descriptions that clearly elucidate the nature of WRPs are insufficient.</p><p>There are many other suggestions to be revised for precise description of the conclusion, but most of them can be addressed by rewriting or rephrasing. Followings are listed points required for revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The result from the RTase assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> indicates that the addition of only HRT1 to WRPs results in the incorporation of 14C IPP into products. Does this mean that HRT1 by itself can exert RTase activity on WRPs, or that WRPs still contain unwashed HRBP and REF? I consider that information about WRPs is too limited in the manuscript, just describing, for example, &quot;prepared by incubating 50kRP with 8 mM CHAPS for 1 h at 4<sup>o</sup>C&quot; and &quot;80% of the RTase activity was retained&quot;. It will be very helpful for discussion if the authors can indicate the levels of the proteins (and preferably RTase activity) retained on WRPs used for enzyme assay, which would be different from those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Moreover, I am not sure if the authors can conclude that the HRT1-HRBP-REF ternary complex is enough for RTase, based on the results from assay using WRPs, which might contain other proteins. The fact that LsCPT3 and LsCPTL2 reconstituted on <italic>Hevea</italic>WRPs exhibit RTase activity seems insufficient to deny the involvement of the other proteins in the case that such proteins from <italic>Hevea</italic> can interact also with the lettuce enzymes.</p><p>2) In the Introduction section, the authors describe &quot;a precise role of NgBR in cPT activity is still unknown owing to a lack of in vitro studies on the function of NgBR family with purified proteins.&quot; This is true. In vitro assay with purified proteins was not performed in the previous studies, e.g., ref. 29 about SlCPT3 and SlCPTBP from tomato. But, does the same hold for the present work, which also does not use purified enzyme?</p><p>3) The explanation in paragraph six of the Discussion section does not make sense. Does HRT2, unlike HRT1, compete with REF on binding to HRBP? The interaction between HRT2 and HRBP looks weak according to the Y2H analysis.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> (left), why was ~40% activity detected in the absence of HRT1 mRNA even though HRT1 was clearly needed for RTase activity?</p><p>5) Some parts of description are difficult to follow, mainly because the purpose of the experiments are not clearly stated, results are not clearly explained or results are not described in the orderly way.</p><p>6) In many places, RP and detergent-washed <italic>Hevea</italic>RPs (WRP) are not clearly distinguished. For example in abstract, 'RTase activity enhancement observed for the complex assembled on RPs' in this case RPs must mean WRP. I see others in other places. It is better to be described distinctly. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> is a nice cartoon to follow.</p><p>7) Figure 1—figure supplement 1 would be better to be shown as a figure instead of supplement as an introduction for the people not familiar with this field.</p><p>8) Formation of the tertiary protein complex HRT1-HRBP-REF has been suggested based on the results of the BiFC and enzymatic assays, unfortunately the in vivo result is missing.</p><p>9) Classification of proteins applied in the manuscript (Figure 2—source data 1) is unclear. All identified protein subclasses should be shown in this table together with a complete list of proteins. Were any enzymes related to polyisoprenoid biosynthesis (e.g. HMGR, FPPS etc) identified by this method?</p><p>10) No data on the reconstitution of HRT2 in the RP-based in vitro translation system are presented in the manuscript. This fact has to be commented.</p><p>11) The statement concerning the stoichiometry of the HRT1-HRBP complex (1:1) is too speculative. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> presents only the mRNAs level but not the concentration of the respective proteins. Either western-blot analysis has to be presented or the comment has to be deleted/rephrased.</p><p>12) Authors should commend on the profile of the in vitro obtained products – should a unimodal distribution be expected? A bimodal distribution was observed earlier (Rojruthai et al., 2010).</p><p>13) What was the efficiency of the in vitro HRT assay? Only relative numbers are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.

It is true that the WRPs used in the cell-free expression system were different from that of used for proteomics study. Please see a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplemental 1</xref>) describing the difference of protein levels between RP and the RTase activity of WRP that was used for the cell-free expression system (subsection “Reconstitution of RTase on WRPs”). We agree to the reviewer’s comment concerning a possible contribution of other proteins which may interact with the <italic>Hevea</italic> ternary complex or lettuce enzymes. We reshape the main text to mention that a possible involvement of other protein factor(s) and a significance of cPT as a catalytic core for RTase.</p><p><italic>2) In the Introduction section, the authors describe &quot;a precise role of NgBR in cPT activity is still unknown owing to a lack of in vitro studies on the function of NgBR family with purified proteins.&quot; This is true.

But, does the same hold for the present work, which also does not use purified enzyme?</italic></p><p>Yes. In the present work, we prepared HRBP which was expressed on WRPs by the cell-free system, and used it as a partially purified enzyme sample. We added the comment describing that the present study does not use purified proteins of NgBR family in the Discussion section, as described in the answer for Comment 1.</p><p><italic>3) The explanation in paragraph six of the Discussion section does not make sense. Does HRT2, unlike HRT1, compete with REF on binding to HRBP? The interaction between HRT2 and HRBP looks weak according to the Y2H analysis.</italic></p><p>We deleted the description mentioning about interaction affinities between HRT2 and HRBP or HRBP and REF because we are not able to determine the absolute values of interaction affinities in Y2H. Although it is true that the interaction between HRT2 and HRBP looks weak in Y2H analysis, we have detected distinct interaction between HRT2 and HRBP in the plasma membrane in the BiFC assay, indicating translocation of HRBP from the ER to plasma membrane, while REF was sustained on the ER. We added the data in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> (left), why was ~40% activity detected in the absence of HRT1 mRNA even though HRT1 was clearly needed for RTase activity?</italic></p><p>WRP does not completely lose its RTase activity by the wash treatment with the CHAPS-containing buffer as mentioned in the answer for Comment 1, and the residual activity of WRPs varies depending on batch of 50kRPs, which reflects the background RTase activity of the vector control WRPs. In consequence, relative activity of the control WRPs varies from 20 to 40% of the maximum RTase activity for HRT1-introduced WRPs. It is hard to completely control the residual RTase activity, i.e. residual membrane-bound proteins on RPs, by tuning of washing conditions.</p><p><italic>5) Some parts of description are difficult to follow, mainly because the purpose of the experiments are not clearly stated, results are not clearly explained or results are not described in the orderly way.</italic></p><p>We corrected the manuscript to state the purpose of the experiments clearly, and to explain the results in the orderly way for better understanding by readers.</p><p><italic>6) In many places, RP and detergent-washed Hevea RPs (WRP) are not clearly distinguished. For example in abstract, 'RTase activity enhancement observed for the complex assembled on RPs' in this case RPs must mean WRP. I see others in other places. It is better to be described distinctly. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> is a nice cartoon to follow.</italic></p><p>We agree to the comment. We checked the overall manuscript carefully and corrected it to clearly describe RP and WRP distinctly.</p><p><italic>7) Figure 1—figure supplement 1 would be better to be shown as a figure instead of supplement as an introduction for the people not familiar with this field.</italic></p><p>We agree to the comment. We moved Figure 1—figure supplement 1 to the main part as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and renumbered all figures.</p><p><italic>8) Formation of the tertiary protein complex HRT1-HRBP-REF has been suggested based on the results of the BiFC and enzymatic assays, unfortunately the in vivo result is missing.</italic></p><p>We conducted co-immunoprecipitations from solubilized RP-bound proteins using anti-HRBP and anti-HRT1/HRT2 antibodies. The results suggested the formations of the ternary protein complexes on RPs. We added the results to the manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and descriptions about them in subsection “Formation of the HRT1-HRBP-REF ternary complex on the ER” in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>9) Classification of proteins applied in the manuscript (Figure 2—source data 1) is unclear. All identified protein subclasses should be shown in this table together with a complete list of proteins. Were any enzymes related to polyisoprenoid biosynthesis (e.g. HMGR, FPPS etc) identified by this method?</italic></p><p>We identified a fragment which was annotated as HRT1 or HRT2 as described in the manuscript. There were no enzymes related to polyisopurenoid biosynthesis other than HRT1/HRT2. We added descriptions in the revised manuscript (Results section) and a complete list of proteins to Figure 1—source data 2.</p><p><italic>10) No data on the reconstitution of HRT2 in the RP-based in vitro translation system are presented in the manuscript. This fact has to be commented.</italic></p><p>In the present study, we tested a reconstitution of HRT2 in the WRP-based in vitro translation system. However, the expression level was very low compared to that of HRT1 for unknown reason, and the resulting WRP with recombinantly expressed HRT2 did not show distinct RTase activity. We added a description of the reconstitution of HRT2 in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>11) The statement concerning the stoichiometry of the HRT1-HRBP complex (1:1) is too speculative. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> presents only the mRNAs level but not the concentration of the respective proteins. Either western-blot analysis has to be presented or the comment has to be deleted/rephrased.</italic></p><p>According to the comment, we deleted the descriptions mentioning the stoichiometry.</p><p><italic>12) Authors should commend on the profile of the in vitro obtained products – should a unimodal distribution be expected? A bimodal distribution was observed earlier (Rojruthai et al, 2010).</italic></p><p>A bimodal distribution of the rubber products is observed when large rubber particles are mainly used, while small rubber particles (SRPs), correspond to 50kRP in the present study, usually shows a unimodal distribution of the product. This time, we expected a unimodal distribution of the product from in vitro reaction employing SRPs as a platform. We added the comment on the in vitro obtained products in the Results section.</p><p><italic>13) What was the efficiency of the in vitro HRT assay? Only relative numbers are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. It would be interesting to know any absolute data on rubber formation, e.g. the efficiency of IPP incorporation or the amount of rubber formed normalized per amount of RP or protein content.</italic></p><p>Using 1 µg of WRPs as platform, when HRT1-HRBP-REF complex was introduced, approximately 0.8 nmol of IPP monomers (which corresponds to approx. 54.4 ng of rubber) were incorporated in the 4 hr reaction of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>. Thus, the efficiency of amount of rubber formed is 13.6 ng of de novo rubber/1 µg of WRPs/1hr enzymatic reaction. We added a description of the rubber amount used in the legends for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>.</p><p><italic>14) Authors have to reshape their concept on the role of additional cis-prenyltransferases, besides HRT1, in NR formation.

However, as we wrote in above sections (essential revisions 3 and 10), we still don’t know the role and significance of HRT2 in NR biosynthesis because of its unexpected subcellular localizations in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cells and its low expression in the cell-free expression system. We reshaped the sentence and add descriptions in the Discussion section so that we do not neglect possible roles of polyisoprenoid precursors and cPTs in rubber biosynthesis. We appreciate the helpful opinions of this reviewer and are now very curious about the lipid composition of WRP.</p><p><italic>15) Results of the proteomic analysis should be commented in the context of the paper published by Ponciano G et al., Phytochemistry 2012.</italic></p><p>We added a description concerning the proteomic analysis in previous studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
