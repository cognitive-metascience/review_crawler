It is part of the two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. Dysregulation of mTOR occurs in diabetes, cancer and neurological disease. We report the architecture of human mTORC2 at intermediate resolution, revealing a conserved binding site for accessory proteins on mTOR and explaining the structural basis for the rapamycin insensitivity of the complex.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33101.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To grow and multiply, a living cell must take a variety of factors into account, such as its own energy levels and the availability of nutrients. A protein called mTOR sits at the core of a signaling pathway that integrates these and other sources information. Problems with the mTOR pathway contribute to several diseases including diabetes and cancer.</p><p>The mTOR protein occurs in two distinct protein complexes, called mTORC1 and mTORC2. These complexes contain a mix of other proteins – known as accessory proteins. They also sense different cues and act upon distinct targets in the cell. Recent research reported the structure of mTORC1, which provided clues about how this complex works. Yet, much less was known about the mTORC2 complex.</p><p>Stuttfeld, Aylett et al. have now used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the three-dimensional architecture of the human version of mTORC2. Comparing the new mTORC2 structure to the existing one for mTORC1 showed that they have many features in common but important differences too. The overall shape of both complexes is similar and each complex contains two copies of mTOR arranged in a similar way. Also, the main accessory proteins in each complex interact with almost the exact same parts of mTOR, but the accessory proteins in mTORC2 are organized differently from those of mTORC1. The different accessory proteins also have distinct shapes. These differences could help to explain why the complexes respond to different cues and recognize different targets.</p><p>These new findings provide an entry point for further studies on how mTORC2 works in cells. The next step is to get a higher resolution image of the structure of this complex to see the finer details of all the components. This may in the future help scientists to develop drugs that inhibit mTORC2 to treat cancer and other diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>cell growth</kwd><kwd>regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>51NF40_141735_NCCR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ban</surname><given-names>Nenad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_159492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Michael N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>609883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Michael N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>206212/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aylett</surname><given-names>Christopher HS</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>138262</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ban</surname><given-names>Nenad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>159696</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maier</surname><given-names>Timm</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030B_163478</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ban</surname><given-names>Nenad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) reveals the architecture of the complex and explains the structural basis of rapamycin insensitivity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is the master regulator of cellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). Originally identified in yeast as TOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heitman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kunz et al., 1993</xref>), the mammalian orthologue mTOR senses a range of cellular cues, including nutrient and energy availability, and growth factor signals, to control metabolism and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). Due to its role as a central controller of cell growth, aberrant mTOR signaling is observed in major diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dazert and Hall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). mTOR is a member of the <italic>phosphatidylinositol-kinase-related kinase</italic> (PIKK) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Keith and Schreiber, 1995</xref>) and exerts its function as the enzymatic component of two distinct protein complexes, mTOR complex (mTORC) one and mTORC2. Together with the small protein mLST8, mTOR forms the core of both complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Loewith et al., 2002</xref>). The protein Raptor is unique to mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2002</xref>), whereas the proteins Rictor and SIN1 are defining subunits of mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Frias et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jacinto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jacinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sarbassov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, Protor-1/2 and Deptor can bind to mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pearce et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>). The polyketide rapamycin, in complex with the endogenous protein FKBP12, inhibits mTORC1 activity by binding the FKBP-rapamycin (FRB) domain of mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aylett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the FKBP-rapamycin complex is unable to bind mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jacinto et al., 2004</xref>), although prolonged rapamycin treatment disrupts mTORC2 signaling by preventing mTOR incorporation into mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lamming et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sarbassov et al., 2006</xref>). mTORC2 is activated by growth factors, in particular through the insulin/PI3K signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). The major substrates of mTORC2 are the AGC-kinase family members Akt, SGK-1 and PKC-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">García-Martínez and Alessi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ikenoue et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sarbassov et al., 2005</xref>). Biochemical analysis has revealed that mTORCs form dimeric assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wullschleger et al., 2005</xref>). The architecture of mTORC1 was resolved only recently through the use of cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aylett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). However, although biochemical analysis and a 26 Å EM reconstruction of yeast TORC2 have suggested that TOR and Lst8 form the same dimeric core as observed in mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gaubitz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wullschleger et al., 2005</xref>), higher resolution information on the mTORC2 assembly remains unavailable. Structural data on mTORC2 accessory proteins are restricted to the fission yeast Sin1 CRIM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tatebe et al., 2017</xref>) and the SIN1 PH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan and Matsuura, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We co-expressed the core components of human mTORC2; mTOR, mLST8, Rictor, SIN1 and Protor-1, in <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> cells using the MultiBac system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fitzgerald et al., 2006</xref>). Expression was attained for all components, and mTORC2 was captured by affinity to a FLAG tag inserted in the amino-terminal HEAT repeats of mTOR. Reconstituted complexes were purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Yields remained low (~0.1 nmol complex per 10 L culture), as mTORC2 proved labile over the course of purification, resulting in two major species of mTOR complexes eluting from SEC; mTOR-mLST8 alone and reconstituted mTORC2 complex comprising mTOR, mLST8, Rictor, SIN1 and substoichiometric amounts of Protor-1, as confirmed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Human mTORC2 demonstrated kinase activity towards the substrate Akt-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). mTORC2 also proved extremely labile during sample preparation for both negative staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Stabilisation of human mTORC2, by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde using a modified gradient fixation protocol, allowed us to visualise intact, rhombic complexes. We collected cryo-EM data from stabilised samples, yielding 94 953 mTOR-dimer-containing particles for single particle analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Due to the labile nature of the complex, we observed intact complexes only in thicker ice, which limited the achievable contrast. Single particle reconstruction of mTORC2 proceeded from both an <italic>ab initio</italic> model generated from negatively stained samples and from the prior structure of the <italic>Kluyveromyces marxianus</italic> TOR-Lst8 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baretić et al., 2016</xref>), yielding essentially identical results. A reconstruction of non-cross-linked mTORC2 from negatively stained grids agrees well with the cryo-EM reconstructions of cross-linked mTORC2 indicating that the cross-linking procedure preserves the native structure of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). mTORC2 proved heterogeneous; refinement initiated from the <italic>K.m.</italic> TOR-Lst8 reference yielded classes encompassing free mTOR-mLST8 (30%), mTOR-mLST8 occupied on a single flank by accessory protein (52%) and a complete complex bearing accessory factors on both flanks of the mTOR dimer (18%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Since only a fraction of particles were of the complete complex we conclude that our mTORC2 sample dissociated prior to fixation or due to non-exhaustive cross-linking. Subsequent refinement of the complete complex with the application of C<sub>2</sub> symmetry resolved the entire complex to 7.4 Å, while a focused refinement on the accessory factor density yielded 6.2 Å resolution, based upon a gold standard FSC of 0.143 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The resolution is likely limited by the achieved contrast in the measured micrographs and the inherent flexibility of the Rictor/SIN1 domains.</p><p>The complete human mTORC2 dimer displays a general organization similar to that we previously reported for mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aylett et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The previous 26 Å structure of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> TORC2 was refined without symmetry because of substantial differences in the densities resolved on either side of the central cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gaubitz et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), however, our complete mTORC2 complex is effectively identical (real-space two-fold rotated correlation &gt;0.9) on either side of the symmetry axis to at least 8.9 Å (the limit of resolution in C<sub>1</sub>) refined without symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 therefore function as dimeric, C<sub>2</sub> symmetric, complexes. The dimeric arrangement of mTOR in mTORC2 is most similar to that observed for the <italic>K.m.</italic> TOR-Lst8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baretić et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The FAT domains of the (m)TOR dimer in mTORC2 and TOR-Lst8 come within 6 Å of each other, contrary to the conformation of the mTOR dimer in mTORC1 that is substantially outward-rotated. The resemblance between the free mTOR dimer and the mTOR dimer found within the mTORC2 complex may account for the increased lability of mTORC2 compared to mTORC1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33101.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Both human mTOR complexes resolved at intermediate resolution.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) The architecture of human mTORC2.

SIN1 consists of two domains of known structure, a CRIM domain and a PH domain, neither of which form α-solenoids. While it remains impossible to definitively trace a polypeptide chain at this resolution, we were able to identify five regions of stacked α-solenoidal repeats, of which three can be resolved to the level of individual helices and two are less well ordered, that make up the majority of the density outside of the mTOR-mLST8 dimer and account for most of the elements expected to correspond to Rictor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The assignment of the major density features to Rictor is confirmed by a negatively stained EM reconstruction of mTORC2 lacking Protor-1, which recapitulates density for all but one partially disordered extremus of the accessory protein region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The most striking feature, which we dub the ‘tower’, is a well-resolved, 9/10-α-hairpin stack rising from the ‘bridge’ HEAT repeat of mTOR. This centrepiece is joined at one-third its length from the bridge by another well-resolved α-solenoid, encompassing 4/5-hairpins, which we refer to as the ‘buttress’. The buttress links the tower to a region we term the ‘body’, comprising three further repeats (9–11 hairpins in total) that stack against one another, with its periphery being poorly ordered. The body is only peripherally associated with the mTOR dimer. Finally, at the top of the tower, a ‘cap’ region of linked density juts out toward the mTOR active site. No large regions of non-α-solenoidal density were resolved, preventing us from assigning a location to SIN1, although a small region of non-helical density at the extremity of the cap represents the most likely candidate. This location of SIN1 would corroborate previous studies implying an interaction between SIN1 and mLST8 and a role of the SIN1 CRIM domain in recruiting substrates towards the active site of mTOR within mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tatebe et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33101.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Human mTORC2 accessory factor density and binding sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Accessory factor density bound to the mTOR dimer.

This is the same site occupied by the characteristic mTORC1 subunit Raptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Baretic and colleagues have established that the TOR dimer interface runs along this plane, and have shown that a partner protein is not required for TOR dimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baretić et al., 2016</xref>). We confirm this observation for mTOR-mLST8, demonstrating that the Rictor-mTOR and Raptor-mTOR interactions can be formed only with intact mTOR dimer and are not required to stabilise the mTOR dimer. Given that the inter-subunit interfaces are completely different in the two mTOR complexes (in Raptor the cleft between the horn and bridge is occupied by the loops at the tips of three helical hairpins, whereas in mTORC2 a single helix covers the length of the cleft), there must be an as yet unknown selective advantage to a dimeric architecture.</p><p>Another less well-resolved contact is the junction of the body and the free end of the bridge amino-terminal HEAT repeats within the mTOR dimer, which does not recapitulate any contact found in mTORC1. Regions of Raptor make contact with the HEAT repeat horn in the mTORC1 structure, however, the horn does not appear to make an analogous contact with any mTORC2 accessory protein. The differences between mTORC1 and mTORC2 in the mTOR-exposed surfaces of the horn region are presumably linked to their distinct modes of regulation by post-translational modifications or binding of associated protein factors.</p><p>The final major contact identified between Rictor and the mTOR dimer is near the FRB domain of mTOR. The tower α-solenoid repeat bridges the gap between the binding site at the juncture of the mTOR dimer and the FRB domain of mTOR itself, while the cap, which is connected to the tower, straddles the surface of the FRB, deepening the active site cleft of the mTOR kinase domain. Raptor similarly deepens the active site in mTORC1, but from a position directly opposite mLST8, as opposed to Rictor, which approaches from the other side of the active site. This position of the cap masks the FKBP-rapamycin binding site of mTOR, thereby explaining the rapamycin insensitivity of mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This finding is consistent with what was seen previously with yeast TORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gaubitz et al., 2015</xref>). It is tempting to conclude that this region is responsible for substrate recruitment, given its proximity to the active site, however, further study is required to confirm this.</p><p>The architecture of human mTORC2 reveals that the two mTOR complexes share many features, including the preservation of effective C<sub>2</sub> symmetry, the common binding site for the principal accessory proteins Raptor and Rictor, the deepening of the active site cleft and the significant distance between the presumptive substrate-selection region and the active site of mTOR. While this manuscript was under revision, another publication described the architecture of <italic>yeast</italic> TORC2 at a resolution of 7.9 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karuppasamy et al., 2017</xref>). The main conclusions drawn in that publication are consistent with our findings. Many important biological questions remain, in particular the reason for the requirement for C<sub>2</sub> symmetry, and the exact identity and function of the mTORC2 domains making up the cap region. A full interpretation of human mTORC2 must await future higher-resolution studies of a more stable form of the complex.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Laboratory materials</title><p>Unless otherwise stipulated, Sf21 insect cell lines and media were provided by Expression Systems (Davies, USA) and Lonza (Basel, Switzerland), respectively.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Architecture of the Human mTORC2 Core Complex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Kun-Liang Guan (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports the structure of the human mTORC2 complex at intermediate resolution. The structural information reveals similarities of mTOR between mTORC1 and mTORC2 in their interactions with other subunits. Importantly, the study provides molecular basis explaining why mTORC2 is resistant to inhibition by the FKBP12-rapamycin.

We have added a few comments in the first paragraph of the “Results and Discussion” section, stating: “Due to the labile nature of the complex we observed intact complexes only in thicker ice, which limited the achievable contrast.”, “The resolution is likely limited by the achieved contrast in the measured micrographs and the inherent flexibility of the Rictor/SIN1 domains.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can the authors provide some evidence that non cross-linked samples assume similar architecture to the presented structure?

The class averages of the non-cross-linked mTORC2 match the reprojections of the cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Furthermore we obtained a 3D reconstruction of the negatively stained non-cross-linked mTORC2 sample which is in agreement with the cryo-EM reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We added a sentence to the Results section:“A reconstruction of non-cross-linked mTORC2 from negatively stained grids agrees well with the cryo-EM reconstructions of cross-linked mTORC2 indicating that the cross-linking procedure preserves the native structure of the complex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is unclear how the focused refinement improved the map features – do the authors observe an improvement in features or does the improvement in value merely reflect the increase in the number of projections used?</p></disp-quote><p>Conformational flexibility of the accessory proteins relative to the core results in lower local resolution. Indeed, the overall refinement aligned mostly the core mTOR- mLST8 and “blurred” the accessory proteins on the periphery. By focusing the refinement around the accessory proteins, ignoring the core, and combining the C1- and C2-mTORC2, we improved the local resolution and were able to improve the signal-to-noise in this area, allowing us to more readily separate the helices assigned to Rictor. We added a sentence to the Materials and methods section stating this: “Additionally, the mTOR-mLST8 core dominated the overall particle alignment, resulting in lower local resolution for the accessory proteins due to their flexibility.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The parameters reported for negative stain data collection are very similar to those used for cryo-EM. Might this be an error?</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct as stated; a similar data collection script was used in each case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors state that &quot;…our mTORC2 samples underwent partial fragmentation to yield successively less-occupied products during freezing.&quot; Do the authors mean that the complex dissociated during blotting prior to vitrification? How is this the case since the sample was cross-linked?</p></disp-quote><p>As we have observed dissociation over all sample preparation steps, we expect the full complex to be dissociating prior and during GraFix stabilization where the sample is subjected to gradually increasing amounts of the glutaraldehyde. Therefore we would expect that the procedure resulted in cross-linking of both the dissociated complex as well as non-dissociated complex. In addition, because crosslinking is not necessarily exhaustive, we suspect additional dissociation during grid preparation. We have rewritten this section to clarify the statement: “Since only a fraction of particles were of the complete complex we conclude that our mTORC2 sample dissociated prior to fixation or due to non-exhaustive crosslinking.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Recent findings from the cryo-EM structure of S. cerevisiae TORC2 (Karuppasamy et al., 2017) are also in line with some of the findings here and should therefore be mentioned in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the reference in the Discussion in the last paragraph:“While this manuscript was under revision, another publication described the architecture of <italic>yeast</italic> TORC2 at a resolution of 7.9 Å (Karuppasamy et al., 2017). The main conclusions drawn in this publication are consistent with our findings.” A further extended comparison is beyond the scope and format of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) A better schematic representation that includes the terminologies they used such as tower, bridge, horn, cap etc. should be included to better orient the reader.

We also note that several publications place SIN1 in this region, which would as well be compatible with our data. Therefore we prefer not to make a definitive statement.</p></body></sub-article></article>
