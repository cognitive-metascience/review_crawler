In cardiac pacemaker cells, hetero-tetramer GIRK1/4 channels and homo-tetramer GIRK4 channels play a central role in parasympathetic slowing of heart rate. It is known that the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site of the GIRK1 subunit is defective, but the functional difference between GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers and GIRK4 homo-tetramers remains unclear. Here, using purified proteins and the lipid bilayer system, we characterize Gβγ and Na<sup>+</sup> regulation of GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers and GIRK4 homo-tetramers. We find in GIRK4 homo-tetramers that Na<sup>+</sup> binding increases Gβγ affinity and thereby increases the GIRK4 responsiveness to G protein stimulation. GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers are not activated by Na<sup>+</sup>, but rather are in a permanent state of high responsiveness to Gβγ, suggesting that the GIRK1 subunit functions like a GIRK4 subunit with Na<sup>+</sup> permanently bound.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15750.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15750.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15750.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Signals from outside of a cell can alter the activity inside the cell. This process often involves members of a large family of proteins called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are found on the surface of many cells in the body. When these receptors are activated they release a G protein on the inside of the cell that then splits into two parts. One of these parts – called the Gβγ subunit – can directly bind to, and open, a protein called a GIRK channel that is found in the cell’s membrane. Once opened, these channels allow potassium ions to flow into the cell.</p><p>GIRK channels are involved in a number of processes in the body. For example, when we are at rest, our brain sends nerve impulses to the heart and, via signals through GPCRs and Gβγ subunits, causes the GIRK channels to open. The flow of potassium into the heart muscle cells then helps to slow the heart rate.Heart cells produce two subtypes of GIRK channels, called GIRK4 and GIRK1/4. However, it was not known whether these two channels play similar or distinct roles.</p><p>Now, Touhara et al. report that GIRK4 and GIRK1/4 channels are distinct. In particular, the way that GIRK4 channels respond to the stimulation from the nervous system can be tuned by the concentration of sodium ions inside the heart cell. When there are more sodium ions in the cell, the Gβγ subunits bind more strongly to the GIRK4 channel; this means that the channel is more sensitive to the nerve impulses from the brain. In a related study, Wang et al. – who include all of the same researchers – also discovered that sodium ions affect GIRK2 channels from neurons in a similar way. By contrast, Touhara et al. found that the GIRK1/4 channel is unaffected by the sodium level inside the cell and is instead always sensitive to stimulation by nerve impulses that signal being at rest.</p><p>Touhara et al. then looked at mouse heart cells that had been grown in the laboratory and found that they respond as if all of their GIRK channels were the GIRK1/4 type. That is to say, that a heart cell’s activity didn’t change much when extra sodium ions were present. This is likely because, unlike in neurons, the concentration of sodium ions inside a heart cell probably does not change much under normal conditions.</p><p>These findings shed new light on G protein signaling, but there is still more that is not yet completely understood. For example, different GPCRs in cells will all release Gβγ subunits when stimulated but somehow produce specific responses. Touhara et al. are now interested in figuring out how this kind of specificity is achieved in heart cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15750.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15750.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>G protein gated potassium channel</kwd><kwd>G protein</kwd><kwd>hetero-tetrameric ion channel</kwd><kwd>planar lipid bilayer</kwd><kwd>cardiac physiology</kwd><kwd>sodium activation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIHGM43949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The GIRK1 subunit contains a defective Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site but behaves as if it is permanently bound to a sodium ion, and therefore increases the affinity of Gβγ to GIRK1/4 hetero-tetrameric channels in lipid membranes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the cardiovascular system, cardiac GIRK channels play a central role in parasympathetic slowing of the heart. Specifically, when the body is at rest, parasympathetic neurons convey signals from the central nervous system to cardiac pacemaker cells <italic>via</italic> cholinergic neurotransmission, activating the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 2 (M2R). Activated M2Rs release inhibitory G protein alpha subunits and Gβγ. Gβγ is a hetero-dimeric protein composed of tightly bound beta and gamma subunits. This free Gβγ, along with its lipid anchor, diffuses on the intracellular membrane surface and binds directly to GIRK to activate it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Logothetis et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sakmann et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kurachi et al., 1986</xref>). Activation of GIRK shifts the resting membrane potential of pacemaker cells toward the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup>, lengthening the interval between cardiac action potentials and thereby slowing the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Loewi and Navratil, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Rayner and Weatherall M, 1959</xref>). The critical role of parasympathetic regulation of cardiac GIRK channels is evident from the severe diseases that result from mutations in the <italic>GIRK</italic> gene such as Atrial Fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kovoor et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Voigt et al., 2010</xref>), and Long QT syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Mammals express four GIRK channel subunits (GIRK1-4), forming various homo-tetramers and hetero-tetramers. Cardiac GIRK channels are composed of GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Krapavinsky et al., 1995</xref>). Since the GIRK1 subunit does not form functional homo-tetramers, GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits form functional GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers and GIRK4 homo-tetramers in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Krapavinsky et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Corey and Clapham, 1998</xref>). <italic>GIRK1</italic> and <italic>GIRK4</italic> knockout mice show similar phenotypes in terms of heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bettahi et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting that both subunits perform non-redundant tasks. However, little is known about whether or how GIRK1 influences cardiac GIRK channel behavior. Specifically, what are the functional differences between GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers and GIRK4 homo-tetramers?</p><p>Although GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits share ~44% sequence identity, one notable difference occurs in the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site. The GIRK1 subunit has an aspartate to asparagine replacement in this Na<sup>+</sup> binding site, presumably rendering it incapable of binding intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999</xref>). However, it is still unclear what influence this defective Na<sup>+</sup> binding site has on the function of GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers. Cellular electrophysiological experiments have not clarified this issue because it is difficult to control the concentration of GIRK ligands inside cells and it is also not possible to express GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers without co-expression of GIRK4 homo-tetramers. To overcome these difficulties we have purified human GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers and GIRK4 homo-tetramers and studied their ligand regulation by Na<sup>+</sup> and Gβγ in the planar lipid bilayer system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Purified GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers and GIRK4 homo-tetramers are functional in planar lipid bilayer membranes</title><p>Although the GIRK1 subunit does not form functional homo-tetrameric channels, it does form structural homo-tetramers similar to GIRK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, in order to isolate GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers, GIRK1 and GIRK4 homo-tetramers had to be removed during purification. To remove both homo-tetramers two different tags, a deca-histidine tag and a 1D4 peptide tag, were fused to the GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits, respectively. Two sequential affinity chromatography steps isolated only GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramer channels containing both tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

In this method, bilayer membranes containing specific mole fractions of Ni-NTA-lipids were formed. GIRK channel proteoliposomes, which also contained the same mole fraction of Ni-NTA-lipids as the bilayer membrane, were then fused to the membrane. C8-PIP<sub>2</sub> and 2 µM soluble Gβγ (sGβγ-His<sub>10</sub>), which contained a deca-histidine-tag instead of its physiological lipid anchor, were applied to the intracellular side of the membrane. At 2 µM concentration sGβγ-His<sub>10</sub> does not activate GIRK channels directly from solution, however, it saturates (i.e. occupies nearly 100% of) all available Ni-NTA-lipids in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). These membrane-bound sGβγ-His<sub>10</sub> molecules are able to activate GIRK channels, which are present in the membrane at a much lower density than Ni-NTA-lipid molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This method permits the study of GIRK channel activation as a function of the membrane sGβγ-His<sub>10</sub> density (Gβγ concentration), which is controlled through the predetermined mole fraction of Ni-NTA-lipid molecules in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In subsequent graphs, Gβγ concentration is quantified as Ni-NTA-lipid mole fraction, but for accounting purposes the stoichiometry of sGβγ-His<sub>10</sub> to Ni-NTA-lipid is 1:3 (i.e. a single sGβγ-His<sub>10</sub> molecule binds to 3 Ni-NTA-lipid molecules), meaning the actual sGβγ-His<sub>10</sub> density on the membrane is one third the density of Ni-NTA-lipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In order to compare currents from different membranes that generally contain different numbers of GIRK channels, at the end of each experiment proteolipsomes containing lipid-anchored Gβγ were fused to the membrane to maximally activate the GIRK channels in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

GIRK4 current increases as a sigmoid-shaped function, and Na<sup>+</sup> concentration has a prominent effect on Gβγ activation. Specifically, Na<sup>+</sup> increases GIRK4 current at all Gβγ concentrations, but notably, the increase is relatively largest at low Gβγ concentrations where, for example, at 0.001 Ni-NTA mole fraction 32 mM Na<sup>+</sup> increases normalized current almost 20-fold, from 0.018 to 0.34. These data suggest that GIRK4 is similar to the neuronal GIRK channel, GIRK2, in its response to Gβγ and Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore applied the same equilibrium gating model used to analyze GIRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The model has 25 states of ligand occupancy, corresponding to 0 to 4 of each ligand, Gβγ and Na<sup>+</sup>, as illustrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

The errors on values for equilibrium dissociation constants and cooperativity factors are larger than those determined for GIRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) because the data set on GIRK4 is smaller. However, the overall conclusion is that GIRK4 is very similar to GIRK2. Through model analysis the data support three conclusions: that 4 Gβγ molecules are required to open the channel (the model yields higher residuals with less than 4), that Gβγ binds cooperatively to GIRK4, and that Na<sup>+</sup> exerts its major effect by increasing the Gβγ affinity for the channel.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15750.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>GIRK channel activity as a function of Na<sup>+</sup> and Gβγ concentrations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>), (<bold>B</bold>), and (<bold>C</bold>) Plots of activity of GIRK4 homo-tetramers (<bold>A</bold>), GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers (<bold>B</bold>), and GIRK1(N217D)/4 hetero-tetramers (<bold>C</bold>) versus Ni-NTA-lipid mole fraction in the membrane at different Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations.

At all Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations – even in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> – the response of the GIRK1/4 channel to Gβγ is similar to the GIRK4 channel at higher Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations. Thus, the GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramer channel, compared to the GIRK4 homo-tetramer channel, behaves to a first approximation as if it remains permanently stuck in a Na<sup>+</sup>-activated state. That this influence of the GIRK1 subunit is related to its Na<sup>+</sup> binding site is supported by the mutation N217D, which converts the GIRK1 Na<sup>+</sup> binding locus to be more like that of GIRK4 by restoring its Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity to the hetero-tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999</xref>). To test the idea that Asn217 in GIRK1 mimics a Na<sup>+</sup>-bound Asp we fit the GIRK1/4 data to the same model used for the GIRK4 channel, but imposed the condition that two of the four sites are “permanently occupied” by Na<sup>+</sup>, with the underlying idea that the two permanently occupied sites represent the GIRK1 subunits. This condition means GIRK1/4 is described by 15 states of ligand occupancy corresponding to 0 to 4 Gβγ and 0 to 2 Na<sup>+</sup>. The model encodes this by collapsing the 0, 1 and 2 Na<sup>+</sup>-occupied states of the GIRK4 model into a single state with affinity of Gβγ equal to <italic>K<sub>db</sub></italic>﻿<italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings show acetylcholine-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents that are inhibited by tertiapin-Q (TPNQ), a specific GIRK channel blocker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Such recordings were performed with 22 different cells with intracellular solutions containing either 0 mM or 30 mM Na<sup>+</sup>.

We thus conclude that intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> has essentially no influence on GPCR-stimulated GIRK current in these mESC-derived cardiac cells. This observation is consistent with the data recorded in bilayers if the cardiac cells express predominantly GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramer channels, which are only weakly Na<sup>+</sup> sensitive, and not GIRK4 homo-tetramer channels, which are strongly Na<sup>+</sup> sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15750.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> does not significantly activate cardiac GIRK channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings on mESC-derived pacemaker cells.

Homo-tetramers of GIRK4 and hetero-tetramers of GIRK1 and GIRK4, GIRK1/4, form functional K<sup>+</sup> channels, while homo-tetramers of GIRK1 do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Krapavinsky et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hedin et al., 1996</xref>). It is unclear to what extent GIRK4 homo-tetramers versus GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers dominate in cardiac cells. It is also unclear to what extent the functional properties of these channels differ because it has not been possible to study GIRK1/4 channels in isolation, the reason being heterologous expression of both subunits naturally gives rise to a mixed population of homo- and hetero-tetramers. To overcome this problem we overexpressed and purified GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers using sequential affinity columns and also expressed and purified GIRK4 homo-tetramers for comparative analysis. The composition of GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers is reported to consist mainly of two GIRK1 and two GIRK4 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Silverman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Corey et al., 1998</xref>). In this study purified GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers are also most likely composed of two GIRK1 subunits and two GIRK4 subunits, as estimated from SDS-PAGE of fractions from a gel filtration column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, we have no information on the arrangement of subunits within the tetramer either in cells or in our reconstitution experiments.</p><p>We observe that GIRK4 homo-tetramers and GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers exhibit distinctly different properties with respect to their activation by Gβγ and Na<sup>+</sup>. It had been shown that the GIRK1 subunit has a defective Na<sup>+</sup> site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999</xref>), but the present study establishes the following new conclusions. First, that Na<sup>+</sup> binding to the GIRK4 subunit increases affinity for Gβγ This effect is encoded in the model by the Gβγ-Na<sup>+</sup> cross interaction term <italic>η</italic>. Second, the GIRK1 subunit behaves similarly to the GIRK4 subunit with Na<sup>+</sup> permanently bound. Thus, while the GIRK1 subunit is unable to bind Na<sup>+</sup>, it causes the channel to have high affinity for Gβγ even in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>. This effect is encoded in the model by enforcing permanent Na<sup>+</sup> occupancy on the GIRK1 subunits. Taken together, these properties account for the functional differences we observe between GIRK4 and GIRK1/4 channels. GIRK4 channels are less sensitive to G protein stimulation at low Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations (Gβγ binds with lower affinity) and more sensitive at high Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations (Gβγ binds with higher affinity). GIRK1/4 channels on the other hand are very sensitive to Gβγ stimulation at both low and high Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations (Gβγ binds with high affinity independent of Na<sup>+</sup> concentration).</p><p>We also find that GPCR-stimulated GIRK currents in mESC-derived cardiac pacemaker cells are nearly independent of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration. Based on a comparison of these cellular data to the properties of isolated GIRK4 and GIRK1/4 channels in planar lipid bilayers, we conclude that GIRK channels in mESC-derived cardiac channels most likely are predominantly GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers. In an accompanying paper we report that GIRK channels in mouse dopamine neurons are very sensitive to intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>: in experiments analogous to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, eight fold amplification of GPCR-stimulated GIRK currents was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). This degree of Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity is consistent with neurons expressing GIRK2 homo-tetramers. GIRK2, like GIRK4, encodes an intact Na<sup>+</sup> activation site.</p><p>Our findings lead us to conclude that the GIRK1 subunit in a GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramer renders the channel relatively insensitive to Na<sup>+</sup> but permanently in a state of high responsiveness to GPCR stimulation. We can only speculate as to why two kinds of GIRK channels exist, ones whose G protein sensitivity is regulated by intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (i.e. homo-tetramer GIRK4 or GIRK2 channels) and ones whose G protein sensitivity is not much regulated by Na<sup>+</sup> but is always near maximum (i.e. hetero-tetramer GIRK1/4 channels). In neurons, intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration increases during excitation because Na<sup>+</sup> enters the cell through Na<sup>+</sup> channels during action potentials and through glutamate receptor ion channels in response to excitatory neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lasser-Ross and Ross, 1992</xref>). GIRK2 channels silence neurons in response to inhibitory neurotransmitters, which act through inhibitory GPCRs. The GIRK2 regulation by Na<sup>+</sup> provides a way to modulate the inhibitory response according to the activity level. Such modulation would seem beneficial to a neuron that exhibits a wide range of electrical activity from near silent to high frequency spiking. Cardiac cells on the other hand appear to exhibit less activity-dependent variation in levels of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Harrison et al., 1992</xref>). Thus, it seems reasonable that GIRK1/4 channels do not exhibit high Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity, but instead exhibit a permanent state of cholinergic responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ito et al., 1994</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and ﻿methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification</title><p>Human full-length GIRK1 and GIRK4 were cloned into pEG BacMam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Goehring et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The following individuals involved in the review process of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kenton Swartz (Reviewing editor); Chris Miller, David Clapham and Don Hilgemann (peer reviewers).</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There are 4 inwardly rectifying K channel subunits that form tetrameric channels that are activated by G protein β/γ (Gβγ) subunits, GIRK1-4. Their combination into tetramers is not random – a long term question in the field is the different regulatory or functional consequences of heteromerization. Touhara et al. show that intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> regulates homotetrameric GIRK4 channels sensitivity to Gβγ. In contrast, GIRK1 lacks an optimal Na binding site and GIRK1/4 channel Gβγ sensitivity is near its maximum. In other words, GIRK1 subunits may be evolved to reduce Na sensitivity in some tissues, such as heart (GIRK1 + GIRK4), while Na sensitive subunits (GIRK4 homomers) are adapted to regulate neuronal firing as sodium accumulates during bursts of action potentials. The authors take an innovative and solid approach to answering this question and do so beautifully in a reconstituted system where stoichiometry and composition of subunits can be controlled. They do this through use of distinct tags for GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits that enable their purification, and then controlling the Gβγ incorporation into the membrane by tagging Gβγ with His<sub>10</sub> and Ni-NTA tagged lipids. This enables them to quantify the relation between NTA mole fraction of membrane bound Gβγ and GIRK4 vs GIRK1/4 current. They then summarize this in a multi- state model that incorporates Gβγ and Na. The main finding is that Na binding to the GIRK4 subunit increases the affinity for Gβγ, while Gβγ does not require Na binding for its high affinity for Gβγ. The data are outstanding and the interpretation convincing. This manuscript harvests the gold mined in its methodological partner-paper that sets the stage for a quantitative understanding of Gβγ-activated, Na<sup>+</sup>-modulated GRIK channel behavior, by systematically varying Gβγ 'concentration' (i.e., membrane surface density). The manuscript is thorough, in not only purifying and quantifying reconstituted GIRK heterotets, or in comparing Gβγ activation of GRK4 homotetramers with GRK1/GRIK4 channels and the striking difference of Na<sup>+</sup> modulation accomplishments that in themselves would be an exciting breakthrough, but in also linking this new information to GIRK behavior in cardiac and neuronal contexts.</p><p>Requested revisions:</p><p>1) The parameters <italic>K<sub>db</sub></italic>and <italic>K<sub>dn</sub></italic> are described as &quot;equilibrium constants&quot;. After several readings, I managed to conclude (a bit shakily) that these refer to dissociation constants rather than binding constants. Why don't you say this up front?</p><p>2) The parameters of <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> have no units associated with them.</p><p>3) In the second paragraph of the subsection “The Na<sup>+</sup>-insensitive GIRK1 subunit potentiates Gβγ activation of GIRK1/4 hetero tetramers”: Instead of just tersely telling us that the model represents the data well, couldn't you offer the reader a bit more narration about the values of the dissociation constants and the coop factors (beyond telling us to go look at the table), either here or in the second paragraph of the Discussion?

They speculate that cell expression of different GIRK isoforms will modulate firing in different ways. While this seems obvious, it is really only the case in a simple way within cell types with very similar electrophysiological properties. It may not be the case when comparing across cell types with different expression of ion channels and transporters. Consider the cardiac SA node: It is not at all obvious that cytoplasmic Na will accumulate with increased frequency in S/A node cells. The upstroke is made by Ca influx, and Na influx is occurring primarily during the diastolic period through CNG channels (probably). Thus, it is more likely that cytoplasmic Na will decrease with increase of frequency, given this situation, thereby creating a very different regulatory situation than in neurons using Nav channels to make APs. Admittedly, this conclusion may be altered if Na/Ca exchangers generate the majority of Na influx in SA node cells, but most recent work does not support this possibility. We believe that these considerations can be used by the authors to improve the clarity and future relevance of their discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15750.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Requested revisions: 1) The parameters K<sub>db</sub> and K<sub>dn</sub> are described as &quot;equilibrium constants&quot;.
