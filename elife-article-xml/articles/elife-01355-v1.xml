induction. Here, we show that anthocyanin biosynthesis is induced by the virulence promoting secreted effector protein Tin2. Tin2 protein functions inside plant cells where it interacts with maize protein kinase ZmTTK1. Tin2 masks a ubiquitin–proteasome degradation motif in ZmTTK1, thus stabilizing the active kinase. Active ZmTTK1 controls activation of genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. Without Tin2, enhanced lignin biosynthesis is observed in infected tissue and vascular bundles show strong lignification. This is presumably limiting access of fungal hyphae to nutrients needed for massive proliferation. Consistent with this assertion, we observe that maize <italic>brown midrib</italic> mutants affected in lignin biosynthesis are hypersensitive to <italic>U. maydis</italic> infection. We speculate that Tin2 rewires metabolites into the anthocyanin pathway to lower their availability for other defense responses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01355.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01355.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01355.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The production of agricultural crop plants is severely hindered by bacteria, viruses, and fungi that have developed their own strategies to colonize these plants and obtain nutrients from them. Some pathogens kill the plants they colonize, but ‘biotrophic pathogens’ employ sophisticated strategies to manipulate the host plant without killing it.</p><p>During the past decade it has been recognized that the interactions between plants and biotrophic pathogens are largely governed by effector proteins—which are typically secreted by the pathogen after it makes contact with the host. These effector proteins can either stay in the space between the plant cells and pathogen cells, or actually enter inside the plant cells.</p><p>The fungus <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> is one such biotrophic pathogen that colonizes maize plants and causes a disease called corn smut. Hallmarks of this infection are the formation of large plant tumors and the production of a red pigment, called anthocyanin, in infected plant tissues.</p><p>Now, Tanaka et al. reveal that an effector called Tin2, which is secreted by the corn smut fungus, causes the production of this anthocyanin pigment. Tin2 moves inside plant cells, where it blocks the breakdown of a protein-modifying enzyme that is necessary to ‘switch on’ the production of anthocyanin. When a mutant fungus that lacks Tin2 infects a maize plant, no anthocyanin is induced and the pathogen fails to reach the vascular tissue, where it would normally get most of its nutrients. Tanaka et al. revealed that, in these infections, this vascular tissue was strongly reinforced with a compound, called lignin, suggesting that the plant fortifies these cell walls to block access by the mutant fungus.</p><p>Since the building blocks for making lignin are also required for making anthocyanins, Tanaka et al. suggest a model whereby Tin2 compromises the ability of plants to protect themselves by diverting resources away from making lignin. In line with this speculation, the corn smut fungus was shown to cause stronger disease symptoms in maize plants with mutations that prevent them from producing lignin.</p><p>The Tin2 effector of the corn smut fungus appears to target a critical protein in maize that can shift the balance of the plant’s metabolic pathways in favor of the pathogen. Further, since anthocyanin production is also observed after infections of plants with other microbes, these findings may have uncovered a microbial strategy to enhance virulence that is also employed by other plant pathogens.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01355.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01355.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Ustilago maydis</italic></kwd><kwd>smut fungus</kwd><kwd>plant pathogen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Shigeyuki</given-names></name><name><surname>Brefort</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Neidig</surname><given-names>Nina</given-names></name><name><surname>Djamei</surname><given-names>Armin</given-names></name><name><surname>Kahnt</surname><given-names>Jörg</given-names></name><name><surname>Kahmann</surname><given-names>Regine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DFG Collaborative Research Center 593</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brefort</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Djamei</surname><given-names>Armin</given-names></name><name><surname>Kahmann</surname><given-names>Regine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LOEWE Program of the State of Hesse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kahmann</surname><given-names>Regine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alexander von Humboldt Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Shigeyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DFG Excellence Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FL3 INST 186/822-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feussner</surname><given-names>Ivo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Consortium for Plant Biotechnology Research Inc.</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEFG36-02GO12026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vermerris</surname><given-names>Wilfred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>USDA Biomass Research &amp; Development Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2011-10006-30358</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vermerris</surname><given-names>Wilfred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A fungal effector secreted by the corn smut pathogen increases the virulence of the pathogen by elevating anthocyanin production and reducing lignification in maize.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The fungus <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> causes smut disease in maize. <italic>U. maydis</italic> is a biotrophic fungus that needs living plant tissue for completion of its sexual cycle and spore formation. After penetrating epidermal cells and establishing an extended interaction zone in which hyphae are encased by the host plasma membrane, fungal hyphae traverse mesophyll tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doehlemann et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2009</xref>), and accumulate in and around vascular bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doehlemann et al., 2008</xref>) presumably to obtain nutrients from veins. During infection, <italic>U. maydis</italic> secretes hundreds of effector proteins to suppress plant defense responses, and to reprogram plant signaling and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doehlemann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mueller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Djamei and Kahmann, 2012</xref>). However, the function of the vast majority of these novel effectors is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Djamei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Djamei and Kahmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hemetsberger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Linde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>). At later stages of host colonization, large plant tumors develop that provide the environment for massive fungal proliferation. During biotrophic growth, a high affinity fungal sucrose H<sup>+</sup> symporter, Srt1, is upregulated and plays a crucial role for fungal nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wahl et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Visible changes in host metabolism include an accumulation of anthocyanin in infected areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banuett and Herskowitz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brefort et al., in press</xref>). Up to date, anthocyanin induction was thought to result from unspecific biotic stress caused by microbial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steyn et al., 2002</xref>), and flavonoid-pathway related compounds like luteolinidin have been shown to function as phytoalexins negatively affecting fungal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Snyder and Nicholson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zuther et al., 2012</xref>). So far, no positive link has been established between anthocyanin induction and microbial virulence. We have recently shown that the secreted <italic>U. maydis</italic> effector Tin2 (Um05302) is specifically responsible for anthocyanin induction in infected seedling tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brefort et al., in press</xref>). The <italic>tin2</italic> effector gene resides in the largest effector gene cluster 19A comprising 24 effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kämper et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brefort et al., in press</xref>). Deletion of the entire cluster 19A largely abolishes tumor formation and anthocyanin induction, although the mutant is still able to grow and complete its life cycle inside the plant tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brefort et al., in press</xref>). Here, we elucidate the molecular function of Tin2 and show that Tin2 is a secreted anthocyanin biosynthesis inducing effector protein functioning inside plant cells. We hypothesize that it may be beneficial for <italic>U. maydis</italic> to induce anthocyanin biosynthesis as a strategy to compete with tissue lignification and to gain access to veins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>tin2</italic> mutant phenotype</title><p>Tin2 was previously shown to be responsible for anthocyanin induction during biotrophic growth and was shown to have a weak contribution to virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brefort et al., in press</xref>). To unambiguously establish its contribution to virulence, we introduced <italic>tin2</italic> in this study into SG200Δ19A-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brefort et al., in press</xref>), a mutant strain lacking the 14 leftmost effector genes of cluster 19A, including <italic>tin2</italic>. This mutant is severely attenuated in virulence, is unable to elicit anthocyanin formation and induces at most small tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brefort et al., in press</xref>). Introduction of <italic>tin2</italic> enhanced tumor formation significantly and fully restored anthocyanin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In addition, we could demonstrate that <italic>tin2</italic> was induced during biotrophic growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Microscopic analysis and fungal biomass determination revealed that a SG200Δtin2 mutant did colonize plants efficiently, but was attenuated during late proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To get an idea, which processes might be affected by Tin2, we determined the transcriptional response of <italic>Z. mays</italic> to infection by SG200 and SG200Δtin2. At 4 days post inoculation (dpi), RNA was prepared from three biological replicates and analyzed by Affymetrix maize genome arrays as described before for other <italic>tin</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brefort et al., in press</xref>). Hierarchical clustering analysis of differentially regulated genes showed that the expression patterns of plant genes in response to SG200Δtin2 was related to the response to SG200 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with the small contribution of Tin2 to tumor formation. Among the top five genes most highly induced after SG200 infection (compared to SG200Δtin2), two were related to anthocyanin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) and one of these was the second most highly induced gene when SG200-infected tissue was compared with mock inoculated tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). To substantiate these data, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for the five genes comprising the anthocyanin pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) using tissue from maize infected with SG200 and SG200Δtin2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This analysis revealed that all five genes tested were significantly induced in SG200-infected tissue, illustrating that the anthocyanin pathway is transcriptionally induced when <italic>U. maydis</italic> provides the <italic>tin2</italic> effector. Another pathway comprising three differentially regulated genes concerned the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) implicated in aphid and fungal resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2011</xref>). When the expression levels of eight genes comprising the entire DIMBOA biosynthesis pathway were analyzed by qPCR, we detected significant differences in expression for <italic>Bx1</italic>, <italic>Bx2</italic>, <italic>Bx5</italic> and <italic>Bx8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) in SG200- and SG200Δtin2-infected tissue while we could not detect differences in expression for <italic>Bx3</italic>, <italic>Bx4</italic>, <italic>Bx6</italic> and <italic>Bx7</italic> (not shown). To determine whether the transcriptional changes detected can be linked to the presence or absence of respective metabolites, amounts of total anthocyanin were quantified photometrically at the anthocyanin specific absorption of 515 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This revealed an approximately 15-fold increase of anthocyanins in leaf material upon infection with the wild-type strain that was absent in the SG200Δtin2-infected leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). By UPLC-PDA-TOF-MS analysis the identity of the three highly abundant anthocyanins in infected maize leaves were determined: cyanidin 3-glucoside (449.0996 Da, C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>21</sub>O<sub>11</sub><sup>+</sup>); cyanidin 3-(6’’-malonylglucoside) (535.1088 Da, C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>23</sub>O<sub>14</sub><sup>+</sup>); cyanidin 3-(3’’,6’’-dimalonylglucoside) (621.1092 Da, C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>25</sub>O<sub>17</sub><sup>+</sup>) and confirmed by MS<sup>2</sup> fragmentation studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). These cyanidin derivatives were previously described to be the major anthocyanins in maize leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fossen et al., 2001</xref>). Relative amounts of these three cyanidins identified confirmed the overall anthocyanin profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In the UPLC-PDA-TOF-MS analysis, we also identified flavonoids and DIBOA-glucoside to be reduced in tissue infected with the <italic>tin2</italic> mutant relative to the corresponding wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Exact mass as well as MS<sup>2</sup> spectra information allowed to identify the three flavonoids as: orientin 2’’-<italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside (594.1585 Da, C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>30</sub>O<sub>15</sub>); isoorientin 2’’-<italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside (594.1585 Da, C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>30</sub>O<sub>15</sub>); quercetin-glucoside-rhamnoside (610.1534, C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>30</sub>O<sub>16</sub>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). The biosynthesis of these flavonoids branches off the anthocyanin pathway and is likely a side effect of the upregulation of this pathway after infection by wild-type <italic>U. maydis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In case of DIMBOA biosynthesis we identified 2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one glucoside (DIBOA-glucoside, 343.0903 Da, C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>17</sub>NO<sub>9</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) to be regulated by Tin2. These findings suggest that, besides the influence of Tin2 on anthocyanin, additional pathways may be affected directly or indirectly by <italic>tin2</italic>.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01355.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression and mapping of functional domains in Tin2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Biological function of truncated Tin2 proteins.

An amino acid alignment revealed significant sequence conservation in the C-terminal third of the protein, whereas the N-terminus showed less conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The C-terminal region contains two proline repeat sequences (PxxP), suggesting that this domain might be important for the interaction with other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saksela et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dornan et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

After infection, mCherry fluorescence could be observed around fungal hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

In addition, mCherry-Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> was never detected in the cytosol of infected plants. Since anthocyanin biosynthesis is occurring in the cytosol of plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holton and Cornish, 1995</xref>), we expected that Tin2 would translocate to plant cells after being secreted. To demonstrate a function of Tin2 in the plant cytosol, we expressed <italic>tin2</italic> without its secretion signal under the CaMV 35S promoter in maize leaf epidermal cells after biolistic bombardment. As this did not induce anthocyanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, leftmost panel), we repeated the experiment with leaves from plants infected with SG200Δtin2. Here, anthocyanin could be induced by Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, third panel), was absent in infected leaves without <italic>tin2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, second panel) and could also not be observed when biologically inactive Tin2<sub>26-202</sub> was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, rightmost panel). To confirm that anthocyanin is produced in SG200Δtin2-infected tissue transiently transformed with <italic>tin2</italic>, p35S-Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> and p35S-mCherry as transformation control were introduced simultaneously in SG200Δtin2-infected tissue.

In line with this assertion, we observed strongly lignified cells in vascular bundle tissue in cross sections of maize leaves infected with SG200Δtin2 and could only rarely observe fungal hyphae in bundle sheath cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14E</xref>).

Several Myb and NAC transcriptional activators involved in secondary cell wall formation have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fornalé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhong et al., 2011</xref>), but the mechanisms behind tissue-specific and developmentally regulated gene expression, and the role of posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression are yet to be fully elucidated. In <italic>tin2</italic> mutant infected tissue total lignin levels appear increased, although statistically relevant effects were seen in only one of the mutants analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A</xref>). This may reflect that increased lignification does not affect the entire leaf but, as we have shown, is restricted to the vascular tissue colonized by the <italic>tin2</italic> mutant late in infection. Therefore, when total tissue is analyzed, differences in total lignin content may not be so evident in wild-type and <italic>tin2</italic> mutant infected tissue. However, the increased susceptibility of maize <italic>bm</italic> mutants to <italic>U. maydis</italic> and the increased leaf areas displaying disease symptoms, provide strong evidence for a role of lignification in disease resistance. Several mechanisms may form the basis for this observation. A less lignified cell wall will be easier to penetrate by the fungus. The plant may also be less effective at producing defense-related lignin that could slow down the migration of the fungus. Lastly, since the fungus spreads via the vascular tissue and may rely on nutrients obtained from this tissue for massive proliferation, the altered physico-chemical characteristics of the vascular tissue in the <italic>bm</italic> mutants, combined with altered dimensions of the xylem vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vermerris et al., 2010</xref>) may influence entry and the rate of migration of the fungus. The <italic>bm2</italic> mutant appears to be an exception in that it does not show increased susceptibility to <italic>U. maydis</italic>, and even appears to attenuate the effect of infection in <italic>bm1-bm2</italic> and <italic>bm2-bm3</italic> double mutants relative to the <italic>bm1</italic> and <italic>bm3</italic> single mutants. This effect may be due to the accumulation of a fungitoxic (phenolic) compound in this mutant, as has been proposed for the sorghum <italic>brown midrib12</italic> mutant, which was shown to be less susceptible to colonization by <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Funnell-Harris et al., 2010</xref>). Also in <italic>N. attenuata</italic> lines in which two <italic>CAD</italic> genes were silenced, compensatory processes for the structural deficiencies were observed when plants were grown in the field, and in this case such plants accumulated various phenylpropanoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaur et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, while we consider direct effects of Tin2 on lignification to be the simplest model to explain the reduced virulence on the <italic>tin2</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>), the situation may in reality be much more complex. For example we cannot formally rule out that in the absence of anthocyanin biosynthesis it is not actually the enhanced lignification that affects fungal spread but an altered composition of the plant cell walls. Conversely, the enhanced disease symptoms observed in the <italic>bm</italic> mutants could also be attributed to an lower incorporation of phenolics rather than to the reduction in lignin, that is in wild-type plants cell wall phenolics may negatively affect fungal growth and restrict pathogen spread.<fig id="fig15" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01355.023</object-id><label>Figure 15.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model for Tin2 function.</title><p>In the upper part the hypothetical model for infection of maize with wild-type <italic>U. maydis</italic> is depicted.

Based on the experiments described here, it is clear that modifying lignin composition in maize has the risk of increased susceptibility to <italic>U. maydis</italic>, and the associated reduction in yield.</p><p>Whether Tin2 is actively diverting the flux from lignin to anthocyanin remains speculative as flux measurements would require the absolute quantification of lignin and anthocyanin in the infected tissue and this is hampered by the technical difficulties in lignin extraction and quantification due to limited amounts of infected tissue material. In addition, the direct or indirect effects of Tin2 on other pathways like DIMBOA and flavonoid biosynthesis might complicate such analyses. However, precedence for a connection between lignin and anthocyanin biosynthesis comes from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, where the silencing of HCT (hydroxycinnamoyl transferase), the first committed enzyme from the lignin pathway, redirected the metabolic flux into flavonoids through chalcone synthase and this resulted in elevated levels of flavonols and anthocyanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besseau et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, transgenic <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants expressing the lignin biosynthesis repressing ZmMYB31 transcription factor from maize redirected carbon flux towards the biosynthesis of anthocyanins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fornalé et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, a competition between anthocyanin and lignin pathways for their common precursor has also been detected in strawberry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ring et al., 2013</xref>). In that system it was demonstrated that plant class III peroxidase (FaPRX27), a gene connected with lignin biosynthesis, is linked to a region implied in fruit color decrease. In addition, it was demonstrated that the downregulation of chalcone synthase lead to an induction of FaPRX27 and this diverted the flux from anthocyanins to lignin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ring et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, there appears to be a metabolic connection between anthocyanin and lignin biosynthesis pathways in monocot as well as dicot systems and <italic>U. maydis</italic> may be altering this with the help of Tin2. Future work will be needed to address whether this connection is direct with lignin functioning as barrier or indirect with anthocyanin induction negatively affecting the accumulation of other defense compounds.</p><p>Transient expression of the ZmR1 transcription factor known to positively regulate the anthocyanin pathway in maize revealed strong nuclear localization when ZmR1 was co-expressed with ZmTTK1 and Tin2, but not when Tin2 was omitted. We suggest that the difference in ZmR1 localization may be caused by its phosphorylation, although we cannot exclude other possibilities. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic> MYB75, which is related to maize ZmC1, but is not the closest ortholog, acts as a repressor for the lignin-specific branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway presumably through an interaction with TT8, a bHLH protein related to ZmR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhargava et al., 2010</xref>). If such a scenario also exists in maize, the observed Tin2-mediated nuclear localization of ZmR1 might actually promote the formation of such a repressive complex for lignin biosynthesis. How Tin2 affects the expression of DIMBOA is currently unclear. It is conceivable that this could reflect a co-regulation with anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. Alternatively, the activity of another transcription factor might be modulated by the Tin2-stabilized ZmTTK1 protein. An upregulation of <italic>Bx1</italic> and elevated amounts of DIMBOA had previously been detected after colonization of maize by <italic>U. maydis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basse, 2005</xref>). In this context, it had also been demonstrated that <italic>U. maydis</italic> is resistant to DIMBOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basse, 2005</xref>) while several other fungal pathogens of maize are susceptible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glenn et al., 2002</xref>). This could indicate that the induction of DIMBOA might deter infection by other pathogens in <italic>U. maydis</italic> infected tissue. However, in a macro-array based expression analysis of phenylpropanoid and related genes in <italic>brown midrib</italic> mutants, two genes from the DIMBOA pathway, <italic>Bx4</italic> and <italic>Bx5</italic>, were significantly upregulated in the <italic>bm3</italic> mutant, that is the mutant with the strongest effect in lignin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guillaumie et al., 2007</xref>). The authors suggest that this may be a compensatory reaction for the lack of COMT activity in the <italic>bm3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guillaumie et al., 2007</xref>). If true, the upregulation of DIMBOA after SG200 infection could also be the consequence of the locally reduced lignin content in the infected areas.</p><p>For its function, the Tin2 protein must translocate into plant cells after being secreted. Although an mCherry-Tin2 fusion protein produced by <italic>U. maydis</italic> was partially biologically active, we could never see the fusion protein accumulate inside maize cells. Based on similar results with Cmu1, another transferred effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Djamei et al., 2011</xref>), we speculate that large fluorescent tags fused to the respective effector prevent uptake in this pathosystem. Cmu1 and Tin2 do not share obvious common motifs that can be recognized in their primary amino acid sequence that could serve as translocation signal, and it remains to be determined how they cross the plant plasma membrane. Anthocyanin induction after transient transformation of Tin2 could be observed only when plants were pre-infected with a <italic>tin2</italic> mutant strain. We consider that it may be necessary to pre-infect plants to obtain high levels of phenylalanine or tyrosine for anthocyanin biosynthesis. These amino acids supply the flavonoid pathway and <italic>U. maydis</italic> infection was shown to increase their amounts in infected leaves through Cmu1 and possibly other effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doehlemann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Djamei et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In maize, anthocyanin induction is connected to kernel development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holton and Cornish, 1995</xref>) and is also observed when coleoptiles are exposed to UV-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beggs and Wellman, 1985</xref>). We hypothesize that there will be a native regulatory system stabilizing the ZmTTK1 protein kinase in such conditions, and Tin2 may mimic this regulator. Interestingly, ZmTTK1 orthologs in barley and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> have substitutions in critical serine residues of the phosphodegron motif DSGxS, and in the related kinase from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> this region is missing altogether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Since the barley smut <italic>U. hordei</italic> and the <italic>B. distachyon</italic> smut <italic>U. bromivora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbieri et al., 2011</xref>) both lack an ortholog of Tin2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laurie et al., 2012</xref>; AD and RK, unpublished data), this could suggest that the ongoing co-evolution between host and pathogen has already generated stable kinases in barley and <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, respectively, that no longer need respective orthologs of the Tin2 effector for activity.</p><p>Anthocyanin serves for pollinator attraction of flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sheehan et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, its accumulation is frequently observed under abiotic and biotic stress conditions. Anthocyanin is transported and accumulates in the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodman et al., 2004</xref>), provides UV-B stress protection and allows scavenging of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steyn et al., 2002</xref>). So far, the observed accumulation of anthocyanin after biotic stress was discussed in the frame of defense responses of resistant cultivars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammerschmidt and Nicholson, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hipskind et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, some other examples, not connected to classical resistance responses, have been described: in a recent report it has been demonstrated that tomatoes enriched in anthocyanins are less susceptible to the necrotrophic fungus <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>. The enhanced resistance occurs through reduced spreading of the ROS burst, which limits the induction of cell death necessary for growth of this necrotroph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). In potato it was shown that ectopic overexpression of an anthocyanin 5-<italic>O</italic>-glycosyl transferase conferred enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen <italic>Erwinia carotovora</italic>. In this system, it is not clear, however, whether the effects are direct or indirect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lorenc-Kukuła et al., 2005</xref>). In perennial ryegrass infected with the fungal endophyte <italic>Epichloae festucae</italic>, prominent anthocyanin induction is observed at the base of tillers, while fungal Δ<italic>sak</italic> mutants, lacking a stress activated MAP kinase, fail to induce anthocyanin, display alterations in the vascular tissue and accumulate less fungal biomass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eaton et al., 2010</xref>). In this system it has been speculated that the observed downregulation of key enzymes in the shikimate and anthocyanin pathway may divert precursors into the catechin/tannin pathway with negative consequences for fungal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eaton et al., 2010</xref>). In the present study, we have uncovered a new positive connection between anthocyanin induction and development of a biotrophic pathogen. We suggest that examples where anthocyanin induction is observed in response to biotic stress should be revisited to see, whether metabolic rewiring of the phenylpropanoid pathway is adopted as a common strategy by biotrophic microbes colonizing plants.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Growth conditions and virulence assays</title><p><italic>Zea mays</italic> cv.

The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed following the instructions of the matchmaker yeast two-hybrid manual (Clontech) using 1 mg of bait-DNA (pGBKT7-Tin2<sub>26-207</sub>) and 0.5 mg of library-DNA. All resulting yeast clones were tested by immunoblotting for expression of the respective fusion proteins. Interacting clones were verified by empty vector controls excluding self-activating clones as well as by vector swap experiments. Full-length cDNAs of putative interaction partners were generated from SG200-infected tissue collected 6 days post infection, cloned in pGADT7 and tested for interaction with Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> expressed from pGBKT7-Tin2<sub>26-207</sub>.</p><p>For yeast protein interaction assays, the genes encoding the proteins tested for interaction were cloned into pGBKT7 or pGADT7 vectors (Clontech), respectively, to express fusion proteins with the yeast GAL4 binding (BD) and activation domain (AD), respectively, in strain AH109 (Clontech). Yeast transformants were screened on selective dropout media (SD) lacking only tryptophan (Trp) and leucine (Leu) to select yeast cells, which contained the desired plasmids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Protein interactions were assessed on SD selection medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (His) containing 3 mM 3-Amino-1, 2, 4-triazole (3-AT). Yeast MEL1p activity was measured by addition of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl α-D-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal). Fusion protein expression was verified by western blot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Protein expression and protein in vitro studies</title><p>For protein expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, pRSET-GST-PP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>) and pPR-IBA102 (IBA Lifesciences, Göttingen, Germany) vectors were used for the preparation of GST-Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> or Strep-ZmTTK1, respectively. <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) strain was used as host for protein expression. <italic>E. coli</italic> transformants carrying respective expression plasmids were grown in YT medium (1.6% Bacto Tryptone, 1.0% Yeast Extract, 0.5% NaCl) containing ampicillin (50 µg/ml). Protein induction was performed by addition of 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 28°C for 5 hr. Cell pellets were lysed by BugBuster master mix (Merck, Schwalbach, Germany). Soluble supernatant was incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare, München, Germany) or Strep-tactin sepharose (IBA Lifesciences) for GST- or Strep-tagged protein purification, respectively. Protein enrichment and purity was assessed by western blot.

Protein was visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). Monoclonal anti-c-myc antibody produced in mouse, anti-HA antibody produced in rabbit or monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody produced in mouse were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany) and used as a primary antibody. Anti-mouse IgG HRP-linked or anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA) and used as a secondary antibody. Strep-tactin-HRP (IBA Lifesciences) was used for the detection of Strep-tagged protein. For immunoprecipitation of ZmTTK1 from plant cell, total plant protein extract was incubated with human-IgG agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C for 2 hr on a rotary shaker. For in vitro kinase assay, recombinant proteins or human-IgG agarose carrying immunoprecipitates were incubated at 28°C for 30 min in a volume of 25 µl reaction buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 µM ATP, and 2.5 µCi [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments. While the manuscript in its current form is not acceptable for <italic>eLife</italic>, we believe that the work has potential. The reviewers had several serious concerns, and would consider a substantially revised manuscript.</p><p>The work utilizes a fungal effector to identify a new interaction with a novel regulator of the phenylpropanoid network that appears to be limited to the monocots. The most serious concern was that, while there is evidence for an anthocyanin role in defense, there was not very good support for a flux trade off argument with respect to the role of lignin, especially since anthocyanins can act directly as antimicrobial compounds of the phytoalexin class in other species, without invoking a lignin link. The flux trade off is highly speculative. One way to support the model would be to determine whether high anthocyanin lines have lowered lignin content. Alternatively, you should merely bring up the lignin link as a speculative hypothesis in the Discussion.</p><p>Additional concerns:</p><p>1) There were key experimental details mentioned in each specific review (by Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2, below) that should be included or clarified in the text. These are essential such as with regards to information about the genetic background and phylogeny to provide the necessary assurance for the interpretations being put forward.</p><p>2) As the data were presented as regulating pathways and there is extant transcriptome information, it would make sense to provide pathway level views of gene expression at all phenolic genes both phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways. It was felt that this pathway level view would help the reader to better place the observations in their broader network context.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 comments</italic>:</p><p>The authors focus on an effector from <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> that interacts with a maize protein kinase that is responsible for controlling phenolic metabolism. In this work the authors make the identification of a putative monocot specific phenolic regulator that interacts with the Tin2 effector. This then links to transcriptional control of the phenolic metabolic pathways and is proposed to control a flux based defense system. The molecular analysis of the effector is very strong and detailed. However, I would argue that the novelty is not in the identification that an effector does something but instead in the analysis of phenolic metabolism. It is here that there needs to be work to bring the metabolic interpretation to the same strength as the molecular analysis of the effector.</p><p>I think the authors have really over-interpreted the flux redirection concept. This begins with the title that makes an explicit assumption of flux redirection and continues throughout. They have some evidence on the anthocyanins via the CHS mutant but don't have any evidence on the lignification theory. This is exemplified by their final sentence “We suggest that examples where biotic stress leads to anthocyanin induction should be revisited as the deployment of specific translocated effectors (like Tin2) to achieve metabolic rewiring may be a common strategy adopted by plant pathogenic microbes.” Their data definitely shows that the effector rewires but it does not show that this rewiring is key. Given the data, it is completely possible that the anthocyanins are playing a direct role in the infection, which is in agreement with the other citations. To make the rewiring/flux arguments would require mutants in CAD or other lignin steps to show that these have the expected consequences.</p><p>To experimentally make the flux theory, it would require absolute quantification of the anthocyanins to show that this is a comparable amount of carbon going into anthocyanins that is lost from the phenolics. The anthocyanins are currently not quantified.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, how did the authors define orthologs for TTK1? A key point of the manuscript is that this is a unique phenolic regulator for these monocots but there is no description of how the authors ruled out dicot orthologues?

Anthocyanin induction would be accomplished by induction of the Tin2 protein, which stabilizes a kinase (ZmTTK1), which in turn affects somehow anthocyanin formation.

This reviewer is obviously not fully aware of the fact that there are hardly any reports on the function of novel fungal or oomycete effectors that are not Avr proteins. Therefore, we feel somewhat disappointed that the part on elucidation how Tin2 functions has not been met with more appreciation.</p><p>In the meantime, however, we have done whatever possible to strengthen the link with lignin (see below for more details) with the most important result being that with one exception all maize mutants affected in lignin biosynthesis display significantly enhanced virulence of <italic>U. maydis</italic> and in addition tumor formation which is locally confined in wild type maize is spreading to much larger leaf areas.

Unfortunately, we could not yet test whether the purple maize mutants that show anthocyanin formation constitutively have the expected lower lignin content. The reason for this is that the plants display the purple phenotype only when almost fully grown under natural light conditions. The mutant plants we are growing in our greenhouse since late October, unfortunately, do not display the purple leaf phenotype yet. Therefore, we could not test the effects of anthocyanin production on lignin content in leaves. However, based on our newly included data that show enhanced virulence of <italic>U. maydis</italic> in several lignin mutants of maize, which was the expected consequence, we feel more convinced than before that our ideas were correct.</p><p><italic>To experimentally make the flux theory, it would require absolute quantification of the anthocyanins to show that this is a comparable amount of carbon going into anthocyanins that is lost from the phenolics.
