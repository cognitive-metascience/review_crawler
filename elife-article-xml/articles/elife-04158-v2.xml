Previous studies have demonstrated a role for local translation in altering the structure and function of synapses during synapse formation and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. In this study, we ask whether in addition to promoting local translation, local stimulation also triggers directed trafficking of RNAs from nucleus to stimulated synapses. Imaging of RNA localization and translation in cultured Aplysia sensory-motor neurons revealed that RNAs were delivered throughout the arbor of the sensory neuron, but that translation was enriched only at sites of synaptic contact and/or synaptic stimulation. Investigation of the mechanisms that trigger local translation revealed a role for calcium-dependent retrograde netrin-1/DCC receptor signaling. Spatially restricting gene expression by regulating local translation rather than by directing the delivery of mRNAs from nucleus to stimulated synapses maximizes the readiness of the entire neuronal arbor to respond to local cues.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04158.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04158.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04158.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The nervous system contains billions of cells called neurons that connect to each other to form complex networks via junctions known as synapses. Synapses form between the end of an elongated section (called the axon) of one neuron and the tiny projections (or dendrites) from the cell body of the next neuron.</p><p>Throughout the lifespan of an animal, the nervous system responds to experiences and stimuli from the environment by changing the strength of the connections at synapses; this is known as ‘synaptic plasticity’. In this way, long-term information about learning and memory can be stored and used to direct future responses to similar situations.</p><p>Many proteins are involved in forming and altering synapses. The genes that code for these proteins are found in the nucleus of the neuron within the cell body. To make new proteins, copies of genes are made using molecules called mRNAs, which then leave the nucleus and are used as templates by the machinery that assemble proteins. Previous studies have shown that mRNA molecules are transported from the cell body to the axon and dendrites, but it is not clear exactly where the proteins are produced.</p><p>Kim et al. have now studied the movement of mRNAs in neurons from the sea slug <italic>Aplysia</italic> during synapse formation and synapse plasticity. This showed that mRNAs are delivered equally throughout the neuron, and so it appears that mRNAs are not targeted to a particular synapse. However, the level of protein production using these mRNA molecules is much higher in places where synapses are being formed or altered. A protein called netrin-1 promotes protein production in the dendrites of neurons at these synapses.</p><p>Kim et al. demonstrate that although mRNAs are delivered throughout the neuron, they are only used to make proteins at specific synapses. This allows the entire neuron to be in a state of readiness to make new synapses or alter existing ones in response to stimuli from the environment. Understanding more about how this local control of protein production works within neurons may provide new insights into diseases that affect synaptic plasticity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04158.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04158.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Aplysia</kwd><kwd>synapse formation</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>mRNA localization</kwd><kwd>netrin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS045324</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Kelsey C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The spatial regulation of gene expression within neurons occurs primarily at the level of local translation rather than by stimulus-induced RNA targeting from nucleus to synapse.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synapse formation and long-lasting experience-dependent synaptic plasticity require new RNA and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kandel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalinovsky and Scheiffele, 2004</xref>). Neurons are dramatically polarized and compartmentalized cells, elaborating axonal and dendritic processes that extend long distances and forming thousands of synaptic connections with other neurons. This polarity and compartmentalization poses challenges to the spatial regulation of gene expression during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity: how can the products of gene expression be restricted to specific synapses undergoing activity-dependent changes in structure and function? Many studies have demonstrated that mRNAs that constitutively localize to axonal growth cones in immature neurons and to dendrites in mature neurons undergo stimulus-induced translation, demonstrating that regulated translation of localized mRNAs provides one mechanism of spatially restricting neuronal gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aakalu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Job and Eberwine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lyles et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsokas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2001</xref>). Here, we set out to determine whether, in addition to regulating compartmentalized translation, local stimulation also regulates RNA trafficking from the soma to the synapse. We considered that the regulated trafficking of stimulus-induced transcripts from nucleus to stimulated synapse would provide a means of directly coupling the requirement for transcription with the requirement for local translation during synapse formation and plasticity.</p><p>A number of findings indicate that the persistence of long-term plasticity requires not only translation but also transcription. For example, transcriptional inhibitors block late-phase LTP of rodent hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frey et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nguyen et al., 1994</xref>) and long-term facilitation (LTF) of <italic>Aplysia</italic> sensory-motor synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montarolo et al., 1986</xref>), indicating that translation of pre-existing localized mRNAs is not sufficient for late-LTP in hippocampus or for the persistence of LTF in <italic>Aplysia</italic>. Similarly, when isolated <italic>Aplysia</italic> sensory neurites, severed from their somata, are paired with motor neurons, they undergo a form of serotonin (5HT)-induced LTF that does not last as long as the LTF in cultures containing intact SNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grabham et al., 2005</xref>). Together these studies demonstrate that newly transcribed mRNAs are required for persistent synaptic plasticity. This led us to ask whether, in addition to regulating local translation, synaptic stimulation regulates the trafficking of RNAs from the nucleus to specific subcellular sites.</p><p>Consistent with the possibility of stimulus-induced control of RNA trafficking, previous studies have reported that activity can regulate the localization of mRNAs within neurons. For example, depolarization has been shown to increase the dendritic localization of several mRNAs, including those encoding beta-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiruchinapalli et al., 2003</xref>), BDNF, and TrkB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tongiorgi et al., 1997</xref>), while incubation with DHPG has been shown to increase the dendritic localization of the AMPA glutamate receptor GluA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grooms et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, neurotrophins have been reported to regulate the concentration of specific mRNAs in axons of regenerating adult sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Willis et al., 2007</xref>). Neuronal activity also induces transcription of genes whose transcripts are subsequently transported into dendrites, including for example the immediate early gene Arc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Link et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lyford et al., 1995</xref>). In situ hybridization images of the <italic>bclw</italic> transcript in a recent study from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Cosker et al (2013)</xref> indicated that the mRNA localized to peripheral but not central axons of DRG neurons, suggesting that neurons are capable of directing transcripts from the soma to subsets of processes. Together, these findings suggest that RNAs may undergo activity-dependent transport from the nucleus to locally stimulated subcellular compartments.</p><p>In this study, we directly monitored RNA targeting from the soma to stimulated synapses during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity. To examine synapse formation, we cultured a single bifurcated <italic>Aplysia</italic> SN with a target (L7) MN, with which it formed glutamatergic synapses, and a non-target (L11) MN, with which it fasciculated but did not form chemical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glanzman et al., 1990</xref>). To study RNA localization during synapse-specific plasticity, we cultured bifurcated SNs with two target MNs and locally perfused 5HT onto the connection with one MN to produce synapse-specific LTF. We asked whether and how stimuli regulate RNA and protein localization and concentration by analyzing the distribution of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), RNA binding proteins, and translation factors. We found that rRNA, three specific mRNAs, ribosomal proteins, and translation factors were delivered throughout the SN, to both synaptic and non-synaptic sites, but that translation was significantly enriched at sites of synaptic contact and at sites of synaptic stimulation. These results indicate that the spatial regulation of gene expression in <italic>Aplysia</italic> sensory-motor neurons is mediated primarily at the level of translation rather than at the level of RNA targeting from the nucleus. These results, together with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) suggested the existence of a trans-synaptic signal that promotes translation of localized mRNAs. In investigating the nature of such a trans-synaptic signal, we uncovered a role for netrin-1/DCC signaling in local translation at synapses. Our findings are thus consistent with neurons delivering transcripts and translational machinery throughout the neuron, but with a synaptically restricted netrin-1-dependent signal triggering localized translation at synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ribosomal RNA targets equally well to SN branches contacting target and non-target MNs</title><p>We first asked whether the most abundant RNA, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) underwent directed targeting from neuronal cell bodies to synaptic sites during synapse formation.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>, incubation with netrin-1 significantly increased sensorin immunoreactivity. To differentiate between stimulated local translation and stimulated somatic translation followed by transport into the branches, we cultured bifurcated SN-MN, removed the SN cell body, incubated with netrin-1, and processed the cultures 24 hr later for sensorin immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). These experiments revealed that netrin-1 increased sensorin concentration equally well in branches contacting both L7 and L11 MNs, consistent with local stimulation of translation. Netrin-1 also increased peIF4E immunoreactivity in SN-LFS cultures in which the SN soma had been removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The netrin-1-induced increase in sensorin immunoreactivity in intact SN-LFS cocultures was similar to that observed with five spaced applications of serotonin (5HT), which produces LTF of SN-MN synapses and which has been shown to promote sensorin translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, netrin-1-induced translation in intact or soma-lacking SNs was blocked by pre-incubation with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (10 μM for 24 hr), indicating that the increased immunoreactivity did indeed result from increased translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We considered the possibility that netrin-1 might transform non-synaptic sites to synapses and that the increase in translation occurred as a result of the conversion of non-synaptic to synaptic sites. However, incubation of SN-L11 cocultures or L7-SN-L11 cocultures with netrin-1 did not result in the formation of synapse as shown by the absence of an excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) in the L11 MN after SN stimulation (data not shown). We did find, however, that incubation with netrin-1 significantly increased EPSP amplitude between SN and LFS target MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>). The increase in EPSP amplitude was similar to that seen during LTF induced by five spaced applications of 5HT (data not shown). LTF induced by five applications of 5HT has also been shown to involve significant increases in the number of SN varicosities (sites of synaptic connections) in SN-MN cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glanzman, et al., 1990</xref>). We thus measured the effect of netrin-1 on varicosity numbers, and, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>, found that it significantly increased the number of SN synaptic varicosities in SN-LFS MN cultures.

Using a simple system consisting of a single, bifurcated <italic>Aplysia</italic> SN contacting a target L7 MN, with which it formed glutamatergic synapses, and a non-target L11 MN, with which it did not form chemical synapses, we asked whether and how synaptogenic signals regulate RNA localization and/or local translation. To determine how local stimulation spatially regulates gene expression, we cultured a single bifurcated SN with two target MNs and locally perfused 5HT onto the SN connections that formed onto one MN to produce synapse-specific LTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin et al., 1997</xref>). We used 18S and 28S rRNA FISH and S6-dendra2 overexpression to monitor the localization of rRNA; sensorin, β-thymosin and EF1α FISH to monitor localization of three mRNAs, including one transcriptionally induced mRNA; and Staufen-dendra2 overexpression to monitor localization of an RBP previously reported to be involved in mRNA localization in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lebeau et al., 2011</xref>). We monitored translation using quantitative immunocytochemistry for a SN-specific protein, sensorin. We monitored translation more globally by immunocytochemistry for the activated, phosphorylated forms of eIF4E and 4EBP, live imaging with a sensorin-based translational reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), and the recently described ribopuromylation method to visualize newly synthesized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">David et al., 2012</xref>). The results of our experiments revealed that RNAs and translational machinery are delivered throughout the neuron, but that translation is spatially restricted to sites of synaptic contact or to stimulated synapses. They further indicate that the guidance factor netrin-1 promotes translation at synapses. Our findings are most consistent with a model in which synapse formation leads to the release of netrin-1 from the MN, which in turn triggers pre-synaptic DCC to promote translation in the pre-synaptic compartment.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Local regulation of translation, rather than RNA targeting, mediates spatial regulation of gene expression during synapse formation</title><p>Studies of mRNA localization in non-neuronal asymmetric cells have revealed that a large number of transcripts localize to specific subcellular compartments.

Using this preparation, we find that the local proteome was regulated at the level of translation rather than by stimulus-induced mRNA targeting from the nucleus. Thus, transcripts, ribosomes, and translational machinery were delivered throughout the neuron, but translation was selectively activated in response to local stimuli such as synapse formation. We note that our studies do not rule out a role for more localized subcellular trafficking of mRNAs within neuronal processes, and/or selective stabilization within processes (as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Farris et al.

The finding that anti-DCC antibodies decrease sensorin immunoreactivity in SNs paired with MNs, but not in isolated SNs, is consistent with netrin-1 being released from the MN and binding to DCC on the adjacent pre-synaptic SN to promote the translation of sensorin at synapses. Netrin-1 binding to DCC may promote translation by releasing translational machinery from binding DCC cytoplasmic domains within the pre-synaptic terminal, as proposed by Flanagan et al. (2010). Alternatively, netrin-1-induced translation may be downstream of PI3 kinase and/or MAPK pathways, both of which are activated by netrin-1 binding to DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Round and Stein, 2007</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported that serotonin-induced translation of sensorin in SNs required a calcium-dependent retrograde signal from the MN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).

Finally, we show that overexpression of ApNetrin in MNs significantly increases synaptic strength and sensorin immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>We suspect that netrin-1/DCC signaling is one of multiple local cues and signaling pathways that regulate translation in neurons and that translation is not regulated in a digital on/off manner, but rather in a graded manner. This explains, for example, why there is some sensorin translation in SN neurites contacting non-target L11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and why sensorin protein is expressed in isolated sensory neurons that have been incubated with anti-DCC antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><p>Our previously published report that synapse formation alters the localization of sensorin mRNA such that it concentrates at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lyles et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meer et al., 2012</xref>), and that serotonin-regulated translation of a sensorin-based translational reporter was restricted to sites of synaptic contact, suggested that the activity-dependent synaptic localization of mRNA played a critical role in the regulation of its translation. Our current finding that netrin-1 increases translation at synaptic and non-synaptic sites indicates that the precise subcellular localization of the mRNA is secondary to the localization of the netrin-1 signal. Thus, sensorin mRNA does not have to be in the synaptic milieu per se to be translated but rather has to localize to a site in which netrin-1/DCC signaling can occur. We also note that we previously found that there was an increase in the concentration of sensorin mRNA in SN branches contacting target as compared to non-target MNs in more mature (5 DIV) cocultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lyles et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that while there is not directed targeting of sensorin mRNA from soma to process during synapse formation, there may be preferential stabilization, over time, of sensorin mRNA at sites of synaptic contact. This finding is consistent with recent studies indicating that regulated RNA degradation functions to localize mRNAs and to limit translation within axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colak et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Local translation contributes substantially to the local proteome</title><p>Our study also sheds light on the relative contributions of local translation and somatic translation to the local proteome. Thus, we can compare the amount of netrin-1-induced translation of the sensorin reporter in SN-LFS cocultures with and without the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Although one cannot directly compare the total concentration of sensorin in intact SN and isolated SN neurites, our data indicate that netrin-1 is able to induce an equivalent increase in SN neurites in the presence or absence of a SN soma. This suggests that local translation contributes substantially to stimulus-induced changes in the local proteome.</p><p>The fact that netrin-1 was able to stimulate global translation at non-synaptic sites as detected by phospho-eIF4E immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>) suggests that a large number of transcripts, and not just the two mRNAs we detected by FISH, localize throughout the neuronal arbor. Moreover, we found that every type of RNA that we imaged was delivered from the soma throughout the neuronal arbor, whether during synapse formation or following local stimulation. In contrast, we found that every measure of translation that we employed demonstrated localized translation at synapses and/or stimulated synapses. While our results are consistent with the idea that mRNAs are delivered throughout the neuronal arbor, validation of this idea as a general mechanism will require analysis of a larger pool of specific transcripts.</p><p>Taken together, our findings show that a signaling pathway involved in axon guidance also regulates synapse formation by spatially restricting neuronal gene expression. Our findings further underscore an uncoupling of transcriptional and translational regulation in neurons, with stimuli triggering transcription of a population of mRNAs that are delivered throughout the neuron, but with local cues independently regulating their translation. Decentralizing the control of gene expression to individual subcellular compartments in this manner enriches the adaptability and plasticity of the nervous system by enabling each compartment to change its proteome in response to local cues. This mechanism allows all the branches of a neuron to be in a state of readiness to respond to local stimuli by changing their local proteome and hence their synaptic structure and function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Aplysia</italic> cell culture</title><p>Cultures were prepared from adult 80–100 gram <italic>Aplysia</italic> (Alacrity, Redondo Beach, CA) for SN-LFS MN cultures or from the abdominal ganglion of juvenile <italic>Aplysia</italic> (1–4 g, National Aplysia Resource, University of Miami, FL) for L7 and L11 MNs.

Your article has been quite favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Mani Ramaswami, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Kang Shen, another of the peer reviewers, has also agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Kim and Martin describe the transport of RNAs in a cultured sensory neuron that forms connection with two motor neurons: a synaptic connection with L7 and a non-synaptic adhesive contact with L11. The authors show fairly convincingly that, in these preparations, three different RNA species which are: (a) constitutively expressed; (b) trancriptionally induced by activity, or; (c) translationally controlled by activity are distributed equally between the two sensory neuron axons/ neurite. However, the last class (sensorin) is translated more efficiently in the synaptically connected branch. This increased translation correlates with increased eIF4e and 4-EBP phosphorylation. They further show that externally applied netrin, suggested to work as a translational activator and a synaptic signaling molecule can induce translation of sensorin RNA in SNs through a pathway that requires endogenous DCC and involves eIF4e phosphorylation. They also show that forced netrin expression in MNs induced sensorin translation in presynaptic SNs and that this requires calcium signaling in MNs.</p><p>Despite the general clarity of the paper, there are several significant concerns.</p><p>Do note that the major comment 1 must be addressed in the revised manuscript. Comments 2 and 3 also require additional experiments, which the authors must seriously consider as they would greatly strengthen the conclusions made in the paper.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The paper is almost entirely dependent on a preparation in which spontaneous synaptic activity is (reasonably) inferred in one neurite and believed to induce RNA transport granule disassembly and RNA translation in that neurite. Thus, it describes a developmental process that may or may not involve mechanisms involved in learning and memory. The manuscript does not make this distinction clear.</p><p>The authors must perform the same experiments with pulsed 5HT stimulation to look at neurotransmitter induced protein synthesis and granule disassembly. This would serve to integrate their observations with an established <italic>Aplysia</italic> literature and link it to previous studies (substantially from the authors' lab) of serotonin-induced translation and synaptic plasticity. In addition, it would allow the authors to make a comparison, in the same preparation, between mechanisms of translational control (including mRNA and RNA granule dynamics) involved in 5HT-induced translation and those associated with spontaneous-activity regulated translation.</p><p>The revised paper should be rewritten to clearly discriminate between translational control events induced by acute 5HT stimulation and those associated with spontaneous activity.</p><p>With respect to the latter, the experiments were performed in young neurons (day 3), did the author analyse additional time points? The outcome might be different according to the developmental stages. This aspect should be discussed.</p><p>2) There is no evidence that netrin is expressed in MNs and that it is normally required for sensorin translation in SN neurites. The experiments presented, including the requirement for DCC, only show that netrin has this potential ability, not that this is its biological role. Can this issue be experimentally addressed? Does netrin have an effect on sensorin translation in MNs as well? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, one potential control experiment for this is to use the DCC antibody to see if the labeling of SN axon by the labeled netrin is based on netrin-DCC binding.</p><p>3) Does <italic>Aplysia</italic> Staufen bind sensorin and EF1alpha mRNA? The authors should also ask if endogenous Staufen behaves similarly to the overexpressed form (ApStaufen-dendra2). These are important points because overexpression of RNA binding proteins very often leads to aggregates formation. Caveats from this complication should be clearly addressed in the text and hopefully through experiments.</p><p>4) Can the authors examine additional mRNAs to see if they are also globally transported in response to synaptic activity?</p><p>5) Six figures to characterize RNA transport and translational in this <italic>Aplysia</italic> preparation seem too many. I think the key data could be safely and better compressed into three figures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04158.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Do note that the major comment 1 must be addressed in the revised manuscript. Comments 2 and 3 also require additional experiments, which the authors must seriously consider as they would greatly strengthen the conclusions made in the paper</italic>.</p><p>We have performed three additional experiments in response to the reviewers’ comments, which we summarize below.</p><p>1) We analyzed the distribution of another localized mRNA in <italic>Aplysia</italic> sensory neurons, encoding β-thymosin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>, like sensorin mRNA, β-thymosin mRNA also distributes equally well to sensory processes contacting target and nontarget motor neurons. These data support the generality of our finding that mRNAs distribute throughout the neuronal arbor rather than being delivered from the nucleus and soma to a specific synaptic target.</p><p>2) We examined the distribution of ApStaufen-dendra2 in bifurcated sensory neurons following local stimulation with 5x5HT. These data, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>–figure supplement, indicate that local stimulation induces an increase in the number of Staufen-containing puncta in the sensory neuron processes, but that there is no difference in the increase between the stimulated and unstimulated branch. Again, these data are consistent with RNAs being delivered throughout the neuronal process following local stimulation.</p><p>3) We incubated cultures of motor neurons expressing ApNetrin-Dendra2 and sensory neurons expressing DCC-mCherry with anti-DCC antibodies (or with IgG as a negative control). These experiments, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10–figure supplement 1</xref>, show that the anti-DCC antibodies greatly reduce the binding of ApNetrin-1-dendra2 to the sensory neurons. This control supports our conclusion that ApNetrin-1 is released from motor neurons and binds to DCC on the sensory neuron.</p><p><italic>Major points</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The paper is almost entirely dependent on a preparation in which spontaneous synaptic activity is (reasonably) inferred in one neurite and believed to induce RNA transport granule disassembly and RNA translation in that neurite. Thus, it describes a developmental process that may or may not involve mechanisms involved in learning and memory. The manuscript does not make this distinction clear</italic>.</p><p>While the <italic>Aplysia</italic> sensory-motor culture system is best known in the context of learning and memory, it also presents many advantages to the study of synapse formation since it is, to our knowledge, the only preparation in which one can culture neurons that 1) do not form chemical autapses and 2) that will fasciculate with but not form chemical synapses with a non-target follower neuron. Several published studies have taken advantage of this phenomenon (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glanzman, et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kandel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montarolo, et al., 1986</xref>) though, as the reviewer points out, certainly not as many as have focused on learning-related synaptic plasticity. We very explicitly set out to study RNA localization and translation in the context of both local synapse formation and local 5HT-induced synaptic plasticity in our study. In particular, our aim was to examine a single neuron with two branches that received localized signals either as a result of synapse formation or as a result of local 5HT stimulation, since we recognized that this allowed us to study more broadly whether and how localized signals received at localized and distal subcellular compartments could regulate the trafficking of mRNAs out of the soma. We understand that the use of both types of preparations may generate some confusion and have done our best to revise the text to more clearly differentiate between the experiments involving synapse formation and those involving plasticity induced by acute 5HT stimulation.</p><p>We would also like to respond to the reviewer's comment here and elsewhere about granule disassembly by pointing out that our methods do not allow us to study granule assembly or disassembly. Rather, our focus is on RNA distribution within the neuron, and on sites of translation. While the biology of RNA granule assembly and disassembly is important and highly relevant to our studies, it is not the focus of our experiments.</p><p><italic>The authors must perform the same experiments with pulsed 5HT stimulation to look at neurotransmitter induced protein synthesis and granule disassembly. This would serve to integrate their observations with an established</italic> Aplysia <italic>literature and link it to previous studies (substantially from the authors' lab) of serotonin-induced translation and synaptic plasticity. In addition, it would allow the authors to make a comparison, in the same preparation, between mechanisms of translational control (including mRNA and RNA granule dynamics) involved in 5HT-induced translation and those associated with spontaneous-activity regulated translation.</italic></p><p>In response to the reviewer’s request that we perform additional experiments with pulsed 5HT stimulation, we have now added an experiment in Figure 4–figure supplement 4 in which we locally perfuse a bifurcated sensory neuron with 5x5HT and examine the localization of ApStaufen-dendra2. We have previously published studies of local translation following local stimulation with 5x5HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang, et al., 2009</xref>) and that data matches the data on local translation during synapse formation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. We refer to these results in the Results section and in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>The revised paper should be rewritten to clearly discriminate between translational control events induced by acute 5HT stimulation and those associated with spontaneous activity</italic>.</p><p><italic>With respect to the latter, the experiments were performed in young neurons (day 3), did the author analyse additional time points? The outcome might be different according to the developmental stages. This aspect should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>In response to the question of whether we have analyzed mRNA localization at other time points, we include data examining sensorin mRNA localization in DIV1 neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>. We have previously published data examining sensorin mRNA localization in DIV5 neurons, and include a discussion of this data in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>2) There is no evidence that netrin is expressed in MNs and that it is normally required for sensorin translation in SN neurites. The experiments presented, including the requirement for DCC, only show that netrin has this potential ability, not that this is its biological role. Can this issue be experimentally addressed? Does netrin have an effect on sensorin translation in MNs as well? In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><italic>Figure 10</italic></xref><italic>, one potential control experiment for this is to use the DCC antibody to see if the labeling of SN axon by the labeled netrin is based on netrin-DCC binding</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer raises an important point concerning the necessity of netrin-1 in promoting sensorin translation. Unfortunately, we have had technical difficulties in assaying netrin-1 expression in single SNs or MNs by FISH. We believe that this is because the RNAs are likely present at low concentrations, since when we overexpress ApNetrin-1, we can detect specific signal by FISH. Consistent with the idea that endogenous ApNetrin-1 (or another DCC ligand) does function to promote translation in sensory neurons, we show that function-blocking DCC antibodies prevent the induction of sensorin translation that is normally observed in SN upon pairing with a MN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). As far as any effect of ApNetrin-1 on sensorin translation in MNs, we note that the MN does not express sensorin mRNA. Finally, we have now performed the experiment suggested by the reviewer, in which we use the DCC antibody to see if the labeling of the SN axon by the labeled netrin is based on netrin-DCC binding. This data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10–figure supplement 1</xref>. Incubation of cultures with anti-DCC antibodies greatly inhibits the labeling of the SN with the ApNetrin expressed in the MN, consistent with ApNetrin binding to DCC on the SN.</p><p><italic>3) Does</italic> Aplysia <italic>Staufen bind sensorin and EF1alpha mRNA? The authors should also ask if endogenous Staufen behaves similarly to the overexpressed form (ApStaufen-dendra2). These are important points because overexpression of RNA binding proteins very often leads to aggregates formation. Caveats from this complication should be clearly addressed in the text and hopefully through experiments.</italic></p><p>We do not know the identity of the mRNAs bound by <italic>Aplysia</italic> Staufen (ApStaufen). Unfortunately, we do not have an antibody that recognizes ApStaufen by immunocytochemistry or immunoprecipitation, and as a result cannot use immunocytochemistry to visualize endogenous ApStaufen or to immunoprecipitate ApStaufen from <italic>Aplysia</italic> CNS to characterize the bound RNAs (which is a tricky experiment even with a good antibody). Further, since we are expressing tagged ApStaufen by microinjection of individual neurons, we cannot perform any biochemical assays to identify the bound mRNAs (since there is not enough starting material). While we hope to generate anti-ApStaufen antibodies in the future that will allow us to perform these experiments, we also think these types of experiments are better done, as they have been, in the mouse, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> systems.</p><p><italic>4) Can the authors examine additional mRNAs to see if they are also globally transported in response to synaptic activity</italic>?</p><p>In response to the request to study other localized RNAs, we now include an analysis of the mRNA encoding β-thymosin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> of the revised manuscript, these experiments show that, like sensorin and EF1α mRNAs, β-thymosin mRNA localizes equally well to SN branches contacting target and nontarget MNs.</p><p><italic>5) Six figures to characterize RNA transport and translational in this</italic> Aplysia <italic>preparation seem too many. I think the key data could be safely and better compressed into three figures.</italic></p><p>We respectfully disagree with the suggestion that we merge the first six figures into three. Each figure makes a distinct point. The first figure focuses on rRNA distribution. The second figure focuses on the localization of constitutively expressed mRNAs during synapse formation. The third figure focuses on the localization of stimulus-induced mRNAs following branch-specific plasticity. The fourth figure focuses on the Staufen RNA binding protein. We believe that it is important to discriminate between these various classes of RNAs by dividing them into distinct figures (each of which is quite complicated on its own), and are concerned that merging them into one might generate more confusion. The fifth figure shows translation, assayed by immunocytochemistry using sensorin and translation factor antibodies, and by using a live reporter to demonstrate that the translation is local. The sixth figure uses ribopuromycylation to show that this local restriction of translation likely involves a large number of mRNAs, which indicates that many RNAs are distributed equally well to SN branches contacting target and nontarget MNs. We could move this to a supplementary figure if the editors and reviewers felt this was important, but again we believe that the data in each figure make important and distinct points.</p></body></sub-article></article>
