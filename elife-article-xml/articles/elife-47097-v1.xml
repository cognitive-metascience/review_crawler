Through analysis of the Polo-like kinase (Plk) family cell-cycle regulators in mice, we show that Plk1’s expression closely mirrors myoblast dynamics during embryonic and postnatal myogenesis. Cell-specific deletion of <italic>Plk1</italic> in embryonic myoblasts leads to depletion of myoblasts, developmental failure and prenatal lethality. Postnatal deletion of <italic>Plk1</italic> in MuSCs does not perturb their quiescence but depletes activated MuSCs as they enter the cell cycle, leading to regenerative failure. The <italic>Plk1</italic>-null MuSCs are arrested at the M-phase, accumulate DNA damage, and apoptose. Mechanistically, <italic>Plk1</italic> deletion upregulates p53, and inhibition of p53 promotes survival of the <italic>Plk1</italic>-null myoblasts. Pharmacological inhibition of Plk1 similarly inhibits proliferation but promotes differentiation of myoblasts in vitro, and blocks muscle regeneration in vivo. These results reveal for the first time an indispensable role of Plk1 in developmental and regenerative myogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47097.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Muscles have their own population of stem cells, called muscle satellite cells. These cells are essential for muscle growth and repair. In healthy adult muscles, they spend most of their time inactive, but when there is an injury, they reawaken and start dividing. Some of the new cells return to an inactive stem cell state to await the next injury. The rest mature into new muscle cells or join with damaged muscle fibres to help them repair.</p><p>The cell cycle is the series of events that a cell goes through from its birth until it divides. In muscle satellite cells, progression through the cell cycle is tightly controlled to ensure they divide and grow the correct amount. One of the proteins responsible for controlling the cell cycle is Polo-Like Kinase 1 (PLK1), but studying this protein is difficult. A common way to investigate a protein's effect is to delete the gene that makes it and observe the consequences. However, PLK1 is so essential to life that yeast, flies, zebrafish and mice all die when the gene is missing. Jia et al. deleted the gene that makes PLK1 only in mouse muscle satellite cells to find out the role this protein plays in controlling the cell cycle in stem cells.</p><p>Deleting the gene that codes for PLK1 before the mice were born was lethal. The embryos failed to develop mature muscle fibres, and they died. But deleting the gene after the mice were born had a different effect. The muscles developed normally, but they were unable to heal when injured. The same healing problem also happened when healthy mice received a drug that blocked the function of PLK1 protein. A closer look at the muscle satellite cells revealed the source of the problem. Without PLK1, the cells got stuck part way through their cell cycle, just before they were due to divide. They tried to become muscle cells, but they did not make it. Instead, the muscle satellite cells started to act as though their DNA had been damaged, and then they self-destructed.</p><p>Muscle satellite cells become less able to divide as we get older. They can also malfunction in some types of degenerative muscle diseases. Understanding how muscle satellite cells control their cell cycle could help us to find out what causes them to go wrong. Further work to understand PLK1 also has potential implications for cancer treatment. PLK1 blockers have been used to stop cancer cells from dividing, but Jia et al.’s findings show that this kind of drug may also hamper the ability of muscle to repair damage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Plk1</kwd><kwd>BI2536</kwd><kwd>satellite cells</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR071649</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yue</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuang</surname><given-names>Shihuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000199</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NC1184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuang</surname><given-names>Shihuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibition of Polo-like kinase that has been shown to exhibit antitumor effect unexpectedly disrupts muscle stem cell function, leading to developmental and regenerative failures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult skeletal muscle has an efficient regenerative capacity in response to muscle injury or physiological stimuli (i.e. intense exercise training). Muscle regeneration relies on a population of muscle resident stem cells, known as muscle satellite cells (MuSCs). These cells are located in a unique niche between the basal lamina and the plasma membrane of myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mauro, 1961</xref>) and remain in a quiescent state until activated by regenerative signals. Upon activation, MuSCs proliferate to generate a pool of myoblasts that eventually return to the quiescent state to replenish the MuSCs pool or differentiate to repair muscle injuries. Thus, cell cycle regulation of MuSCs is critical for precise control of the number of myoblasts that is needed for muscle regeneration. Reduced regenerative capacity was observed when a muscle was exposed to an inhibitor of mitotic division, colchicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pietsch, 1961</xref>) or irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quinlan et al., 1995</xref>). Knockout of <italic>Cdkn1b, Cdkn1c</italic> or <italic>Rb</italic> (negative cell cycle regulators) results in aberrant satellite cell activation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chakkalakal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hosoyama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mademtzoglou et al., 2018</xref>). Positive cell cycle regulators, including cyclin A, B, D, E, F and G, are upregulated in activated MuSCs to regulate cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cenciarelli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Luca et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukada et al., 2007</xref>). Deregulation of cell cycle regulators p16 and p21, and Notch signaling in quiescent MuSCs in old mice leads to proliferative senescence, accumulation of DNA damage, mitotic catastrophe and high frequency of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The polo-like kinases (PLKs) are a conserved subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases that play pivotal roles in cell cycle regulation. The PLK family contains five members (PLK1-5) in mammals, all except for PLK5 contain an amino-terminal Ser/Thr kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Archambault and Glover, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Cárcer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu, 2015</xref>). Among the PLK kinases, PLK1 is the most conserved and best known for its role in mitosis via phosphorylation of different substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 2004</xref>). PLK1 also participates in modulating DNA replication and DNA damage checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takaki et al., 2008</xref>). Overexpression of PLK1 is observed in several human tumors, including prostate and ovarian cancers, and muscle cell-derived rhabdomyosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hugle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Vugt and Medema, 2005</xref>). Inhibition of PLK1 by small interfering RNA or pharmacological inhibitors exerts antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo, providing strong preclinical and clinical support for the use of PLK1 inhibitors in cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Degenhardt and Lampkin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lens et al., 2010</xref>). Outside the cancer field, the role of PLK1 in normal mitotic cells especially stem cells are poorly understood. As <italic>Plk1</italic> gene deletion leads to embryonic lethality in mice, zebrafish, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohkura et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sunkel and Glover, 1988</xref>), conditional deletion of <italic>Plk1</italic> is necessary to understand its tissue or cell-type-specific functions. In this study, we used myogenic cell-specific targeted mutation to show that Plk1 is absolutely required for mitosis and survival of myogenic cells during muscle development and regeneration in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Plk1</italic> is dynamically expressed during muscle regeneration and myogenesis</title><p>To establish the relevance of Polo-like kinases in myogenesis, we surveyed the expression of Plk1–Plk4 (Plk5 was not surveyed as it does not have a kinase domain) at various time points during CTX-induced muscle regeneration. Activation and proliferation of MuSCs peaks at 3 days post injury (DPI), and the overall architecture of the muscle is restored by 10 DPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">CHARGÉ and Rudnicki, 2004</xref>). The mRNA levels of <italic>Plk1</italic>, <italic>Plk3</italic>, and <italic>Plk4</italic> were all transiently up-regulated after muscle injury, reaching peak expression levels at 3 DPI and returning to the preinjury levels at 10 DPI, but <italic>Plk1</italic> exhibited the most prominent fold change (increased by &gt;13 fold) at 3 DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The expression pattern of Plk1 corresponded to those of myogenic transcriptional factors Pax7 and MyoG at both mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) levels. We also surveyed the mRNA levels of <italic>Plk1-4</italic> during differentiation of primary myoblasts isolated from limb muscles.

BI2536 treatment (injection of 50 μl into the TA muscle at a final dosage of 0.4 μg/g body weight) significantly inhibited regeneration of CTX-injured muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

The cell-cycle-dependent expression pattern suggests a key role of Plk1 in regulating metaphase progression of MuSCs. To further determine cell cycle defects of Plk1 KO MuSCs, we analyzed proliferation of MuSCs attached on cultured EDL myofibers. After 3 days of culture, the WT MuSCs formed clusters of 6–8 myoblasts on the myofibers. However, MuSCs from Plk1<sup>PKO</sup> mice failed to complete the cytokinesis and were arrested at mitosis stage, evident from the dispersed distribution of nuclear Pax7 and MyoD signals surrounding metaphase and telophase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The numbers of myoblasts were also significantly decreased on the Plk1<sup>PKO</sup> relative to WT myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

WB analysis showed that p53 protein level was massively elevated in <italic>Plk1</italic> KO myoblasts compared to control myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).

Although Plk1 has been shown to play an indispensable role in cell cycle and mitotic progression of non-myogenic cell types especially cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 2004</xref>), its function in MuSCs and myogenesis has not been investigated. Here, we identify an irreplaceable role of Plk1 in controlling MuSC proliferation. Specifically, we found that <italic>Plk1</italic>-deficient MuSCs lose their proliferative capacity, accumulate marks of DNA damage response and undergo apoptosis without completing mitosis, leading to failure of muscle development and defective muscle regeneration in response to injury.</p><p>PLK1 is highly expressed in various human tumors and proliferating cells during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Vugt and Medema, 2005</xref>). Our findings extend this feature to the adult stem cells and demonstrate that Plk1 activity synchronizes with the proliferative ability of MuSCs. Previous studies have reported that constitutive deletion of <italic>Plk1</italic> leads to embryonic lethality at morula stage (E3.5) due to mitotic aberrancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wachowicz et al., 2016</xref>). Similar mitotic defects were also observed in our myogenic progenitor-specific <italic>Plk1</italic> KO mice, which died prenatally due to failure in muscle development. Compared to our model, <italic>Pax7<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice exhibit progressive loss of the MuSC lineage with reduced muscle size, myonuclei number and myofiber diameters, leading to poor viability and early death within the first 3 weeks of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seale et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>Myf5</italic> and <italic>MyoD</italic> double knockout mice, but not the <italic>Myf5</italic> or <italic>MyoD</italic> single knockout mice, show complete lack of skeletal muscle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rudnicki et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rudnicki et al., 1993</xref>). <italic>Myogenin</italic>-null mice die after birth from severe and global muscle deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hasty et al., 1993</xref>). Our myogenic progenitor specific <italic>Plk1</italic> KO mice die earlier than these KO mice lacking one of the key myogenic transcription factors, demonstrating an indispensable role of Plk1 in embryonic muscle development.</p><p>Activation of MuSCs is a crucial step for muscle regeneration. Evidence shows that a lack of MuSCs contributes to defective regeneration and muscle weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>). Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that blockage of cell proliferation by colchicine treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pietsch, 1961</xref>) or irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quinlan et al., 1995</xref>) drastically reduces muscle regenerative capacity. In addition, MuSCs function is also controlled by various signals in the local microenvironment, called stem cell niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuang et al., 2008</xref>). This niche consists of various cells and extracellular factors that function to regulate MuSCs during muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuang et al., 2008</xref>). Our study identifies Plk1 as an intrinsic regulator of MuSCs, but what extrinsic factors regulate the dynamic expression of <italic>Plk1</italic> remains to be elucidated. It is reported that ~ 50% reduction of MuSCs induced by <italic>Pten</italic> deletion could sufficiently maintain muscle regeneration, and muscle regeneration fails only when the SC population drops to 10% or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yue et al., 2017</xref>). In our model, MuSCs-specific <italic>Plk1</italic> deletion only leads to ~30% reduction in MuSCs, yet the remainder 70% MuSCs fail to regenerate the injured muscle after CTX injury due to cell cycle arrest. This leads to infiltration of fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), macrophages and adipocytes that occupy the muscle after CTX-induced regeneration. These results highlight the absolute requirement of Plk1 in cell cycle progression of <italic>Pax7</italic>-expressing MuSCs during regenerative myogenesis.</p><p>PLKs are key regulators of many cell-cycle-related events, including chromosome segregation, centrosome maturation, bipolar spindle formation, regulation of anaphase-promoting complex, and execution of cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 2004</xref>). Conditional knockout of <italic>Plk1</italic> leads to defective polyploidization and cell death in megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trakala et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Plk1</italic> inhibition also prevented pancreatic β cell proliferation and G2/M cell-cycle phase progression in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shirakawa et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to proliferative defects, <italic>Plk1</italic>-null MuSCs also undergo apoptosis. This observation is consistent with previous reports that <italic>Plk1</italic> depletion induces apoptosis in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Erikson, 2003</xref>). During normal mitosis processes, if DNA damages are detected a signaling cascade will be initiated to enforce cell cycle arrest (checkpoint activation), followed by DNA repair process. If DNA repair fails or if excessive DNA lesions are accumulated, an apoptosis process will be triggered. Phosphorylated H2AX could form nuclear foci within 1 min at the sites of DNA double-strand breaks and thus represents a sensitive marker of DNA damages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paull et al., 2000</xref>). Here, we reported that after <italic>Plk1</italic> deletion, most MuSCs exhibit robust γH2AX signal, suggesting that a failure of DNA repair may underpin the observed cell death.</p><p>Previous work has also shown that PLK1 plays a crucial role during recovery from G<sub>2</sub> DNA damage checkpoint through targeting multiple factors such as ATR/Chk1, ATM/Chk2 and p53 pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassermann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>). We show that pharmacological inhibition of p53 or ATM/ATR significantly increases the apoptosis of wildtype myoblasts, potentially due to inhibition of p53 and ATM-dependent DNA damage response. The Plk1-null cells also underwent apoptosis, manifested by markers of activated Caspase-3, DNA damage response (γH2AX), DNA fragmentation and TUNNEL labeling. Previous studies have shown that the DNA damage response and activation of Caspase-3 are key steps in myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burgon and Megeney, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernando et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fortini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larsen et al., 2010</xref>). In agreement with this concept, we also found that pharmacological inhibitions of Plk1 activates Caspase-3 and promotes myogenic differentiation. However, the <italic>Plk1</italic>-null myoblasts fail to express the myogenic differentiation marker myogenin despite activation of Caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), due to the cell cycle blockage and apoptosis prior to terminal differentiation. These results demonstrate that cell cycle-dependent dynamic regulation Plk1 is key for MuSC proliferation and differentiation. <italic>PLK1</italic> knockout in tumor cells induces DNA damage and causes p53 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Erikson, 2003</xref>), but activated p53 could also transactivate proapoptotic genes, leading to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Erikson, 2003</xref>). This explains why p53 inhibition partially rescues apoptosis of <italic>Plk1</italic>-null myoblasts that express high levels of p53. Our results demonstrate that a proper level of p53 is critical for MuSC homeostasis. Indeed, it has been reported that regeneration-induced loss of quiescence in <italic>p53</italic>-deficient MuSCs results in tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Preussner et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, lower levels of p53 is observed in aged MuSCs that exhibit a high frequency of cell death in the transient expansion phase of muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>PLK1 is highly expressed in several cancer types, and thus represents a druggable target in cancer therapeutics. BI2536, one of the most effective Plk1 inhibitors, induces apoptosis of rhabdomyosarcoma cells when synergistically used with microtubule-destabilizing drugs, but a low dose of BI2536 (7 nM) has no effect on C2C12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hugle et al., 2015</xref>). Consistently, we report that low dose of BI2536 (1–10 nM) have no effect on the proliferation of MuSCs-derived primary myoblasts. However, BI2526 treatment profoundly inhibits MuSCs function during muscle regeneration, cautioning the potential side effect of PLK1 inhibition in skeletal muscle homeostasis and cancer cachexia. Impaired regenerative ability has been well-established in aged muscle owing in part to decreased number and functionality of MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jang et al., 2011</xref>), including defective dividing capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) and quiescent maintenance failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>). Similar aging features were observed in our <italic>Plk1</italic> null or BI2536 treated MuSCs, suggesting that increasing Plk1 activity may preserve functions of MuSCs in aged muscle.</p></sec><sec

Mice were anesthetized using a ketamine-xylazine cocktail, and 50 μl saline or 50 μl of 10 μM CTX was injected into TA muscles in the absence or presence of 10 μg BI2536. Muscles were then harvested at different days post-injection to assess the completion of regeneration, repair and gene expression. Tamoxifen (Calbiochem) was prepared in corn oil at a concentration of 10 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>, and experimental and control mice were injected intraperitoneally at 2 mg per day per 20 g body weight for 5 days to induce Cre-mediated deletion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Isolation, culture and differentiation of primary myoblast</title><p>Primary myoblasts were isolated from hind limb skeletal muscle of 6-week-old male mice as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yue et al., 2017</xref>). Muscle tissues were minced and digested in type II collagenase and Dispase B mixture (Roche). Digested cells were harvested and cultured in growth media, F-10 Ham’s medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta), 4 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on collagen-coated dishes. Primary myoblasts were isolated and purified after 2–3 times of pre-plate. For in vitro genetic deletion, 4-OHT (0.4 μM, Calbiochem) was added in culture medium for 1 day to induce Cre-mediated deletion. P53 (Pifithrin-α, Sigma) and ATM/ATR (CGK733, Sigma) inhibitor were used according to the manufactory’s protocol and treated the myoblast together with 4-OHT or Methanol. Muscle differentiation was induced using 80% confluence of isolated primary myoblasts in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma,) supplemented with 2% horse serum (Sigma). Differentiated cells were kept in differentiation media for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Flow cytometry analysis</title><p>The amount of DNA present in the cell was detected by Flow cytometry using propidium iodide (PI) staining.

Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>We are in the process of discussing the reviews. Before advising further and reaching a final decision, we would like to hear your response to the following concerns as provided by each reviewer, along with an estimated time frame for completing any additional work. Each reviewer has raised concerns regarding improved image quality and quantification for the same set of figures, along with additional experimentation to substantiate the conclusions as written. Of note, determining the fate of the Plk null cells and the cell cycle work described in Figures 5 and 6 was raised by all reviewers as being insufficient and will require additional analysis (as outlined) to buttress the conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript of Jia et al. examines the role of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) in skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Notable strides have been made over the preceding decade in uncovering mechanisms that regulate MuSC commitment and differentiation, yet the regulatory controls that manage MuSC proliferation and survival remain largely unknown. Here, Jia et al. report that MuSC display a robust and transient spike in Plk1 expression, coincident to MuSC activation and proliferation (Figures 1 and 2). Subsequently, the authors conduct a series of intervention experiments to ascribe biologic function to Plk1 (Figures 3-7). Most of these experiments provide compelling outcomes, demonstrating that Plk1 is essential for the survival of both embryonic skeletal myoblasts and adult MuSCs (Figure 5-6), and that this survival mechanism operates (in part) through p53 upregulation (Figure 7). The data linking Plk1 to cell cycle progression is suggestive and fits with prior observations in the cancer field, yet this data is not as compelling as the pro-survival role characterized by the authors (see below for further discussion on this point). Taken together, this is an important set of observations that would be of considerable interest to skeletal muscle biologists and those that study cell survival/cell death in stem cell populations. However, at this stage there are a number of concerns the authors need to address to strengthen the conclusions as stated.</p><p>1) A reasonable conclusion that could be drawn from this data is that the primary function of Plk1 is to restrain caspase activation that occurs during MuSC differentiation (others have shown that caspase 3 activation is required for MuSc differentiation). This is entirely reasonable based on the data (and that fact that DNA damage has also been reported to be a downstream requirement of caspase induced differentiation, Larsen et al., 2010). As such, loss of Plk1 may 'release the brakes' on caspase 3, resulting in cell death rather than cell differentiation. Other kinases such as CK2 have been shown to act in this manner. The authors should include expanded discussion of this point in the manuscript.</p><p>2) As noted above the role of Plk1 in MuSC cell cycle progression is not compelling. In fact, the alteration in cell numbers may simply be the result of a change in cell survival (there are more cells because of the survival effect rather than true cell cycle progression). One way to address this issue would be to conduct a double thymidine block/release experiment on wildtype and Plk1 null cells and then measure thymidine incorporation, H2AX staining and comet assays over time. This would at least clarify the degree to which Plk1 influences survival vs. proliferation.</p><p>3) Given the concerns that caspase activity and DNA damage can mark differentiating cells as well as apoptotic cells, the authors need to include a more definitive cell death marker that is not open to interpretation. Annexin V/PI dual staining is a conclusive cell death measure and should be performed in a number of the experimental settings (primarily Figure 6). On this point, including FACS mediated PI staining as a measure of DNA content is misleading as it may be documenting dead cells rather than increased numbers of surviving cells (Figure 5F).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>A study examining the role of Plk1 in skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) uses a combination of conditional ko mice, cultured cells and Plk1 inhibitors to attempt to establish that Plk1 is essential for myoblast proliferation and thus, required for skeletal muscle development and skeletal muscle regeneration.

To fully support the conclusions made, additional experiments are needed. A further concern is that figures are incompletely labeled, figure legends are missing descriptions and required data are not provided including mouse sex, ages of mice or injury details. Throughout the manuscript there are mistakes, references to SCs that I assume means satellite cells and MuSCs that I assume are skeletal muscle stem cells. The authors should be consistent throughout to avoid confusion for the non-expert readers and carefully read and assess the text and legends for agreement, wording and typographical errors that are too numerous to address individually in the review.</p><p>For Figure 2 the authors claim that higher signal intensity of Plk1 colocalized to MyoD (subsection “Plk1 is dynamically expressed during muscle regeneration and myogenesis”, last paragraph). The image quality provided is insufficient to make this conclusion and no quantitative analyses were performed to substantiate this claim. Even though mRNA levels are higher in activated MuSCs the relationship of mRNA levels to protein abundance is complex and indirect.</p><p>I fail to understand how the authors conclude that Plk1 is necessary for Pax7 cell survival as Pax7 precedes MyoD (subsection “Loss of Plk1 in myogenic progenitors leads to embryonic lethality”, last paragraph). In Plk<sup>MKO</sup> mice Plk1 is deleted upon MyoD expression and thus, determining a relationship between Plk1 and Pax7 is simply not possible. Similarly, in the aforementioned paragraph the claim that loss of Plk1 blocks proliferation and survival lacks the accompanying data to support the claim. The absence of MuSCs does not prove that Plk1 is necessary for survival. Furthermore, there appears to be muscle tissue in Figures 3C, 4B and 4D but the selected images are not accompanied by quantitative analyses that could include PCR or Western blots to confirm that no skeletal muscle is present and better support the authors' conclusions.</p><p>The data in Figure 4E are concerning as Pax7 immunoreactivity (red) is present in the interstitial areas, inside of myofibers, contained within nuclei and excluded from nuclei. Pax7 immunoreactivity is exclusively nuclear and while Pax7<sup>+</sup> nuclei can be found in the interstitium and within myofibers during regeneration, there appears to be more Pax7 immunoreactivity outside of nuclei than contained within nuclei. In addition to Dystrophin immunoreactivity, the authors need to visualize Laminin to appropriately identify the MuSCs. The concerns noted for the immunofluorescence images question the validity of the quantitative data provided.</p><p>In the second paragraph of the subsection “Deletion of Plk1 impairs muscle regeneration in adult mice”, the authors make the claim that the absence of Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells in the Plk1<sup>PKO</sup> mice is due to proliferative failure. The cells are absent and without additional data I find it difficult to determine how the authors made this conclusion from the mere absence of cells. The inhibitor experiments that follow using BI2536 add little to the conclusions as the inhibitor will affect all cells that contain Plk1, which may comprise many different cell types in muscle tissue. In the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, the authors again state that Plk1 regulates proliferation with no supporting data but refer to Supplementary figure 3, whose legend does not describe the panels provided. The lack of adequate figure descriptions is particularly frustrating as the colors in the figure used for distinct immunoreactivity are not provided either in the figure itself or in the legend. I am not able to adequately interpret the figure.</p><p>Cells are stated to be synchronized for Figure 5 by a thymidine block, however, data to prove or support that the cells are indeed synchronized are not provided. How long do the cultures remain synchronized? What is the extent of synchronization? In Figure 5B is difficult to determine that the cells are on intact myofibers, the image quality is poor and in the lowest panel white is not defined and cannot be readily interpreted. For Figure 5F a complete cell cycle analysis is needed and not simply cells that are in G2/M. Has the timing of the cell cycle changed in the conditional ko cells? Again, I fail to understand how the data provided in Figure 5G confirm that the PKO cells undergo cell cycle arrest at mitosis. How have the authors determined whether or not cells are cycling from the data in this panel? I assume errors in the figure legend means arrows in the figure. Does methanol &quot;induction&quot; cause cell cycle arrest as well?</p><p>For Figure 6A the authors claim that 4OHT treatment causes all cells to apoptose based on Cas3 immunoreactivity. As there are only one or two cells that are Cas3<sup>+</sup> in the figure how can the authors make the conclusions stated in the subsection “Plk1-null MuSCs apoptose”, for Figure 6B? Although the TUNEL labeling aids to support the conclusions regarding apoptosis, the authors should not publish Caspase 3 immunoreactivity as they clearly acknowledge that Caspase 3 is required for differentiation. Thus, despite the arguments made and the apparent lack of Myogenin immunoreactivity (Figure 6—figure supplement 1, lacking quantification) the rationale for using Caspase 3 is insufficient. in the aforementioned subsection, the authors state that all cells are Caspase 3 positive or TUNEL positive (Figure 6C-F) yet if one examines the panels provided there is a great deal of variability raising concerns that 100% of all cells are positive.</p><p>Without exhaustive details, overall, the quality of data in Figure 7 are insufficient to support the authors' conclusions, particularly those in panels A, B, and G. The inhibitor experiments are an initial method to support the conclusions, but the role of p53 would be best supported by a genetic experiment as a p53 heterozygous mouse should partially rescue the Plk1<sup>PKO</sup> phenotype during muscle regeneration.</p><p>In summary, the rather low quality of many images, the lack of rigor in the text (the Supplementary figure 3 legend is wrong) missing labels in figures, and the lack of quantification in the data fail to support the authors' conclusions and provide a high level of frustration for me attempting to interpret data without adequate descriptions and labeling. Additional experimental details are lacking including the sex of mice, the precise ages as in 8 week old mice MuSCs are still fusing into myofibers, while in 12 wk old mice the fusion is at levels that have plateaued. In the injury experiments it is often unclear how long after CTX injection the muscle was harvested.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript reports the function of Plk1 in muscle satellite cells both in developing and regenerating muscle.

This is entirely reasonable based on the data (and that fact that DNA damage has also been reported to be a downstream requirement of caspase induced differentiation, Larsen et al., 2010). As such, loss of Plk1 may 'release the brakes' on caspase 3, resulting in cell death rather than cell differentiation. Other kinases such as CK2 have been shown to act in this manner. The authors should include expanded discussion of this point in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>That’s a great point. We have now provided new data to support the potential role of Plk1 inhibition induced Caspase-3 activation in promoting myogenic differentiation. While deletion of Plk1 during proliferation stage leads to cell death and precludes the opportunity to examine its effect in differentiation, we found that inhibition of Plk1 kinase activity using BI2536 promotes myogenic differentiation. We included these data in Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and also added discussion in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As noted above the role of Plk1 in MuSC cell cycle progression is not compelling. In fact, the alteration in cell numbers may simply be the result of a change in cell survival (there are more cells because of the survival effect rather than true cell cycle progression). One way to address this issue would be to conduct a double thymidine block/release experiment on wildtype and Plk1 null cells and then measure thymidine incorporation, H2AX staining and comet assays over time. This would at least clarify the degree to which Plk1 influences survival vs. proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>From the single fiber culture in Figure 5B and Figure 6A, B, all the Plk1-null MuSCs lost the ability to proliferate, stopped before completing the first division and die within 72h (also quantified in Figure 5—figure supplement 1). As suggested, we have now performed the double thymidine block/release experiment on wildtype and Plk1 null cells (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A-B).

Our new results shown that Plk1-null myoblasts indeed are mostly labeled by the Annexin V, while the control cells were mostly negative. We agree that PI staining is a common method to distinguish live and dead cells as live cells exclude PI and thus make them unlabeled, while dead cells are positively labeled. However, our study used PI on fixed dead cells, where all cells are labeled and the labeling intensity correlates to DNA content. This is a commonly used method for FACS based determination DNA content in fixed cells. We also performed TUNEL Assay as a readout of apoptosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>A study examining the role of Plk1 in skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) uses a combination of conditional ko mice, cultured cells and Plk1 inhibitors to attempt to establish that Plk1 is essential for myoblast proliferation and thus, required for skeletal muscle development and skeletal muscle regeneration.

Our original statement was not accurate, and we meant to say that Plk1 signal was co-localized to MyoD signal. We replaced the images with a higher magnification one and rephrased the statement. We also counted over 200 cells on myofibers cultured for 72h, all Plk1<sup>+</sup> cells were also MyoD<sup>+</sup>.

The absence of MuSCs does not prove that Plk1 is necessary for survival.

Reading this statement again, without the results that were shown later in the manuscript, we agree that the sentence is misleading. We also agree that there were no data to directly support “proliferation and survival” here. We have therefore reworded this phrase as “Plk1 is necessary for the generation or maintenance of embryonic myoblasts”.</p><p>To answer the second part regarding whether there is muscle tissue in Figures 3C, 4B and 4D, we must first clarify that these figures are from two different mice models. In the Plk1<sup>MKO</sup> mice, Plk1 is deleted in MyoD-expressing embryonic myoblasts. Figure 3C is based on this model and we do not see any eMyHC marked myotubes (shown in Figure 3D, from the same limbs shown in Figure 3C). The second model is Plk1<sup>PKO</sup> mice, in which Plk1 is deleted in Pax7-expressing cells when tamoxifen or 4-OH-Tamoxifen is administered. Figure 4B and Figure 4D are from the latter mouse model in which muscles were allowed to develop normally and then tamoxifen was administered to delete Plk1 only in the Pax7<sup>+</sup> satellite cells. Again, we don’t see any central nucleated dystrophin+ myofibers (Figure 4E) that were regenerated after degeneration of the original muscles prior to deletion of Plk1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data in Figure 4E are concerning as Pax7 immunoreactivity (red) is present in the interstitial areas, inside of myofibers, contained within nuclei and excluded from nuclei.

To ensure scientific rigor, our quantification only include the nuclear signals (i.e. DAPI and Pax7 double positive signals), and all non-nuclear signals were excluded in the quantification.

The host myofbers were not seen as they are out of focus. The white channel in Figure 5B represents the DAPI staining and we added the label in revised manuscript. We also performed analyses at more time points after double thymidine block to pinpoint defects prior to G2/M, but stages after G2/M is impossible as the KO cells don’t seem to pass that time point. In Figure 5F, we used PI staining to show cells containing doubled DNA content suggestive of completion of S-phase. In Figure 5G, the white arrows indicate cells containing unsegregated chromosomes, which were more abundant in KO cells than control (methanol treated) cells.
