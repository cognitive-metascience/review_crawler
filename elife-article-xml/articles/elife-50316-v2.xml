food by animals is key to their survival. It has been proposed that diverse animals from insects to sharks and humans adopt searching patterns that resemble a simple Lévy random walk, which is theoretically optimal for ‘blind foragers’ to locate sparse, patchy resources. To test if such patterns are generated intrinsically, or arise via environmental interactions, we tracked free-moving <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae with (and without) blocked synaptic activity in the brain, suboesophageal ganglion (SOG) and sensory neurons. In brain-blocked larvae, we found that extended substrate exploration emerges as multi-scale movement paths similar to truncated Lévy walks. Strikingly, power-law exponents of brain/SOG/sensory-blocked larvae averaged 1.96, close to a theoretical optimum (<italic>µ</italic> ≅ 2.0) for locating sparse resources. Thus, efficient spatial exploration can emerge from autonomous patterns in neural activity. Our results provide the strongest evidence so far for the intrinsic generation of Lévy-like movement patterns.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>levy walk</kwd><kwd>exploration</kwd><kwd>central pattern generator</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105568/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berni</surname><given-names>Jimena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105568/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berni</surname><given-names>Jimena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002923</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT 20121578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medan</surname><given-names>Violeta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000270</institution-id><institution>Natural Environment Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Oceans 2025 Strategic Research Programme</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sims</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000655</institution-id><institution>Marine Biological Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sims</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The nervous system circuitry that controls locomotion has evolved to intrinsically generate an optimal search pattern for resources.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The generation of rhythmic patterns of movement is a key feature of behaviours that are conserved across the animal kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ijspeert, 2008</xref>). Central pattern generators (CPGs) are motor neural circuits capable of generating rhythmic activity when activated that require no sensory or descending inputs of phasic timing information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ijspeert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berni, 2015</xref>). However, complex sequences of behaviour entirely organised within the nervous system without the need for sensory inputs from environmental influences or sensory feedback during its course are seemingly rare in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Slater, 1999</xref>). For instance, finding resources requires efficient movement through complex environments and is an ability key to animal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ijspeert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sims et al., 2008</xref>). Foraging, in which an animal searches widely to obtain food resources, is one such complex sequence of behaviour, comprising physiological, sensory and cognitive processes modified in response to environmental fluctuations. Apparently complex patterns of behaviour can potentially arise from simple movement ‘rules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sims et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maye et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wearmouth et al., 2014</xref>), however it remains unknown whether autonomous movements resulting in spatial exploration could result in optimal searches.</p><p>Autonomous generation of movement patterns that are optimal for finding resources should be advantageous in naïve and inexperienced animals. It has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maye et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wearmouth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kölzsch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Humphries et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Jager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sims, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reynolds, 2015</xref>) that foraging patterns described by apparent Lévy random walks in freely moving animals may represent intrinsically generated behaviour that is exhibited when a searcher has incomplete information about resource location, such as when there is an absence of external clues or cues, or no information about the environment provided by memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sims et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, where there is a lack of knowledge about resource location, autonomously generated search programs based on Lévy walks may represent efficient patterns to adopt until clues and cues are encountered by moving.</p><p>A Lévy random-walk search pattern can be generated by drawing displacements (move steps) from a probability distribution with a heavy power-law tail, such that <italic>P</italic>(<italic>l</italic>)~<italic>l <sup>-µ</sup></italic>, with 1 &lt; <italic>µ</italic> ≤ 3 where <italic>l</italic> is the move step length between turns and <italic>µ</italic> the power law exponent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). A Lévy walk iterated over many time intervals will be distributed much further from its starting position than a Brownian walk of the same length because small-step ‘walk clusters’ are interspersed by long ‘steps’ to new locations, with this pattern repeating across all scales resulting in a fractal pattern of walk clusters with no characteristic scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sims et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reynolds, 2018</xref>). Theory predicts that Lévy walk search strategies are optimal where resources are sparse and distributed unpredictably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Viswanathan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Viswanathan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Humphries and Sims, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wosniack et al., 2015</xref>) – such as in uncertain or dynamic environments where the spatial scaling patterns of search behaviour cannot be tuned to target distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reynolds, 2018</xref>) – whereas Brownian (exponential) walks are sufficiently efficient when resources are highly abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Viswanathan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Viswanathan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Humphries and Sims, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wosniack et al., 2015</xref>). However, a Lévy walk with an inverse square power-law distribution of move steps (<italic>µ</italic> ~2) is optimal across a very broad range of resource distributions and abundances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Humphries and Sims, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wosniack et al., 2015</xref>). Because Lévy walks can optimise search efficiencies in this way, it has been proposed that natural selection should have led to adaptations for Lévy walk foraging [the Lévy foraging (LF) hypothesis] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sims et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Viswanathan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Viswanathan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Viswanathan et al., 2008</xref>).

However, the origin of apparent Lévy-like behaviour is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sims, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sims et al., 2014</xref>) and remains contentious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reynolds, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reynolds, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Viswanathan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benhamou, 2007</xref>), not least because a candidate generative mechanism for Lévy movement has not been identified unequivocally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kölzsch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Jager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reynolds, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sims et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Testing for Lévy-like search patterns in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva tracks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Computer simulated path with Lévy-distributed move step lengths (truncated power-law exponent, <italic>µ</italic> = 2.0) between turning points.

While it is not expected that Lévy-like movement will be temporally ubiquitous in animal behaviour, since it is only advantageous when searching with incomplete information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sims et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Viswanathan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Humphries and Sims, 2014</xref>), recent studies have hypothesised two principal mechanisms to account for Lévy movement patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sims, 2015</xref>): it arises from (i) endogenous neurophysiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maye et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wearmouth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kölzsch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Humphries et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Jager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sims et al., 2014</xref>) resulting in behavioural adaptations to different resource distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sims et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Humphries et al., 2010</xref>) – the intrinsic hypothesis; or that (ii) sensory interactions of animals moving along straighter, ballistic type paths in fractal environments, for example, power-law distributions of resource patches, give rise to Lévy patterns as an emergent phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reynolds, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reynolds, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyer et al., 2006</xref>) – the extrinsic hypothesis. Nevertheless, there have been no studies to date that have unequivocally tested both hypotheses in the same model organism.</p><p>Our ability to specifically and acutely manipulate neuronal activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae during a spatial exploration sequence makes it a suitable model for testing the Lévy foraging hypothesis and to explore its mechanisms. Here, we used two transgenic lines of flies: BL (for brain lobes) in which the brain and part of the SOG function can be acutely and reversibly impaired in free-moving larvae, and BLsens (for BL and sensory), which allows us to block the brain lobes, the SOG and all somatosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berni, 2015</xref>). Movements in these larvae comprise sequences of forward peristaltic contractions (crawls) interspersed with pauses and reorientations (turns) in which the brain and part of the SOG are not required for normal performance of an exploratory routine; patterns are produced by autonomous activity of the thoracic and abdominal nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berni, 2015</xref>). Because the BL line may not be expressed in all neurons, we performed electrophysiology experiments to evaluate the strength of neuronal activity blockade. We also tested a transgenic line specific for the mushroom body, MB247 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pauls et al., 2010</xref>), to determine the potential contribution of cholinergic neurons from this structure of the brain in free-moving larvae. Finally, to confirm the results obtained affecting activity in the brain lobes, SOG and sensory system, we induced neuronal death expressing the proapoptotic genes (rpr and hid) with the BLsens line.</p><p>We used this model system to test whether extended substrate exploration of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae is an intrinsic, spontaneous pattern resembling a Lévy search in the absence of exteroception and proprioception.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded movement paths of individual larva using high-resolution video tracking extending for 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>) (Materials and methods). A Kalman filter used for track smoothing to reduce effects of video tracking errors combined with computation of track step lengths reconstructed the larva movement paths reliably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; see Materials and methods). Across all controls and treatments in this study 658 larva tracks were recorded; 187 (28.4 %) did not meet the criteria required for reliable track analysis to support testing of the Lévy foraging hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Humphries et al., 2013</xref>) and were discarded prior to track modelling analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The criteria for discarding individual larva tracks were: (i) tracks with fewer than 200 move steps (126 tracks), or (ii) tracks where the larva interacted with the arena edge (e.g. travelled along it; 52 tracks), or (iii) where no computed steps were longer than the 0.44 mm minimum resolution for a step length (nine tracks) (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Humphries et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> provides illustrations of the track processing for an example track with the detailed analysis of the turning behaviour.

Therefore, BL/+, <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic>/+ and MB247/+ larvae (without synaptic blockade) moving for up to 1 hr time periods in larger environments with minimal exposure to external cues at the higher (restrictive) temperature of 33°C, exhibited movement patterns with Lévy-like characteristics that were similar to those of larvae at 22°C.</p><p>Furthermore, we also found that the turn angle distribution for all individual larva paths that were best fitted by truncated power-laws showed a near uniform distribution of large turn angles (50 and 175<sup>o</sup>, left or right) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), a characteristic consistent with the uniform random turn-angle distribution (i.e. where all turn angles have equal probability) expected in a pure, idealised Lévy random walk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Viswanathan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartumeus et al., 2005</xref>). The presence of some directional persistence in our larva tracks (higher frequency of turn angles around 0<sup>o</sup>) indicates some short-range angle correlations. However, it has been widely demonstrated that the efficiencies of random Lévy walk searches remain robust to the presence of short-range correlations in directional persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartumeus et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Viswanathan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">da Luz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raposo et al., 2003</xref>).

Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sims et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Jager et al., 2012</xref>) have identified that spatially nested composite Brownian (CB) walks may have parameters finely tuned to Lévy walks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reynolds, 2015</xref>). To investigate this further, we compared larvae move-step distributions with three composite Brownian (CB) walk distributions comprising proportions of two, three, and four exponential distributions (CB2, CB3 and CB4; Materials and methods). Comparing truncated power-law, power, exponential and the three CB walks within the model set demonstrates that 13% of BL/+ larvae move-step distributions (8 of 63 distributions) were best fit by second or third-order CB walks, with two tracks (3.2%) best fit by pure power laws. In contrast, in <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic>/+ larvae 92% of move step distributions (36 of 39 distributions) were best fit by a pure or truncated power law, with three best fit by second or third or CB walks. Similarly, 85% of BL &gt;<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> distributions (22 of 26 distributions) were best fit by truncated power laws over exponential and second, third or fourth order CB walks, with 4 (15%) best fit by a CB2 distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). This suggests that BL/+ movements were typified by Lévy-like patterns resembling multi-scale and hierarchically nested Brownian walk clusters, confirming the results found from the tortuosity analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), but less extensive in terms of a repeating pattern across increasing scales shown by the <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic>/+ and BL &gt;<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> larvae. The strong support within the model set for truncated power laws in BL &gt;<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> larvae combined with a higher power law exponent may indicate a fundamental difference whereby the lack of brain and SOG inputs may alter movements in such a way as to more closely approximate optimal Lévy-like walks.</p><p>The mushroom body is the main associative centre in insects for processing sensory information of several modalities ultimately contributing to the selection of appropriate behavioural outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erber et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schürmann, 1987</xref>).

Long-range correlations in MSD of BLsens &gt; <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> larvae trajectories were present with α ~1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). As with the BL/+ and BL &gt;<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> larvae, we also found the frequency distributions of straightness index cluster sizes were best fit by truncated power laws over a mean of 1.4 orders of magnitude of the data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, 55% of tracks were best fit to truncated or pure power laws rather than exponential or composite Brownian walks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), similar to the results found for BL &gt;<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> larvae.</p><p>To validate our results we used a second approach; instead of blocking synaptic transmission with UAS-<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> we induced specific neuronal death early during larval development in the brain lobe, SOG and sensory system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). We generated a new and stronger BLsens driver line (BLsens<sup>R57C10</sup>) by replacing <italic>elav</italic>-gal4 with R57C10-gal4 and crossed it to the proapoptotic genes activators (UAS-rpr and UAS-hid) using <italic>tubulin</italic>-gal80<sup>ts</sup> to restrict the moment of expression (UAS-<italic>rpr</italic>, UAS-<italic>hid</italic>/+,+; <italic>elav</italic>-Gal4, <italic>tsh</italic>-Gal80/+, <italic>tub</italic>-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>/+; Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). After determining a set of temperatures that kill the neurons and allow the larvae to reach the third instar, we performed behavioural experiments in the same way as the other lines tested. At the control temperature of 22°C with no induced apoptosis, we found 80% of BLsens &gt; <italic>rpr, hid</italic> larvae had move step length distributions best fit by truncated power laws with an exponent of 1.51 over 1.71 orders of magnitude of the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), and cluster and MSD analyses confirming power law behaviour (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">4</xref>). Of the 77 tracks analysed, five were best fit by the exponential and 10 were best fit by neither distribution. For BLsens &gt; <italic>rpr, hid</italic> larvae tracked at the restrictive temperature of 32°C, inducing apoptosis of brain plus sensory neurons, the trajectories were generally more spatially restricted for the majority of individuals. Although this resulted in more exponential fits to step-length frequency distributions (10 tracks from 62 retained), it was striking that 37% of distributions were best fit by truncated power laws (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Moreover, the mean exponent for BLsens &gt; <italic>rpr, hid</italic> was 2.14, with CPD analysis demonstrating 68% of population exponents fall within the <italic>μ</italic> value range of 1.5 to 2.5, and 38% between 1.75 and 2.25 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). All other analyses supported the presence of Lévy-like walks in movement patterns best fit by truncated power laws (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">4</xref>). Interestingly, the power law exponent of BLsens &gt; <italic>rpr, hid</italic> larvae movement patterns at 32°C, killing most brain and sensory neurons, was significantly higher and closer to the theoretical optimum than controls at 22°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, D, E</xref>). This was similar to the result found for power law exponents of BLsens &gt; <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> compared to <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic>/+ control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, the results obtained with proapoptotic driver lines were similar to those seen in the experiments with UAS-<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic>, which reinforces our finding that even without brain function larvae explore their environment with movement patterns well approximated by Lévy walks.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Near optimal Lévy search in larvae after apoptosis in the brain lobes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression pattern of the BLsens<sup>R57C10</sup> line.

Similarly, we have demonstrated that freely moving <italic>Drosophila</italic> BL/+, <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic>/+ and MB247/+ control larvae tracked over large relative time and space scales with minimal sensory inputs (visual, olfactory, gustatory) and homogeneous temperatures at 22°C and 33°C display exploration (search) patterns well approximated by Lévy-like searches. All previous observations, even in favour of the extrinsic hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Censi et al., 2013</xref>) were demonstrated in animals with intact nervous systems, thus the influence of the sensory inputs from the environment could not unambiguously be asserted.</p><p>Our finding that BL &gt;<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> larvae with strongly impaired brain processing and part of SOG function explore with multi-scale, Lévy-like movement patterns provides the first strong evidence that a Lévy-like pattern was not an emergent property of interactions with fractally distributed resources or sensory landscapes (rejecting the extrinsic hypothesis). In contrast, we show that substrate exploration resembling a Lévy walk pattern is an intrinsic routine for exploration (support for the intrinsic hypothesis). That BLsens &gt;<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> larvae exhibit multi-scale, Lévy-like patterns and heavy-tailed distributions – via forward crawls interspersed by pauses then turns – indicates that multi-scale movement patterns are generated spontaneously by the central networks of the thoracic and abdominal system that operate independently of input from either the brain or the sensory system. This was confirmed in larvae BLsens &gt;<italic>rpr, hid</italic> larvae expressing proapoptotic gene activators that kill brain and sensory neurons, which were also free-moving with patterns from long trajectories well approximated by Lévy-like walks. Therefore, we conclude that multi-scale, Lévy-like search patterns arise intrinsically and autonomously in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae.</p><p>We also found evidence for intrinsic Lévy-like patterns that are theoretically optimal for sparse resource target encounter in patchy landscapes. Model fits to movement patterns gave power law exponent values of <italic>µ</italic> = 1.66 for BL &gt;<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> and <italic>µ</italic> = 1.96 for BLsens &gt; <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> larvae, values close to the theoretically optimal Lévy search pattern of <italic>µ</italic> ~2. Recent simulations demonstrate that Lévy walks with <italic>µ</italic> ~2 are optimal for a much broader range of resource densities and distributions than generally realised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Humphries and Sims, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wosniack et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, numerous studies show that Lévy walks with power law exponents &lt; 2 yield more ballistic searches which are optimal for finding target resources more distantly located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Viswanathan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Humphries and Sims, 2014</xref>). It is also apparent that Lévy searches with <italic>µ</italic> ~1.5, and similar to exponents shown by BL/+ and <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic>/+ larvae (1.35 and 1.54 respectively) at the restrictive temperature of 33°C, have in simulations been shown to have the lowest variance in foraging efficiency compared to theoretically optimal Lévy foragers, in addition to having low ‘famine’ durations that are only slightly greater than for <italic>µ</italic> ~2 Lévy searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Humphries and Sims, 2014</xref>). Taken together, this suggests <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval exploration patterns were similar to theoretically optimal Lévy searches for efficient location of sparse and distant resources.</p><p>The restrictive temperature of 33°C did not affect patterns of movements in larvae because there was no significant difference in power law exponents for BL/+ or <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic>/+ at 33°C or 22°C, a preferred temperature for these larvae. The difference between exponents of BL/+ and <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic>/+ larvae with BL &gt;<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> larvae may be as a result of sensory responses of BL/+ and <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic>/+ search patterns to minimal external cues likely to have been present in our experimental set-up. For these larvae, the lack of food cues may have resulted in a higher proportion of longer steps (more extensive searching) giving rise to the lower exponent. This implies that the theoretically near-optimal search pattern of BL &gt;<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> larvae emerges from central pattern generation in the absence of external sensory inputs.</p><p>Precisely how intrinsic, autonomous Lévy-like search patterns are generated in the nervous system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae was not investigated in this study. Recent studies however, have localised the networks controlling the elements of the behaviour sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berni, 2015</xref>) which provides some insight. Exploratory behaviour is already present in newly hatched <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae consisting of straight-line forward crawls driven by peristaltic contractions that are interrupted by pauses, turns and redirected forward crawls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berni et al., 2012</xref>). Genetic dissection of neural circuitry of this exploratory behaviour shows that larval straight-line crawls rely on symmetrical output of the thoracic and abdominal network, whereas thoracic segments generate the asymmetric activity resulting in a turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berni, 2015</xref>). An intermittent interruption to crawling determined the time-dependent alternation between crawls and turns, but it was not known which part of the system was responsible or whether it was dependent on a fluctuating property of the whole network such as excitation level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berni, 2015</xref>).</p><p>A Lévy movement pattern will emerge when straight-line, ballistic movement is interrupted by pauses with intervals timed stochastically according to a heavy-tailed (e.g. power-law) distribution of pause times. It is possible that Lévy movement we observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae could arise from the temporal structure of pauses arising from a ‘Lévy timing mechanism’ (LTM) within the thoracic and abdominal network. We propose that the LTM is generated by temporally scale-free changes in neuronal activity of the circuit controlling the transition between straight-line crawls and turns. Scale-free temporal structuring of activity has been observed from single neurons to circuits and is a widespread feature of nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazzoni et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that these patterns of activity could underlie the generation of a Lévy movement. Furthermore, an LTM arising within the thoracic and abdominal neural network of free-moving <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae could be analogous to hypothetical ‘fractal reorientation clocks’ in intermittent locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartumeus and Levin, 2008</xref>). It was proposed in a simulation study that a scale-free (Lévy) distributed pattern of times between pauses (stops or strong changes in speed) punctuating the movement path of a model organism results in Lévy intermittence that may come from reorientation mechanisms capable of organising directional persistence on time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartumeus and Levin, 2008</xref>). The neural coding processes underpinning a potential mechanism such as this remains to be elaborated precisely, but a link between fractal timing dynamics and propagation patterns in neural networks has been proposed from experimental observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</xref>). Patterns of spontaneous activity in cortical networks can occur as cascades or ‘avalanches’, where it is proposed that the activity of an individual neuron causes activities in other units in turn, thereby initiating a neuronal avalanche through the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</xref>). The spatial and temporal distributions of neuronal avalanches appear well described by power laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</xref>), which indicates the network to be in a critical state such that its system dynamics occur at many different spatio-temporal scales (scale-free) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, a neural coding scheme based on bursty, multifractal time-series patterns of spike potentials recorded from rat hippocampus during foraging has been proposed to generate neurologically based superdiffusive (Lévy) search patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gutiérrez and Cabrera, 2015</xref>). In this context, our empirical study provides some support for the idea of an LTM or ‘fractal reorientation clock’ organising movement paths. Indeed, scale-free or fractal initiators of signalling pathways underlying movement patterns in the absence of prior information about resource location may be common in nature across diverse taxa, from individual cells to animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maye et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Korobkova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Proekt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Namboodiri et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicate that multi-scale movement paths that appear complex are generated intrinsically and we show that a relatively simple neural network generated within the thoracic and abdominal nervous system is the principal driver. That free-moving <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae without brain and sensory function crawl and explore their environment with apparently complex search patterns that approximate optimal Lévy walks should perhaps not be considered so surprising since it is well established that higher animals can have spared function following decerebration. In vertebrates such as rats for example, much behavioural capacity is spared following decerebration at the mesencephalic and precollicular levels with preservation of a number of complex and well-coordinated behaviour patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Woods, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lovick, 1972</xref>). These include locomotion and components of feeding, grooming and defensive behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Woods, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lovick, 1972</xref>). These results for vertebrates clearly suggest that the neural circuitry for many elements of species-typical behaviours can be organised in lower regions of the neuraxis and that these can be integrated to form complex patterns of behaviour. Thus, the intrinsic Lévy-like search patterns we identify in <italic>Drosophila</italic> with no brain or sensory functions can be viewed as an underlying ‘free running’ optimal search pattern that is modified by environmental stimuli. We propose that when sensory inputs are received to the brain, such as olfactory stimuli, descending signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tastekin et al., 2015</xref>) to the thoracic and/or abdominal circuits modulate neural activity from Lévy-like patterns to deterministic patterns of movement driven by environmental information, e.g. chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gomez-Marin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Multi-scale movement patterns exhibited by brain and sensory blocked larvae are the intrinsic output of the thoracic and abdominal nervous system and appear finely tuned to theoretically optimal Lévy walks, which suggests selection pressure for Lévy walk characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reynolds, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sims et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, comprehensive computer simulations have confirmed that Lévy walks arise as the optimal search strategy in a wide range of different environments, providing the density of resources is sparse and the searcher’s information about resource location is limited to its close vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wosniack et al., 2017</xref>). This has been suggested to provide the strongest theoretical evidence underpinning the evolutionary origins of empirically observed Lévy walks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wosniack et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, because searching behaviour is crucial to mobile animals’ success (e.g. for food and mate location), the simple neural circuitry giving rise to complex, intrinsic Lévy-like searches that are theoretically optimal in diverse patchy landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Humphries and Sims, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wosniack et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wosniack et al., 2017</xref>) may have adapted early in the evolution of nervous systems. Centralised nervous systems comprised of cerebral ganglia were likely present in the Ediacaran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Northcutt, 2012</xref>) and brains and trunk ganglia are evident in early Cambrian arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanaka et al., 2013</xref>). Early presence of Lévy-like behavioural outputs from simple neural circuitry, such as that observed for <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, could help explain the widespread occurrence of multi-scale, Lévy-like behaviour among widely separated modern taxa, such as fish and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sims et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Humphries et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Humphries et al., 2010</xref>), that have a last common ancestor over 450 million years ago. We cannot exclude, however, the possibility for convergent evolution of similar movement patterns across diverse taxa. Nevertheless, an advantage as beneficial for resource acquisition by ‘blind foragers’ as Lévy search patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Viswanathan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Humphries and Sims, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wosniack et al., 2015</xref>), together with our finding of intrinsic neuronal generation of multi-scale, Lévy-like behaviour for substrate exploration in an animal, presents the intriguing possibility that search strategies evolved to exploit Lévy patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or<break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Drosophila</italic> <break/> <italic>melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>w; <italic>elav</italic>-GAL4, <break/><italic>tsh</italic>-GAL80/ +,+; <italic>cha3.3</italic>-GAL80, <break/>UAS-EGFP/ +</td><td>DOI: <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.07.048">10.1016/j.cub.2012.07.048</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td>BL/+</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>w; <italic>elav</italic>-GAL4, <italic>tsh</italic>-GAL80/ +,+; <italic>cha3.3</italic>-GAL80, UAS-EGFP / +</td><td>DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.07.048">10.1016/j.cub.2012.07.048</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td>BL &gt; +</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>w; <italic>elav</italic>-GAL4, <italic>tsh</italic>-GAL80/ +,+; UAS-EGFP / +</td><td>DOI: <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.07.048">10.1016/j.cub.2012.07.048</ext-link></td><td>NA</td><td>BLsens &gt; +</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Drosophila</italic> <break/><italic>melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>20XUAS-IVS-Syn21-Shibire-ts1-GFP-p10</td><td>Gift from G.

To confirm the efficiency of the manipulation the number of active, sick and almost paralysed, or dead larvae in each plate was counted every day.

Secondary antibodies were washed 4 × 30 min in PBT and specimens were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) between two aluminium-foil spacers, to avoid distortion of nerve cords, under number one cover glasses. Image stacks were captured on a Leica TCS-SP-5 confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electrophysiology recordings</title><p>Third instar larvae were dissected and pinned out in a sylgard-coated Petri dish filled with physiological saline (135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2.6H2O, 2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM N Tris (hydroxymethyl) methyl-2- aminoethanesulfonic acid and 36 mM sucrose, pH 7.15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berni, 2015</xref>]). Suction electrodes were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass (1.00 × 0.75 mm 4’, A-M Systems Inc; Harvard Apparatus). To obtain a pipette tip with approximately the same or slightly smaller diameter than the individual brain lobe the pipette tip was cut with scissors under a microscope. The suction electrode was gently approached until touching the brain lobe and suction was applied until an increase in baseline activity was observed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). A reference electrode was placed in the dish saline. After a stable recording was obtained, reference temperature (RT) was recorded (BAT-7001H thermometer with PT-6 sensor, Physitemp) and hot buffer was immediately superfused until target temperature was attained (33°C ± 1.0). Activity was recorded for several minutes while the lobes slowly reached recovery temperature (&lt;29°C). Extracellular activity was acquired with an extracellular amplifier (A-M System 1700), filtered (Low cut-off, 1 Hz; high cut-off, 1 kHz) and digitalized (Digidata 1320A, Axon Instruments). Individual traces were analyzed with Clampfit (plamp10, Axon Instruments). Activity was measured for 10 s after the temperature check. To quantify the brain lobe response to temperature changes, first, baseline (before suction) was subtracted from all recordings. Next, brain activity at the target temperature (33°C ± 1.0 S.D.) was normalised to that at reference temperature (≅23°C). This renders an index with value of 1 when no change respect to RT is observed, and zero when all brain activity is abolished.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Larva tracking</title><p>In the majority of studies examining the behaviour patterns of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including those with BL larvae, trials for tracking movement are generally short (1–10 min; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vogelstein et al., 2014</xref>). However, when testing for the presence of multi-scale behaviour such as Lévy search patterns, longer tracks are required because the underlying move-step frequency distribution of an animal’s normal movement routine must be sampled thoroughly to increase the likelihood of detecting rare longer move steps, if they are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sims et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Humphries et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Humphries et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Humphries et al., 2013</xref>). Longer track times require larger areas as larvae will likely move further in the trial time. For robust statistical detection of the macroscopic properties of a search pattern it is important for an organism’s path to be as unbounded as possible, that is, for collision with the edges of the arena to be minimised. Edge collision will truncate move step lengths (distance between consecutive turns) introducing potential bias against the chances of recording long move steps that are characteristic of some movement search patterns, e.g. Lévy walks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Humphries et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, track sections recorded after an edge collision were analysed as separate tracks and visual inspection was used to remove tracks where the larva simply travelled along the arena edge. Therefore, in this study each trial lasted 1 hr in which we tracked 10 young third instar larvae within a large 240 × 240 mm arena relative to the total body length of tracked larvae (mean, 2.37 mm ± 0.57 S.D.; <italic>n</italic> = 90). Each larva was video tracked once. In addition, we tested for significant differences between <italic>µ</italic> values (summarising movement patterns) before and after collisions with other larva and arena edge before reorientation in both BL/+ and <italic>shi</italic><sup>ts</sup>/+ treatments at both 22°C and 33°C (results given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Groups of 10 early third-instar larvae were washed to remove traces of food and allowed to dry crawl for 2 min on a clean agar-coated plate (5 cm diameter) before being transferred to the arena. The exploratory behaviour was monitored using a Frustrated Total Internal Reflection (FTIR)-based Imaging Method for high throughput locomotion analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Risse et al., 2013</xref>). The arena coated with a 2 mm thick layer of 0.8% agar was placed within a temperature controlled LMS220 chamber in the dark at 22°C or at 33 ± 1°C (changes in temperature for short periods of time were due to the inertia of the system). At 33°C the UAS-<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> is activated and the synaptic transition is blocked as controlled with <italic>elav</italic>-GAL4/UAS-<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> which were paralysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). During all treatments at both temperatures the incubator fan was disconnected during the recording to avoid air currents and the larvae were illuminated with infrared light, which they cannot see (HP HSDL-4230 IR LED, 875 nm; intensity from 14.33 nW/mm<sup>2</sup> in the edge to 9.12 nW/mm<sup>2</sup> in the center). One hour long movies were recorded at 2fps with a Basler acA2040-180km CMOS camera using Pylon and StreamPix software, mounted with a 16 mm KOWA IJM3sHC.SW VIS-NIR Lens and 825 nm high performance longpass filter (Schneider, IF-093). The resolution was 2048 × 2048 px to obtain forward movement displacements and actual pause-turns that are recorded accurately rather than to include ‘flickering’ movements associated with peristaltic movements.</p><p>The <italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic> coordinates of individual larvae exploring the agar were obtained using the FIM track free software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Risse et al., 2013</xref>). To check that this rate of frame capture was not too slow to accurately and reliably represent a larva trajectory we conducted a larva tracking test at 15 fps, which we then subsampled to 7.5, 5 and 3 fps, to enable a comparison for the same set of tracks at different frame recording frequencies. We found there was no effect of frame capture rate on estimation of the <italic>µ</italic> exponent parameter (ANOVA: <italic>F</italic> = 1.96, p=0.146; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>) (for track analysis methodologies see sections <italic>Maximum Likelihood Estimation</italic> and <italic>Computing step lengths from tracks</italic>). Therefore, all larva tracks were recorded at two fps. Prior to further analysis, the <italic>x, y</italic> integer coordinates obtained from the tracking software were converted to mm by multiplying by 0.11 (the approximate dimension of 1 pixel).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Track processing</title><p>The processing of the raw tracks from video recordings, required for determining move step lengths, and the subsequent MLE analysis, are described in detail below. In summary however, the workflow process for each raw track proceeded as follows. The track was first smoothed using a Kalman filter, to remove the jaggedness resulting from the integer (pixel) recording. Smoothed tracks were then checked for gap errors, where the time between recorded points exceeded one time step (0.5 s, i.e. missed locations) and for speed errors, where the speed to a point exceeded 0.55 mm/s (recording errors). Turning points in the track were then identified and a set of step lengths was derived. Step lengths below the 0.44 mm minimum step resolution value were discarded and finally the MLE, Mean Square Displacement (MSD) and Straightness Index (SI) analyses were performed.</p><p>Each larva trajectory was smoothed with a Kalman filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jonsen et al., 2005</xref>) prior to determining move step lengths to reduce the potential effect of tracking positional errors, e.g. head motion ‘flickering’, being counted as actual movements. A simple linear smoothing was applied, the aim being to remove the jaggedness of the track caused by the integer (pixel) based recording. To achieve this two 1D filters were used, one for movement in <italic>x</italic> and one for movement in <italic>y</italic>, with parameters for both as follows: position state minimum variance = 0.5; velocity state minimum variance = 0.5; measurement covariance = 1.0. These parameters smoothed the track while introducing a minimum change to the track locations, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. We calculated that any move step &lt;0.44 mm (four pixels) (termed the minimum step resolution value) might not have resulted from actual movement of the larvae but would more likely be the result of noise, or flicker, in the imaging equipment. Therefore, to further reduce the effect of tracking errors, all move steps with values &lt; 0.44 mm were excluded from the analysis. Where tracking errors resulted in gaps in the tracks, the resultant erroneous steps were ignored, as were all steps where a maximum speed of 0.55 mm/s was exceeded. Tracks with fewer than 200 move steps were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) analysis</title><p>While there are alternative methods to Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for the detection of power-law distributions of move step-lengths, such as root mean square fluctuation, or mean squared displacement, these methods do not provide estimates of exponents and cannot be used to properly compare alternate distributions. The methodology used here to determine the best fit distributions is therefore based on that described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clauset et al. (2009)</xref> and used previously in Humphries et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Humphries et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Humphries et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, truncated Pareto (truncated power law, TP) and exponential distributions (E) were the principal models used to test for the presence of Lévy-like walks in move-step frequency distributions. Briefly, the appropriate MLE equation was used to derive an exponent with the initial <italic>x<sub>min</sub></italic> parameter set to the minimum value found in our dataset. A best fit dataset was generated with the estimated parameters and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test was used to determine the goodness of fit (the KS D statistic). To determine the best fit value for the <italic>x<sub>min</sub></italic> parameter the calculation was repeated with increasing values for <italic>x<sub>min</sub></italic> taken from the dataset with the value that resulted in the best (lowest) KS-D statistic being retained as the best fit value. The method was repeated to derive a best fit value for the <italic>x<sub>max</sub></italic> parameter, so both the <italic>x<sub>min</sub></italic> and <italic>x<sub>max</sub></italic> parameters were fitted in the same way. In order to provide consistent data sets for model selection, once values for <italic>x<sub>min</sub></italic> and <italic>x<sub>max</sub></italic> had been derived, the dataset was reduced to include only values between those lower and upper bounds. The resulting dataset therefore contained only the step lengths fitting the proposed distribution and it was this that was used to assess the goodness of fit and in the determination of log-likelihood values and Akaike weights, for all distributions, thus simplifying model selection.</p><p>The MLE analysis requires two equations for each distribution to be tested. One is the MLE equation for the distribution and is used to estimate the exponent. The other is a random number generator (RNG) and is used to generate best-fit datasets. Note however that there is no closed form MLE equation for the truncated Pareto and therefore we perform the MLE numerically by iteratively searching for the value of <italic>µ</italic> that maximises the log likelihood. The equations that were used for each distribution are given below. The exponential equations were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clauset et al.

However, the results have been shown to be dependent on the parameters chosen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Humphries et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Plank and Codling, 2009</xref>), and it can be difficult to set a threshold turning angle, or a corridor width, that have a sound basis in the biology of the animal and which are not to some degree subjective. These problems were addressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Humphries et al. (2013)</xref> by recognising, firstly, that these issues do not arise when dealing with 1D data where the turning points are simply unambiguous reversals in direction and, secondly, that when projected into 1D, the properties of a 2D (or 3D) Lévy distribution are preserved; that is, the 1D projection of a 2 or 3D Lévy walk is itself a Lévy walk. The preservation of the power-law exponent under projection has long been understood and has been described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sims et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Humphries et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, other distributions, such as the exponential, were also shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Humphries et al. (2013)</xref> to be preserved sufficiently well when projected to be clearly identified as such. Additionally, it was shown that the points at which 1D reversals occurred represented significant turns in the movement path and that the turn angles at these locations are more uniformly distributed than the turn angles in the raw data, and thus more consistent with a uniform turn angle distribution expected in a pure, idealised Lévy random walk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartumeus et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, the method employed here was that described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Humphries et al. (2013)</xref> which, briefly, consists of taking coordinate values from one axis and computing turning points as the reversals in direction in that axis. Contiguous steps between reversals were considered to be sampling artefacts and were coalesced into single move steps. The process was repeated using the other axis and all steps from both axes were combined into a single move step-length data set for each individual. This method has now been employed in a wide range of movement studies with taxa ranging from bacteria to seabirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reynolds, 2018</xref>) and, importantly, has been proved to work effectively with curved trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tromer et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Track tortuosity analysis</title><p>When plotted at a specific scale, the track of a larva shows little of the underlying complexity, whereas zooming in across different scales reveals complex movement patterns (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To investigate the actual tortuous nature of animal tracks First Passage Time (FPT) analysis can be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradshaw et al., 2007</xref>). This method computes the variance in the passage forward and backwards of a circle of radius <italic>r</italic> as it is advanced along the track. By increasing the radius and plotting the variance, the scale(s) at which the tortuosity of the track is at a maximum can be determined. This method has been used extensively for the analysis of animal movement tracks, such as albatrosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weimerskirch et al., 2007</xref>). However, while this reveals potential domains or scale(s) of activity it does not provide a time-dependent visualisation of track complexity. To show changes in track complexity at fine spatial scales through time we employed a straightness index (S.I.) that was computed by advancing a window of fixed time scale (e.g. 1 min) along the track point by point and calculating at each point the ratio of the straight line distance to the actual distance travelled. This index, which varies from 0 (no movement) to 1 (straight line movement), can capture very well the complexity of the movement at various scales (set by the window time frame) throughout the track. As the time window decreases the smoothing effect is also reduced revealing increasing track details. A window size of 1 min was selected to balance the need to visualise track complexity without losing the time-series with details of the smallest scale movements. The S.I. was computed for each larva through time and revealed changes in movement as larva alternated between straight line relocation, changes of direction and different degrees of tortuosity. Hence, a change in the S.I. along a larva’s track captures the magnitude of the change in movement pattern from intensive, area-restricted searching movements (higher tortuosity) to extensive, straighter line movements (lower tortuosity), and <italic>vice versa</italic>, across a wide range of spatial scales. We analysed the size distribution of S.I. changes (or walk clusters) along each track time-series by fitting model distributions in the same way as with move step-length data, with MLE methods used for parameter fitting and AIC weights (<italic>w</italic>AIC) for model selection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cumulative probability distributions</title><p>We used cumulative distribution functions (CDF) to determine the probability of larva track <italic>μ</italic> exponents of each experimental treatment (the response) falling within different <italic>μ</italic> value ranges.

Rather, the average <italic>µ</italic> values from all KF sensitivity tests are close to those found in the analysis. The minimum step resolution value chosen for the analysis (0.44) was determined from the tracking resolution and larval movements (head sways and peristaltic contractions) and represents the lowest value above the track noise. All computed move steps lower than this value were excluded from the analysis. For the sensitivity test, values of 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 were used as this range covered viable alternative values.

The alternative possibility is that such movement patterns are an emergent side-effect of how animals interact with the environment. The former explanation suggests that Lévy walks etc. are adaptive, whereas the latter explanation suggests that the behavior is not evolved. This experimental paper gives what is close to a definitive answer to this longstanding question.</p><p>The experiment has been custom designed, the data carefully processed, and the analysis has been undertaken with the required high standards (for example, the authors have taken care to distinguish power laws from truncated power laws). There are several technical results that, together, paint a picture that is as surprising as it is significant. When the experimenters artificially impair brain processing of sensory information, the resulting movement paths resemble Lévy walks, supporting the idea that there is an evolved neurophysiological mechanism that generates paths resembling Lévy walks.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Optimal searching behaviour generated intrinsically by the central pattern generator for locomotion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: William S Ryu (Reviewer #1); Adam J Calhoun (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are some concerns and needs for clarifications requiring revision. The full reviewer comments are provided and should be fully addressed, but as a guide to the revision, we emphasize a few points brought out in these reviews.</p><p>1) Both reviewer #1 (main concerns – request to check if the statistics change over time (e.g. dependent on satiety?)) and #2 (point 4 – is there any adaptation to the turn rate?) overlap and indicate the need for serious consideration by the authors of stationarity in the data.</p><p>2) The additional concerns of reviewer #2 can be characterized as two question each requiring a careful response:</p><p>a) Is a random walk model (RWM) appropriate for fly larva foraging?</p><p>For RWM, the assumption is that reorientation events are independent and that the &quot;steps&quot; do not have some non-trivial correlations (e.g. curvature with direction of turn, etc.). We ask the authors to show additional statistics about turns and steps in support of a RWM. In addition, inspection of the tracks in the figures makes it look like sometimes larvae are either on a curvy track or turning a lot. Our guess is that this is real, and we think some small figure emphasizing that would be not too difficult to produce. For instance, if the authors simply show that slightly different thresholds in the tracking still results in truncated power laws we would be fine with the analysis. Our main concern would simply be that all these power laws are simply a result of the particular tracking.</p><p>b) How sensitive are the results to the segmentation parameters?</p><p>The authors are looking at 1D of the 2D data set so they aren't identifying &quot;turns&quot; directly and so can't directly do a sensitivity test for &quot;turn angle.&quot; Essentially, they are identifying step lengths which statistically reproduce the same exponent of the power law distribution. We ask for a better description of the segmentation pipeline for step lengths in the main text, to help clarify to readers that the analysis does not identify turns directly, since we feel this might be overlooked by some readers. Moreover, we require some comment on how sensitive these results are regarding any parameters used in this pipeline, including image processing, filtering, data exclusion (<italic>x<sub>min</sub></italic>), and fitting.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is nice work.</p><p>Stochasticity is a fundamental element of animal behavior and in the context of search is universal across a wide range of species. Recent measurements of animal movements has shown that these probabilistic movement patterns approach a Lévy distribution. Leveraging the neurogenetic power of the fly model, this work addresses important questions. How do animals generate these non-trivial distribution? How are these random number generators implemented biologically? Are they generated through sensory information, sensory processing, higher order computation (extrinsically) or through a mechanism at a lower level (intrinsically)?</p><p>I believe technically the experiments are sound and that the data analysis uses appropriate and modern statistical tests required for determining the distribution parameters. I especially appreciate the inclusion of the order of magnitude of the data range, and the transparency of the testing details shown in the supplementary files.</p><p>The authors are careful to show important controls and experimentally the tracking experiment looks also to be carefully controlled for environmental inhomogeneities. However there are two parameters that I would like the authors to comment on. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> it has been shown that searching behavior changes scale over time, slowly increasing with a tau measured in tens of minutes. Are the fly search patterns constant in time over the 1 hour experiment? Does this differ between the BL/SOG blocked conditions? Also, it is assumed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that the change in time is due to a change in satiety levels. At the beginning of the experiment the worm is well fed and so when searching on an agar surface with no food, it looks local with a short time/length scale, but as it gets hungry it extends the searching scale. While the blocked BL/SOG condition was shown to be within a range of normal feeding (Figure 2), I wonder if there might be still be a <italic>systematic</italic> nutritional or a satiety difference that is occurring. These comments are directed at a better understanding of mechanism, and does not affect the author's primary argument for an intrinsic vs. extrinsic characterization. But I think might at the very least deserve some comment in a response or perhaps even a comment in the text.</p><p>One part of the MLE analysis I did not fully understand. The authors describe a procedure to reduce the data range (<italic>x</italic><sub>min</sub>, <italic>x<sub>max</sub></italic>) for the fitting. Why was this necessary? I would like to better understand the differences in fitting if this data pruning was not done. Perhaps one could gleam this information from the supplementary files, but looking it over it is not clear to me.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the foraging literature, Lévy walks (or truncated power laws) are of fundamental importance and are seen across the animal kingdom. Where do they come from? In this manuscript, Sims et al. propose that power law movement is generated intrinsically by the motion generating circuitry of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. The fits certainly look like power laws and the authors provide evidence that larvae generate this even in the absence of a synaptic activity in the brain. Still, I have some concerns about the way the data is quantified and interpreted.</p><p>1) I would like to see some further quantification of how the analysis pipeline identifies turns. This is fundamental to the entirety of the manuscript but when I look at the examples of turns in Figure 4A I am not convinced that there are not large numbers of spurious turns. Are there thresholds that they can vary to ensure that this result isn't the effect of some spurious parameter?</p><p>2) I would also like some more insight into how path curvature relates to power law scaling of random walk step length. Many of these paths certainly <italic>look</italic> curved, and I know other worms such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> do have curved paths. Do <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae? Is a curved path equivalent to a sequence of frequent turns?</p><p>3) Some quantification of turning angle seems like it would be useful as well. Can the authors clarify whether optimal search relies on uncorrelated turn angle? If you have a sequence of anticorrelated turns, you may get a power law alpha ~ 2.0 (for the sake of argument) but the animal would move outward in a ballistic fashion which is very different behaviorally. I am especially wondering about turns between short steps which are (I assume) very small and would look very different than the random walks you get in Viswanathan et al., 1999, or the authors' own Figure 1A, for instance.</p><p>4) Is there any adaptation to the turn rate, e.g. if you quantify exponent early vs. late is it the same? Many animals perform an area-restricted search when placed in a new environment, which might affect the overall measured exponent.</p><p>5) The authors perform a lot of manipulations to see if the animal will continue to produce Lévy flights and indeed they do (I am impressed they do anything with some of these manipulations). In fact, it seems impossible for them to do anything <italic>except</italic> Lévy flights. Have the authors considered a manipulation (puffing on odorants, for instance) that would induce a Brownian random walk and see if they revert to a Lévy flight or if they indeed continue on in a Lévy flight? Some of the manipulations, such as apoptosis experiment in the brain lobes in Figure 7D, suggest that the VNC (not CPGs per se) are what are driving the power law – but there could still be local sensory processing here. My concern here is that the authors may not be truly getting rid of the sensory processing that could drive the power law.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study is an excellent paper that should be published as soon as possible.</p><p>One of the most important open problems in theoretical ecology and movement ecology in particular is whether or not observed Lévy walk movement patterns (and similar behavior) are caused by intrinsic pattern generators implemented neurophysiologically.

We showed in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 that µ values did not change significantly before or after BL/+ and <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic>/+ control larvae (at 22 or 33<sup>o</sup>C) collided with the edge of the arena, indicating stationarity in the data following intermittence of the path. However, in the revised paper we have undertaken further analysis by taking larva tracks with fitted move steps, separating them at the midpoint, and retaining for analysis those for which each half of the tracks was best fitted by a truncated power law. The average µ values for the first and second half of all tracks across trials within a treatment were compared to determine any significant differences, which would indicate changes in path statistics over time (i.e. non-stationarity). We found no significant differences between the first and second halves of the tracks and with no clear trend of increasing or decreasing µ values, as might be expected to occur if µ showed significant temporal dependence on changing satiety or other factors over the 1 h trial period. We now include these results in a new Supplementary file 5 and refer directly to the results in Figure 2—figure supplements 2 and 3 in the main Results and ‘Exploration strategy in an environment with minimal external cues’ section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The additional concerns of reviewer #2 can be characterized as two question each requiring a careful response:</p><p>a) Is a random walk model (RWM) appropriate for fly larva foraging?</p><p>For RWM, the assumption is that reorientation events are independent and that the &quot;steps&quot; do not have some non-trivial correlations (e.g. curvature with direction of turn, etc.).

We address each point in turn below.</p><p>Random walks: We agree that it is interesting to consider the appropriateness of the RMW for larva searching. As pointed out, an assumption underlying the concept of a uncorrelated random walk (Brownian motion) is that turn angles follow a uniform random distribution such that any turn angle is equally probable and statistically independent. In the 1980s correlated random walks (CRWs) were developed because CRWs have short-range angle correlations that appear more similar to empirical data since the correlations incorporate directional persistence. However, the memory effects on directional persistence have a finite range and decay exponentially, meaning that at large enough spatial and temporal scales CRWs become uncorrelated random walks. The size of arena we used for <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva is unlikely to allow sufficiently long and large movement paths to emerge such that CRWs emerge as uncorrelated random walks so some directional persistence is expected (non-uniform random turn angle distribution), emerging as an increased frequency of turn angles around 0<sup>o</sup>. This is important to consider in the context of applying Lévy random walks to larva searching paths because an assumption of a pure Lévy walk is that turn angles follow a uniform random distribution. Again though, because our arena size and trial time limited very large spatial and temporal tracks it is expected that movements modelled with Lévy walks will show some short-range correlations.</p><p>In the revised paper we have undertaken a turning angle analysis (results given in Figure 5—figure supplement 1) to explore these dynamics. The results demonstrate that using the raw turning angles without applying the objective step identification method results in a highly skewed distribution centred on turns around 0<sup>o</sup>. A raw turn-angle distribution dominated by a very high frequency of small angle deviations around 0<sup>o</sup> indicate these may be unrelated to actual turning behaviour (interruptions in the movement path). The distribution of significant turns identifies a relatively higher frequency of larger angle turns that is more consistent with a uniform turn angle distribution of idealised random Lévy walks (note that there are far fewer significant turns than raw turns). The significant turns identified between 50 and -50<sup>o</sup> indicate the presence of short-range angle correlations, however, Lévy walks are independent of short-range correlations and the estimated value of µ<sub>opt</sub> = 2 remains unchanged under such conditions. This indicates that even with short-range angle correlations the µ values we found for larva will not be affected in important ways.</p><p>In the revised paper, therefore, we conclude in the Results subsection ‘Exploration strategy in an environment with minimal external cues’ and in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, that at the scales over which we were able to track larva, the movement statistics are consistent with the expectations of a pure Lévy walk but with short-range angle correlations associated with the spatially and temporally bounded environment.</p><p>Curved paths: The reviewers raise an important point here that needed to be clarified further. In the revised paper we have now included a new figure as suggested (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) which explores curved paths and the relationship between curved paths and turning angles.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> larva sometimes exhibit curved paths within movement trajectories, as can be seen in Figure 5 track panels. The new Figure 2—figure supplement 1 shows an example of a Kalman-filtered track of a control larva (BL/+ at 33<sup>o</sup>C) executing a curved path. The figure shows that curved tracks are indeed generated by larvae crawling in a curve which is produced by a consistent but minor deviation in larva heading. We also demonstrate in this figure for the same animal that the objective move-step estimating method (Humphries, Weimerskirch and Sims, 2013; Tromer et al., 2015) identifies small turns within the curved movement. Without more detailed analysis, the path as plotted in this figure gives the impression when plotted at this scale that the method identifies small steps where they appear not to occur. However, a more detailed plot of the actual movements of the larva in the curved track section shows that small turns interrupting the curve are present and are correctly identified by the objective move-step estimation method used.</p><p>Threshold analysis: We think it is very important to demonstrate clearly that different thresholds in the tracking still results in truncated power laws. We have undertaken new sensitivity analyses to explore this. The results are presented in a new Supplementary file 2, and referred to directly in the first paragraph of the revised Results.</p><p>We altered the Kalman filter (KF) parameters and minimum step resolution values to determine the effects of such changes on the consistency of treatment <italic>µ</italic> values. The values used for the results presented in the main paper were using Position and Velocity minimum variances of 0.5 and a covariance of 1.0 for the KF, and a minimum step resolution of 0.44 mm. The sensitivity analysis for the KF parameters considered values that differed significantly from those used, bracketing the analysis values. The results in Supplementary file 2 show differences in the µ values were generally small, confirming that the values chosen for the KF did not alter the finding of truncated power laws in larva tracks. Rather, the average µ values from all KF sensitivity tests are close to those found in the analysis. The minimum step resolution value chosen for the analysis was determined from the tracking resolution and larval movements (head sways and peristaltic contractions) and represents the lowest value above the track noise. All computed move steps lower than this value were excluded from the analysis. For the sensitivity test, values of 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 were used as this range covered viable alternative values. As with the KF tests, the finding of truncated power laws and the resultant µ values differed very little from those presented in the original analysis. We conclude that significant changes in parameters associated with video track processing had no important effects on our finding of truncated power laws in larva movement paths and the resultant µ values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) How sensitive are the results to the segmentation parameters?</p><p>The authors are looking at 1D of the 2D data set so they aren't identifying &quot;turns&quot; directly and so can't directly do a sensitivity test for &quot;turn angle.&quot; Essentially, they are identifying step lengths which statistically reproduce the same exponent of the power law distribution. We ask for a better description of the segmentation pipeline for step lengths in the main text, to help clarify to readers that the analysis does not identify turns directly, since we feel this might be overlooked by some readers. Moreover, we require some comment on how sensitive these results are regarding any parameters used in this pipeline, including image processing, filtering, data exclusion (x<sub>min</sub>), and fitting.</p></disp-quote><p>In answer to the question of how sensitive are the results to the segmentation parameters we direct the reviewers to our responses to the previous point. We have substantially altered Kalman filter and minimum step resolution values and found no significant effects on treatment µ values.</p><p>However, in the revised paper we have sought to further clarify the description of how larva tracks were processed and turns identified. We have revised the Materials and methods section and included an overview paragraph detailing the process of track analysis. This reads:</p><p>“Track processing</p><p>The processing of the raw tracks from video recordings, that was required for determining move step lengths, and the subsequent MLE analysis, are described in detail below. […] Turning points in the track were then identified and a set of step lengths was derived. Step lengths below the 0.44 mm minimum step resolution value were discarded and finally the MLE, Mean Square Displacement (MSD) and Straightness Index (SI) analyses were performed.”</p><p>We have revised the Materials and methods section referring to the identification of turn angles:</p><p>“Computing step lengths from tracks</p><p>Various methods have been proposed for the identification of turning points, and consequently move step-lengths, in tortuous two-dimensional (2D) movement paths; for example the location of acute turning angles [Tromer et al., 2015], or the deviation of the movement path from an imaginary corridor of set width encompassing the trajectory [Clauset, Shalizi and Newman, 2009; White, Enquist and Green, 2008]. […] Additionally, it was shown that the points at which 1D reversals occurred represented significant turns in the movement path and that the turn angles at these locations are more uniformly distributed than the turn angles in the raw data, and thus more consistent with a uniform turn angle distribution expected in a pure, idealised Lévy random walk [Bartumeus et al., 2005].”</p><p>In the revised paper we have also stated clearly in the first paragraph of the Results section:</p><p>“Turns were identified as the reversal in direction in a 1D projection of the 2D movement patterns. This method is unbiased and preserves the distribution properties of the original 2D trajectory [Humphries, Weimerskirch and Sims, 2013] (see Materials and methods).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The authors are careful to show important controls and experimentally the tracking experiment looks also to be carefully controlled for environmental inhomogeneities. However there are two parameters that I would like the authors to comment on. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> it has been shown that searching behavior changes scale over time, slowly increasing with a tau measured in tens of minutes. Are the fly search patterns constant in time over the 1 hour experiment? Does this differ between the BL/SOG blocked conditions? Also, it is assumed in C. elegans that the change in time is due to a change in satiety levels. At the beginning of the experiment the worm is well fed and so when searching on an agar surface with no food, it looks local with a short time/length scale, but as it gets hungry it extends the searching scale. While the blocked BL/SOG condition was shown to be within a range of normal feeding (Figure 2), I wonder if there might be still be a systematic nutritional or a satiety difference that is occurring. These comments are directed at a better understanding of mechanism, and does not affect the author's primary argument for an intrinsic vs. extrinsic characterization. But I think might at the very least deserve some comment in a response or perhaps even a comment in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We refer the reviewer to our responses to point 1 above in which we provide support for stationarity in larva movement data by showing no significant differences in µ values before and after collision, and between the first and second halves of tracks. We now refer to these results explicitly at the beginning of the Results section and in Supplementary file 5 and Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One part of the MLE analysis I did not fully understand. The authors describe a procedure to reduce the data range (x<sub>min</sub>, x<sub>max</sub>) for the fitting. Why was this necessary? I would like to better understand the differences in fitting if this data pruning was not done. Perhaps one could gleam this information from the supplementary files, but looking it over it is not clear to me.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not reduce the data range in order to facilitate the fitting, rather we use the results of the fitting to define the data range for model selection such that across all individual track model fits we are comparing like with like. This is standard methodology in MLE and model selection. However, we have revised the Materials and methods section relating to this (Maximum Likelihood Estimation analysis) to help clarify this point, which now reads:</p><p>“In order to provide consistent data sets for model selection once values for <italic>x<sub>min</sub></italic> and <italic>x<sub>max</sub></italic> had been derived, the dataset was reduced to include only values between those lower and upper bounds. The resulting dataset therefore contained only the step lengths fitting the proposed distribution and it was this that was used to assess the goodness of fit and in the determination of log-likelihood values and Akaike weights, for all distributions, thus simplifying model selection.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) I would like to see some further quantification of how the analysis pipeline identifies turns. This is fundamental to the entirety of the manuscript but when I look at the examples of turns in Figure 4A I am not convinced that there are not large numbers of spurious turns. Are there thresholds that they can vary to ensure that this result isn't the effect of some spurious parameter?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for helping to identify where we can provide further clarity of our methods and results.</p><p>The path tracks shown in Figure 2 and elsewhere all suffer from the same issue that it is difficult to see the fine detail needed to assess that turns are made by the animal itself when the full track is shown at a single, large scale. In Figure 2A (lower panel) it is evident that the animal makes turns at the places where significant turns are identified. However, we understand the need to show more detail about this. In the revision we now show an exploration of the possibility of identifying spurious turns and provide a new analysis (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) demonstrating that small turns are indeed small turns made by the animal and are not an artefact of the methodology.</p><p>Furthermore, we would refer the reviewer to our previous responses (point 2A) describing new sensitivity analyses of both the Kalman filter and the minimum step resolution values. We found that broad variations in these parameters have no significant effects on the μ values.</p><p>We have revised the Materials and methods to include an overview description of the track processing workflow (see ‘Track processing’ section) and revised the section ‘Computing step lengths from tracks’ to make clear the theoretical basis for the objective method of computing step lengths from identifying significant turns. We also reference clearly in that section the two most relevant papers from different research groups that validate the method (Humphries, Weimerskirch and Sims, 2013; Tromer et al., 2015), including for curved trajectories.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I would also like some more insight into how path curvature relates to power law scaling of random walk step length. Many of these paths certainly look curved, and I know other worms such as C. elegans do have curved paths. Do Drosophila larvae? Is a curved path equivalent to a sequence of frequent turns?</p></disp-quote><p>We refer to our responses to this point made in the Editor’s Summary (point 2A ‘curved paths’). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae do exhibit curved paths and our new Figure 2—figure supplement 1 shows that curved paths comprise an animal moving in a curve, which is comprised of a sequence of heading deviations to a consistent side of the animal rather than significant turns. (See Turchin 1998 book, for a discussion on deviations and turns.) We find that small turns made by the animal sometimes interrupt this curved heading trajectory, that are unambiguously identified with the objective method employed and which has been shown to work equally well with curved trajectories (Tromer et al., 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some quantification of turning angle seems like it would be useful as well. Can the authors clarify whether optimal search relies on uncorrelated turn angle? If you have a sequence of anticorrelated turns, you may get a power law alpha ~ 2.0 (for the sake of argument) but the animal would move outward in a ballistic fashion which is very different behaviorally. I am especially wondering about turns between short steps which are (I assume) very small and would look very different than the random walks you get in Viswanathan et al., 1999, or the authors' own Figure 1A, for instance.</p></disp-quote><p>We refer the reviewer to our response to this point about turning angles in the Editor’s Summary (point 2A ‘random walks’). As mentioned there, we have undertaken a turn angle analysis of truncated power law best fit larva paths and find the expected pattern of turn angles. The distribution is consistent with a near uniform pattern at larger angles and some short-range angle correlations. However, Lévy walks are independent of short-range correlations and the estimated value of µopt = 2 remains unchanged under such conditions. Therefore, optimal Lévy search is not reliant upon an uncorrelated turn angle.</p><p>The Results have been revised to include this new analysis, which now reads:</p><p>“Furthermore, we also found that the turn angle distribution for all individual larva paths that were best fitted by truncated power laws showed a near uniform distribution of large turn angles (50 and 175°, left or right (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), a characteristic consistent with the uniform turn-angle distribution expected in a pure, idealised Lévy random walk [Viswanathan et al., 1999; Bartumeus et al., 2005]. […] This, taken together with the presence of truncated power law (Lévy) fits to move step-length and walk-cluster size distributions, and the presence of long-range correlations in movement paths confirms the appropriateness of applying the Lévy random walk model to <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva tracks.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Is there any adaptation to the turn rate, e.g. if you quantify exponent early vs. late is it the same? Many animals perform an area-restricted search when placed in a new environment, which might affect the overall measured exponent.</p></disp-quote><p>We refer to our response to this point made in the Editor’s Summary (point 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors perform a lot of manipulations to see if the animal will continue to produce Lévy flights and indeed they do (I am impressed they do anything with some of these manipulations). In fact, it seems impossible for them to do anything except Lévy flights. Have the authors considered a manipulation (puffing on odorants, for instance) that would induce a Brownian random walk and see if they revert to a Lévy flight or if they indeed continue on in a Lévy flight? Some of the manipulations, such as apoptosis experiment in the brain lobes in Figure 7D, suggest that the VNC (not CPGs per se) are what are driving the power law – but there could still be local sensory processing here. My concern here is that the authors may not be truly getting rid of the sensory processing that could drive the power law.</p></disp-quote><p>The animals do not always perform Lévy walks since in all trials there are some tracks that are either definitely exponential or which cannot be correctly classified as either truncated power law (Pareto) or exponential distributions by the MLE analysis. Supplementary file 2 gives a full summary of the number of tracks fitted by truncated power law, exponential or as unclassified model fits. The movement patterns shown by larva are diverse but there is a predominance of paths best described by truncated Lévy power laws even when brain and sensory processing is blocked.</p></body></sub-article></article>
