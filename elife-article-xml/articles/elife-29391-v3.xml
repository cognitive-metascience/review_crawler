<italic>Apicomplexa</italic> phylum clusters thousands of single-celled eukaryotes identified as parasites of metazoans including humans in whom they cause or increase the risk of major public health problems. Preeminent human pathogens include <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species that are responsible for dreadful malarial disease, as well as <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp., which are leading causes of food-borne and water-borne diseases. A shared characteristic of apicomplexan life cycles is the multiplicity of developmental stages, with progress from one stage to the next occurring alongside precise genetic reprogramming to ensure the survival and transmission of parasite populations. The emerging concept of remarkably dynamic gene expression in Apicomplexa has risen from the observation that large numbers of mRNAs are exclusively expressed in a given developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bozdech et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Radke et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Unlike those of metazoans, Apicomplexa genomes have a unique chromatin architecture typified by an unusually high proportion of euchromatin and only a few heterochromatic islands, which are scattered through the chromosome bodies or embedded at telomeres and centromeres. Although alterations in chromatin structure are acknowledged to be important for the transcriptional control of commitment to stage differentiation in several Apicomplexa, as well as for antigenic variation-mediated immune evasion in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, yet the understanding of chromatin remodeling remains incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bougdour et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scherf et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotes, the timely opening and closing of chromatin that is required for gene expression, chromosomal organization, DNA repair or DNA replication is governed by histone turnover and the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones, such as lysine methylation (me) and acetylation (ac) among many others. Indeed, PTMs on histone tails have been shown, alone or in combination, to alter the accessibility of effector proteins to nucleosomal DNA and hence to impact chromatin structure, according to the ‘histone code’ hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strahl and Allis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Turner, 2000</xref>). In addition, PTMs also act as signals that recruit ATP-dependent remodeling enzymes to move, eject or reposition nucleosomes. Enzymes carrying antagonist activities account for the versatile activities of PTMs on chromatin: it is the opposite, yet well concerted, activities of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) that control acetylation levels in cells.</p><p>Apicomplexa have evolved unique ways to modify histones that rival the strategies adopted by the cells they infect and provide zoites with remarkable capacities to multiply or undergo stage differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bougdour et al., 2010</xref>). Some histone-modifying enzymes have acquired gain-of-function mutations that confer broader or enhanced activity on substrates. It is the case of parasite Set8-related proteins endowed with H4K20 mono-, di-, and trimethylase activities that contrast with the mono-methylase-restricted metazoan Set8, and that derive from a single-amino-acid change in the substrate-specific channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sautel et al., 2007</xref>). Another example is the Apicomplexa HDAC3 family which is typified by an AT motif insertion at the entrance of the active-site tunnel of the conserved catalytic domain causing additional substrate/inhibitor recognition and binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bougdour et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotes, PTMs have been detected primarily in the histone tails sticking out from the nucleosome, but an ever-growing list of PTMs characterized as critical regulators of chromatin structure and function have now been identified in the lateral surface of the histone octamer, which directly contacts DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lawrence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tropberger and Schneider, 2013</xref>). Those ‘core’ histone PTMs promote different outcomes in nucleosome dynamics depending on their location. Modifications near the DNA entry-exit region of the nucleosome (e.g., H3K36ac) have been shown to favor local unwrapping of DNA from a histone octamer, thereby providing a better exposure of nucleosomal DNA to chromatin-remodeling and DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neumann et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, lateral-surface PTMs mapping close to the dyad axis (e.g., H3K122ac) were shown to decrease the affinity of the octamer to DNA and to affect nucleosome stability or mobility significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tropberger et al., 2013</xref>). As has been described for histone-tail modifications, different lateral-surface modifications on the same residue can be associated with opposite transcriptional programs. This is the case for the H3K64 residue near the dyad axis that facilitates nucleosome eviction and thereby gene expression when acetylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Cerbo et al., 2014</xref>), whereas trimethylation of the same residue acts as a repressive heterochromatic mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daujat et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In both <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, unbiased mass spectrometry hasuncovered the repertoire of the most prevalent histone PTMs, including singular marks. However, only few of them were mapped at the outer surface of the octamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saraf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trelle et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we investigated in depth how histone H4 PTMs could influence chromosome organization and gene regulation in apicomplexan parasites. We report versatile modifications at lysine 31 of histone H4 (H4K31), which lies at the protein–DNA interface close to the dyad axis of the nucleosome. Genome-wide mapping revealed that H4K31 could be either acetylated or methylated and that enrichment of these marks occurred in a mutually exclusive manner. In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, the H4K31 residue tended to be acetylated at the promoter of a nearby active gene and to be mono-methylated in the core body of the gene. H4K31me1 occupancy was inversely correlated with gene expression, suggesting that the mark acts as a repressive mark that impedes RNA polymerase progression. In <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, H4K31ac was also seen at the promoter whereas H4K31me1 occupancy was highly enriched at pericentromeric heterochromatin, possibly compensating for the absence of H3K9me3 and HP1 in this atypical chromosome structure in order to maintain a constitutive heterochromatin environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>H4K31 maps at the dyad axis of the nucleosome</title><p>While studying the protein content of nucleosomes from <italic>T. gondii</italic>-infected cells, we and others mapped an acetylation site on histone H4 lysine 31 (H4K31ac) that had previously been largely underestimated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeffers and Sullivan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). This modification was also identified in both the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saraf et al., 2016</xref>) and acetylome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cobbold et al., 2016</xref>) of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> throughout the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle of the parasite. The H4K31 residue is located at the N-terminus of the H4 α1 helix and its side chain is extended in the major groove of the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). The closed state of chromatin results from the interaction of K31 and R35 residues with DNA by a water-mediated hydrogen bond. The addition of an acetyl group to the -NH2 group of the lysine side chain (K31) abolishes its interaction with DNA mediated by a water molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, right panel). Acetylation may therefore destabilize the protein–DNA interface close to the dyad axis of the nucleosome where the residue lies, and thus presumably could open the chromatin. Although the H4K31 residue is well conserved across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), mass spectrometry initially indicates that its acetylation is restricted to metazoans, as an unexpected mark in inflammatory and auto-immune contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soldi et al., 2014</xref>), as it was found neither in yeast nor in the ciliated protozoan <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia et al., 2007</xref>). Recent studies, including our present findings, contradict this view as they show that this PTM also arises in the Apicomplexa phylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cobbold et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeffers and Sullivan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saraf et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29391.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The residue K31 on the lateral surface of histone H4 is a novel PTM.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The high-resolution MS/MS spectrum of the H4K31ac peptide generated from histone H4.

Therefore, H4K31me1-containing foci could be associated with subtelomeric and/or centromeric regions. However, the number of foci observed varied, signifying its dynamic changes across parasite developmental stages. The mark was observed in all asexual forms and remained unaffected by treatment with FR235222 (data not shown).</p><p>Because H4K31 is also a site of methylation, the transition between H4K31ac and H4K31me1 may represent a novel ‘chromatin switch’ that contributes to chromatin structure and function in eukaryotic cells. Nevertheless, a different readout is expected from one species to another. In metazoans, H4K31me1 is temporally regulated during the cell cycle and interplay, if any, with H4K31ac should be restricted to mitotic chromosomes. In <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, H4K31me1 formed discrete immuno-fluorescent foci around the nucleus, a pattern quite distinct from that of H4K31ac typified by a diffused signal distributed throughout the parasite nuclei. As H4K31me1 and H4K31ac have distinct nuclear locations and different stoichiometry, H4K31ac being a low-abundance mark, the transition between H4K31me1 and H4K31ac may be not an issue in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> as it can be in <italic>T. gondii</italic> where both modifications are concomitantly distributed throughout euchromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Nucleosomes with H4K31ac and H4K31me1 are enriched at the promoter and at the core body of active genes, respectively</title><p>To further explore whether H4K31ac and H4K31me1 are indeed alternative antagonistic PTMs on the same H4 molecules in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, we examined their genome-wide distributions using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq). We first investigated the relative performance of our homemade antibodies in terms of specificity, sensitivity and the number and distribution of peaks. We observed low variability and a high degree of similarity in read coverage between technical replicates, regardless of the antibodies used for immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next compared the locations of the peaks from each antibody type. Visual display of the chromosomal distribution indicated that H4K31ac and H4K31me1 exhibited distinct patterns of enrichment across the chromosomes and were mutually exclusive genome-wide (e.g., Chr. Ib, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). Zooming in to detailed gene level revealed that H4K31ac was enriched in distinct peaks at intergenic regions (IGRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>), of which 75% mapped outside the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>), in line with the euchromatic in situ localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The calculated average profile of H4K31ac showed a pattern strikingly similar to that of H3K14ac and H3K4me3, characterized by high signals at 5’UTR/promoter that drop sharply after the translational initiation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>). Conversely, H4K31me1 showed a distinct pattern of enrichment, best discernable at large genes, spanning from the ATG to the entire gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>) and absent from IGRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). The H4K31me1 computed average density profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>) fully matched with gene prediction, making this mark useful for the explicit detection of unannotated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Remarkably, these data allowed the identification of H4K31me1 as a novel PTM whose spreading was restricted to gene bodies in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b and d</xref>). However, this mark was not the only one to decorate chromatin in this fashion as a similar pattern was also found for the genome-wide distribution of H3K4me1 in the type I (RH) <italic>T. gondii</italic> strain (Kami Kim, unpublished data available at ToxoDB). We have re-examined the extent and genome-wide scattering of H3K4me1 using a type II (Pru) genetic background. We observed a high degree of similarity in read coverage between H3K4me1 and H4K31me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3a</xref>) and a similar pattern of enrichment over the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3b</xref>).

We therefore interrogated whether the enrichment patterns of modified H4K31 could specify levels of gene expression in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. We first conducted a global transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq of tachyzoites during growth phase in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Cluster analysis revealed varying levels of gene expression with cluster Q1 displaying the highest level, clusters Q2 and Q3 defining intermediate levels, and cluster Q4 displaying the lowest level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>). High mRNA level (in Q1, which includes the <italic>GRA1, MAG1</italic> and <italic>SRS</italic> genes) was associated with a high level of H4K31ac upstream of the ATG together with an enrichment along the gene body, which coincided with the expected lack of H4K31me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9e and f</xref>).

This dual histone PTM was also detected on nucleosomes surrounding genes that have been recognized as being expressed exclusively during sexual stages in the definitive feline host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hehl et al., 2015</xref>). The co-enrichment of H3K9me3 and H3K14ac was somehow restricted to the transcriptional units that become active in the sexual stages (shown in red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>). However, H3K14ac was seen to spread over some tachyzoite-expressed neighboring genes (shown in blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>) and probably contributes to their activation.

Although the reasons for this pattern remains unclear, it seems to bookmark genes that are repressed temporally, which await parasite-stage differentiation for stage-specific expression. Thus, H3K14ac and H3K9me3 could form the so-called bivalent chromatin domain capable of silencing developmental genes while keeping them poised for rapid activation upon cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voigt et al., 2013</xref>). The H3K14ac along with the repressive mark H3K27me3 have been shown to be enriched in a similar manner at a subset of inactive promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karmodiya et al., 2012</xref>). Bivalent domains have gathered wide attention because they might contribute to the precise unfolding of gene expression programs during cell differentiation. Apparently, these bivalent marks are restricted to inactive stage-specific promoters, which differ from both pericentromeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s4">Figure 10—figure supplement 4</xref>) and telomeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10d</xref>) heterochromatin which are decorated by H3K9me3 but missing H3K14ac enrichment. It was previously reported that H3K9me3 typifies centrometric heterochromatin in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2011</xref>) but this study conflicts with our data in reporting enrichment of the mark to ‘poised’ stage-specific genes. This discrepancy could be explained by the genetic background of the parasite strain, as Brooks and colleagues infected human cells with a type I (RH) strain that lost the ability to develop into mature cysts whereas we used infections with a type II strain (Pru), which is more relevant as it does readily develop tissue cysts and latent infections in animals.</p><p>Taken together, our data highlight unique chromatin signatures that are associated with transcription rate in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Genes clustered in Q1 are primarily defined by low H4K31me1 enrichment and enhanced acetylation at both promoter and the 5’ proximal gene body, whereas those from Q2 and Q3 are markedly typified by the presence of H4K31 methylation in the gene body and an acetylation mark restricted to the promoter. In this context, H4K31ac would be predicted to disrupt histone–DNA interaction, thereby affecting nucleosome stability while promoting RNA polymerase progression across transcribed units. Conversely, H4K31me1 could act as a transcription-linked repressive mark that may hypothetically slow the progress of the RNA polymerase on active genes, proabbly by modulating the transcription-dependent histone turnover, but this still needs to be established. Nevertheless, the mark does not elicit its predicted repressive effect on constitutively repressed genes. Otherwise, we identified a subset of genes that were typified by their exclusive expression in chronic and sexual stages that are displaying typical bivalent chromatin domains characterized by H3K9me3 and H3K14ac enrichments in acute-phase tachyzoites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>H4K31me1 enrichment, a blueprint for unannotated genes and uncharacterized long non-coding RNAs</title><p>As mentioned previously, H4K31me was mainly detected throughout the body of active genes with translation start and stop codons as boundaries, and its enrichment was inversely correlated to the yield of mRNA.

Although our ChIP-seq analysis confirmed the absence of pericentric enrichment of both H3K9me3 and HP1, it clearly highlighted a remarkable enrichment of H4K31me1 at pericentromeric regions that flank the cenH3-enriched centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12a</xref>).

Proteome-wide mapping of acetylome/methylome as well as nucleosome protein content analyses allowed the identification of H4K31 as a site for both acetylation and methylation across a wide range of species, including those from the apicomplexan parasitic phylum. The K31 residue lies at the N-terminus of the histone H4 α1 helix, and its positively charged side chain forms water-mediated interactions with the DNA phosphate backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Its acetylation was predicted to trigger substantial conformational changes in the nucleosome by shifting the side chain of lysine from the unacetylated to the acetylated state, causing the loss of the water-mediated interactions that K31 establishes with DNA and the residue R35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). However, this prediction was not validated as X-ray crystallography did not indicate large structural changes to nucleosomes when glutamine was substituted for lysine to mimic the acetylated state (H4Q31, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iwasaki et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, H4K31ac may increase DNA unwrapping at the entry-exit point of the nucleosome, thus giving access to the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers that act on nucleosome disassembly and turnover as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chatterjee et al. (2015</xref>). The latter assumption would fit with the ‘regulated nucleosome mobility’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cosgrove et al., 2004</xref>), which predicts that outer surface PTMs (e.g., H3K36ac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Williams et al., 2008</xref>]) regulate the equilibrium between mobile and relatively stationary nucleosomes by altering histone–DNA molecular interplay.</p><p>In both <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, genome-wide studies pinpointed a local enrichment of H4K31ac at active gene promoters, in line with the cooperative contribution of acetylation and other PTMs in shaping a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state. H4K31ac relieves nucleosomal repression thus facilitating the access of the transcriptional machinery to the DNA template, whereas H4K31 monomethylation probably locks the nucleosome in a repressed conformation that maintains chromatin in a closed or semi-closed state also called poised-state, while it also prevents GCN5-related HAT from catalyzing the acetylation of the residue. Interestingly, apart from its predicted effects on the nucleosome mobility and chromatin state, we found that, in <italic>T. gondii</italic>,H4K31ac also prevents methylation at the body of highly expressed genes, thereby ensuring maximal efficacy of the RNA polymerase progression and activity. Indeed, we found H4K31me1 enrichment only in the transcribed coding sequence of a subset of genes typically associated with limited activity of the RNA polymerase II. In a model where the nucleosome disassembles in front of transcribing RNA polymerase II to allow its physical progression across transcribed units, it is plausible that, by stabilizing the wrapping of DNA around the histone octamer, H4K31me1 slows down RNA Pol II processing along the fiber and thus reduces the level of transcription.</p><p>Aside from specific patterns of PTMs, histone chaperones significantly contribute to controlling how the RNA polymerase II engages the nucleosome in and around a promoter and during the elongation step. For instance, the FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transactions) histone chaperone has been shown to assist first in the removal of nucleosomes ahead of the transcribing RNA Pol II and next in their reassembly after polymerase passage. Although we provide evidence that H4K31 modifications may contribute to gene regulation at least in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, studies in other eukaryotes have underlined H4K31's instrumental role in the recruitment or mobilization of histone chaperone at transcribed genes. In budding yeast, H4K31 along with two proximal residues on the side of the nucleosome (i.e., H4R36 and H3L61) promotes the recruitment of the yFACT subunit Spt16 across transcribed genes, as assessed by the typical change in Spt16 distribution in which occupancy shifts toward the 3’ ends of transcribed genes in the H4K31E yeast mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nguyen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The versatility of H4K31 goes beyond even these modifications as ubiquitylation of H4K31 has been reported as an additional regulatory PTM for transcription elongation in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that the histone H1.2 subtype, while localized at target genes, regulates the elongating RNA Polymerase II in an interaction that is typified by phosphorylation of Ser2 on its carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). Indeed, it was shown that upon interaction with the Ser2-phosphorylated CTD of the active RNA Pol II, the histone H1.2 subtype becomes able to recruit the Cul4A E3 ubiquitin ligase and PAF1 elongation complexes. In turn, those proteins stimulate H4K31 ubiquitylation that positively influences the accumulation of the H3K4me3/H3K79me2 signature, thereby leading to a more productive elongation phase of transcription. Importantly, blocking H4K31 ubiquitylation by K31R mutation markedly reduces H3K4 and H3K79 methylation and consequently impairs gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In order to test the functional significance of H4K31 modifications in vivo, we tried to substitute H4K31 in the <italic>T. gondii</italic> genome with alanine or glutamine to mimic acetyl lysine or with arginine to mimic nonacetylated lysine but were unsuccessful in achieving these substitutions (data not shown). Engineered budding yeast with those substitutions did not significantly affect cell viability but led to an unexpected increase of telomeric and ribosomal DNA silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hyland et al., 2005</xref>), both of which argue for the mutations' driving a non-permissive chromatin state. This finding does not fit with our working model in whichH4K31Q should promote open chromatin. It is plausible, however, that the substitutions did not faithfully mimic the effects of the modifications in these instances. In sharp contrast with the aforementioned substitutions, glutamic acid (E) that mimics succinylated lysine was shown to compromise the growth in budding yeast severely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xie et al., 2012</xref>), maybe as a consequence of the alteration in the distribution of Spt16 across yeast genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nguyen et al., 2013</xref>). Succinylation on H4K31 has also been detected by mass spectrometry in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nardelli et al., 2013</xref>). This modification could drastically impact intranucleosomal structure and induce ‘abnormal’ histone–DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>In this context, H4K31 methylation would counteract the activating effect of H4K31 acetylation and succinylation, by preventing the nucleosome from adopting an open conformation that permits gene expression. The analysis in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> revealed remarkable features of H4K31me1 by stressing a much more pronounced repressive character because the modification was exclusively restricted to non-permissive silenced chromosomal zones. Originally, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> heterochromatin — in which clusters of genes are maintained in a silent state — was singularly defined by increased nucleosomal occupancy, histone deacetylation, H3K9me3 and the binding of PfHP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scherf et al., 2008</xref>). Most of the genome can be characterized as euchromatin, but those silenced regions were organized towards the periphery of the nucleus and contain, among others, the <italic>var</italic>, rif and stevor families that cluster together, proximal to each telomere. The repression of the <italic>var</italic> genes, for instance, involves the trimethylation of H3K9 and its spreading to the next-door nucleosome by the action of HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scherf et al., 2008</xref>). H4K31me1 enrichment was detected, although unevenly and at low rates, in the vicinity of few <italic>var</italic> (5 out of 64) and <italic>rifin</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12c</xref>). However, the modification does not spread while its enrichment fades quickly and probably remains limited to the site of heterochromatin initiation where both H3K9me3 and HP1 levels culminate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12c</xref>). The lack of spread of H4K31me1 along a series of nucleosomes may be explained by the absence of a competent protein reader that specifically recognizes the PTM and recruits the H4K31me1-catalyzing methyltransferase. To date, no H4K31me1-reading protein has been identified, although the PTM is not buried and hence is accessible for the binding of regulatory factors. In fact, the bromodomain of BRD4 is able to recognize the acetylated isoform of H4K31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Filippakopoulos et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although H4K31me1 occupancy is generally limited across the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome, the modification is by far the most promiscuous PTM found at pericentromeric zones of all chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">2</xref>). As such, both H4K31me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>) and centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoeijmakers et al., 2012</xref>) were found to be clustered towards the nuclear periphery. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> centromeres were originally described as displaying a unique epigenetic status typified by the noteworthy absence of the canonical pericentromeric PTM H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoeijmakers et al., 2012</xref>), which is present in all species including <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s4">Figure 10—figure supplement 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2011</xref>). Clearly this study has emphasized an unusual role of H4K31me1 in pericentromeric heterochromatin in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and has provided new insights on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation in <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p><p>In metazoans, H4K31me1 was shown to decorate the mitotic chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). In this regard, H4K31me1 is a novel mitotic marker that targets newly synthesized H4 that may be involved in the regulation of chromosomal condensation and segregation during mitosis. H4K31 is structurally very close to H3K56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), the acetylation of which is reported to increase the binding affinity of H3 toward histone chaperones, thereby promoting nucleosome assembly during the S phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Collectively, our results argue for a similar role for H4K31me1 in chromatin assembly during DNA replication in metazoans. However, the picture appears more complex than this as H4K31 methylation, unlike H3K56ac, is predicted to prevent histone exchange, thereby slowing histone turnover rate behind the replication forks, which overall contributes to the stabilization of newly incorporated nucleosomes in chromatin.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that H4K31 acetylation and methylation are associated with very distinct nuclear functions in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Moreover, we demonstrate the evolution of distinct epigenetic strategies to organize chromosome regions that are essential for cell division and gene expression in apicomplexan parasites.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Parasites and host cells culture</title><p>HFF primary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bougdour et al., 2009</xref>) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Thermo Fischer Scientific, France) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), 10 mM (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)−1-piperazine ethanesulphonic acid) (HEPES) buffer pH 7.2, 2 mM L-glutamine and 50 μg ml of penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen).

Each 19mer peptide may contain up to four modifications each. Five control spots are included on each array: biotin peptide, c-Myc tag, no histone peptide and two background spots containing a mixture of modifications that are present on the array. Arrays were blocked with tris-buffered saline (TTBS) (10 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) plus 5% nonfat dry milk. Antibodies were diluted in TTBS. Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies (R and D systems). The blots were developed with the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate kit (Thermo Fisher Scientic). The Array Analyze software program designed by Activemotif was used to analyze the spot intensity of the interactions and to generate graphical analysis of the histone peptide–antibody interactions. The Spot Statistics tab gives a comparison of the intensities of each spot in the left and right array. The data points ideally should be on a straight line connecting 0,0 and 1,1 which indicates perfect duplicates. Outliers (or poor replicates) will not fall along the linear line. The Distribution Errors tab displays the errors of the intensities between the right and left spot, normalized to the maximum intensity. Ideally, most of the peptides will contain an error range of 0–5% (which means very little variation between the left and right sides). The Reactivity tab displays the background-subtracted intensity values for all single modified peptides, as well as for control spots. Selecting a modification from the pull-down menu scales the intensity of the selected modification to 1.0 (y-axis). The impact of neighboring modifications on the single modified peptides was further investigated using the Modification Analysis tab and selecting for the modification of interest. The results were graphed as a Specificity factor, which is the ratio of the average intensity of all spots containing the mark divided by the intensity of all spots not containing the mark. All modifications have been accounted for in determining the specificity factor, but only the ten modifications with the highest specificity factor values are graphed. The larger the difference in specificity-factor values for the mark of interest versus other marks, the more specific the interaction. Non-specific signals will decrease the specificity-factor values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and next -generation sequencing in <italic>T. gondii</italic></title><p>HFF cells were grown to confluence and infected with the type II (Pru<italic>∆ku80</italic>) strain. Harvested intracellular parasites were crosslinked with formaldehyde (final concentration 1%) for 8 min at room temperature and the crosslinking was stopped by the addition of glycine (final concentration 0.125M) for 5 min at room temperature. Crosslinked chromatin was lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES KOH pH7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.125% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail) and sheared in shearing buffer (1 mM EDTA pH8.0, 0.5 mM EGTA pH8.0, 10 mM Tris pH8.0, protease inhibitor cocktail) by sonication using a Diagenode Biorupter. Samples were sonicated for 16 cycles (30 s ON and 30 s OFF), to 200–500 base-pair average size.

For library preparation: 10 ng DNA of each sample was converted to phosphorylated blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow polymerase and T4 polymerase (NEB). An ‘A’ base was added to the 3' end of the blunt phosphorylated DNA fragments using the polymerase activity of Klenow (exo minus) polymerase (NEB). Illumina's genomic adapters were ligated to the A tailed DNA fragments, and PCR amplification was performed to enrich ligated fragments using Phusion High Fidelity PCR Master Mix with HF Buffer (Finnzymes Oy). The enriched product of ~200–700 bp was cut out from the gel and purified. For sequencing, the library was denatured with 0.1M NaOH to generate single-stranded DNA molecules, and loaded onto channels of the flow cell at 8pM concentration, amplified in situ using the TruSeq Rapid SR cluster kit (#GD-402–4001, Illumina). Sequencing was carried out by running 100 cycles on Illumina HiSeq 4000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For data analysis, after the sequencing platform generated the sequencing images, the stages of image analysis and base calling were performed using Off-Line Basecaller software (OLB V1.8). After passing the Solexa CHASTITY quality filter, the clean reads were aligned to the <italic>T. gondii</italic> reference genome (Tgo) using BOWTIE (V2.1.0). Aligned reads were used for peak calling of the ChIP regions using MACS V1.4.0. Statistically significant ChIP-enriched regions (peaks) were identified by comparison of two samples, using a p-value threshold of 10<sup>−5</sup>. The peaks in each sample were then annotated by the overlapped gene using the newest <italic>T. gondii</italic> database. The EXCEL/BED format file containing the ChIP-enriched regions was generated for each sample. For data visualization, the mapped 100 bp reads represent enriched DNA fragments identified by the ChIP experiment. Any region of interest in the raw ChIP-seq signal profile can be directly visualized in the genome browser. We used 10-bp resolution intervals (10-bp bins) to partition the stacked reads region, and counted the number of reads in each bin.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has assembled a list of concerns that we would like you to address in a response letter.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes the characterization of histone post-translational modifications H4K31Ac and H4K31me1 in the apicomplexan parasites <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Most characterized histone PTMs in these organisms have been within the N terminal tails and globular domain PTMs are a recent focus of study in the chromatin literature. The authors propose a PTM switch on H4K31 that governs chromatin state in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. The authors also identify the enzyme responsible for addition and removal of H4K31Ac. The modifications described here have not been examined closely in any organism, and the data presented suggest potential for important functions in gene regulation and chromosome function. Data are also presented suggesting a function for H4K31me1 in metazoan mitosis. Overall the findings appear interesting and potentially important, but there are a number of methodological points that must be clarified and analyses that must be supplied. Aspects of data presentation and literature citation also require improvement.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The specificity of the H4K31Ac and H4K31me1 antibodies is crucial, but these data aren't shown. Modification antibodies that are truly specific are difficult to generate, and there have been many reports of commercial H4ac and histone lysine methyl antibodies cross-reacting with other modified residues or reactivity influenced by other nearby PTMs (Rothbart 2015 Mol Cell). Much of the data on H4K31Ac is consistent with the antibody having cross-reactivity to H3K14Ac. Please show antibody specificity data, which should demonstrate that the antibodies do not cross-react with common histone PTMs, perhaps by probing available PTM arrays. This is the most essential revision and the authors should insure that antibody specificity is unambiguously demonstrated.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the MS/MS analysis detecting H4K31ac but it is not clear from the text how this MS was performed (Results section and Materials and methods say Tg infected cells) and how extensively the PTM on histones or H4 were examined. The sample size disclosure form says 3 replicates were performed, but we are not given any information about the concordance of these replicates or full data. Did the authors detect the modification in Plasmodium by MS? The modifications were not reported in the cited Trelle 2009 paper. If the authors did not perform MS for Pf H4, they should cite Cobbold 2016 Science Reports who found H4K31ac using an affinity approach similar to the one performed by Jeffers 2012 for the Tg acetylome, and Saraf 2016 JProtRes, which is in the references, but not cited as having reported this PTM (Introduction, last paragraph).</p><p>3) More conclusive evidence for the H4K31me1 PTM in Tg and/or Pf must be provided, as the authors did not cite a reference nor could we find published data that such a PTM has been reported using MS. Did the authors detect H4K31me1 in their 3 MS replicates? As cited by the authors, Nardelli (mBIO 2013) detected H4K31succ but the authors do not mention 2 additional modifications, H4K31me2 and H4K31form, that were also reported in that study. Based on the genome localization the abundance of the PTM appears greater than H4K31ac. Further, given the access to specific antibodies, an affinity approach should be straightforward to confirm the PTM even if the bulk histone approach was unsuccessful.</p><p>4) Conclusions derived from cytological data are usually supported by just one image, or at best several images. The claims regarding the mitotic role of H4K31me1 in metazoans (paragraph four in subsection &quot;H4K31me1 associates in vivo with distinct chromatin patterns&quot;) are very weakly supported. The conclusion stated in paragraph three is not supported at all. A quantitative analysis of the cytology should be presented (percentages of images matching those shown) with statistics where appropriate. All conclusions should be supported by data, as in:</p><p>a) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> FR235222 was reported previously by the authors to be a specific inhibitor of HDAC3. The image provided suggests that this inhibitor, but not other HDAC inhibitors, change the abundance of H4K31ac. Quantitation and appropriate statistical analysis is required.</p><p>b) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> Pf parasites are shown in similar experiments as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. These experiments also require quantitation.</p><p>c) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> CRISPR inactivation of candidate TgHDAC was performed. Again, the images shown are convincing, but single images are not sufficient. The authors need to quantify +red/green signals and provide statistical analysis.</p><p>d) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> CRISPR inactivation of candidate HAT. The authors need to quantify +red/green signals and provide statistical analysis.</p><p>e) The authors state that cyclopeptide inhibitors impact H4K31Ac levels and that other types of HDAC inhibitors do not. However, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, it appears that butyrate and APHA influence H4K31Ac levels.</p><p>5) There are several references to low levels of H4K31ac, but these are not well-supported, and appear to be derived from subjective interpretation of cytology (comparing signal intensity across antibodies is not appropriate). Perhaps mass spectroscopy provides a more solid basis for this assertion, but mass spec data are presented very briefly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.</p><p>6) The presentation of genomics data relies too heavily on genome browser snapshots. These are helpful and appropriate as supporting evidence, but conclusions based on genomic data should be supported by genomic analyses. Some conclusions, like the limitation of H4K31me1 by translational initiation and termination sites (subsection &quot;Nucleosomes with H4K31ac and H4K31me1 are enriched at the promoter and the core body of active genes, respectively&quot;) are not supported at all – transcriptional initiation and termination sites could just as easily be involved. The claim that H3K9me3 and H3K14ac co-localize in poorly transcribed (Q4) genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) is inconsistent with the genomic analysis in Figure 7—figure supplement 1, which does not show an obvious enrichment of either modification in Q4 genes. This may be because Q4 genes are transcriptionally heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6/8</xref> and subsection &quot;Nucleosomes with H4K31ac and H4K31me1 are enriched at the promoter and the core body of active genes, respectively&quot; state that H4K31me1 is a novel mark of transcriptional units, but H3K4me1 (genome-wide data available on Toxodb) seems to have a very similar distribution (also suggested by H3K4me1 data in Figure 7—figure supplement 1, though not discussed), so this statement may not be accurate. Did the authors compare H3K4me1 and H3K31me1 distributions?</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> shows that H4K31me1 marks Tg pericentromeric heterochromatin (discussed in paragraph three of subsection &quot;Distribution of H4K31 modifications across the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome reveals 403 H4K31me1 as a novel pericentromeric PTM&quot;), but this information appears to be based upon the genome-wide data for CenH3 published in Brooks et al., 2013 (also available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.Toxodb.org">www.Toxodb.org</ext-link>). The Brooks paper, which showed the localization of H3K9me2/3 to Tg centromeres should be discussed and cited since the authors examine similarities and differences between Tg and Pf. The Tg ortholog of HP1, which binds H3K9me3, was reported by Gissot et al., 2012 (also not cited), and its localization was reported to centromeres and telomeres.</p><p>9) The data reported for H3K9me3 in this manuscript agree in centromeric localization but conflict in reporting localization to &quot;poised&quot; genes. The definition of &quot;poised&quot; genes is unclear. A table is provided (without a legend or description of samples), but statistical support for enrichment of this mark on poised genes is required, as is further discussion. What proportion of genes in Q4 were poised and were they developmental stage-specific genes?</p><p>10) There are several species in which ncRNA contribute to the organization of centromeres (although probably not Tg based on the authors' data). The Scherf laboratory has characterized ncRNA in Plasmodium, including several that are transcribed at var loci. Are the H4K31me1 marks that flank centromeres in Pf sites of ncRNA transcription? Does the presence of ncRNA at var loci correlate with H4K31me1 localization?</p><p>11) The discussion of H4K31Ac and H4K31me1 functionality is overbroad.

Modification antibodies that are truly specific are difficult to generate, and there have been many reports of commercial H4ac and histone lysine methyl antibodies cross-reacting with other modified residues or reactivity influenced by other nearby PTMs (Rothbart 2015 Mol Cell). Much of the data on H4K31Ac is consistent with the antibody having cross-reactivity to H3K14Ac. Please show antibody specificity data, which should demonstrate that the antibodies do not cross-react with common histone PTMs, perhaps by probing available PTM arrays. This is the most essential revision and the authors should insure that antibody specificity is unambiguously demonstrated.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed an exhaustive characterization of both H4K31ac- and H4K31me1-directed antibodies using modified histone PTM arrays and added those data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>. We have shown that our home-made antibody were highly specific for synthetic peptides with H4K31ac or H4K31me1 over peptides with previously described acetyl marks in histone tails and globular domains. H3K14ac and H4K20me1 were used as controls and showed no reactivity toward H4K31ac and H4K31me1 peptides, respectively. Taken together, these data provide compelling evidence that our antibodies recognize their respective epitopes with high specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the MS/MS analysis detecting H4K31ac but it is not clear from the text how this MS was performed (Results section and Materials and methods say Tg infected cells) and how extensively the PTM on histones or H4 were examined. The sample size disclosure form says 3 replicates were performed, but we are not given any information about the concordance of these replicates or full data. Did the authors detect the modification in Plasmodium by MS? The modifications were not reported in the cited Trelle 2009 paper. If the authors did not perform MS for Pf H4, they should cite Cobbold 2016 Science Reports who found H4K31ac using an affinity approach similar to the one performed by Jeffers 2012 for the Tg acetylome, and Saraf 2016 JProtRes, which is in the references, but not cited as having reported this PTM (Introduction, last paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>We did not perform ms-ms identification for Pf H4. However, H4K31ac was identified in Pf by two comprehensive studies of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteome and acetylome: Saraf et al., 2016 and Cobbold et al., 2016, respectively that we are citing properly in the revised manuscript (Results section, first paragraph). We performed several ms assays in <italic>T. gondii</italic> but modifications at this residue were quite difficult to identify with great confidence by mass spectrometry in our conditions. H4K31ac peptide was at least identified one time with high confidence (as reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using an affinity approach similar to Jeffers and Sullivan, 2012, similar peptides were detected by <italic>Maxquant</italic> and <italic>Proline</italic> but with low confidence. We did not mention those unsuccessful identifications and changed the sample size disclosure accordingly. Nevertheless, H4K31ac was distinctly identified in <italic>T. gondii</italic> by two independent studies (Jeffers and Sullivan, 2012; Xue et al., 2013) as well as in metazoans (Garcia et al., 2005; Garcia et al., 2006; Soldi et al., 2014). Taken together, these findings emphasize the existence H4K31ac on nucleosomes isolated from animal cells or <italic>apicomplexa</italic> parasites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More conclusive evidence for the H4K31me1 PTM in Tg and/or Pf must be provided, as the authors did not cite a reference nor could we find published data that such a PTM has been reported using MS. Did the authors detect H4K31me1 in their 3 MS replicates? As cited by the authors, Nardelli (mBIO 2013) detected H4K31succ but the authors do not mention 2 additional modifications, H4K31me2 and H4K31form, that were also reported in that study. Based on the genome localization the abundance of the PTM appears greater than H4K31ac. Further, given the access to specific antibodies, an affinity approach should be straightforward to confirm the PTM even if the bulk histone approach was unsuccessful.</p></disp-quote><p>Identification of H4K31me1 using a bulk histone approach was unsuccessful in our conditions. Two other studies were also not able to identify the mark in the proteome of <italic>T. gondii</italic> (Nardelli et al., 2013) and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (Saraf et al., 2016) while this PTM was identified with high confidence and several times in mammalian cells (Garcia et al., 2006; Moraes et al., 2015). We then used as an alternative approach antibodies directed specifically against methylated H4K31. As stated in subsection &quot;H4K31me1 associates in vivo with distinct chromatin patterns&quot;, we raised an antibody directed against H4K31me2, a modification reported by Nardelli et al., 2013, however although reacting avidly with the peptide antigen, those did not detect histone H4 in human or parasite protein extracts. We also generated antibodies recognizing H4K31me1 and those were controlled for their specificy as above-mentioned.</p><p>We edited the manuscript accordingly specifically by mentioning all the other PTM occurring at H4K31; corresponding references were also added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Conclusions derived from cytological data are usually supported by just one image, or at best several images. The claims regarding the mitotic role of H4K31me1 in metazoans (paragraph four in subsection &quot;H4K31me1 associates in vivo with distinct chromatin patterns&quot;) are very weakly supported. The conclusion stated in paragraph three is not supported at all. A quantitative analysis of the cytology should be presented (percentages of images matching those shown) with statistics where appropriate. All conclusions should be supported by data, as in:</p></disp-quote><p>Quantitation and statistics were added in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> FR235222 was reported previously by the authors to be a specific inhibitor of HDAC3.

However, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, it appears that butyrate and APHA influence H4K31Ac levels.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree with the reviewer that both Butyrate and APHA trigger more acetylation of H4K31 in the host cell nuclei they fail to increase H4K31ac signal in parasite nuclei as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and quantified in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There are several references to low levels of H4K31ac, but these are not well-supported, and appear to be derived from subjective interpretation of cytology (comparing signal intensity across antibodies is not appropriate). Perhaps mass spectroscopy provides a more solid basis for this assertion, but mass spec data are presented very briefly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer comment that comparing signal intensity across antibodies may lead to subjective interpretations. Therefore and in absence of any quantitative ms-ms data, we have removed any mention to &quot;low level&quot; of H4K31ac (subsection &quot;H4K31ac marks euchromatin in mammalian cells and apicomplexan parasites&quot; and &quot;GCN5b and HDAC3 enzymes fine-tune the H4K31ac levels in Toxoplasma gondii&quot;).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The presentation of genomics data relies too heavily on genome browser snapshots. These are helpful and appropriate as supporting evidence, but conclusions based on genomic data should be supported by genomic analyses. Some conclusions, like the limitation of H4K31me1 by translational initiation and termination sites (subsection &quot;Nucleosomes with H4K31ac and H4K31me1 are enriched at the promoter and the core body of active genes, respectively&quot;) are not supported at all – transcriptional initiation and termination sites could just as easily be involved. The claim that H3K9me3 and H3K14ac co-localize in poorly transcribed (Q4) genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) is inconsistent with the genomic analysis in Figure 7—figure supplement 1, which does not show an obvious enrichment of either modification in Q4 genes. This may be because Q4 genes are transcriptionally heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p></disp-quote><p>After re-reading the manuscript with the reviewers' comments in mind. While you did not require us to do so, we have re-run our analyses to include new data that overall reinforce our initial hypothesis. Indeed, we assessed a variety of RNA-seq expression data (available at ToxoDB and published by Hehl et al., 2015 and Pittman et al., 2014) to re-evaluate the enrichment of H3K9me3 and H3K14ac at genes clustered in Q4. First we uncovered that Q4 genes were indeed transcriptionally heterogeneous. As such, we discovered that the repressive signature H3K9me3 was primarily present at the vicinity of genes typified by low RNA levels in tachyzoites and referenced as stage-specific within the <italic>T. gondii</italic> life cycle. Indeed, we have uncovered that bradyzoite-restricted genes (BAG1, ENO1, SRS) displayed marks of both active (H3K14ac) and silent (H3K9me3) chromatin. This dual histone PTM was also detected on nucleosomes surrounding genes that have been recognized as exclusively expressed during sexual stages in the definitive feline host, like the merozoite gene <italic>GRA11b</italic>. While we have shown few examples in the previous version of the manuscript, we are now providing a tremendous amount of data supporting the conclusion that H3K14ac and H3K9me3 form a bivalent chromatin domain capable of silencing developmental genes while keeping them poised for rapid activation upon cell differentiation. For instance, over the 111 members of the SRS superfamily of proteins annotated in ToxoDB, we identified 66 SRS genes displaying H3K9me3/H3K14ac enrichment, including the aforementioned 52 merozoite (Hehl et al., 2015) along with 8 bradyzoite SRS genes (Pittman et al., 2014) whereas the 14 SRS genes exclusively expressed in tachyzoite (e.g. SAG1 cluster) lack the dual PTM. All these data are discussed (second paragraph in subsection &quot;Interplay between H4K31ac and H4K31me1 predicts distinctive patterns of gene expression in T. gondii&quot;) and displayed in the main new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> as well as in three related <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">3</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6/8</xref> and subsection &quot;Nucleosomes with H4K31ac and H4K31me1 are enriched at the promoter and the core body of active genes, respectively&quot; state that H4K31me1 is a novel mark of transcriptional units, but H3K4me1 (genome-wide data available on Toxodb) seems to have a very similar distribution (also suggested by H3K4me1 data in Figure 7—figure supplement 1, though not discussed), so this statement may not be accurate. Did the authors compare H3K4me1 and H3K31me1 distributions?</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer is right. H3K4me1 displayed a similar distribution over the body of genes that H4K31me1 as reported in ToxoDB but still unpublished by Kami Kim lab. We have reexamined the extent and genome-wide scattering of H3K4me1 and observed a high degree of similarity in read coverage between H3K4me1 and H4K31me1 and a similar pattern of enrichment over the gene body. However, those PTMs are unevenly distributed across the genome, H3K4me1 being occasionally weakly enriched relative to H4K31me1 at few expressed genes. These new data have been now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref> and commented in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> shows that H4K31me1 marks Tg pericentromeric heterochromatin (discussed in paragraph three of subsection &quot;Distribution of H4K31 modifications across the P. falciparum genome reveals 403 H4K31me1 as a novel pericentromeric PTM&quot;), but this information appears to be based upon the genome-wide data for CenH3 published in Brooks et al. 2013 (also available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.Toxodb.org">www.Toxodb.org</ext-link>). The Brooks paper, which showed the localization of H3K9me2/3 to Tg centromeres should be discussed and cited since the authors examine similarities and differences between Tg and Pf.

The definition of &quot;poised&quot; genes is unclear.

What proportion of genes in Q4 were poised and were they developmental stage-specific genes?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revision, we attempted to describe differences between our data and Brooks et al., 2013, in a balanced manner as following: &quot;It was previously reported that H3K9me3 typifies centrometric heterochromatin in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (Brooks et al., 2011) but this study conflicts with our data in reporting enrichment of the mark to &quot;poised&quot; stagespecific genes. This discrepancy could be explained by the genetic background of the parasite strain since Brooks and colleagues infected human cells with a type I (RH) strain that lost the ability to develop into mature cysts while we used infections with a type II strain (Pru) which is more relevant as it does readily develop tissue cysts and latent infections in animals.&quot;</p><p>Concerning the proportion of genes clustered in Q4 harboring a poised signature, please see our response to comment # 6 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) There are several species in which ncRNA contribute to the organization of centromeres (although probably not Tg based on the authors' data). The Scherf laboratory has characterized ncRNA in Plasmodium, including several that are transcribed at var loci. Are the H4K31me1 marks that flank centromeres in Pf sites of ncRNA transcription? Does the presence of ncRNA at var loci correlate with H4K31me1 localization?</p></disp-quote><p>We have no clear correlation. Whereas H3K9me3/HP1 is clearly associated with var and also GC elements according to Macs2. However, H4K31me1 enrichment was detected, it was unevenly and at low rates in the vicinity of few var (5 over 64).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The discussion of H4K31Ac and H4K31me1 functionality is overbroad.
