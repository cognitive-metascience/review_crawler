We show here that LRRK2 kinase interferes with primary cilia formation in cultured cells, human LRRK2 G2019S iPS cells and in the cortex of LRRK2 R1441C mice. Rab10 phosphorylation strengthens its intrinsic ability to block ciliogenesis by enhancing binding to RILPL1. Importantly, the ability of LRRK2 to interfere with ciliogenesis requires both Rab10 and RILPL1 proteins. Pathogenic LRRK2 influences the ability of cells to respond to cilia-dependent, Hedgehog signaling as monitored by Gli1 transcriptional activation. Moreover, cholinergic neurons in the striatum of LRRK2 R1441C mice show decreased ciliation, which will decrease their ability to sense Sonic hedgehog in a neuro-protective circuit that supports dopaminergic neurons. These data reveal a molecular pathway for regulating cilia function that likely contributes to Parkinson’s disease-specific pathology.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

Recent mass spectrometry efforts have revealed a subgroup of Rab GTPases as the primary substrates of LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Steger et al., 2017</xref>). Rab GTPases are master regulators of all membrane trafficking events in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pfeffer, 2017</xref>). LRRK2 phosphorylation modifies the so-called switch 2 regions of Rab proteins that report the identity of the bound nucleotide. Because cognate effector and regulatory proteins interact with Rabs in a nucleotide-dependent manner via this motif, phosphorylation on the switch two loop interferes with the ability of Rabs to bind to most of their partner proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steger et al., 2016</xref>). Given the importance of the LRRK2 kinase in familial Parkinson’s disease, there is great interest in determining which Rab-dependent processes are most significantly impacted by elevated LRRK2 kinase activity.</p><p>We recently showed that Rab29 GTPase, localized on the Golgi, recruits the predominantly cytoplasmic LRRK2 onto membranes and activates it’s ability to phosphorylate downstream Rab8A and Rab10 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Purlyte et al., 2018</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Although Rab8A and Rab10 have distinct localizations and roles in different tissues, they (along with Rab29) have been implicated in the process of ciliogenesis. Primary cilia are single, microtubule-based cellular projections on many types of cells that are critical for developmental signaling via the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway as well as for G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways; they are produced in tight coordination with the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hilgendorf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rohatgi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yoshimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>) showed that exogenous expression of Rab8A protein increased cilia length significantly, consistent with Rab8A being a limiting component of cilia formation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yoshimura et al. (2007)</xref> also discovered that the basal body associated, Cenexin-3 protein binds Rab8A and relocates to the primary cilium together with Rab8A upon serum starvation. Subsequent work has shown that both Rab8A and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Rabin8, are needed in part, for so-called BBSome function in ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knödler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2012</xref>) and also for the delivery of membrane vesicles to the growing cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Rab10 is detected in association with primary cilia in cultured MDCK and LLC-PK1 kidney cells and in rodent renal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babbey et al., 2010</xref>). Rab10 is also reported to be necessary for axonal membrane trafficking and axonal elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We show here that Rab8A and Rab10 have opposing roles in normal ciliogenesis. Unlike Rab8A, Rab10 is a native suppressor of ciliogenesis, and upon LRRK2 phosphorylation, it binds preferentially to RILPL1 (Rab interacting lysosomal protein-like 1) protein to further interfere with cilia formation. These cilia modulatory events have important consequences in the brain where they influence the ability of cholinergic neurons to generate cilia in the somatosensory cortex; loss of cilia will decrease the ability of these neurons to respond to a Sonic hedgehog signal that triggers neuroprotective signaling toward dopaminergic circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gonzalez-Reyes et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rab8A increases while Rab10 inhibits cilia formation in A549 cells</title><p>To explore the relationship between primary cilia and two important LRRK2 substrates, we revisited the contributions of Rab8A and Rab10 to primary cilia formation. Throughout the text, Rab8 will refer to Rab8A unless otherwise indicated. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yoshimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knödler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babbey et al., 2010</xref>), some of the total pool of Rab8A localized at the base and within primary cilia (detected with anti-Arl13b antibody; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, a portion of the total pool of Rab10 localized only to the base of cilia in both hTERT-RPE as well as primary, antibody-panned, rat astrocyte cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To study the roles of Rab8A and Rab10 in primary cilia formation, the proteins were knocked out of A549 cells using CRISPR-Cas9, and their depletions were confirmed by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As shown previously, loss of Rab8A decreased significantly the capacity of A549 or RPE cells to generate primary cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Surprisingly, loss of Rab10 increased the percentage of cells that made primary cilia compared with parental wild type A549 and RPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C,E</xref>). Importantly, the effects of Rab8A or Rab10 knockout on primary cilia formation were reversed upon re-expression of exogenous Rab8A or Rab10 wild type proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>; Rab10,~4 fold overexpressed and Rab8A,~10 fold): exogenous Rab8A stimulated while Rab10 inhibited ciliogenesis in cells lacking these proteins. Note that RPE cells start at a higher level of intrinsic ciliation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right) and thus there is less possibility of enhancing ciliation in this cell type.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40202.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rab10 is a negative regulator of primary cilia formation.</title><p>hTERT-RPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, upper panels) or primary rat astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lower panels) were transfected with GFP-Rab8A (A, left) or GFP-Rab10 (A, right). 24 hr post transfection, cells were fixed and stained for primary cilia using anti-Arl13b antibodies (red).

More than 90% of the endogenous Rab10 was depleted in these cells as seen by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, right panel). Surprisingly, loss of both Rab8A and Rab10 from A549 cells reversed the block of ciliogenesis observed in Rab8A KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, Rab10 is a dominant suppressor of cilia formation. Even though A549 Rab10 KO cells are significantly ciliated, exogenous Rab8A even further increases ciliation in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Thus, Rab8A drives a Rab10-independent pathway for cilia formation. Note that loss of either Rab10 or Rab8A does not change the level of the other protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, Rab8 goes to the cilium in Rab10KO cells, as in wild type cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rab8A and Rab10 mutants cannot be used to mimic phosphorylation</title><p>Phosphorylation of Rab proteins by LRRK2 has been shown to interfere with their ability of to bind to numerous, cognate effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steger et al., 2016</xref>). Studies of protein phosphorylation often utilize substrate mutants generated in the hope that they cannot be phosphorylated (T-to-A) or alternatively, that they will mimic the phosphorylation state (T-to-E). Unfortunately, we were unable to use such mutant Rab8A or Rab10 proteins as a series of functional and localization tests showed that they are nonfunctional. The non-phosphorylatable, threonine to alanine (TA) mutations in both Rab8A and Rab10 failed to reverse their respective ciliation phenotypes observed in knockout cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), indicating that they are non-functional. Light microscopy of A549 cells expressing these mutants showed that unlike wild type Rab8A protein, Rab8A-TA was more concentrated over the Golgi and not seen in cilia; Rab8A-TE was more dispersed than the wild type protein and may aggregate upon expression in HEK293T cells. Rab10-TE was much more concentrated on the Golgi than the wild type protein and Rab10-TA was entirely cytosolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), as confirmed by membrane fractionation after expression in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In vitro experiments using biotin-geranyl pyrophosphate as substrate confirmed that neither Rab8A-TE nor Rab10-TA mutants are good substrates for Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, unlike the phosphorylated versions of Rab8A or Rab10 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Steger et al., 2017</xref>), Rab8A-TE and Rab10-TE failed to show enhanced interaction with GFP-RILPL1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is a very important caution—the TA and TE mutants do not reflect the desired states and should not be used in future experiments exploring the consequences of Rab8A and Rab10 phosphorylation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40202.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Rab8A and Rab10 phospho-site mutants are non-functional proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rab8A-KO and Rab10-KO A549 cells were infected with lentivirus to stably express wild type (WT), phospho-mimetic (TE) or non-phosphorylatable (TA) mutants of Rab8A and Rab10, respectively. 24 hr post transfection, cells were fixed and stained with anti-GFP.

Altogether, these data suggest that the RILPL1 N-terminus interacts with pRab10 in pericentriolar membranes; overexpression of the C-terminus dominantly interferes with cilia formation, perhaps by competing for interactions that localize pRab10 and RILPL1 to that cellular compartment.

In this background, exogenous Rab10 inhibited and Rab8A stimulated ciliogenesis, even in the absence of RILPL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This suggests that Rab8A and Rab10 do not absolutely require RILPL1 for their effects on ciliogenesis or can mediate their effects via another protein such as the related RILPL2. In contrast, when exogenous RILPL1 was introduced into cells lacking Rab8A or Rab10, it was no longer capable of repressing ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). These experiments demonstrate that RILPL1 needs Rab10 to repress ciliogenesis, however, exogenous Rab10 can also suppress ciliogenesis independent of RILPL1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Because cells lacking Rab8A are already poorly ciliated, we cannot discern further RILPL1-inhibition in this cell background.</p><p>It was recently reported that LRRK2 overexpression in HEK293T cells decreases centrosomal cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Madero-Pérez et al., 2018</xref>).

As noted earlier, exogenous RILPL1 was cytosolic but also enriched at the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Its expression was sufficient to trigger an increase in the distance between mother and daughter centrioles in some cells: specifically, 20% of A549 cells showed centrioles &gt; 2 µm apart, whereas 48% of cells showed this phenotype upon RILPL1 expression. However, there was no relationship between RILPL1 expression level and centriolar distance over 3 logs of expression measured by quantitative light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that centriolar separation may be a secondary phenomenon, indirectly triggered in some cells by RILPL1 expression. No change in centriolar distance was detected in RILPL1 KO cells; finally, the ability of RILPL1 to increase centriole distance was completely nullified in Rab10 or Rab8A-KO cells while the RILPL1 localization remained unchanged.

At endogenous levels of expression, we propose that pathogenic LRRK2 generates an inhibitory complex that contains pRab10 and RILPL1. RILPL1 shows enhanced binding to p-Rab10, and our data show that LRRK2 inhibition requires both of these proteins to yield a ciliation defect. In addition, in the absence of pathogenic LRRK2, upon overexpression of RILPL1, we also detect inhibition of cilia formation; this inhibition requires the presence of Rab10, and may reflect a similar inhibitor complex that requires overexpression to generate in the absence of Rab10 phosphorylation. In addition, overexpressed Rab10 can also inhibit cilia formation in a RILPL1-independent manner that may involve RILPL2 or other proteins; RILPL1 appears a more potent inhibitor than Rab10 upon overexpression. Further work is needed to explore this possibility. In summary, our data support a model in which pathogenic LRRK2 alters cilia formation by phosphorylating Rab10, which recruits RILPL1 to coordinately interfere with cilia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, right). In the absence of LRRK2 activation, exogenous RILPL1 can also block ciliation from its location adjacent to the mother centriole; in this scenario, RILPL1 requires Rab10 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, left).

Like their R1441G LRRK2 MEF cell counterparts, LRRK2<sup>G2019S/WT</sup> iPS cells showed 50% less Gli1 expression than wild type cells, and this reduction was directly proportional to the extent of their loss of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,E</xref>).

These cholinergic neurons send long-distance projections onto tyrosine hydroxylase positive, dopaminergic neurons and also receive signals from them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Threlfell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2006</xref>). Dopaminergic neurons send Shh signals to nearby striatal, cholinergic neurons that in return, send neuroprotective signals back to the dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gonzalez-Reyes et al., 2012</xref>). In the striatum, the overall ciliation of neurons was not significantly different in R1441C mice compared with wild type brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Importantly, when primary cilia were specifically monitored for ChAT-positive neurons, there was a striking reduction in the number of ciliated cholinergic neurons in R1441C striatum compared to wild type striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>). R1441C mice had a highly significant cilia defect in cholinergic neurons that was not seen in wild type mice brains. These data suggest that loss of dopaminergic neurons in LRRK2-mediated Parkinson’s disease may be a result of defective ciliogenesis in striatal cholinergic neurons, thus impairing a critical protective loop involving non-cell autonomous Shh signaling between cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown here that Rab8A and Rab10 have opposite effects on ciliogenesis in multiple cell types: Rab8A stimulates cilia formation, while Rab10 inhibits this process. Rab8A and Rab10 share numerous effector proteins, and their phosphorylation by pathogenic LRRK2 kinase interferes with the ability of most of these effectors to interact with the Rabs. However, a few effector proteins, including RILPL1, bind Rab8A and Rab10 with preference for their phosphorylated forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Steger et al., 2017</xref>). This unusual class of effectors gains special focus in efforts to understand the downstream, physiological consequences of hyperactivated LRRK2 kinase that underlies familial Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>We have shown here that pRab10 colocalizes with its RILPL1 effector on pericentriolar membranes adjacent to mother centrioles, and like Rab10, exogenous RILPL1 expression interferes with cilia formation. RILPL1 expression leads to more concentrated localization of pRab10 at centrosomes, consistent with the interaction of these proteins in cells. All of the above mentioned experiments involve exogenous expression of proteins that each may titrate out key players needed for cilia formation. Importantly, under conditions of <italic>endogenous</italic> protein expression, pathogenic LRRK2 kinase interferes with ciliation by generating pRab10 that binds endogenous RILPL1 and blocks cilia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Moreover, LRRK2-mediated ciliation defects were not seen in cells lacking Rab10 or RILPL1, highlighting the importance of this pathway and these proteins in pathogenic LRRK2 signaling. How complexes of pRab10 block cilia formation together with RILPL1 protein will be important to elucidate in the future.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sato et al., 2014</xref> showed previously that mice lacking Rab8A and Rab8B show normal primary cilia formation; these mice die, however due to microvillus atrophy caused by failure to correctly generate these intestinal, apical membranes. Additional knockdown of Rab10 in double-knockout MEF cells reduced the percentage of ciliated cells in that study. It is important to note Rab8B still present in our cells may explain the differences in ciliation phenotypes that we have reported here.</p><p>How does altering ciliogenesis relate to Parkinson’s disease pathology? Parkinson’s disease is associated with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Little is known about primary cilia in the adult brain; both neurons and astrocytes are ciliated, and they contain typical signaling molecules that include AC3, SSTR and the Smoothened protein that is important for Shh signaling. We found, for the first time, that cholinergic neurons in the striatum show cilia defects in R1441C LRRK2 mutant mice; defects were also seen in the somatosensory cortex, marked by either SSTR or AC3. Kottman and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gonzalez-Reyes et al., 2012</xref>) have described a neuroprotective circuit in which Shh increases the resilience of dopaminergic neurons to toxins that mimic Parkinson’s disease-associated, dopaminergic neuron loss. Cholinergic neurons of the striatum receive a Shh signal from dopaminergic neurons, which triggers secretion of dopaminotrophic, neuroprotective GDNF. Our data support a model in which pathogenic LRRK2 in cholinergic neurons impairs their ability to generate cilia, thereby blocking their receipt of the Shh signal from dopaminergic neurons. This pathway may be critical for the protection of dopaminergic neurons in aging brains, and represents a mechanism to explain the selective loss of dopamine neurons associated with the presentation of Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>We cannot yet comment on the status of astrocyte cilia in LRRK2 mutant mice. Anti-AC3 antibodies rarely label astrocytes after postnatal day 10, and Arl13b has been used previously as an astrocyte cilia marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kasahara et al., 2014</xref>). In our hands, mouse anti-Arl13b antibodies labeled cell bodies and processes of GFAP-positive and negative glial cells but failed to label primary cilia specifically. A possible explanation is that astrocyte cilia are four times shorter than neuronal cilia in rodent brains and they are deeply recessed into a ciliary pocket, perhaps making them harder to label and/or detect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breunig et al., 2008</xref>). Additional work will be needed to assess the consequences of pathogenic LRRK2 on astrocyte ciliiogenesis throughout the brain.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that LRRK2-mediated familial Parkinson’s disease is quite distinct from more classic diseases of ciliogenesis called ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). Patients carrying mutations in genes critical for cilia formation suffer diverse phenotypes including polycystic kidney disease, retinal degeneration, obesity, skeletal malformations and brain anomalies. Many of these symptoms are due to critical, developmental defects in Hedgehog and Wnt signaling processes that require ciliary pathways for proper signal transduction, even before birth. Because LRRK2 modulates Rab GTPase activity rather than permanently inactivating it, many cell types may have normal cilia formation or shorter cilia with decreased but still functional signaling capacity. It will be important to determine which cells and tissues display the greatest cilia defects in LRRK2 models of Parkinson’s disease, and try to understand how those changes lead to specific loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain.</p><p>In summary, pathogenic LRRK2 has a profound effect on cilia in cultured cells, and shown here, in human iPS cells and mutant mouse brains. Loss of ciliation correlates directly with loss of Shh signal reception in the striatum; other signaling events may also by altered. Olfactory receptor signals require cilia, and anosmia (loss of smell) is one of the earliest symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Future characterization of brain cilia in specific neuronal subtypes will provide critical information regarding pathways that may be altered in cells expressing pathogenic LRRK2; moreover, ciliation should be evaluated in cells from patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. Finally, Rab10 expression levels were reported as significantly increased in Alzheimer’s disease brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that Rab10’s role as a ciliogenesis inhibitor may also be relevant to Alzheimer’s disease pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (WT and R1441G) as well as hTERT-RPE cells were ciliated by overnight serum starvation in DMEM medium alone. For A549 cells, cells were plated at 80% confluency and 24 hr later, subjected to 2% serum for 48 hr. Neither rat astrocytes nor iPS cells needed cilia induction. Rat astrocytes made primary cilia after one week in culture while undifferentiated iPS cells made cilia by 72 hr in culture on matrigel. To identify primary cilia, cells were stained for cilia markers Arl13b or acetylated tubulin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Membrane fractionation</title><p>Cells were chilled on ice, washed with ice cold PBS, and swelled in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4. After 15 min, 5X buffer was added to achieve a final concentration of resuspension buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM DTT, 20 µM GDP, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)), and the suspension was passed 20 times through a 25 gauge syringe. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 X <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C. The postnuclear supernatant was spun 100,000 X <italic>g</italic> for 20 min in a table top ultracentrifuge in TLA100.2 rotor; the resulting supernatant was the cytosol fraction. Membrane pellets were solubilized in 1% Triton X100 containing 1X resuspension buffer. Protein was estimated by Bradford assay (BioRad, Richmond, CA). Samples containing 25 μg of membrane protein, or the equivalent volume of cytosolic protein, were heated at 95°C for 2 min after addition of 5X SDS–PAGE sample buffer. Samples were loaded in duplicate onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels for imunoblotting; filters were incubated with chicken anti-GFP (Aves, 1:2000) overnight then with donkey anti‐chicken 680 (Licor, 1:10,000) for 1 hr, imaged using an Odyssey Infrared scanner (Licor), and quantified using ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Hedgehog signaling</title><p>MEFs were cultured in 24 well plates, and upon confluency, serum starved in DMEM and treated with 200 nM MLi2 or DMSO. At the same time, cells were treated with either 25 nM Sonic hedgehog (Shh) or PBS. After 16 hr ± MLi2,±Shh treatment, cells were lysed for RNA extraction and qPCR of Gli1 mRNA. Human patient derived iPS cells already have high Gli1 levels and did not need Shh treatment; iPS cells were lysed for qPCR analysis of Gli1 after 72 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>To extract total RNA, cells are lysed in Trizol (Sigma) for 5 min in an RNA-free zone. RNA extraction was performed using chloroform/isopropyl alcohol according to the manufacturer.

Animal studies and breeding were approved by the University of Dundee ethical committee and performed under a U.K. Home Office project license. Mice were multiply housed at an ambient temperature (20–24°C) and humidity (45–55%) and maintained on a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle, with free access to food (SDS RM No. three autoclavable) and water. Genotyping of mice was performed by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from ear biopsies. Primer 1 (5’ -CTGCAGGCTACTAGATGGTCAAGGT −3’) and Primer 2 (5’ –CTAGATAGGACCGAGTGTCGCAGAG- 3’) were used to detect the wild-type and knock-in alleles. Homozygous LRRK2-R1441C and littermate wild-type controls (7 months of age) were used for experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.

The A549 RILPL1 knockout cell line was generated using sense and anti-sense paired guides DU57861 and DU57867 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mrcppureagents.dundee.ac.uk">https://mrcppureagents.dundee.ac.uk</ext-link>), targeting exon 3 of RILPL1; sense guide: GGTGATGAAGAAGCTGAAGG (DU57861); anti-sense guide: GCTCCCGCTCTGACATGCCT (DU57867). Cells at about 80% confluency were co-transfected in a six-well plate with the pair of constructs using Lipofectamine LTX reagent (9 μl Lipofectamine LTX and 2.5 mg DNA per well). After 24 hr transfection, the medium was replaced with medium Supplemented with puromycin (2 mg/ml). After 24 hr selection, the medium was replaced with medium without puromycin and cells were left to recover for 48 hr before performing single-cell sorting using an Influx cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). Single cells were placed in individual wells of a 96-well plate containing DMEM Supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin,100 mg/ml streptomycin and 100 mg/ml normocin (InvivoGen).

Highly cross absorbed H + L secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) conjugated to Alexa 488, Alexa 568 or Alexa 647 were used at 1:2000 or 1:4000. All antibody dilutions for tissue staining included 1% DMSO to help antibody penetration. All images were obtained using a spinning disk confocal microscope (Yokogawa) with an electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera (Andor, UK) and a 100 × 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Images were analyzed using Fiji (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fiji.sc/">https://fiji.sc/</ext-link>) and whenever necessary, were presented as maximum intensity projections.

GFP-Rab8A or GFP-Rab10 were then immunoprecipitated using GFP binding protein immobilized on Sepharose for 1 hr at 4°C. Resin was washed 3 times with 1X membrane fractionation resuspension buffer and eluted with 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The elutions were run on 12% SDS-PAGE gels for immunoblotting, detecting prenylation Streptavidin 800 nm (Licor, 1:1000) then chicken anti GFP (Aves 1:2000). Membranes were incubated with donkey anti chicken 680 (Licor 1:10,000) for 1 hr, imaged using an Odyssey Infrared scanner (Licor0 and quantified using ImageJ software. For Rab8A, dishes were treated with 10 µM lovastatin 16 hr before lysis—because Rab8A is monoprenylated, this increased the pool of non-prenylated Rab8A in the cytosol, enabling us to assay for prenylation capacity in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Mouse brain processing and primary cilia analyses</title><p>Homozygous LRRK2-R1441C and littermate wild-type controls (7 months of age) were terminally anesthetized and perfused by injection of PBS into the left cardiac ventricle followed by injection of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS before collecting the brains for analysis. Mice brains were immersed in 30% sucrose for 2 days until they were completely submerged. Brains were then embedded in plastic blocks with OCT (BioTek, USA), frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C. While embedding, the anterior and posterior sides of the brains in the block were noted. For cryosectioning, OCT blocks were kept at −20°C for 10 min. The brains were oriented to cut sagittal sections on the cryotome (Leica CM3050S, Germany) at 16 µm thickness and adhered onto SuperFrost plus tissue slides (Thermo Fisher, USA). This orientation helped in visualizing cortex, hippocampus and striatal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>).</p><p>Slices closest to the midline were chosen for immunostaining. For primary cilia staining in brain sections, frozen slides were thawed at RT for 10 min then gently washed with PBS for 5 min. Sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 15 min. Sections were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and 2% bovine calf serum in PBS for 2 hr at RT. Sections were incubated overnight with primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies and incubated with secondary antibodies (Thermo Scientific, 1:1000) at room temperature for 2 hr. Stained tissues were overlayed with Mowiol and a glass coverslip. Three brain areas were chosen – Somatosensory area of the cerebral cortex, pyramidal layer of the hippocampus and striatal area of the caudoputamen, adjacent to the lateral ventricle. Four to five regions within each brain area were imaged using 0.75 µm Z-sampling for each mouse brain. All image visualizations and analyses were performed using Fiji (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fiji.sc">https://fiji.sc</ext-link>). To analyze primary cilia, maximum intensity projections of Z-stacks were median filtered, thresholded and the resulting mask was subjected to the skeletonize function. Number of Primary cilia structures in these masks were then counted using Analyze &gt; Analyze Particles. To measure primary cilia lengths, the output image from the previous step was subsequently analyzed using Analyze &gt; Skeleton &gt; Analyze Skeleton &gt; Longest shortest path function. The number of nuclei in the cerebral cortex and striatal regions of the brain were determined by analyzing maximum intensity projections of the DAPI channel. The image was median filtered, subjected to ‘Fill Holes’, ‘Watershed’ followed by Analyze &gt; Analyze Particles. The number of nuclei in the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus was determined manually by differential pseudo-coloring of the Z-stack to overcome counting errors caused by tight packing of the nuclei and intense nucleoli staining of neurons in this region. For cilia analysis of iPS cells, undifferentiated cells were plated on matrigel coated coverslips and cultured for 72 hr; the cells were subconfluent, two dimensional monolayers rather than organoids. Upon confluency (5 days), they lose their ciliation and were not analyzed further.</p><sec id="s4-15-1"><title>Quantitation of centriolar distance</title><p>A549 cells transfected with RILPL1-GFP and stained for Centrin-3 or gamma tubulin were imaged on a confocal microscope with Z-step size of 0.5 µm. Distances were quantified from cells where only two dots were visible; cells in mitosis were excluded based on nuclear DAPI staining. Only a single plane from a Z-stack was used to quantify the distance between centrioles to eliminate error introduced by Z-sampling. The distance was measured using FIJI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fiji.sc">https://fiji.sc</ext-link>) by drawing a straight line between the centers of the centriole dots. RILPL1 expression was quantified in FIJI by first subtracting background from the sum-intensity projection images, outlining the cells, followed by measuring the integrated density of the signal from a single cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-2"><title>Statistics</title><p>Graphs were made using Graphpad Prism six software.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Christopher G Burd as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Novick (Reviewer #3). Reviewer #2 remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has highlighted the concerns that require revision and/or responses, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript presents an investigation into the roles of LRRK2, Rab8A, Rab10, and RILPL1 in ciliogenesis and report that Parkinson's Disease-associated alterations in LRRK2 activity lead to compromised cilium assembly and Hedgehog signaling. Overall, the reviewers considered the conclusion that LRRK2 regulates the activities of Rab8 and Rab10 in ciliogenesis to be well supported by the data. Although the study provides little mechanistic insight into the specific functions of Rab8 and Rab10 in ciliogenesis, it does provide an interesting and potentially important insight into the etiology of Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) It is not firmly established that Rab8 and Rab10 play important roles in ciliogenesis in cell types other than the A549 cell line (see reviewer 2, major comment 1), which is not commonly used for investigating ciliogenesis. The impact of the work could be better evaluated by repeating a limited number of key experiments in RPE cells or wildtype MEFs (e.g. to show that Rab10/RILPL1 can inhibit ciliogenesis in these cells). This seems to have been addressed with experiments done using RPE cells (subsection “Rab8 activates while Rab10 inhibits cilia formation in A549 cells”, first paragraph), but the data is not shown. At a minimum, this data should be shown.</p><p>2) Neither the Rab8 or Rab10 T-to-E/A mutant proteins are functional and it seems likely that the mutant Rabs are non-functional independent of their presumed effects on phosphorylation, and this point is not adequately explored or clearly conveyed. It is shown that Rab10 T73A is cytosolic, explaining why it is non-functional. Why are the other rab8 and Rab10 mutants non-functional? Are they isoprenylated? If the mutants do not selectively affect phosphorylation (e.g. they alter isoprenylation), their use seems tangential to the main point of the paper.</p><p>3) The effect of the Rab10 LRRK2 phosphorylation site mutations (T73A, E) on its association with RILP1 should be determined, similar to the analysis of Rab8 mutants and RILP1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This information is important for interpreting the phenotypes of the mutant proteins.</p><p>4) Please note that each of the reviewers were confused by certain aspects of the presentation (see the reviews). I encourage you to consider revising the presentation to address these sources of confusion.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This study addresses the role of LRRK, a protein kinase implicated in Parkinson's disease, in ciliogenesis. Mutations in LRRK that cause PD activate its protein kinase activity, but how this leads to PD is unknown. The study follows an earlier publication that reported that Rab proteins are the principal substrates for LRRK, including Rab8 and Rab10, the focus of this study. Rab8 has previously been implicated in ciliogenesis, and the authors present evidence that phosphorylation of Rab8 by LRRK inhibits its function in ciliogenesis. In contrast, the authors find that depletion of Rab10, another Rab GTPase implicated in ciliogenesis, potentiates ciliogenesis and that phosphorylation of Rab10 by LRRK potentiates its inhibitory effect on ciliogenesis via enhanced interaction with RILPL1, a Rab10 effector of unknown function. It is shown that depletion of RILPL1 potentiates ciliogenesis, similar to depletion of Rab10. Finally, it is shown that PD mutations in LRRK cause a decrease in the proportion of ciliated cells and deficient SSH signaling in striatal cholinergic neurons of the mouse brain. The specific functions of Rab8 or Rab10 in ciliogenesis or PD are largely unknown. This is a technically sound, well controlled study, that clearly supports roles for Rab8 and Rab10 in ciliogenesis, though if these GTPases play direct, specific roles in ciliogenesis remains an open question. In my opinion, the major value of this study lies in the identification of functional consequences for LRRK-mediated phosphorylation of Rab8 and Rab10 in ciliogenesis, a finding that puts a spotlight on ciliogenesis for future studies of PD etiology.</p><p>Phenotypic analyses of Rab8a/b knockout mice by Sato et al., 2014, showed essentially no effect on cilia number and little evidence of ciliopathies that would be expected by the loss of a key factor in ciliogenesis. Moreover, they reported that knockout of Rab10 resulted in a loss of cilia, the opposite reported here. How do the authors reconcile these published observations with their results? If I understand correctly, the authors propose that Rab8 &quot;activates&quot; ciliogenesis, rather than provides an essential role, but it is unclear to me what &quot;activate&quot; means.</p><p>It is shown that loss of RILPL1 potentiates ciliogenesis, similar to loss of Rab10. It is also shown that Rab10 does not require RILPL1 for its effects on ciliogenesis (&quot;This suggests that Rab8A and Rab10 do not require RILPL1 for their effects on ciliogenesis…&quot;). So why are Rab10 and RILPL1 proposed (&quot;LRRK2 kinase acts via a pRab10-RILPL1 pathway to inhibit ciliogenesis&quot;) to function on the same ciliogenesis pathway? It would be helpful if the authors clarified this conclusion.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>Rigour and extent of the statistical information are satisfactory.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Here, Dhekne et al. investigate the roles of LRRK2, Rab8A, Rab10, and RILPL1 in ciliogenesis and report that Parkinson's Disease-associated alterations in LRRK2 activity lead to compromised cilium assembly and Hedgehog signaling, which may contribute to Parkinson's pathogenesis. This study builds on two recent reports in <italic>eLife</italic> from these groups (working also with Matthias Mann's group) that identified Rab8A and Rab10 as LRRK2 substrates, characterized phosphorylation-dependent binding of RILPL1 to these Rab's, and found reduced ciliogenesis in fibroblasts with elevated LRRK2 activity. In this manuscript, the authors investigate how Rab8A, Rab10, and RILPL1 control ciliogenesis downstream of LRRK2, finding that Rab8A promotes ciliogenesis (as previously reported), while RILPL1 promotes Rab10-dependent inhibition of cilium formation. Additionally, the authors show that increased LRRK2 activity leads to decreased reduced ciliogenesis (in MEFs, human iPS cells and mouse brain) and diminished cilium-dependent Hedgehog signaling (in MEFs and human iPS cells).</p><p>The negative regulation of ciliogenesis by Rab10/RILPL1 is an interesting finding that, if generalizable to other cell types/tissues, represents a novel insight into ciliogenesis that motivates future analysis of the underlying mechanism. Additionally, the findings that LRRK2 hyper-activity inhibits ciliogenesis and blunts Hedgehog signaling provide further evidence that ciliary defects may contribute to Parkinson's Disease. Lastly, the observation that Rab10 knockdown suppresses ciliogenesis defects seen in MEFs with elevated LRRK2 activity provides an important connection between the two aforementioned findings. As detailed below, the study could be strengthened by further examining Rab10's role in ciliogenesis in cell lines that are more commonly used to study cilia. Additionally, some data are presented in a confusing manner and do not support some of the conclusions reached. These unclear sections significantly obscure the key results and should be revised before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Many of the experiments are done in A549 cells, but A549 cells ciliate at a relatively low rate (~25%) and are not commonly used to study ciliogenesis. Thus, it is possible that the inhibitory effects on ciliogenesis of Rab10/RILPL1 may be a distinct feature of this cell type rather than indicative of a more general role for these proteins in regulating cilium formation (especially as Sato et al., 2014, reported Rab10 to be instead a positive regulator of ciliogenesis that acts redundantly with Rab8A and Rab8B). This concern is partially mitigated by the data from LRRK2-R1441G MEFs shown in Figure 6, but it would nonetheless be helpful to repeat a limited number of key experiments in RPE cells or wildtype MEFs (e.g. to show that Rab10/RILPL1 can inhibit ciliogenesis in these cells). In the first paragraph of the subsection “Rab8 activates while Rab10 inhibits cilia formation in A549 cells”, the authors note that cilia were examined in RPE cells following knockdown of Rab8A and Rab10, but the data are not shown.</p><p>2) Several sections of the Results are confusing and should be revised (see Minor Comments 1-5 for details).</p><p>3) While the authors have tested the functional interdependencies among LRRK2, Rab8A, Rab10, and RILPL1, the bigger picture of how these proteins interact to control ciliogenesis remains unclear with respect to where Rab8A fits in. Could the authors integrate Rab8A into a pathway model like that in Figure 6D? It seems that one possible model is RILPL1 --| Rab8A --| Rab10 --| ciliogenesis, with LRRK2 promoting Rab10 activity, but this diverges a bit from Figure 6D and perhaps there are alternatives that fit better or otherwise merit consideration. Lastly, given the evidence that Rab10 can inhibit ciliogenesis in the absence of RILPL1, are there Rab10 effectors that the authors view as good candidates for mediating Rab10's inhibition of ciliogenesis?</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) The authors state, &quot;addition of exogenous Rab10 suppresses cilia formation in cells lacking Rab8A or Rab10. Moreover, Rab8A enhances cilia formation in cells lacking Rab10; thus this represents an independent pathway for ciliogenesis activation&quot;. First, the effect of exogenous Rab10 expression on ciliogenesis in Rab8A-deficient cells does not appear to have been examined here. Second, the data indicate that Rab8A does not enhance cilium formation in cells lacking Rab10; rather, Figure 2B shows that cells lacking Rab10 bypass Rab8A's normal role in promoting ciliogenesis – itself a striking finding. Finally, this section concludes by discussing evidence from Sato et al. that Rab8A/B double-mutant mice show normal primary cilia. This fact seems to confuse or contradict the present data; it may be helpful instead to discuss the findings of Sato et al., 2014, in the Discussion.</p><p>2) The conclusions that can be drawn from the use of phospho-site T-&gt;A and T-&gt;E mutants are also not clear. As the authors note, the Rab10A T73A appears to be non-functional and should not be used as a phosphorylation-blocking allele. Given that Rab8A T72A and T72E mutants both fail to rescue ciliogenesis defects in Rab8A knockout cells and interact poorly with RILPL1 (while phosphorylated Rab8A robustly binds RILPL1), it is likely these mutants are non-functional and do not specifically block or mimic phosphorylation. Thus, the statement in the Abstract that &quot;Rab8A phosphorylation blocks its ability to promote ciliogenesis&quot; should be revised. Also, is the more potent inhibition of ciliogenesis by the Rab10 T73E mutant relative to wildtype Rab10 statistically significant?</p><p>3) The order of data presented in the text does not closely follow the order of data in the figures, especially for the first 2 figures and Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Adjusting the order of the figure panels would make the paper easier to follow. Also, in the first paragraph of the subsection “RILPL1 regulates pRab10 localization”, the reference to Figure 3—figure – supplement 1 appears to instead refer to Figure 5—figure – supplement 1. In the first paragraph of the subsection “RILPL1 regulates pRab10 localization”, the reference to Figure 4B appears to refer instead to Figure 4A. Lastly, what is being shown in Figure 2A with respect to GFP-Rab8 and GFP-Rab10?</p><p>4) An additional area of confusion is in the section titled, &quot;RILPL1 suppresses cilia formation via centrioles&quot;. It seems from the data in Figure 5F-H that, contrary to the section title, RILPL1 suppresses cilia formation independently of effects on centriole spacing. Additionally, while the effects on ciliogenesis of RILPL1 expression in RILPL1 KO cells are striking, it would be informative to assess whether a similar inhibition of ciliogenesis occurs when RILPL1 is over-expressed in wildtype cells.</p><p>5) In Figure 4, the authors analyze the effects of RILPL1 fragments on pRab10 localization. While the reported effects are interesting, the suggestion &quot;that the RILPL1 N-terminus interacts with pRab10 in pericentriolar membranes&quot; should perhaps be tempered given that a prior report from these groups showed that it is the C-terminal RH domain in RILPL1 that mediates interaction with Rab8A (PMID: 29125462), and the same may be true for Rab10 (even considering the data shown).</p><p>6) The results from LRRK2-G2019S iPS cells in Figure 7C-E could be attributed to differences in ciliogenesis associated with the process of deriving the mutant versus wildtype lines. This potential concern could be alleviated by examining whether MLi2 treatment restores normal levels of cilium formation to the G2019S cells.</p><p>7) The authors state that &quot;Yoshimura et al., 2007, were the first to show that Rab8A, but not Rab8B, is the only Rab GTPase to localize to primary cilia in hTert-RPE1 cells&quot;. This statement may be misleading to some readers given subsequent evidence that GFP-Rab23 localizes to RPE1 cilia (PMID: 26136363), as does Rab8B (PMID: 21273506). Additionally, while Rab8 and Rabin8 promote ciliogenesis, this effect appears to be only partly through the BBSome and may instead be primarily related to delivery of membrane vesicles to the growing cilium (e.g. PMID: 25812525).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper evaluates the role of the Rab8 and Rab10 GTPases as well as the Rab effector RILPL1 in the regulation of ciliogenesis by the LRRK2 kinase.

Mutations in LRRK that cause PD activate its protein kinase activity, but how this leads to PD is unknown. The study follows an earlier publication that reported that Rab proteins are the principal substrates for LRRK, including Rab8 and Rab10, the focus of this study. Rab8 has previously been implicated in ciliogenesis, and the authors present evidence that phosphorylation of Rab8 by LRRK inhibits its function in ciliogenesis. In contrast, the authors find that depletion of Rab10, another Rab GTPase implicated in ciliogenesis, potentiates ciliogenesis and that phosphorylation of Rab10 by LRRK potentiates its inhibitory effect on ciliogenesis via enhanced interaction with RILPL1, a Rab10 effector of unknown function. It is shown that depletion of RILPL1 potentiates ciliogenesis, similar to depletion of Rab10. Finally, it is shown that PD mutations in LRRK cause a decrease in the proportion of ciliated cells and deficient SSH signaling in striatal cholinergic neurons of the mouse brain. The specific functions of Rab8 or Rab10 in ciliogenesis or PD are largely unknown. This is a technically sound, well controlled study, that clearly supports roles for Rab8 and Rab10 in ciliogenesis, though if these GTPases play direct, specific roles in ciliogenesis remains an open question. In my opinion, the major value of this study lies in the identification of functional consequences for LRRK-mediated phosphorylation of Rab8 and Rab10 in ciliogenesis, a finding that puts a spotlight on ciliogenesis for future studies of PD etiology.</p><p>Phenotypic analyses of Rab8a/b knockout mice by Sato et al., 2014, showed essentially no effect on cilia number and little evidence of ciliopathies that would be expected by the loss of a key factor in ciliogenesis. Moreover, they reported that knockout of Rab10 resulted in a loss of cilia, the opposite reported here. How do the authors reconcile these published observations with their results? If I understand correctly, the authors propose that Rab8 &quot;activates&quot; ciliogenesis, rather than provides an essential role, but it is unclear to me what &quot;activate&quot; means.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the word activate and replaced it with increases.</p><p>Sato et al. reported no change in cilia number of length upon Rab8A/Rab8B knockout, and additional Rab10 siRNA decreases ciliation 15%. These authors never show the effect of Rab10 KO alone in their wild type background – it is always in the background of double knockout. It is possible that the loss of Rab8B or the double knockdown of Rab10 and Rab13 explains the differences from what we observe and their findings and we have tried to clarify the text in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is shown that loss of RILPL1 potentiates ciliogenesis, similar to loss of Rab10. It is also shown that Rab10 does not require RILPL1 for its effects on ciliogenesis (&quot;This suggests that Rab8A and Rab10 do not require RILPL1 for their effects on ciliogenesis…&quot;). So why are Rab10 and RILPL1 proposed (&quot;LRRK2 kinase acts via a pRab10-RILPL1 pathway to inhibit ciliogenesis&quot;) to function on the same ciliogenesis pathway? It would be helpful if the authors clarified this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the text – “Figure 6D compares two scenarios by which Rab10 and RILPL1 interfere with cilia formation. At endogenous levels of expression, we propose that LRRK2 generates an inhibitory complex that contains pRab10 and RILPL1. RILPL1 shows enhanced binding to p-Rab10, and our data show that LRRK2 inhibition requires both of these proteins to yield a ciliation defect. In addition, in the absence of LRRK2, upon overexpression of RILPL1, we also detect inhibition of cilia formation; this inhibition requires the presence of Rab10, and may reflect a similar inhibitor complex that requires overexpression to generate in the absence of Rab10 phosphorylation. On the other hand, overexpressed Rab10 can also inhibit cilia formation in a RILPL1-independent manner, that may involve RILPL2 or other proteins. Further work is needed to explore this possibility.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>Rigour and extent of the statistical information are satisfactory.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The negative regulation of ciliogenesis by Rab10/RILPL1 is an interesting finding that, if generalizable to other cell types/tissues, represents a novel insight into ciliogenesis that motivates future analysis of the underlying mechanism.
