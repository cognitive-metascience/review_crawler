Using reconstituted nucleosomal DNA replication assays, we assessed the impact of nucleosomes on replication initiation. To generate distinct nucleosomal landscapes, different chromatin-remodeling enzymes (CREs) were used to remodel nucleosomes on origin-DNA templates. Nucleosomal organization influenced two steps of replication initiation: origin licensing and helicase activation. Origin licensing assays showed that local nucleosome positioning enhanced origin specificity and modulated helicase loading by influencing ORC DNA binding. Interestingly, SWI/SNF- and RSC-remodeled nucleosomes were permissive for origin licensing but showed reduced helicase activation. Specific CREs rescued replication of these templates if added prior to helicase activation, indicating a permissive chromatin state must be established during origin licensing to allow efficient origin activation. Our studies show nucleosomes directly modulate origin licensing and activation through distinct mechanisms and provide insights into the regulation of replication initiation by chromatin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22512.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22512.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22512.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Each human cell contains more than two meters of DNA. To fit this length into a cell, remodeling enzymes compact the DNA by helping it to bind to specific proteins. This compaction has the side effect of making the DNA harder to access.</p><p>DNA replication is one process that requires access to the DNA. Replication occurs each time a cell divides, so that each newly formed cell receives a full set of genetic material. DNA replication starts simultaneously at hundreds of sites across the DNA. At each of these sites, cells assemble a protein called a replicative helicase. Helicases play a important role in many steps of DNA replication, but their most fundamental role is to separate the two DNA strands that make up the double helix; these strands then act as templates during replication.</p><p>A helicase is initially inactive when loaded at a replication start site. Additional proteins then bind to the helicase to activate it. Studies have shown that DNA compaction influences DNA replication, but it was not known exactly how compacted DNA affects helicase loading and activation.</p><p>To investigate the effects of compacted DNA during replication in more detail, Azmi et al. created different types of compacted DNA molecules using various remodeling enzymes. Some of the compacted DNAs directly prevented the binding of a protein that is required to load the helicase to the replication start site. In addition, the compaction reduced the number of sites on the DNA where replication could begin. Other types of compacted DNA allowed the helicase to be loaded normally, but inhibited the subsequent activation of the helicase. However, treating these DNA types with particular remodeling enzymes restored helicase activation to normal levels.</p><p>Overall, the findings presented by Azmi et al. suggest that cells can control helicase loading and activation independently by compacting DNA in different ways. Such control is important to ensure that each time a cell divides, it fully replicates its entire DNA.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22512.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22512.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA Replication</kwd><kwd>Helicase</kwd><kwd>Eukaryotic</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>chromatin remodeling enzyme</kwd><kwd>origin licensing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>123700-PF-13-071-01-DM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Azmi</surname><given-names>Ishara F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM54096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacAlpine</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>Craig L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM104097</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacAlpine</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>Craig L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Stephen P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nucleosomal DNAs assembled or modified by different chromatin remodeling enzymes differentially impact the origin licensing and helicase activation steps of replication initiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The eukaryotic genome is packaged into a condensed form known as chromatin that presents a barrier to DNA-associated processes. Chromatin is primarily composed of nucleosomes, each of which consists ofÂ ~147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer. The location and modification state of nucleosomes is dynamic, regulates access to the DNA and partitions the genome into distinct chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>). Nucleosome positioning and modifications influence all DNA processes including replication, transcription, repair and recombination. Thus, maintaining appropriate chromatin states across the genome is critical for cellular viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hargreaves and Crabtree, 2011</xref>). Although there is a growing wealth of knowledge concerning the impact of nucleosomes on gene expression, significantly less is known about the role of nucleosomes in regulating DNA replication.</p><p>Proper eukaryotic DNA replication requires the temporal separation of two key events: origin licensing and origin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li and Araki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>). During G1, origin licensing is initiated by origin-recognition complex (ORC) binding to replication origin DNA. ORC then recruits Cdc6 and Cdt1 and these proteins load two inactive Mcm2-7 replicative DNA helicases around the origin DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>). Origin activation is temporally separated from origin licensing and occurs during S phase. S-phase cyclin-dependent kinases and the Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase (DDK) drive recruitment of two helicase-activating proteins, Cdc45 and GINS, forming the active replicative helicase, the Cdc45/Mcm2-7/GINS (CMG) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka and Araki, 2013</xref>). Recruitment of DNA polymerases and their accessory proteins to the CMG complex forms a bidirectional pair of replisomes. The majority of these events have been reconstituted in vitro using purified proteins and naked DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">2017</xref>).</p><p>Chromatin is proposed to influence multiple aspects of replication initiation including origin licensing, origin activation and the time of replication initiation within S phase. Origin DNA is nucleosome-free to allow ORC DNA binding and, once bound, ORC positions origin-proximal nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berbenetz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eaton et al., 2010</xref>). Repositioning of origin-proximal nucleosomes reduces helicase loading and origin function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lipford and Bell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simpson, 1990</xref>), and loaded helicases appear to interact with these nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>). Local chromatin states have also been implicated in the activation of eukaryotic origins, each of which is predisposed to initiate earlier or later in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhind and Gilbert, 2013</xref>). How chromatin modulates these events and whether specific chromatin regulators impact replication initiation events is unclear.</p><p>Chromatin-remodeling enzymes (CREs) play a major role in determining the chromatin landscape across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Struhl and Segal, 2013</xref>). CREs are multi-protein complexes that use the energy of ATP bindingÂ andÂ hydrolysis to assemble, move, slide or alter the composition of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Papamichos-Chronakis and Peterson, 2012</xref>). Four subfamilies of CREs are conserved from yeast to humans: ISWI, SWI/SNF, INO80, and CHD. Members of the ISWI and CHD subfamilies typically function in nucleosome assembly, and they can create regularly spaced nucleosomal arrays by ATP-dependent sliding of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamiche et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">LÃ¤ngst et al., 1999</xref>). Similarly, members of the SWI/SNF subfamily mobilize nucleosomes in cis, but these enzymes can also evict nucleosomal histones or eject entire nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clapier et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, these CREs typically promote enhanced accessibility of nucleosomal DNA. Finally, members of the INO80 subfamily conduct the post-replicative removal of a particular histone within a nucleosome, and sequential replacement with either a canonical or a variant histone, a process termed nucleosome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mizuguchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Papamichos-Chronakis et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, some members of the INO80 subfamily can also catalyze nucleosome sliding (e.g. yeast INO80-C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shen et al., 2003</xref>). Although different CREs can exert a differential impact on nucleosomes, the current view is that each of these enzymes use ATP-dependent DNA translocation as a central mechanism for their activities.</p><p>Various CREs have been implicated in the regulation of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacAlpine and Almouzni, 2013</xref>). For instance, ISW1-containing remodeling complexes interact with replisome proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poot et al., 2005</xref>) and Chd1 negatively regulate replication initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biswas et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, SWI/SNF stimulates replication initiation at specific yeast origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flanagan and Peterson, 1999</xref>) and is associated with a subset of human origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Euskirchen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although elimination of different CREs influences DNA replication, whether these effects are direct or indirect and the specific events of replication that are impacted remain elusive. CREs impact multiple processes including transcription, histone modification, and nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>) leaving open the possibility of indirect effects. In addition, cells express multiple members of each CRE family and overlapping functions of these enzymes could mask the effects of single CRE deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsukiyama et al., 1999</xref>). Although the simultaneous deletion of multiple CREs could overcome this issue, in many cases these are lethal events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monahan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsukiyama et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Here we describe origin-dependent in vitro replication assays using nucleosomal DNA templates. To address how different nucleosomal states impact DNA replication, we investigated nucleosomal templates that were remodeled by different CREs. Consistent with in vivo studies, these templates showed distinct replication capacities. Most of the nucleosomal DNA templates permitted origin licensing, but ISW2- and Chd1-remodeled templates reduced the efficiency of this event by positioning nucleosomes over the origin DNA, decreasing ORC DNA binding and helicase loading. Although permissive for origin licensing, SWI/SNF- and RSC-remodeled templates showed reduced CMG formation and origin activation. Addition of specific CREs improved replication initiation from these templates but only if the CRE was added prior to CMG formation. Our findings show that local nucleosome status differentially modulates two steps during replication initiation and that specific CREs establish permissive and restrictive states for replication initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstitution of Mcm2-7 helicase loading using nucleosomal DNA</title><p>To investigate the impact of chromatin on replication initiation, we first reconstituted origin licensing using nucleosomal DNA templates.

In addition, the flanking nucleosome on the opposite side of the origin was shifted towards the ACS (fromÂ +222 toÂ +168) in the ISW2 templates. These data support a model in which encroachment of origin-proximal nucleosomes onto origin DNA directly inhibits origin licensing.</p><p>To determine whether the reduced origin licensing of the ISW2 and Chd1 templates was caused by decreased ORC DNA binding, we examined ORC association with these nucleosomalÂ templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

First, we examined DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2-7 (detected by retardation of Mcm6 electrophoresis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Francis et al., 2009</xref>). This modification was either unchanged (SWI/SNF) or improved (RSC) relative to ISW1a templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating Mcm2-7 phosphorylation by DDK was not reduced. Next, we assessed CMG formation by examining Cdc45 and GINS template association after replication initiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Both SWI/SNF and RSC templates showed reduced Cdc45 and GINS template association compared to ISW1a templates. For these initial experiments, we measured template association at the end of the replication reaction. Thus, the decreases in Cdc45 and GINS template association could be due to inefficient CMG formation during initiation or increased CMG dissociation during elongation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we repeated the replication-initiation assays in the presence of ATP but without other rNTPs or dNTPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Under these conditions, the CMG can form and partially unwind DNA but replication cannot initiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>). As in the previous assays, we observed reduced Cdc45 and GINS association with SWI/SNF and RSC templates compared to the ISW1a templates. Consistent with reduced active helicases and DNA unwinding, the amount of Rfa1 (a subunit of the eukaryotic single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA) association with RSC and SWI/SNF templates was also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, the observed reduction in DNA replication products observed for the SWI/SNF and RSC templates in the complete assays was due to reduced CMG formation and helicase activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>CRE-specific restoration of replication and CMG formation to RSC and SWI/SNF templates</title><p>Our previous replication assays were performed in the absence of CREs to address how different chromatin states impact replication initiation. In vivo, however, these enzymes could be present at origin-proximal chromatin during initiation. To address whether the continuous presence of a CRE during replication initiation altered our findings, we asked if the addition of ISW1a, RSC or SWI/SNF during replication-initiation assays improved replication initiation from the RSC and SWI/SNF templates. Adding ISW1a during the helicase-loading step (DL) of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) restored CMG formation and increased DNA replication of the RSC templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, adding RSC during the helicase-loading step did not alter either the amount of replication or CMG formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lane 6). Similar experiments with SWI/SNF templates showed that the addition of ISW1a (but not SWI/SNF) improved replication of SWI/SNF templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast to the ability of ISW1a to improve replication from the RSC and SWI/SNF templates, addition of RSC or SWI/SNF to ISW1a templates during helicase loading did not reduce replication levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, consistent with its ability to reduce helicase loading, addition of Chd1 to ISW1a during helicase loading did reduce replication. Together these data indicate that the defects that we observe in CMG formation and replication for the RSC and SWI/SNF templates are not simply due to the lack of a CRE during the replication assay. Instead, our findings suggest that specific CREs create nucleosomal states that facilitate CMG formation and replication initiation.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22512.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Rescue of SWI/SNF and RSC template replication initiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of ISW1a addition at various steps during the replication assay.

Analysis of local nucleosome positioning by MNase-seq did not reveal a nucleosomal pattern that distinguished the RSC and SWI/SNF templates from ISW1a templates in origin proximal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with the robust helicase loading observed for all three templates, they each exhibited a nucleosome-free region over the origin. The nucleosome pattern near <italic>ARS1</italic> was similar between the ISW1a and SWI/SNF templates. In addition, treatment of SWI/SNF templates with ISW1a did not cause major changes in nucleosome positioning. The pattern of RSC-remodeled nucleosomes was substantially different from SWI/SNF and ISW1a templates on the right side of <italic>ARS1</italic>. ISW1a addition to RSC templates enhanced the positioning of one nucleosome centeredÂ atÂ ~400 bp on the right side of the <italic>ARS1</italic> ACS. Thus, unlike the situation for origin licensing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), there was no apparent correlation between flanking nucleosome positions and the reduced origin activation observed for SWI/SNF and RSC templates.</p><p>Previous studies have reported a histone-binding motif in Mcm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foltman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2015</xref>), raising the possibility that nucleosome-Mcm2-7 interactions may facilitate replication initiation in a nucleosomal context. To test this possibility, we purified a mutant version of Mcm2-7 that lacks the Mcm2 histone-binding motif. Incorporation of this mutation did not alter helicase loading or DNA synthesis with or without nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3AâB</xref>), suggesting that this interaction is not critical for replication initiation under the conditions of these assays. This is consistent with the lack of an obvious replication phenotype for this mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foltman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Given the redundant functions of chromatin remodelers in vivo, we asked if the ability to improve the replication of RSC and SWI/SNF templates was unique to ISW1a or if other CREs could perform the same function. As discussed above, addition of RSC or SWI/SNF to the corresponding nucleosomal templates during helicase loading did not improve CMG formation or replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, ISW2 addition to RSC templates resulted in only limited rescue of both CMG formation and replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, addition of ISW1b or INO80-C to RSC templates after helicase loading improved replication initiation and CMG formation to similar levels as ISW1a addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, the ability to restore full replication competence to the RSC or SWI/SNF templates is limited to a subset of CREs, consistent with previous studies indicating that these complexes have distinct functionalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>).</p><p>We also asked when ISW1a needed to be present during a specific replication event to improve replication of SWI/SNF and RSC templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When added only during the helicase-loading step (DL) or after helicase-loading but removed before DDK treatment (AL), ISW1a significantly improved replication of the SWI/SNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and RSC templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and E</xref>). Addition of ISW1a to the SWI/SNF and RSC templates after the DDK-step (but before CMG formation and replication initiation) also improved replication and CMG formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>). In contrast, addition of ISW1a only during the initiation/elongation (I/E) step of the replication reaction did not improve CMG formation or replication of RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) or SWI/SNF templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, ISW1a can only improve the replication competence of RSC and SWI/SNF templates if it acts prior to the events of origin activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The development of fully-reconstituted replication-initiation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">2017</xref>) has opened the way to biochemically investigate the interactions between the replication-initiation machinery and nucleosomes. Although previous in vivo studies have revealed evidence that local chromatin states impact replication initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berbenetz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eaton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lipford and Bell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacAlpine and Almouzni, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simpson, 1990</xref>), a molecular understanding of these interactions has been difficult to attain. Here, we have used origin-containing nucleosomal DNA templates assembled in the presence of different CREs to investigate how origin-proximal nucleosomes affect replication initiation. For many of our studies, we have deliberately excluded CREs during the replication assays to investigate the impact of different static nucleosomal states on replication initiation. We also performed replication initiation assays in the presence of CREs, a situation that is potentially more representative of the in vivo situation at promoter-proximal origins. Together these studies reveal that local nucleosomes directly impact two steps in replication initiation: ORC DNA binding and CMG formation. Our studies do not include a full representation of the events that have the potential to impact replication initiation in vivo as they lack histone modifications and higher-order chromatin structures. Nevertheless, these studies represent an important first step to understanding the molecular mechanisms by which chromatin states modulate replication initiation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Specific CREs establish helicase-loading competent origin-proximal nucleosomes</title><p>Previous studies have shown that replication origins are included within nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) and this characteristic is important for origin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berbenetz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eaton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lipford and Bell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacAlpine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simpson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with nucleosomes impacting origin selection, we found that assembly of DNA into nucleosomes reduced origin-independent initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Given the redundancy of CREs in vivo, which CREs are capable of establishing NFRs at replication origins is unknown. Our findings demonstrate that CRE-dependent differences in local nucleosomes impact origin licensing. Only a subset of CREs positioned nucleosomes in a manner that allowed efficient origin licensing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A and B</xref>). ISW2 templates showed the most inefficient Mcm2-7 loading compared to other templates and this reduction correlated with the encroachment of origin-proximal nucleosomes over origin DNA in a manner that inhibited ORC DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>). This finding is consistent with studies showing that ISW2 slides nucleosomes towards the promoter-proximal NFR to suppress transcription at cryptic transcription-start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whitehouse et al., 2007</xref>). Our findings suggest that ISW2 and perhaps Chd1 play a similar role in regulating origin usage. Interestingly, once ORC is bound to origin DNA, ISW2 is unable to displace ORC with a nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Similarly, once ISW2 establishes nucleosome positioning at the origin, ORC is unable to bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting ORC cannot displace interfering nucleosomes. These findings suggest that both the relative timing of ORC binding and histone deposition and the CRE present at this time will influence the use of a given site as an origin.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22512.025</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Nucleosomes remodeled by different CREs influence replication initiation differently.</title><p>Nucleosomes affect multiple steps of replication initiation using distinct mechanisms.

In particular, SWI/SNF and RSC templates reduced this event. Our finding that the reduced replication of these templates is rescued by addition of other CREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) makes it clear that these effects are nucleosome-dependent. It remains to be determined how the RSC and SWI/SNF templates modulate this event. Given that these templates allow efficient helicase loading, simple steric inhibition by encroaching nucleosomes is unlikely to explain these effects. This conclusion is reinforced by the presence of a large nucleosome-free region overlapping the origin for both templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, despite their different capacities for replication initiation and CMG formation, ISW1a and SWI/SNF templates had a similar pattern of surrounding nucleosomes and the SWI/SNF nucleosomes pattern was not changed by the same ISW1a addition that restored robust CMG formation and replication initiation to these templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Another possibility is that the lack of uniformly-spaced nucleosome arrays in the RSC and SWI/SNF templates reduces CMG formation. Of the seven CREs we tested, only SWI/SNF and RSC did not establish uniformly-spaced nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). On the other hand, we observed a similar lack of uniformly positioned nucleosomes when we did not add any CRE to the nucleosome assembly reactions, and these templates showed much higher levels of replication initiation than the RSC and SWI/SNF templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Although it is possible that very subtle changes in nucleosome positioning are responsible, a more likely explanation is that the structure of the nucleosomes remodeled by RSC and SWI/SNF is different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that SWI/SNF family remodelers establish nucleosome structures that are different from canonical nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lorch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schnitzler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ulyanova and Schnitzler, 2005</xref>). Such altered nucleosomes could have distinct abilities to interact with the replication machinery. SWI/SNF and RSC are also known to remove H2A/H2B dimers from nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clapier et al., 2016</xref>). Although we do not observe a dramatic reduction in the relative amounts of H3 and H2A for these templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) it is possible that a subset of nucleosomes assembled in the presence of RSC or SWI/SNF are lacking the full complement of H2A/H2B. One argument against this possibility is the ability of ISW1a addition to readily restore full replication initiation and CMG formation to these templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Given that free histones are removed after initial nucleosome assembly, it is not clear how ISW1a addition could restore full nucleosomes to the RSC or SWI/SNF templates.</p><p>One interesting possibility to explain the different capacities of the templates to facilitate CMG formation is raised by recent studies suggesting that loaded Mcm2-7 interacts with adjacent nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that different positions/conformations of local nucleosomes (see below) impacts the ability of nucleosomes to interact with Mcm2-7 double hexamers. These interactions could directly or indirectly modulate access of helicase-activating proteins to loaded Mcm2-7 double hexamers. Addition of some CREs to RSC or SWI/SNF templates improved their replication but only if added before the helicase-activation proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that a positive interaction between loaded Mcm2-7 and nucleosomes must be established prior to CMG formation. Interestingly, we found that RSC and SWI/SNF could not reduce replication from an ISW1a template when added during helicase loading. Perhaps a subset of CREs produce nucleosomes that can interact with the replication machinery positively and once these interactions are established they prevent otherÂ CREs fromÂ inducing alternative conformations. Although previous studies have identified a histone-binding motif in Mcm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foltman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2015</xref>), incorporation of this mutation into the Mcm2-7 complex did not alter helicase loading or DNA synthesis with or without nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3AâB</xref>). It is possible, however, that this mutation is not sufficient to eliminate Mcm2-7 interactions with adjacent nucleosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>CREs show different capacities to establish replication-competent chromatin states</title><p>Our studies show that the different CREs are not equivalent in their ability to establish replication-competent nucleosomes. These differences were observed both with regard to the initial deposition of nucleosomes on DNA (e.g. RSC templates inhibiting CMG formation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and when CREs were added after deposition (e.g. ISW1a addition rescuing the reduced CMG formation of RSC templates, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The specificity of the different CREs in our assays suggests that the presence of different CREs at origins will impact origin usage. Localization of specific CREs to origin DNA through interactions with the replication machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Euskirchen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Papamichos-Chronakis and Peterson, 2008</xref>) or adjacent promoters/transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yen et al., 2012</xref>) could impact either origin licensing or activation. Our studies indicate that presence of a specific CRE at an origin during a particular cell cycle stage would have different consequences for DNA replication. A CRE present during S phase would impact the initial assembly of nucleosomes and more likely impact subsequentÂ origin licensing/helicase loading. A CRE that is present during G1 is less likely to impact origin licensing and more likely to modulate subsequent CMG formation. Thus, simple deletion of a CRE or monitoring of CRE association with origin DNA in an asynchronous cell culture is unlikely to reveal their full impact on the events of DNA replication.</p><p>Interestingly, the RSC and SWI/SNF templates show hallmarks of late-initiating origins. Like late-initiating origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Santocanale et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wyrick et al., 2001</xref>), these templates showed efficient origin licensing but reduced/delayed replication initiation. In addition, replication timing is established in late M or early G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dimitrova and Gilbert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raghuraman et al., 1997</xref>) and replication timing can only be reprogrammed prior to S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peace et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, SWI/SNF and RSC templates can be remodeled to replicate efficiently if certain CREs are added prior to shifting the templates into helicase-activation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which is the biochemical equivalent of the G1-S phase transition. These similarities suggest that local nucleosome states influence replication timing.</p><p>Although our studies investigated DNA replication in the context of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> DNA-sequence-defined origins of replication, they are relevant to DNA replication in all eukaryotic organisms. Although most organisms do not use sequence-defined origins of replication, origin-proximal nucleosome-free regions are a common characteristic of origins in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fragkos et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, our findings regarding the impact of local nucleosomes on origin licensing and selection are relevant to these origins as well. Indeed, the absence of specific sequences directing initiation of replication suggests that local chromatin states will have an even more important role in most organisms. Importantly, once helicases are loaded, specific origin sequences have little or no impact on subsequent origin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gros et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2015</xref>). The assays described here lay the groundwork for future studies of the impact of nucleosome structure and histone modification on DNA replication, and can be extended to query DNA replication-dependent nucleosome assembly events and epigenetic inheritance mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains used in these studies are derivatives of W303 and are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The proposed studies are clearly very early work on chromatin and initiation of DNA replication in vitro. The studies represent a very good first step in understanding a complex mechanism, even if the detailed molecular insight remains to be determined. It will be acceptable for publication provided they address the following important criticisms and adequately reply to these comments:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) They demonstrate the activity of each CRE in an ATPase assay or on a mononucleosomal template.</p><p>2) They test whether the presence of a histone chaperone has an effect on the replication assays, where histones are presumably displaced.</p><p>3) They provide a better description of how the chromatin was prepared.</p><p>4) They discuss the caveat of why the specificity of initiation seen in vivo has not been duplicated using their in vitro system.</p><p>Other Comments:</p><p>1) The manuscript does not mention one of the main interaction points between the chromatin and the initiation machinery: the BAH domain of ORC1 that can bind nucleosomes. This domain has been shown in yeast to affect certain initiation events and in humans this domain has been implicated in both reading an origin &quot;histone code&quot; and potentially in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome. A mutant version of ORC could be produced with the BAH removed and the assays in this manuscript could be repeated. If the domain is not important for any activities described in the paper, this may suggest that post-translational modifications of the histones may be required for BAH-specific activity. Alternatively, the BAH domain may be necessary for ORC, when pre-bound to naked DNA, to resist the conversion of the chromatin organization by ISW2 to a non-permissive state.</p><p>2) SWI/SNF and RSC CREs generate chromatin organization that is not permissive to origin activation, yet it is not clear why this occurs. It is also not clear why subsequent treatment with Isw1a rescues activation. The nucleosome occupancy patterns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref> do not shed light on this. One possibility is that there are altered nucleosomes around the origin that are formed by SWI/SNF or RSC that are not adequately profiled by the MNase-Seq, which is described as sequencing only mono-nucleosomal fragments less than 160 bp. Alternatively, is there a possibility that the intensity of the nucleosomes is not easily comparable across different templates, due to internal normalization? The profiles of the whole 3.8 kb template for each remodeling condition may help to address this, or using some independent method to fragment the DNA and sequencing could address percent occupancy. Addressing these points would at the very least rule out certain caveats.</p><p>3) Why do you need to purify away the Nap1 and CREs? This is not discussed, but I would argue that you may need a histone binding protein to avoid that the evicted histones precipitate onto DNA again. How much of each CRE remains bound is a critical issue.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>, are anti-CPB and anti-FLAG on the same membrane? If not, an internal reference should be used to validate the wash of the CREs. The homogenous removal of the CREs is essential in interpreting the results.</p><p>5) Clarify these statements:- &quot;The results of the MNAse in presence of SWI/SNF and RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) shows that the &quot;nucleosomes&quot; in those samples are not stable&quot;. Could you perform the MNase-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and get a 147 bp protection in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>? What is the difference between these experiments?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> should include a Western blot for ORC as well.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> would be improved by showing ORC occupancy in all CRE contexts.</p><p>8) The size range of all replication products run on denaturing agarose gels should be indicated with marker indicator.</p><p>9) Dissection of the steps after DDK treatment, using purified components such as Cdc45, would make this manuscript even more impactful.</p><p>10) Including a mutant MCM2 lacking the histone binding domain would increase the impact of the manuscript, similar to the ORC BAH mutant.</p><p>11) Including the Abf1 protein, which binds the B3 element of ARS1, would increase the impact of the manuscript. Previously it was proposed that Abf1 helps establish a nucleosome free region for MCM loading.</p><p>We have included the full reviews at the bottom of this letter, to further clarify these requests.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript addresses the effects of chromatin on the complete mechanism of the initiation of DNA replication in a reconstituted system for the first time, using the well-established budding yeast model. The authors first show that a regularly-spaced nucleosome array made with recombinant histones is equally efficient at one of the first major steps in initiation, the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC), which culminates in the loading of the MCM helicase rings. Next, they prepare nucleosomal templates using multiple chromatin remodeling enzymes that generate different patterns of nucleosome placement. These different nucleosome organizations result in different efficiencies of pre-RC formation and further analysis suggests that the positioning of the nucleosomes within the replication origin sequence is the cause of this reduction by limiting the association of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC). The authors then test whether the chromatin templates are competent for origin activation and resulting DNA replication, both in an extract that provides the downstream components and then in a fully-purified system. The results in both systems further emphasize that a specific chromatin configuration is required for the most-efficient replication activity, highlighting a critical window for establishing this chromatin context before/during the helicase priming step by the Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), which is required for multiple downstream steps leading to initiation of replication.</p><p>The work in this manuscript provides an important step in dissecting how chromatin influences DNA replication initiation. The strengths lie in the ability to profile, in a controlled manner, multiple CREs to demonstrate that distinct chromatin organization affects specific substeps in the mechanism. The manuscript could be significantly improved by the addition of a small set of experiments and data. Most notably, incorporating experiments using an ORC1 mutant lacking the bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domain, previously demonstrated to bind nucleosomes and influence replication initiation in vivo.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>1) The manuscript does not mention one of the main interaction points between the chromatin and the initiation machinery: the BAH domain of ORC1 that can bind nucleosomes. This domain has been shown in yeast to affect certain initiation events and in humans this domain has been implicated in both reading an origin &quot;histone code&quot; and potentially in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome. A mutant version of ORC could be produced with the BAH removed and the assays in this manuscript could be repeated. If the domain is not important for any activities described in the paper, this may suggest that post-translational modifications of the histones may be required for BAH-specific activity. Alternatively, the BAH domain may be necessary for ORC, when pre-bound to naked DNA, to resist the conversion of the chromatin organization by ISW2 to a non-permissive state.</p><p>2) SWI/SNF and RSC CREs generate chromatin organization that is not permissive to origin activation, yet it is not clear why this occurs. It is also not clear why subsequent treatment with Isw1a rescues activation. The nucleosome occupancy patterns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref> do not shed light on this. One possibility is that there are altered nucleosomes around the origin that are formed by SWI/SNF or RSC that are not adequately profiled by the MNase-Seq, which is described as sequencing only mono-nucleosomal fragments less than 160 bp.

The profiles of the whole 3.8 kb template for each remodeling condition may help to address this, or using some independent method to fragment the DNA and sequencing could address% occupancy. Addressing these points would at the very least rule out certain caveats.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Main scientific findings:</p><p>The manuscript addresses the issue of how chromatin structure influences/ regulates replication initiation at two steps: (i) origin licensing by orc binding to origins and (ii) origin activation by recruitment and activation of the MCM2-7 helicase. The main conclusions are, derived from in vitro reconstitution of chromatin in a template DNA containing an ars (ori) using different chromatin remodeling complexes, are (i) chromatin structure enhances the specificity of orc binding to ori, (ii) although remodeling complexes inhibit MCM activity when added during the reaction, pre-incubation with remodelers to the template before the addition of MCM and other proteins of the pre-initiation complex rescued replication. Thus, the manuscript demonstrates, perhaps as expected, that nucleosomal landscape modulates replication just as it does of other DNA transactions such as transcription, DNA repair, replicative life span control.</p><p>Significance:</p><p>The authors get credit for biochemically addressing the relationship between chromatin structure and replication initiation. There are two other papers in Molecular Cell on this subject from Diffley's group from UK that has carried the work into chromatin structure and its regulatory role in replication initiation further. This reviewer is of the opinion that the work by the other group should not in any way diminish the impact of the present manuscript from the point of view of publication priority.</p><p>Critique:</p><p>The work presented in this manuscript is well done. However, the evidence for specific ori-dependent initiation in the opinion of this reviewer does not meet the gold standards established by Kornberg and others in oriC, plasmid replication reconstitution and SV40 replication. Without 2D gel analyses or EM, it was difficult to assess to what extent initiation fidelity was enhanced by the chromatin remodeling factors in effectively limiting initiation to the ars sequences. After all, in vivo no initiation occurs under normal conditions without the presence of an ars.</p><p>A second question is how does chromatin remodeling enhance the specificity of licensing and activation of the origins? Is it just by repositioning the nucleosomes around the region of the ars and thereby restricting orc binding to the origins and preventing its physiologically unwarranted binding to the non-ars sequences or is it more intricate? Diffley's group finding that FACT is involved in the process suggests a more elaborate reaction involving perhaps transcription. It was reported by Marahrens and Stillman that one essential element of the ars directs transcription and is needed for ars activity.</p><p>In summary, this is a good paper that explores the role of chromatin in replication and therefore has some novelty. As noted above, the specificity of initiation seen in vivo has not been duplicated in vitro and therefore any conclusions from the chromatin reconstitution work should be cautiously interpreted.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Azmi et al. presents the in vitro reconstitution of DNA replication on chromatinized templates, pre-treated with different chromatin remodeling enzymes (CREs). The authors show how treatment with different CREs lead to differential effects to ORC binding or replication efficiency.</p><p>Although it is important to understand how nucleosomes affect DNA replication, I am skeptical about the impact of the data, as they are presented here. In my opinion, the manuscript represents a collection of observations, with insufficient mechanistic insight to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The conclusion that encroachment of the origin inhibits helicase loading is valid. However, the remaining conclusions are not supported by sufficiently controlled mechanistic insight. In particular, the chromatin templates (after remodeling) are insufficiently characterized to allow conclusions on the role of CREs and the nature of the nucleosomes at the origin. The CREs preparation should be tested in a bona fide CRE assay to ensure that they are all &quot;equally&quot; trustworthy/active.</p><p>1) The data presented seems to have more to do with the activities of the CREs than with replication. A gold standard CRE assay to validate the activity of preparations should be shown. Some introduction into the mechanistic differences between the different CREs (sliding, exchanging, etc.) have to be included both in the Introduction and in the Discussion.</p><p>2) What happens if SWI/SNF or RSC are added to an ISWI1a preparation? Do they overrule ISWI1a? In other words, once you have a good template, can you mess it up (after loading)? To have an impactful conclusion from these studies, a more controlled analysis of the cross-talk between CREs is required, as all CREs are present in the nucleus.</p><p>3) It is unclear how the chromatinized plasmid was prepared. In some part of the text, and for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>, it is stated that the octamer:DNA ratio was 1:1.3, yet from the method section it appears that this is not accurate as the octamer/Nap1 complexes are in large excess to the DNA (180 nM octamer to 120 fmol 3.8kb DNA). This needs to be clarified.</p><p>4) Why do you need to purify away the Nap1 and CREs? This is not discussed, but I would argue that you may need a histone binding protein to avoid that the evicted histones precipitate onto DNA again. How much of each CRE remains bound is a critical point.</p><p>5) This is linked to point 2. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>, are aCPB and aFLAG on the same membrane? If not, an internal reference should be used to validate the wash of the CREs. The homogenous removal of the CREs is essential in interpreting the results.</p><p>6) I am confused by some results/statements:</p><p>- The results of the MNAse in presence of SWI/SNF and RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) shows that the &quot;nucleosomes&quot; in those samples are not stable, yet you could perform the MNase-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and you could get a 147 bp protection in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>. What is the difference between these experiments?</p><p>â Related to this, the statement âOf the seven CREs we tested, only SWI/SNF and RSC did not establish regularly-spaced nucleosomesâ, as RSC and SWI/SNF do not affect spacing, there are just no stable nucleosomes in those samples.</p><p>â The statement âThese similarities suggests that local nucleosome positioning and/or states influence replication timingâ: nucleosome positioning is not an issue with RSC and SWI/SNF, so I would rephrase this and remove the position component. I also think more controls are needed to make this statement.</p><p>7) I am left with the question whether CREs are essential. Can you just add histones and Nap1 to make nucleosomes? How would this &quot;chromatin template&quot; behave in your assays? Would it look like ISWI2/Chd2? This has not been shown, but it may be a good control to strengthen the relevance of CREs in the process.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22512.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) They demonstrate the activity of each CRE in an ATPase assay or on a mononucleosomal template.</italic> </p><p>We have included a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>) showing ATPase activity of each CRE.

In each case we do not see stimulation of replication (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author Response Image 1</xref>). This is likely because other factors are limiting the elongation phase of the assay (e.g. Mrc1, see (Yeeles et al., 2017)). We note that we do not intend this study to address the elongation stage of the reaction as other previous papers have (Devbhandari et al., 2016; Kurat et al., 2016). Instead, we are using the replication phase of our assays as a simple readout of the number of replication forks that are established. That this is the case, is reflected in the close correlation that we observe between the extent of CMG complex formation and the amount of replication products throughout our assays. Although we will include this data in the final manuscript if the reviewers feel strongly, we do not think it enhances our conclusions about the effect of chromatin on replication initiation events and may confuse the readers as to the goals of our study.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22512.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22512.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22512.028</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22512-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) They provide a better description of how the chromatin was prepared.</italic></p><p>The method we employed to prepare nucleosome DNA templates was previously published from Dr. Carl Wuâs lab (Mizuguchi et al., 2012) and optimization was carried out with close communication with Dr. Mizuguchi. The final ratio of DNA: octamer used in our assays is 1:1.3 by mass (296ng of DNA and 385ng of octamers), which is now indicated in the description of the template preparation (subsection âSWI/SNF and RSC templates reduce CMG formationâ).</p><p><italic>4) They discuss the caveat of why the specificity of initiation seen</italic> in vivo <italic>has not been duplicated using their</italic> in vitro <italic>system.</italic> </p><p>In contrast to the reviewerâs suggestion, our helicase loading and initiation reactions exhibit sequence specificity that is consistent with that observed in vivo. Contrary to studies from the Diffley and Remus labs (Devbhandari et al., 2016; Gros et al., 2014; Kurat et al., 2016), the conditions that we use for our helicase loading and replication initiation assays require an intact <italic>ARS1</italic> sequences â in particular the highly-conserved ARS consensus sequence that binds ORC (Heller et al., 2011; Ticau et al., 2015). We show that this is the case for helicase-loading reactions with and without nucleosomes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom row (all our reactions are normally performed at 300 mM K-glutamate). Consistent with the requirement of helicase loading for replication initiation, our replication reactions are also strongly dependent on an intact origin. We have added an additional experiment illustrating this dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>) which we describe in the subsection âLocal nucleosomes impact replication events downstream of helicase loadingâ.</p><p>The only exception to this origin-dependence in our manuscript is that we deliberately promoted non-specific helicase loading on naked DNA by using lower-salt conditions (Devbhandari et al., 2016; Kurat et al., 2016; Remus et al., 2009) for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D (125</xref> mM K-glutamate, top row). We did this to ask whether nucleosomes would enhance origin specificity under conditions in which origin selection is less specific. Indeed, we found that nucleosomes make helicase loading origin-specific even when naked DNA loading is origin-non-specific.</p><p><italic>Other Comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The manuscript does not mention one of the main interaction points between the chromatin and the initiation machinery: the BAH domain of ORC1 that can bind nucleosomes. This domain has been shown in yeast to affect certain initiation events and in humans this domain has been implicated in both reading an origin &quot;histone code&quot; and potentially in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome. A mutant version of ORC could be produced with the BAH removed and the assays in this manuscript could be repeated. If the domain is not important for any activities described in the paper, this may suggest that post-translational modifications of the histones may be required for BAH-specific activity. Alternatively, the BAH domain may be necessary for ORC, when pre-bound to naked DNA, to resist the conversion of the chromatin organization by ISW2 to a non-permissive state.</italic> </p><p>To address the role of the Orc1 BAH domain, we have produced ORC lacking the BAH domain (ORCâBAH) and studied its effect on helicase loading using nucleosomes assembled with several different CREs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Our results indicate that ORCâBAH fully substitutes for ORC in these conditions. In particular, we did not observe further decreases in helicase loading for nucleosome assembled by ISW2. These findings suggest that interactions between the Orc1 BAH domain and local nucleosomes are not required for helicase loading at <italic>ARS1</italic>. We note that previous studies indicate that deletion of the BAH domain in vivo has only a limited effect on <italic>ARS1</italic> function (MÃ¼ller et al., 2010). Although it would be interesting to explore the function of the BAH domains at other origins, this is beyond the scope of the current study. We agree with the reviewer that these findings may also indicate that the effects of the BAH domain require modified versions of histones not present in our current assays. We describe these new findings in subsection âLocal nucleosomes reduce helicase loading by inhibiting ORC DNA bindingâ as well as in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>2) SWI/SNF and RSC CREs generate chromatin organization that is not permissive to origin activation, yet it is not clear why this occurs. It is also not clear why subsequent treatment with Isw1a rescues activation. The nucleosome occupancy patterns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref> do not shed light on this. One possibility is that there are altered nucleosomes around the origin that are formed by SWI/SNF or RSC that are not adequately profiled by the MNase-Seq, which is described as sequencing only mono-nucleosomal fragments less than 160 bp. Alternatively, is there a possibility that the intensity of the nucleosomes is not easily comparable across different templates, due to internal normalization? The profiles of the whole 3.8 kb template for each remodeling condition may help to address this, or using some independent method to fragment the DNA and sequencing could address percent occupancy. Addressing these points would at the very least rule out certain caveats.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that MNase-seq may not fully reveal the differences between the origin-proximal nucleosomes for the ISW1a, SWI/SNF or RSC templates. Unfortunately, our original experimental procedure eliminated smaller fragments so we cannot explore this data to identify sub-nucleosomal fragments that might impact our findings. On the other hand, it is not clear how addition of ISW1a would remove or remodel subnucleosomal particles to eliminate this issue. With regard to comparing nucleosome occupancy, we see similar amounts of nucleosomes associated with the different templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1A-B</xref>) and the nucleosome occupancies that we observe in the MNase-Seq experiments are similar between ISW1a, RSC and SWI/SNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We agree that the current data does not provide a clear mechanistic understanding and there is much to be done to address these observations at a detailed mechanistic level. Nevertheless, our data clearly indicates that these differences observed between the different nucleosomal DNA templates is the result of different CREs establishing distinct nucleosomal states.</p><p><italic>3) Why do you need to purify away the Nap1 and CREs? This is not discussed, but I would argue that you may need a histone binding protein to avoid that the evicted histones precipitate onto DNA again. How much of each CRE remains bound is a critical issue.</italic> </p><p>We choose to remove the CRE from templates primarily to prevent additional nucleosome assembly and remodeling during the assays. Our intent was to establish different chromatin states and ask how DNA replication initiation responds to them. Nap1 gets removed as a consequence of removing CREs, since removal of CRE requires a stringent wash. Additionally, chaperons are primarily involved in the replication elongation step (e.g. replication-coupled nucleosome removal and assembly (Burgess and Zhang, 2013)). In this manuscript, we focus on replication initiation step (e.g. we have not included all the factors required for lagging-strand synthesis in our assays) and thus we did not focus our efforts in understanding how would chaperones influence replication elongation. Nonetheless, we have performed a replication assay to examine whether Nap1 or FACT influence replication initiation in our assay and found no dramatic increase in replication (see major comments, point 2, above).</p><p>We address the amount of each CRE that remains bound to the template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In each case, little of no detectable CRE remains. We note that for the case of the RSC and SWI/SNF templates, the effects on replication cannot be due to residual association of these enzymes as adding these enzymes back to the reactions does not restore full levels of replication products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We only observe rescue of the reduced replication capacities of these templates when we add back different CREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and only when they are added before the helicase-activating proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-E</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>, are anti-CPB and anti-FLAG on the same membrane?

What is the difference between these experiments?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct that we used the incorrect terminology here. What we should have stated is that the nucleosomes are not uniformly spaced. We have revised the text accordingly (subsection âCRE-specific restoration of replication and CMG formation to RSC and SWI/SNF templatesâ).</p><p>The difference in the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and those shown for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref> is the extent of MNase digestion. Under low levels of digestion, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) we observe a relatively random assortment of fragments that indicate that the assembled nucleosomes are not precisely spaced relative to one another. When we add higher amounts of MNase, this random pattern of cleavage between nucleosomes collapses into similar amounts of protected ~147bp DNA for the RSC and SWI/SNF templates as we see for templates that show more uniformly spaced nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We also have performed MNase-seq with SWI/SNF and RSC templates and observe 147 bp protected fragments as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> should include a Western blot for ORC as well.</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> is a helicase loading reaction that is washed with high-salt. ORC is removed under these conditions and, therefore, would not be detected. We note that the key question in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> is whether Mcm2-7 has been loaded (the purpose of the high-salt wash is to remove any incompletely loaded Mcm2-7 â a standard method for the field). We also note that we include an ORC blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, where a low-salt wash that does not remove ORC is performed and we see equivalent ORC binding with and without nucleosomes.</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> would be improved by showing ORC occupancy in all CRE contexts.</italic> </p><p>Mcm2-7 loading requires ORC. Given that we did not see defects in helicase loading for the remaining CREs we do not think that including them in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> will enhance the conclusion of the manuscript. We chose the subset shown to focus on addressing the defects in helicase loading observed for the Isw2 and Chd1 templates. We do show that there are not significant differences for two templates that exhibit the same helicase loading observed for naked DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and showing additional ORC blots would not help to explain the defects in loading for Chd1 and Isw2 templates.</p><p><italic>8) The size range of all replication products run on denaturing agarose gels should be indicated with marker indicator.</italic> </p><p>We have included this information for each figure.</p><p><italic>9) Dissection of the steps after DDK treatment, using purified components such as Cdc45, would make this manuscript even more impactful.</italic> </p><p>We agree that further determination of the precise step impacted by different nucleosomal template in CMG formation would be of interest. Nevertheless, the critical issue is whether the CMG is formed or not and we have clearly documented that it is at this step that nucleosomes assembled in the presence of RSC and SWI/SNF are impacting initiation. Whether this occurs at the Cdc45 or GINS recruiting step will be one of several future directions for these studies.</p><p><italic>10) Including a mutant MCM2 lacking the histone binding domain would increase the impact of the manuscript, similar to the ORC BAH mutant.</italic> </p><p>We had done this experiment previously and mentioned it in the Discussion of the previous version of the paper because we did not observe a defect for this mutant. We have now included this experiment comparing helicase loading and replication initiation using Mcm2-7 with and without the histone-binding domain in the Results section (subsection âCRE-specific restoration of replication and CMG formation to RSC and SWI/SNF templatesâ paragraph three; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>11) Including the Abf1 protein, which binds the B3 element of ARS1, would increase the impact of the manuscript. Previously it was proposed that Abf1 helps establish a nucleosome free region for MCM loading.</italic> </p><p>To address a possible role for Abf1, we examined whether pre-binding of Abf1 to DNA prior to ISW2 nucleosome assembly rescued the defects in helicase loading observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2E-F</xref>). Unlike ORC pre-binding to the DNA, we found that Abf1 is not sufficient to rescue the defect in helicase loading in the presence of ISW2. Additionally, when Abf1 is included during ISW1a nucleosome assembly, we do not see an increase or decrease in the ability of ISW1a templates to load Mcm2-7. Although prior genetic studies show that Abf1 binding enhances replication initiation (Marahrens and Stillman, 1992), this is in the context of a complete chromosome with the adjacent <italic>TRP1</italic> gene being transcribed into the <italic>ARS1</italic> origin. We suspect that Abf1 may become more important under these conditions.</p><p><italic>We have included the full reviews at the bottom of this letter, to further clarify these requests.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[â¦]</italic></p><p><italic>A second question is how does chromatin remodeling enhance the specificity of licensing and activation of the origins? Is it just by repositioning the nucleosomes around the region of the ars and thereby restricting orc binding to the origins and preventing its physiologically unwarranted binding to the non-ars sequences or is it more intricate? Diffley's group finding that FACT is involved in the process suggests a more elaborate reaction involving perhaps transcription. It was reported by Marahrens and Stillman that one essential element of the ars directs transcription and is needed for ars activity.</italic> </p><p>We believe that the effect of nucleosomes on helicase loading is simply due to nucleosome occlusion and this conclusion is supported by our studies of local nucleosome positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The role of nucleosomes in the helicase activation process remains less clear. We provide strong evidence that the effects that we see are due to nucleosomes since they are readily modulated by CREs. Because our reactions do not include any components of the transcription apparatus (they are all performed with purified replication proteins â see (Looke et al., 2017) for gels of the proteins used) any effect of Abf1 or other added proteins on transcription would not be observed in our assays. The same is true for the Diffley lab experiment addressing the role of FACT in replication (Kurat et al., 2016). Instead, FACT is likely to be functioning in the Diffley studies to remove nucleosomes in front of the replication fork (as has been described for FACTâs role in transcription of chromatin templates (Belotserkovskaya et al., 2004)). Indeed, one of the FACT subunits was originally discovered due to its association with DNA Pol Î± (Miles and Formosa, 1992; Wittmeyer and Formosa, 1997).</p><p>Finally, the factor that the reviewer is referring to in the Marahrens and Stillman paper is Abf1(Marahrens and Stillman, 1992), whose function we now address (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2E-F</xref>). Although this protein can act as a transcription factor in some situations, there is no evidence that it does so at <italic>ARS1</italic>. Instead, Abf1 is known to be involved in the establishment of a positioned nucleosome adjacent to <italic>ARS1</italic> (Lipford and Bell, 2001). in vivo this may be particularly important since the <italic>TRP1</italic> gene transcribes into the <italic>ARS1</italic> region on the Abf1-side of the origin DNA.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[â¦]</italic></p><p><italic>1) The data presented seems to have more to do with the activities of the CREs than with replication. A gold standard CRE assay to validate the activity of preparations should be shown. Some introduction into the mechanistic differences between the different CREs (sliding, exchanging, etc.) have to be included both in the Introduction and in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>The first issue is addressed above: major comments, point 1. We have also added additional information about the mechanistic differences between the CREs used into the Introduction (paragraph four) and Discussion section.</p><p><italic>2) What happens if SWI/SNF or RSC are added to an ISWI1a preparation? Do they overrule ISWI1a? In other words, once you have a good template, can you mess it up (after loading)? To have an impactful conclusion from these studies, a more controlled analysis of the cross-talk between CREs is required, as all CREs are present in the nucleus.</italic> </p><p>We have done this experiment and found that SWI/SNF or RSC cannot reduce the efficiency of a ISW1a template. This suggests that once a chromatin state that is active for CMG formation is formed, it is not easily removed. This could be due to the different activities of the CREs or because there are positive interactions formed (e.g. between Mcm2-7 and nucleosomes) that are difficult for RSC or SWI/SNF to eliminate. We have added this data to the Results section(subsection âCRE-specific restoration of replication and CMG formation to RSC and SWI/SNF templatesâ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) and discuss the implications of the findings (subsection âCREs show different capacities to establish replication-competent chromatin states.â).</p><p><italic>3) It is unclear how the chromatinized plasmid was prepared. In some part of the text, and for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>, it is stated that the octamer:DNA ratio was 1:1.3, yet from the method section it appears that this is not accurate as the octamer/Nap1 complexes are in large excess to the DNA (180 nM octamer to 120 fmol 3.8kb DNA). This needs to be clarified.</italic> </p><p>Addressed above, major comment 3. We note that the relative molarity of the plasmid DNA and the octamer is not the correct comparison, as different lengths of DNA would provide different total amounts of DNA in the reaction for the same molarity. Instead, one has to determine the relative total amounts of DNA and octamer (in our case this is a 1:1.3 ratio or 296ng of DNA and 385ng of octamers in a typical reaction).</p><p><italic>4) Why do you need to purify away the Nap1 and CREs? This is not discussed, but I would argue that you may need a histone binding protein to avoid that the evicted histones precipitate onto DNA again. How much of each CRE remains bound is a critical point.</italic> </p><p>Addressed above: other comments, point 3.</p><p><italic>5) This is linked to point 2. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>, are aCPB and aFLAG on the same membrane? If not, an internal reference should be used to validate the wash of the CREs. The homogenous removal of the CREs is essential in interpreting the results.</italic> </p><p>Addressed above: other comments, point 4.</p><p><italic>6) I am confused by some results/statements:</italic> </p><p><italic>- The results of the MNAse in presence of SWI/SNF and RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) shows that the &quot;nucleosomes&quot; in those samples are not stable, yet you could perform the MNase-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and you could get a 147 bp protection in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>. What is the difference between these experiments?</italic> </p><p>Addressed above: other comments, point 5.</p><p><italic>â Related to this, the statement âOf the seven CREs we tested, only SWI/SNF and RSC did not establish regularly-spaced nucleosomesâ, as RSC and SWI/SNF do not affect spacing, there are just no stable nucleosomes in those samples.</italic> </p><p>We disagree that the inability of RSC and SWI/SNF to space nucleosomes indicates that there are no stable nucleosomes on these templates. Both the equivalent levels of 147 bp protected DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>), the similar patterns of origin proximal nucleosomes between ISW1a and SWI/SNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>), and the equivalent levels of bound histones (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-E</xref>) all indicate that the RSC and SWI/SNF templates include stably-associated nucleosomes.</p><p> <italic>â The statement âThese similarities suggests that local nucleosome positioning and/or states influence replication timingâ: nucleosome positioning is not an issue with RSC and SWI/SNF, so I would rephrase this and remove the position component. I also think more controls are needed to make this statement.</italic> </p><p>We agree that local nucleosome states do not appear to be an issue with SWI/SNF vs. ISW1a, however, there are significant differences for RSC and ISW1a as well as for RSC vs ISW1a treated RSC templates. Thus, we think that including changes in nucleosome positioning in this statement is appropriate. It is not clear what other controls the reviewer is referring to. We note, however, that the statement at issue is only suggesting a possibility raised by our data, not making a conclusion.</p><p><italic>7) I am left with the question whether CREs are essential. Can you just add histones and Nap1 to make nucleosomes? How would this &quot;chromatin template&quot; behave in your assays? Would it look like ISWI2/Chd2? This has not been shown, but it may be a good control to strengthen the relevance of CREs in the process.</italic> </p><p>We have assembled nucleosomes with only and histones and Nap1 and the MNase pattern looks similar to that of RSC or SWI/SNF, however, helicase loading and replication initiation is similar to that of ISW1a or naked DNA templates. Not surprisingly, when analyzed by limited MNase digestion, these templates show a similar lack of uniformly-spaced nucleosomes as we observe for RSC and SWI/SNF templates. Thus, the different replication capacities we observe for the RSC and SWI/SNF templates requires the action of these enzymes and is not simply a consequence of non-uniformly spaced nucleosomes. We have now included this experiment as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref> and modified the text accordingly (subsection âRSC and SWI/SNF templates impede CMG complex formationâ and âCRE-specific restoration of replication and CMG formation to RSC and SWI/SNF templatesâ).</p></body></sub-article></article>
