Like many of the parasites that cause tropical diseases, <italic>T. brucei</italic> employs genetic trickery to evade the immune systems of humans and other mammals. This involves changing the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat that surrounds the parasite on a regular basis in order to remain one step ahead of the immune system of its host: while the immune system looks for invaders wearing a particular coat, the parasites are spreading through the host in a completely different coat.</p><p>To infect other hosts, the parasite must undergo changes that allow it to re-infect the tsetse fly. Therefore, besides the ‘antigenic variation’ that allows <italic>it</italic> to change its surface coat when it is in the blood of its host, <italic>T. brucei</italic> must undergo a more fundamental metamorphosis before it is capable of colonizing the tsetse fly. However, many details of the changes that allow the parasites to re-infect flies are not understood.</p><p><italic>T. brucei</italic> has several hundred VSG genes clustered in about 15 regions known as expression sites, but only a single expression site is active at any given time. Each expression site also contains a number of other genes known as expression site-associated genes (ESAGs). Antigenic variation can occur as a result of different VSG genes within the same expression site being expressed as proteins, or when the active expression site is silenced and another expression site is activated. This is another process that is not fully understood.</p><p>Batram et al. now reveal that the expression of VSG genes, antigenic variation and the changes that allow the parasites to re-infect flies are all related to each other.

To achieve this goal, a variety of mechanisms have evolved that ensure allelic exclusion, namely the silencing of expression of all but one member of a gene family, either temporarily or for the remainder of the life of the cell.</p><p>In the mammalian central nervous system, each olfactory sensory neuron expresses only one olfactory receptor (OR) from a family of ∼1200 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>). Before an <italic>OR</italic> gene is expressed, all alleles are silenced and converted to heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Magklara et al., 2011</xref>). A limiting enzymatic activity then stochastically removes the heterochromatin marks from one allele to activate it. The expressed OR protein mediates a feedback loop that inhibits removal of heterochromatin marks from all other alleles, preventing their transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Serizawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21a">Lyons et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Allelic exclusion commonly occurs in pathogens that exploit antigenic variation of their cell surface proteins to keep ahead of the host immune response, usually as part of a population survival strategy. The malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, for example, expresses only one out of 60 members of the <italic>var</italic> gene family, each coding for different versions of the surface virulence factor PfEMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guizetti and Scherf, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Monoallelic expression of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> is a particularly striking example of allelic exclusion in a pathogen. In the mammalian host, the cell surface is covered with millions of copies of VSG that form a dense layer that is virtually impervious to host-derived antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cross, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engstler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schwede et al., 2011</xref>). VSGs are highly immunogenic and provoke a rapid and efficient immune response that diminishes the parasite population. Only trypanosomes that have successfully switched to expression of another, structurally similar but immunologically distinct VSG survive. Trypanosomes possess several hundred <italic>VSG</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berriman et al., 2005</xref>). Their potentially unlimited capacity for antigenic variation forms the basis of trypanosome persistence and virulence. <italic>VSG</italic> genes are expressed from one of ∼15 telomeric expression sites (ES) but only one of these is transcribed at any given time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hertz-Fowler et al., 2008</xref>). Chromatin remodeling appears to play an important role in maintaining the monoallelic expression of the active ES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horn and McCulloch, 2010</xref>). Antigenic variation can result from either a change in the active ES, usually gene conversion at the <italic>VSG</italic> locus, or by an epigenetic change that results in silencing of the active ES and transcription of a previously silent ES (in situ switch). No mechanism or factor has been identified that is involved in the initiation of the latter.</p><p>The complex life cycle of <italic>T. brucei</italic> represents a succession of proliferative and quiescent developmental forms, which vary widely in cell architecture and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MacGregor et al., 2012</xref>). Throughout the parasite's life cycle, the plasma membrane is covered with a series of different surface coats. Antigenic variation only occurs in the mammalian host, and not in the transmitting tsetse fly. Consequently, the trypanosome bloodstream form ES is exclusively functional in the proliferating slender bloodstream stage of the parasite. In response to quorum sensing, the trypanosomes differentiate to the quiescent stumpy form. Stumpy forms are competent for the next developmental transition to procyclic forms, which occurs after ingestion by a tsetse fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reuner et al., 1997</xref>). This developmental transition is accompanied by silencing of the active ES so that allelic exclusion is lost. How this silencing is achieved is unknown.</p><p>In this study, we show that high-level expression of an ectopic <italic>VSG</italic> transgene is sufficient to initiate the directional silencing of the active ES from the telomere inwards. The silencing of the active ES is dependent on the histone methyltransferase DOT1B. Thus, the VSG itself mediates a feedback loop that controls the state of monoallelic gene expression. Furthermore, we show that transcriptional activity of the ES directly determines cell proliferation and developmental competence via a subset of <italic>expression site associated genes (ESAGs)</italic>. Thus, the trypanosome ES can be regarded as a fine-tuned regulator at the crossroads of antigenic variation, proliferation, and development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of wild-type levels of a second VSG causes gradual attenuation of the active expression site</title><p>To simulate a transcriptional switching event (in situ switch) in the most straightforward manner, we adopted a strategy that allows inducible high-level expression of <italic>VSG121</italic> in trypanosomes that have <italic>VSG221</italic> in their active expression site (221<sup>ES</sup>). This was achieved by introducing a <italic>VSG121</italic> gene under the control of a tetracycline-inducible T7 RNA polymerase promoter (121<sup>tet</sup>) into an rDNA spacer locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

After 24 hr, the surface coat of all cells was dominated by VSG121 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the amount of VSG221 had declined to 21(±2)% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, expression of an ectopic VSG at wild-type quantities caused a reduction in the abundance of the ES-resident VSG, which decreased with a half-life of 12 hr that corresponds to the population doubling time within the first 24 hr of induction.</p><p>The reduction in steady state levels of <italic>VSG221</italic> mRNA was caused by an active process, which specifically affects the ES-resident <italic>VSG,</italic> either through reduction of transcription or by <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA degradation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we quantified other mRNAs derived from the ES. As transcription of the ES is polycistronic, any transcriptional silencing would also affect genes upstream of the <italic>VSG</italic>. Initially, the levels of three <italic>ESAG</italic> mRNAs were measured over a period of 8 hr after <italic>VSG121</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). It appears that mRNAs from the telomere proximal <italic>ESAG1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> genes decreased faster than mRNA from the telomere distal <italic>ESAG12</italic> gene. To examine whether this effect was the result of different mRNA half-lives, we inserted the same <italic>GFP</italic> transgene either upstream of the <italic>VSG</italic> gene (promoter distal) or next to the ES promoter (promoter proximal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Upon induction of <italic>VSG121</italic> expression, the promoter proximal <italic>GFP</italic> mRNA decreased with significantly slower kinetics (p&lt;0.018; two-way ANOVA test) than that of the promoter distal <italic>GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel), revealing that the kinetics of <italic>GFP</italic> mRNA reduction was determined solely by the position of the <italic>GFP</italic> gene within the active ES. Thus, <italic>VSG121</italic> overexpression caused a gradual loss of ES activity that started at the telomere and propagated towards the <italic>VSG</italic> promoter. This process was completed within one cell division cycle and was maintained for 120 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Then the ES was gradually reactivated in the reverse direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The ES was not silenced completely, so the effect did not constitute a bona fide ES silencing, but a fine-tuned ES attenuation. We postulate that this VSG-induced attenuation represents the initiation step of an antigenic in situ switch.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02324.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ectopic <italic>VSG121</italic> expression induces gradual ES attenuation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme illustrating the anatomy of the <italic>VSG221</italic> expression site in a set of reporter lines.

Parasite growth was not affected for the first 24 hr of tetracycline induction, but then cell proliferation slowed down significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The cell cycle was analyzed by determining the nucleus (N) and kinetoplast (K) configuration and showed an accumulation of 1K1N cells with the kinetoplasts having a pre-replication morphology and a reduction of cells containing a dividing kinetoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). These observations are consistent with the slowed growth resulting from a G1 phase prolongation. To test this model, the percentage of cells in S-phase was determined at different times after induction of <italic>VSG121</italic> expression. Cells were incubated with the nucleoside-analogue EdU for either 4 or 18 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In the control (0 hr), 80% of trypanosomes had entered nuclear S-phase within the 4-hr labeling window. In contrast, after 24 hr of <italic>VSG121</italic> expression only 17% incorporated EdU into nuclear DNA within an equivalent 4-hr window. However, when the parasites were incubated with EdU for 18 hr, 86% had entered S-phase. Thus, the cells were clearly not arrested in the cell cycle, but showed a specific, at least fivefold expansion of the G1-phase from 3 to 15 hr. Remarkably, all trypanosomes remained fully motile and no morphological abnormality or cell death was observed. The marked G1-phase prolongation obviously required a reduction in metabolic flux and anabolic pathways, including protein synthesis, which in turn might be reflected in decreased overall RNA synthesis. Therefore, we measured total RNA synthesis by labeling nascent transcripts with BrUTP and detection with an anti-BrdU antibody. After 8 hr of tetracycline induction, when <italic>VSG221</italic> transcripts had already decreased to 20%, the general transcription rate was not impaired at all. Only after 24 hr was the global transcription reduced to 30% (p&lt;0.0001; unpaired <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This formally proves that ES attenuation precedes growth retardation and general transcriptional diminution. To test if RNA polymerase I and II transcription was both affected, we inserted luciferase reporter transgenes either downstream of an rDNA promoter or into the <italic>tubulin</italic>-locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In both the cases, luciferase activity was down to 30–50% within 2 days. Thus, all tested regions of the genome were slowly silenced. This also explains the gradual decrease in the amount of ectopically expressed <italic>VSG121</italic> mRNA, which started after 24 hr of tetracycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) that is at a time when the active <italic>VSG221</italic> ES was already attenuated.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02324.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Expression site attenuation causes G1 retardation and transcriptional shut-down.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cumulative growth curve after induction of ectopic <italic>VSG121</italic> expression.

This developmental transition occurs in the mammalian bloodstream and involves ES-attenuation and growth arrest. The VSG-induced ES attenuation described here does not cause a bona fide cell cycle arrest and the parasites do not display the typical morphology of stumpy trypanosomes. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that the ES-attenuated parasites could have adopted stumpy-like characteristics and actually may represent the enigmatic intermediate stage, which is not yet committed to stumpy differentiation. Therefore, we tested for expression of the cell surface transporter <italic>protein associated with differentiation 1</italic> (PAD1), which is a molecular marker for stumpy cells and is not expressed in the dividing slender stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dean et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to a PAD1-specific antibody, we used a transgene, <italic>GFP:PAD</italic><sub><italic>utr</italic></sub>, encoding a GFP with a nuclear localization signal and a <italic>PAD1</italic> 3′UTR (J Sunter, A Schwede and M Carrington, unpublished), which confers the stage specificity of PAD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">MacGregor and Matthews, 2012</xref>). This reporter allowed for live cell analysis of PAD1-expression by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Prior to induction of the ectopic <italic>VSG</italic>, the cells showed no PAD1-expression and no GFP signal. After 48 hr of <italic>VSG121</italic> overexpression, however, the PAD1 protein was clearly detectable on the surface of trypanosomes in the G1-phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Likewise, the GFP:PAD<sub>utr</sub> reporter was visible in most G1 cells, but was also expressed in a minor portion of trypanosomes in other cell cycle phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This is in agreement with the observation that the <italic>PAD1</italic> mRNA is detectable prior to the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MacGregor et al., 2012</xref>).

These observations strongly argue against selection of revertants that prevent <italic>VSG121</italic> expression by interfering with the T7-system.</p><p>Thus, ES attenuation opens a time-window in which the trypanosomes linger in an intermediate state and can progress in two directions, either by differentiating to the insect stage or by returning to proliferation in the mammalian host. This questions the common view that trypanosome development is inevitably unidirectional as in the case of the SIF-induced pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">MacGregor et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The unique feature of the mammalian infective form of African trypanosomes is the plasma membrane with a dense VSG coat. The parasite has evolved an efficient system of antigenic variation that relies on monoallelic expression of <italic>VSG</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borst, 2002</xref>). Though the system is optimized for a monotypic coat, two VSGs have to be handled on the same cell surface during antigen switching. Although nothing is known about the length of this period, the different underlying molecular mechanisms suggest variable time scales. Telomere exchange or gene conversion are probably rather fast processes as loss of <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA by RNAi results in rapid cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sheader et al., 2005</xref>). A similar scenario applies if the active ES would be silenced before a new one is activated. In contrast, time would not necessarily be limiting if an in situ switch would involve activation of a new ES before silencing of the old one.</p><p>In this study, we simulated the activation of a new ES by high-level, inducible expression of a second heterologous <italic>VSG</italic>. The induction of <italic>VSG121</italic> expression resulted in the rapid decrease of <italic>VSG221</italic> mRNA and protein. The ectopic VSG121 dominated the surface coat for several days. The <italic>ESAG</italic>s were also down regulated, showing that induction of a second <italic>VSG</italic> gene attenuates the entire active ES. The insertion of reporter genes showed that this ES attenuation starts at the telomere and progresses towards the promoter region. Our data further indicate that the initial spike in the production of ectopic VSG acts as an immediate early signal, which is relayed to an epigenetic ES silencing machinery that requires the histone methyltransferase DOT1B. This model further explains the expression levels in stable VSG double-expressors that have a second <italic>VSG</italic> inserted into the active ES, just upstream of the endogenous copy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Muñoz-Jordán et al., 1996</xref>). In these double-expressors, both VSGs are expressed in a 50/50 ratio, not exceeding a total amount of 100% compared to wild-type single expressors (data not shown). The generation of such double-expressors requires antibiotic selection for 7 days after transfection. In that time, the trypanosomes react to the initial overexpression of VSG, which occurs immediately after recombination of the transgene into the active ES, and attenuate the ES. When the VSG expression is adapted, attenuation is hold, not affecting the upstream located <italic>ESAG</italic>s. Thus, high-level expression of a second <italic>VSG</italic> alone is sufficient to initiate attenuation of the active ES. Importantly and unlike the endogenous <italic>VSG</italic>, this second <italic>VSG</italic> does not have to be expressed from an ES and it does not need to be transcribed by RNA polymerase I. Furthermore, <italic>VSG</italic> silencing and shutdown of the active ES are mechanistically distinct events, as in <italic>DOT1B</italic>-knockout trypanosomes, the ES-resident <italic>VSG</italic> is silenced upon <italic>VSG</italic> overexpression, but the <italic>ESAG</italic>s are not. No phenotype is observed after <italic>VSG</italic> overexpression in the <italic>DOT1B</italic>-knockout cells, proving that neither the initial surplus of VSG production nor the non-trypanosomal T7 RNA polymerase system is toxic.</p><p>In the mammalian olfactory receptor (OR) system, the expression of an ectopic <italic>OR</italic> transgene is sufficient to mediate a feedback inhibition that prevents the expression of the active endogenous <italic>OR</italic> gene, independent of the receptor signal transduction pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>). This is strongly reminiscent of the VSG-mediated attenuation of the trypanosome ES reported here. Despite the enormous evolutionary distance between kinetoplastids and mammals the mechanistic principle appears to be conserved. The trypanosome model obviously offers some opportunities that are not readily available in the OR system, such as following the kinetics of initiation and reversal of gene silencing. Furthermore, in trypanosomes an array of genes is attenuated, whereas in the olfactory system only the <italic>OR</italic> is silenced. Importantly, the OR system fulfills a single function, namely detection of an almost infinite number of odorant molecules. Our work suggests that the control of monoallelic expression of <italic>VSG</italic> links at least three key-processes, namely antigenic variation, host range determination, and parasite development. Our findings clearly support a model in which the <italic>VSG</italic> ES orchestrates events at the crossroads of antigenic variation, cell cycle, and development. The trypanosome cell can operate for significant periods in a dormant state. This ability may become crucial in the course of an in situ switch to a non-functional or impaired VSG or upon activation of a defective ES. Any trypanosome with an attenuated ES will experience a time window of full developmental competence. Thus, the stumpy life cycle stage with its genuine cell cycle arrest can be bypassed.</p><p>While our experimental system clearly initiates <italic>VSG</italic> switching, it is not suited for completion of the process, most likely because it does not provide functional <italic>ESAG</italic>s. Interestingly, the cells react by not fully silencing the ES, but rather attenuating its activity to about 20%, probably by chromatin remodeling after histone methylation. In response to ES attenuation trypanosomes enter a semi-quiescent state with a specifically extended G1-phase. The parasites remain in this slow growth state for about 5 days and then resume normal growth without any sign of reduced fitness. While ES attenuation is triggered by the brief period of true <italic>VSG</italic> overexpression, the entry into the dormant phase is the consequence of ESAG shortage. It is important to note that ES attenuation does not lead to complete ESAG exhaustion, but rather to gradual reduction in expression. Thus, individual ESAGs could reach growth-limiting levels at different concentrations and hence, could induce G1-retardation at different times. In fact, depletion of <italic>ESAG1</italic> mRNA by RNAi leads to transient growth retardation after 48 hr. The cells recover from this phenotype 2 days later, which is in agreement with the existence of <italic>ESAG1</italic> knockout lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carruthers et al., 1996</xref>). Importantly, even depletion of the non-essential and ES-specific <italic>ESAG8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoek and Cross, 2001</xref>) becomes growth limiting for a transient period. In contrast, <italic>ESAG2</italic>-RNAi is irreversibly lethal and therefore, a complete ES shutdown without functional rescue from non-ES copies or a new ES would be detrimental. Although essential, the down-regulation of <italic>ESAG2</italic> to the level prevailing in ES-attenuated cells (20%) is tolerated. However, the function of these ESAGs remains elusive. ESAG1 and 2 are N-glycosylated, membrane-associated proteins localized in the flagellar pocket. It is suggested that both could function in the endosome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26a">Nolan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pays et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, ESAG1 and 2 could act in concert, which would explain the in parts redundant RNAi phenotypes. In contrast, ESAG8 is found in the nucleolus and the cytoplasm, and interacts with a Puf family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18a">Hoek et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19a">Hoek et al., 2002</xref>). This suggests that ESAG8 plays a role in mRNA regulation and might be linked to the differentiation pathway.</p><p>Thus, the concept of transient ES attenuation rather than immediate and complete ES silencing may be of some physiological relevance; it could allow probing for ES performance, for example ESAG functionality, VSG switching orders, quality of novel mosaic VSGs, or newly assembled expression sites. If both VSGs are compatible, and produce a mixed and dense surface coat and the <italic>ESAG</italic>s of the new ES are fully functional, the old expression site is rapidly and completely silenced with no effects on cell cycle progression. However, if any component of the new ES fails or is not sufficiently functional, the cells can adjust growth, in the extreme, to very basal levels. This way the parasites may either gain time to adapt to the new conditions or reverse the attenuation and re-activate the old ES. We suggest that the latter case resembles an unsuccessful switching event, which would escape experimental detection. In fact, we can only observe successful <italic>VSG</italic> switching events, thereby neglecting the surprising capacity of trypanosomes to reverse switching directions.</p><p>This flexibility could become particularly productive in varying host environments. Provided a sufficiently high ES activation frequency exists, the parasites could effectively probe for host serum-compatible ESAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bitter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaves et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pays et al., 2001</xref>). Hence, ES switching plasticity could determine the host range. One extreme example for this is <italic>Trypanosoma b. rhodesiense,</italic> which is human-infective and thought to be a host-range variant of <italic>T. b. brucei</italic>. The parasites are specifically adapted to human serum by expression of the serum-resistance antigen (SRA) from one particular <italic>VSG</italic> ES in most isolates. The structure of the <italic>SRA</italic>-containing ES is unusual as it is missing several <italic>ESAG</italic>s present in all other ESs. During an infection of a human, an in situ switch to a <italic>VSG</italic> in another ES would cause loss of <italic>SRA</italic> expression, with lethal consequences. Thus, <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> must not switch off the <italic>SRA</italic>-containing ES, thus making the ESAG-dependent differentiation pathway obsolete. This may be the reason why the <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> ES has lost <italic>ESAG1</italic>, <italic>2</italic> and <italic>8</italic>.</p><p>The fact that ES attenuation causes growth retardation could also become mechanistically relevant during another phase of the trypanosome life cycle, namely upon differentiation to the G1/G0-arrested stumpy stage. The developmental transition from the proliferating slender to the quiescent stumpy bloodstream stage is initiated by quorum sensing of the trypanosome-derived compound SIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reuner et al., 1997</xref>). The monomorphic cells used in this study are unresponsive to SIF and hence, should have lost the capacity to differentiate to the tsetse-infective stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vassella et al., 1997</xref>). In our experiments, however, VSG-induced ES attenuation renders monomorphic trypanosomes fully competent for development. After 2 days of <italic>VSG</italic> overexpression the stumpy stage marker PAD1 was strongly up-regulated, specifically in G1-phase cells, and despite global transcriptional silencing being initiated at the same time. This indicates a highly specific event, which, in the absence of SIF, is orchestrated solely by the state of the <italic>VSG</italic> expression site. We are currently investigating this alternative pathway in a pleomorphic strain. The induced expression of a second <italic>VSG</italic> indeed leads to the formation of stumpy forms (data not shown). While VSG itself is not involved, as it is not limiting in our system, three ESAGs signal ES attenuation to the differentiation pathway. Depletion of <italic>ESAG</italic>s <italic>1, 2</italic> and <italic>8</italic> mRNA by RNAi resulted in induction of the PAD1 reporter GFP:PAD<sub>utr</sub>. Down-regulation of any of the other <italic>ESAG</italic>s did not cause GFP:PAD<sub>utr</sub> expression. This underlines the specificity of the pathway and suggests that ES activity controls the induction of transient developmental competence. Remarkably, by embedding the endogenous PAD1 protein into the VSG coat, the ES attenuated trypanosomes became fully responsive to the developmental trigger <italic>cis</italic>-aconitate. They initiated transformation to the procyclic insect stage with the same kinetics as stumpy parasites.</p><p>There is, however, one principal feature that distinguishes SIF-mediated stumpy formation from ES-regulated cell dormancy. While stumpy parasites are terminally differentiated and can only survive if taken up by an insect, the onset of differentiation is fully reversible in the ES-attenuated trypanosomes. We postulate that these parasites linger in an intermediate state with open developmental choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). They have the capacity to complete ES switching by adapting to the new ES or, alternatively, they can re-activate the old, attenuated ES. In both of these cases the parasites resume growth as mammalian bloodstream form cells. If taken up by the tsetse fly, however, they would immediately transform to the procyclic insect stage.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02324.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of the dual roles of expression site attenuation for antigenic variation and development of <italic>T. brucei</italic>.</title><p>Activation of a new ES leads to attenuation of the previously active one in a DOT1B-dependent manner. The attenuation and subsequent growth retardation allows ES quality control via ESAG1, 2 and 8. If the newly activated ES is functional, the old one is rapidly silenced, resulting in a <italic>successful</italic> VSG switch. If, however, a non-functional or non-compatible ES is activated, the cells react with a specific prolongation of the G1-cell cycle phase. This dormancy can last for up to 5 days and is fully reversible. Within this period the trypanosomes become competent for developmental stage transition, which involves expression of the stumpy marker PAD1. The stumpy stage, however, is irreversibly arrested in G0 and therefore committed to a life in the tsetse fly. In contrast, ES attenuation causes a reversible G1 dormancy, which allows either re-activation of the attenuated ES (<italic>unsuccessful switch</italic>) or survival by development in the insect vector. Thus, ES attenuation operates at the crossroads of antigenic variation and development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02324.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02324.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02324-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>This high flexibility might become biologically relevant especially during early infections, when certain ESAGs or VSGs are not compatible with the new host environment: cells either adapt or regain fly-infectivity.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We found your work very interesting, potentially revealing new insight into a central process of parasite survival in the host – the ability to switch surface antigens and evade the host immune response. This would be a valuable new view on this central process, revealing parallels with permanent monoallelic gene controls amongst gene families in mammals. However, we also agreed that there were potential problems with the work, outlined below, which we would like you to address. The two most major issues are first, whether your experimental strategy really does mimic VSG switching, and the extent to which this might causes an artefact. Second, there is concern related to the suggested trigger for VSG switching: expression of a new VSG. It was also felt that in places conclusions are over-stated or the most current literature not taken into account.</p><p>1) Since ectopic T7-based expression of <italic>VSG</italic> is non-physiological and this triggers a global reduction in transcription, it is unclear to what extent certain phenotypes actually reflect physiologically relevant processes as proposed. The authors work hard to convince the reader that the events observed are consistent with processes associated with <italic>VSG</italic> switching and with differentiation of replicative to non-replicative cells. However, these data might also be explained by over-expression of <italic>VSG121</italic> being toxic to the cells, at least in the conditions used. For example, the growth, replication and gene expression effects that are observed might be explained by the cells becoming very sick upon <italic>VSG121</italic> induction. Why this might be is unclear, but one possibility is that very high levels of mRNA for <italic>VSG121</italic>, or perhaps very high levels of two VSGs, overwhelm the transcription and translation apparatus of the cell. If this were the case, it would explain why the cells stop growing and the effects seen. The authors should comment on this.</p><p>The observed return to growth after 5 days, associated with re-expression of <italic>VSG221</italic> (in the ES), is of particular concern. Could this represent the selection for 'revertants' that suppress ectopic expression of <italic>VSG121</italic>? The authors note (in second paragraph of the Results section entitled “Expression site attenuation and growth retardation are fully reversible processes”) that 'the trypanosomes became responsive to re-introduction of tetracycline', which might suggest that permanent mutations that prevent <italic>VSG121</italic> expression have not been selected. However, the wording used is rather vague, and it is not at all clear whether this is their meaning. In addition, we are provided with no evidence to support the putative claim that <italic>VSG121</italic> can be re-induced at this stage. The authors must comment on this further: if revertants are being selected for that no longer express <italic>VSG121</italic>, it suggests significant problems with the experimental approach.</p><p>A main argument that the authors make to suggest that the <italic>VSG121</italic> expression is an accurate mimic of <italic>VSG</italic> switching and differentiation, is that they see a general decrease in transcription, consistent with a previous report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiguet-Vercher et al. (2004)</xref>. In more recent work, using whole-genome gene expression analyses (Kabani et al, 2009, BMC Genomics; Capewell et al, 2013, PLoS ONE), there is little evidence for such global reduction in transcription: though translation decreases in short stumpy cells relative to long slender, only a very small number of genes show reduced levels of mRNA (e.g., 41 in the Capewell study). Thus, the global effects described here upon <italic>VSG121</italic> induction may not reflect the developmental change from long slender to short stumpy cells, but instead toxic effects of <italic>VSG121</italic> overexpression. Thus, the association between <italic>VSG</italic> switching and differentiation may not be warranted. The authors must discuss these data in the context of their model.</p><p>It is currently not convincing that the <italic>VSG</italic> expression site is a 'global regulator' (end of the Introduction) or 'global control module' (end of the Discussion) of antigenic variation, proliferation and development. Without studies in a fully differentiation-competent 'pleomorphic' strain, strong conclusions can't be drawn. These sections should be toned down to reflect the uncertainty.</p><p>2) The strategy used to induce 'switching' involves expression of second VSG, and the authors suggest that such double VSG expression is the trigger for switching – e.g., in the final paragraph of the Introduction “Thus, the VSG itself mediates a feedback loop that controls ... monoallelic gene expression”; “an in situ switch would involve activation of a new ES before silencing of the old one' (first paragraph of the Discussion); and the authors draw parallel with mammalian OR silencing (third paragraph of the Discussion) ”...expression of an ectopic or transgene is sufficient to mediate a feedback inhibition....”. If this is the case, the authors must explain some anomalies. First, this model predicts that two VSGs cannot be simultaneously expressed, as one will trigger suppression of another. However, double <italic>VSG</italic> expressers have been reported, and it has been shown that such double expressers are stable in vitro and in vivo, and do not impair growth: Baltz et al. (1986), Nature; and Munoz-Jordan et al. (1996), Science. How can these data be explained, in the context of the model that the authors propose? Second, the authors' model appears to suggest that expression of a second VSG begins a progressive attenuation of the ES from the telomere, allowing the cells to 'probe for ES functionality'. However, how can this actually happen, since in the normal context a second VSG can only be expressed in conjunction with the upstream <italic>ESAGs</italic>, since they share a common promoter in the ES? In other words, it seems that the only circumstances in which <italic>ESAG</italic>s are not co-expressed with the <italic>VSG</italic> is when an ES is activated that lacks these genes; if this is the case, it is only in these circumstances that G1 dormancy and reversible differentiation occurs (these are induced by LOSS of some ESAGs, as shown by this work). If a new <italic>VSG</italic> is expressed from an ES with a full complement of <italic>ESAGs</italic>, these phenotypes would not be seen, further suggesting that they are an artefact of ectopic <italic>VSG121</italic> expression from outside an ES.</p><p>3) Expression site transcription may control developmental competence via at least three genes co-transcribed with the VSG but it's difficult to see how each gene knockdown acts redundantly to bring about this effect. Could the authors say more about the putative functions of these <italic>ESAGs</italic> relative to those not linked to this phenotype? Is a SIF signal thought to downregulate these ESAGs and in-turn render the cells more competent for differentiation or is <italic>ESAG</italic> downregulation thought to bypasses SIF signalling?</p><p>4) The ESAG sensing model states that <italic>ESAGs 1, 2</italic> and to some extent <italic>8</italic> are important while the other <italic>ESAGs</italic> are not. However, <italic>ESAG 5</italic>, present in all known ES was not tested. The data would be strengthened if ESAG5 RNAi was included.</p><p>5) The authors’ results quantitating transcripts using hybridisation of dot-blots or Northern blots rather than by qPCR was not completely convincing. In the first Results section the authors say “It is immediately apparent that mRNAs.. decreased faster...” These quantifications should ideally be repeated using qRT-PCR<italic>. ESAG1</italic> and <italic>ESAG2</italic> are members of very large gene families, which contain copies outside of ESs, also transcribed by Pol II. Using qPCR, the authors could design primers specific for the <italic>ESAG</italic> copies present in the <italic>VSG221</italic> ES (and not detect non-ES derived <italic>ESAG</italic>s).</p><p>[Editors' note: further clarifications were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>1) One point in particular remains unclear, which is an important issue: the authors say that “it is certainly possible to express two <italic>VSG</italic> ES at the same time, albeit not for long and not at the same level” and then that “cells must adapt to the production of the two VSGs in order to survive. They do this by balancing their expression levels – exactly as our model would predict”. This seems contradictory. Would the model not predict attenuation of the downstream <italic>VSG</italic> in the experiments reported by Munoz-Jordan et al. (1996)?</p><p>2) In the absence of knowing the functions of <italic>ESAGs 1, 2</italic> and <italic>8</italic>, the evidence that <italic>ESAGs1, 2</italic> and <italic>8</italic> serve as signals for ES attenuation still a bit speculative. I think that the Abstract should read that these “appear to serve” or “could serve” as a signal for ES attenuation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02324.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Since ectopic T7-based expression of</italic> VSG <italic>is non-physiological and this triggers a global reduction in transcription, it is unclear to what extent certain phenotypes actually reflect physiologically relevant processes as proposed.

If this were the case, it would explain why the cells stop growing and the effects seen. The authors should comment on this</italic>.</p><p>A) The overexpression of <italic>VSG</italic> per se is non-toxic. In <italic>DOT1B</italic> knockout cells, tetracycline-induced <italic>VSG121</italic> expression occurs with identical kinetics and to the same level as in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, in these mutant cells, no growth phenotype or any transcriptional shutdown occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This means that the surplus <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA or VSG protein does not overwhelm the transcription or translation apparatus of the cells. Thus, the highly specific growth and gene expression phenotype observed in wild type cells is a consequence of expression site attenuation, which does not occur in the <italic>DOT1B</italic> knockout cells.</p><p>B) As a control, we have overexpressed a GFP transgene to similarly high levels. This was indeed toxic to the trypanosomes. The cells started to die within 24 hours and revealed grossly abnormal morphologies. Thus, the GFP overexpressors behaved fundamentally different from trypanosomes after induction of ectopic <italic>VSG</italic> expression.</p><p>C) The T7-based gene expression system was intentionally preferred over a polymerase I-based expression system to minimize interference with the endogenous transcription machinery.</p><p><italic>The observed return to growth after 5 days, associated with re-expression of</italic> VSG221 <italic>(in the ES), is of particular concern. Could this represent the selection for 'revertants' that suppress ectopic expression of</italic> VSG121<italic>?</italic></p><p>We cannot formally exclude that spontaneous mutations are responsible for the reproducible suppression of ectopic <italic>VSG121</italic> expression. However, this possibility is extremely unlikely as several new experiments suggest that an epigenetic mechanism causes <italic>VSG121</italic> silencing 5 days after induction:</p><p>A) We have now induced <italic>VSG121</italic> expression in a population for 72h followed by limiting dilution to 1 cell/ml and cloning on a 96-well plate. A non-induced culture was diluted and cloned in the same way and served as a control. Seven days later, 18 and 14 clones were isolated from the induced and non-induced population, respectively. By protein dot blot we found that <italic>VSG221</italic> expression was fully restored in all clones. It is extremely unlikely that 18 independent mutation events have by chance and at the same time ‘decommissioned’ the T7 expression system. Therefore, we assume that an epigenetic mechanism is responsible for full re-activation of the attenuated ES and silencing of the ectopic <italic>VSG121</italic> copy.</p><p>B) We analysed <italic>VSG</italic> expression at single cell resolution using immunofluorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). All cells in the population were cell surface-positive for <italic>VSG121</italic> within 24 hours after tetracycline induction. This excludes that the return to growth was due to the presence of non-inducible cells in the original population.</p><p>C) Furthermore, we have expressed the <italic>VSG121</italic> gene using a constitutive T7 promoter, i.e., in the absence of tetracycline. All resulting clonal populations revealed reduced levels of ectopic <italic>VSG121</italic> expression, comparable to inducible <italic>VSG121</italic>-expressors after ES-re-activation (after 5 days). Importantly, in those cell lines the tetracycline system was still fully functional, as shown by tetracycline induction of an unrelated transgene. These observations strongly argue against selection of revertants that prevent <italic>VSG121</italic> expression by interfering with the T7-system.</p><p>D) Within 5 days the attenuated ES-linked <italic>VSG221</italic> is gradually de-repressed and we suggest that it is the increasing amount of reappearing <italic>VSG221</italic> that decreases the levels of the ectopic <italic>VSG121</italic>. Once the <italic>VSG221</italic> ES has been fully re-activated, the ribosomal spacer copy of <italic>VSG121</italic> has been silenced to pre-induction levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, in the <italic>DOT1B</italic> knockout cells no suppression of the ectopic copy is observed, even after 10 days of induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This suggests that depletion of <italic>DOT1B</italic> interferes with an epigenetic silencing mechanism. Similar effects were observed when the in situ switching kinetics was monitored in a <italic>DOT1B-</italic>depleted strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Figueiredo et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p><italic>The authors note (in second paragraph of the Results section entitled “Expression site attenuation and growth retardation are fully reversible processes”) that 'the trypanosomes became responsive to re-introduction of tetracycline', which might suggest that permanent mutations that prevent</italic> VSG121 <italic>expression have not been selected. However, the wording used is rather vague, and it is not at all clear whether this is their meaning. In addition, we are provided with no evidence to support the putative claim that</italic> VSG121 <italic>can be re-induced at this stage</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for this lack of clarity. The observations are now detailed in the text. In fact, re-induction works to the same degree as in non-induced parasites in more than 20 % of the population. The other part revealed different degrees of VSG-induction, which is compatible with gradual reversion of epigenetic silencing, rather than outgrowth of a mutant.</p><p><italic>The authors must comment on this further: if revertants are being selected for that no longer express</italic> VSG121<italic>, it suggests significant problems with the experimental approach</italic>.</p><p>The above line of evidence makes it very unlikely that random mutation events are responsible for the decrease of <italic>VSG121</italic> expression.</p><p><italic>A main argument that the authors make to suggest that the</italic> VSG121 <italic>expression is an accurate mimic of VSG switching and differentiation, is that they see a general decrease in transcription, consistent with a previous report by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"><italic>Amiguet-Vercher et al. (2004)</italic></xref><italic>. In more recent work, using whole-genome gene expression analyses (Kabani et al, 2009, BMC Genomics; Capewell et al, 2013, PLoSONE), there is little evidence for such global reduction in transcription: though translation decreases in short stumpy cells relative to long slender, only a very small number of genes show reduced levels of mRNA (e.g., 41 in the Capewell study). Thus, the global effects described here upon</italic> VSG121 <italic>induction may not reflect the developmental change from long slender to short stumpy cells, but instead toxic effects of</italic> VSG121 <italic>overexpression. Thus, the association between VSG switching and differentiation may not be warranted. The authors must discuss these data in the context of their model</italic>.</p><p>A) As done by Amiguet-Vercher et al. we analysed the global RNA synthesis rate at single cell resolution by incorporation of BrUTP into nascent transcripts.</p><p>B) Kabani et al. and Capewell et al. analysed the mRNA expression profiles of the developmental stages using microarray and digital SAGE approaches, respectively. These techniques involve normalisation to the total RNA input in each sample throughout the analysis, as they aim to identify differentially regulated mRNAs. Thus, these publications contain no information on the overall transcriptional activity or the amount of total RNA in the cells – lower global transcriptional activity or reduced overall RNA amounts would not be detected.</p><p><italic>It is currently not convincing that the</italic> VSG <italic>expression site is a 'global regulator' (end of the Introduction) or 'global control module' (end of the Discussion) of antigenic variation, proliferation and development. Without studies in a fully differentiation-competent 'pleomorphic' strain, strong conclusions can't be drawn. These sections should be toned down to reflect the uncertainty</italic>.</p><p>Our observations are indeed based on experiments with monomorphic cells. The fact that developmental competence can be triggered in a strain that is supposed to be partly refractory to developmental progression is mechanistically intriguing. However, we agree that our conclusions would be strengthened by experiments with pleomorphic cells.</p><p>Therefore, we have now done the same overexpression in a pleomorphic cell line. Tetracycline-induced expression of a second VSG in fact leads to growth attenuation and the formation of stumpy forms. We have not included these experiments in the present manuscript as they are in part still ongoing and will be published elsewhere. However, we now mention the result in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) The strategy used to induce 'switching' involves expression of second VSG, and the authors suggest that such double VSG expression is the trigger for switching – e.g., in the final paragraph of the Introduction “Thus, the VSG itself mediates a feedback loop that controls ... monoallelic gene expression”; “an in situ switch would involve activation of a new ES before silencing of the old one' (first paragraph of the Discussion); and the authors draw parallel with mammalian OR silencing (third paragraph of the Discussion) ”...expression of an ectopic or transgene is sufficient to mediate a feedback inhibition....”. If this is the case, the authors must explain some anomalies. First, this model predicts that two VSGs cannot be simultaneously expressed, as one will trigger suppression of another. However, double</italic> VSG <italic>expressers have been reported, and it has been shown that such double expressers are stable in vitro and in vivo, and do not impair growth: Baltz et al. (1986), Nature; and Munoz-Jordan et al. (1996), Science. How can these data be explained, in the context of the model that the authors propose?</italic></p><p>A) Baltz et al. (1986) describe an observation in <italic>T. equiperdum</italic>, a species that has lost the insect life cycle stage. The report does not include any information on the quantities with which both VSGs are co-expressed. In our model, we simulate a situation in which a second <italic>VSG</italic> ES becomes fully transcriptionally active, resulting in the peak expression of two VSGs at wild type levels. This initial and transient spike in VSG production then quickly triggers a feedback loop that attenuates the active ES. Thus, it is certainly possible to express two <italic>VSG</italic> ES at the same time, albeit not for long and not at the same level. Importantly, Figueiredo et al. (2008) showed that trypanosomes lacking the histone methyltransferase <italic>DOT1B</italic> transcribe two ES simultaneously for up to 40 days. However, at no time were both ES 100 % active. Thus, a situation in which a second ES shows 20 % activity whilst retaining expression from the old one is possible, although such a situation would not be stable in vivo under host immune pressure. This may explain the observations of Baltz et al. (1986) and is absolutely compatible with our model.</p><p>B) Munoz-Jordan et al. (1996) generated VSG double-expressors by inserting a second <italic>VSG</italic> into the actively transcribed ES, just upstream of the endogenous <italic>VSG</italic> gene. We have repeated these experiments and carefully quantified the <italic>VSG</italic> levels in several VSG double-expressors and found that both <italic>VSGs</italic> are expressed at a 50/50 ratio, not exceeding a total VSG amount of 100 % when compared to wild type cells. The production of such double-expressor cell lines requires antibiotic selection for 7 days after transfection. During this period the cells must adapt to the production of the two <italic>VSGs</italic> in order to survive. They do this by balancing their expression levels – exactly as our model would predict.</p><p><italic>Second, the authors' model appears to suggest that expression of a second VSG begins a progressive attenuation of the ES from the telomere, allowing the cells to 'probe for ES functionality'. However, how can this actually happen, since in the normal context a second VSG can only be expressed in conjunction with the upstream</italic> ESAGs<italic>, since they share a common promoter in the ES? In other words, it seems that the only circumstances in which</italic> ESAG<italic>s are not co-expressed with the</italic> VSG <italic>is when an ES is activated that lacks these genes; if this is the case, it is only in these circumstances that G1 dormancy and reversible differentiation occurs (these are induced by LOSS of some</italic> ESAGs<italic>, as shown by this work). If a new VSG is expressed from an ES with a full complement of</italic> ESAGs<italic>, these phenotypes would not be seen, further suggesting that they are an artefact of ectopic</italic> VSG121 <italic>expression from outside an ES</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is absolutely right by stating that ES attenuation and cell dormancy would not occur during a ‘regular’ <italic>VSG</italic> switching event. If a new <italic>VSG</italic> ES is activated that contains a full and functional complement of <italic>ESAGs</italic>, none of those would become limiting when the old ES is attenuated. This in situ switch would rapidly be completed without any effects on cell proliferation. This is what we have defined in our model as a 'successful switch' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast, if the newly activated ES does not contain a fully functional or host-compatible set of ESAGs, the trypanosomes would respond to ES attenuation with dormancy and gain of developmental competence. The parasites either adapt to the new ES (as is the case with the unusual <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> SRA-containing ES; see below), they develop in the tsetse vector, or ‘simply’ reactivate the old ES. This is what we have defined as an 'unsuccessful switch' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In our experiments we simulate such an ‘unsuccessful switch’ by expressing a second <italic>VSG</italic> without any <italic>ESAGs</italic>. We discuss this in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) Expression site transcription may control developmental competence via at least three genes co-transcribed with the</italic> VSG <italic>but it's difficult to see how each gene knockdown acts redundantly to bring about this effect. Could the authors say more about the putative functions of these</italic> ESAGs <italic>relative to those not linked to this phenotype?</italic></p><p>Most <italic>ESAGs</italic> do not show any significant homologies to other genes present in the genome databases; so it is problematic to speculate about their functions. However, <italic>ESAG1</italic> is predicted to contain a membrane-spanning domain, as well as cytoplasmic endosomal/lysosomal sorting motifs and it apparently localises to the flagellar pocket. This suggests that <italic>ESAG1</italic> might function as a receptor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pays et al. 2001</xref>). Likewise, <italic>ESAG2</italic> is found in the flagellar pocket, but this protein is GPI-anchored and heavily modified with linear p-NAL glycan chains. Thus, <italic>ESAG2</italic> could function in the elaborate endosome pathway (Nolan et al. 1999). It is tempting to speculate that <italic>ESAG1</italic> and 2 act in concert, as this would explain the redundant RNAi phenotypes. In contrast, <italic>ESAG8</italic> is a nucleolar protein that is also distributed in the cytoplasm (Hoek et al. 2000) and interacts with a Puf family member (Hoek et al. 2002). This suggests that <italic>ESAG8</italic> could play a role in the regulation of mRNA stability, maybe during development. <italic>ESAG6/7</italic> form a transferrin receptor required for iron uptake and thus have a crucial function in metabolism. <italic>ESAG3</italic> contains a secretion signal peptide but apparently lacks a membrane-spanning domain and a GPI-anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pays et al. 2001</xref>). We now mention some potential functions in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Is a SIF signal thought to downregulate these</italic> ESAGs <italic>and in-turn render the cells more competent for differentiation or is ESAG downregulation thought to bypasses SIF signalling?</italic></p><p>We are currently working on the question whether SIF directly induces ES silencing or actively decreases the amount of <italic>ESAG</italic> mRNA. The SIF mediated pathway certainly is the dominant differentiation pathway and involves a complex signaling cascade (Mony et al. 2013). Our results show, however, that ES silencing and concomitant <italic>ESAG</italic> depletion can indeed bypass this pathway.</p><p><italic>4) The</italic> ESAG <italic>sensing model states that</italic> ESAGs 1, 2 <italic>and to some extent</italic> 8 <italic>are important while the other</italic> ESAGs <italic>are not. However,</italic> ESAG 5<italic>, present in all known ES was not tested. The data would be strengthened if</italic> ESAG5 <italic>RNAi was included</italic>.</p><p>We had done the <italic>ESAG5</italic> RNAi, but did not observe any phenotype and hence had not include the data. We now mention the result in the Results section entitled “Signaling of expression site attenuation involves three ESAGs.”</p><p><italic>5) The authors’ results quantitating transcripts using hybridisation of dot-blots or Northern blots rather than by qPCR was not completely convincing. In the first Results section the authors say “It is immediately apparent that mRNAs.. decreased faster...” These quantifications should ideally be repeated using qRT-PCR.</italic> ESAG1 <italic>and</italic> ESAG2 <italic>are members of very large gene families, which contain copies outside of ESs, also transcribed by Pol II. Using qPCR, the authors could design primers specific for the</italic> ESAG <italic>copies present in the</italic> VSG221 <italic>ES (and not detect non-ES derived</italic> ESAGs<italic>)</italic>.</p><p>We agree that our experiments do not distinguish between ES and non-ES transcripts. As suggested by the reviewer we have now tried qPCR, however have not been able to unequivocally distinguish between the ES-encoded and non-ES mRNA species. In fact, the <italic>ESAG1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> family members display very high sequence homologies, which may explain this result.</p><p>The percentage of non-ES derived <italic>ESAG1</italic> transcripts was reported to be at most 20 % of total <italic>ESAG1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carruthers et al. 1996</xref>). This means that the vast majority of <italic>ESAG</italic> transcripts is generated by the active ES. Thus, a decrease in mRNA abundance of more than 20 % must be due to reduced transcripts from the ES. We measured a decrease of <italic>ESAG1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> mRNA of 60 % and 40 %, respectively.</p><p>Importantly, <italic>ESAG8</italic> is specific for the ES. Therefore, the <italic>ESAG8</italic> knock-down only affects the ES-linked gene.</p><p>[Editors' note: further clarifications were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) One point in particular remains unclear, which is an important issue: the authors say that “it is certainly possible to express two VSG ES at the same time, albeit not for long and not at the same level” and then that “cells must adapt to the production of the two VSGs in order to survive. They do this by balancing their expression levels – exactly as our model would predict”. This seems contradictory. Would the model not predict attenuation of the downstream</italic> VSG <italic>in the experiments reported by Munoz-Jordan et al. (1996)?</italic></p><p>This is correct. We actually had done the experiment but did not mention the results. The paragraph beginning “<italic>“This model further explains the expression levels in stable VSG double-expressors…”</italic> is now included in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) In the absence of knowing the functions of ESAGs 1, 2 and 8, the evidence that ESAGs1, 2 and 8 serve as signals for ES attenuation still a bit speculative. I think that the Abstract should read that these “appear to serve” or “could serve” as a signal for ES attenuation</italic>.</p><p>We have changed the Abstract accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
