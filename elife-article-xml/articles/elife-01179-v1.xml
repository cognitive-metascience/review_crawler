Stop codon readthrough is essential to diverse viruses, and phylogenetically predicted to occur in a few hundred genes in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, but the importance of regulated readthrough in eukaryotes remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a ribosome profiling assay (deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments) for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and provide the first genome-wide experimental analysis of readthrough. Readthrough is far more pervasive than expected: the vast majority of readthrough events evolved within <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and were not predicted phylogenetically. The resulting C-terminal protein extensions show evidence of selection, contain functional subcellular localization signals, and their readthrough is regulated, arguing for their importance. We further demonstrate that readthrough occurs in yeast and humans. Readthrough thus provides general mechanisms both to regulate gene expression and function, and to add plasticity to the proteome during evolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01179.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01179.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01179.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For a gene to give rise to a protein, its DNA is first used as a template to produce a messenger RNA molecule. Each group of three nucleotides within the messenger RNA encodes an amino acid, and structures called ribosomes assemble the protein by joining together amino acids in the correct order. The nucleotide triplets are called codons, and some are known as stop codons because they typically instruct the ribosome to stop adding amino acids.</p><p>Sometimes ribosomes interpret stop codons as amino acid insertion signals, giving rise to an extended protein with a modified structure or function. This phenomenon is known as stop codon readthrough, and is required for many viruses to complete their reproductive cycles. However, much less is known about stop codon readthrough in other organisms.</p><p>Now, Dunn et al. have used a technique called ribosome profiling to analyze stop codon readthrough across the entire genome of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. An enzyme was used to fragment messenger RNA, and those fragments that were specifically engaged by ribosomes—and thus likely to encode protein—were sequenced. Stop codon readthrough occurred much more often than had been expected based on previous studies. Indeed, computational analysis strongly suggests that evolution has favored this process for certain fruit fly genes. Moreover, stop codon readthrough was also observed in yeast and human cells, suggesting that it is important in many organisms, not just the fruit fly.</p><p>Stop codon readthrough thus provides a novel way for organisms to tune the expression levels and functions of their genes, both throughout the lifetime of an individual, and the evolution of a species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01179.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01179.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>readthrough</kwd><kwd>stop codon</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>ribosome profiling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunn</surname><given-names>Joshua G</given-names></name><name><surname>Foo</surname><given-names>Catherine K</given-names></name><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunn</surname><given-names>Joshua G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM061107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Belletier</surname><given-names>Nicolette G</given-names></name><name><surname>Gavis</surname><given-names>Elizabeth R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 GM102706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunn</surname><given-names>Joshua G</given-names></name><name><surname>Foo</surname><given-names>Catherine K</given-names></name><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ribosomes translate through stop codons far more often than previously thought, yielding C-terminally extended proteins in a variety of eukaryotes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Upon encountering a stop codon, ribosomes can terminate translation with remarkable fidelity, yet they do not always do so. Stop codon readthrough, the decoding of a stop codon as a sense codon by the ribosome, plays important regulatory roles. Most immediately, readthrough diversifies the proteome by creating a pool of C-terminally extended proteins. In this capacity, it is essential to a variety of plant and animal viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cimino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li and Rice, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Napthine et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Skuzeski et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yoshinaka et al., 1985</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beier and Grimm, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Firth and Brierley, 2012</xref>). In eukaryotic host genes, readthrough is functionally important insofar as it may suppress pathological phenotypes caused by premature stop codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kopczynski et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fearon et al., 1994</xref>), antagonize nonsense-mediated decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keeling et al., 2004</xref>), and, by changing the C-terminal sequence of a given protein, modulate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Torabi and Kruglyak, 2012</xref>), stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Namy et al., 2002</xref>), and/or localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Freitag et al., 2012</xref>). In yeast, the efficiency of translation termination is modulated by [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>], an epigenetic state resulting from prion-like aggregates of Sup35p, the yeast homologue of the translation termination factor eRF3 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tuite and Cox, 2007</xref>). Various yeast strains exhibit [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>]-dependent fitness advantages, implying that increased readthrough activates useful genetic diversity that is ordinarily masked by stop codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">True and Lindquist, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Halfmann et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, a small baseline level of readthrough appears to be beneficial in wild [<italic>psi<sup>−</sup></italic>] yeast strains, as alleles of various factors controlling termination efficiency are under balancing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Torabi and Kruglyak, 2011</xref>).</p><p>However, a broad understanding of the biological roles of readthrough in eukaryotes remains elusive due to a lack of experimental data. To date, only a handful of eukaryotic host genes have been experimentally demonstrated to undergo readthrough in wild-type or prion-free organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geller and Rich, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xue and Cooley, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klagges et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Steneberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Namy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jungreis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Freitag et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Torabi and Kruglyak, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</xref>). Compelling evidence that readthrough is broadly important in eukaryotes came with the development of algorithms (CSF and PhyloCSF) that use orthologous nucleotide sequences from related organisms to identify protein-coding regions of a reference genome based upon signatures of amino acid conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2011</xref>). Using this approach, 283 readthrough events were predicted in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, six of which they confirmed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jungreis et al., 2011</xref>). While these algorithms provide a powerful means to identify ancient and phylogenetically conserved readthrough events, they are limited in their ability to detect evolutionarily recent events. Nor can bioinformatic approaches identify a priori the tissues or cell types in which readthrough occurs, measure the fraction of ribosomes that read through a given stop codon, or determine whether any of these processes are regulated: such questions demand experimental approaches.</p><p>To this end, we present a modified ribosome profiling protocol—based on the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected footprint fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>)—that enables analysis of translation at a genome-wide level in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Application of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ribosome profiling strategy allows annotation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteome using empirical data. By examining the physical locations of ribosomes along mRNAs, we discover that readthrough is far more pervasive than expected: we identify more than 300 readthrough events not predicted by phylogenetic approaches. We provide evidence that these novel extensions are of recent evolutionary origin, and show using specific examples that both the novel and conserved extensions can produce stable protein products, be produced in a regulated manner, and contain functional subcellular localization signals. We further demonstrate that readthrough occurs at many loci in [<italic>psi<sup>−</sup></italic>] yeast and in primary human foreskin fibroblasts, arguing that readthrough is both a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic translation and a novel mechanism to regulate gene expression. Stop codon readthrough thus adds plasticity to the proteome during development, and provides an evolutionary mechanism for extant genes to acquire new functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of a ribosome profiling assay for cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells</title><p>In order to study translation and, more specifically, stop codon readthrough in <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> we sought to develop a robust ribosome profiling assay for this organism. We initially developed our protocol in S2 cells, a macrophage-like lineage derived from late-stage <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos.</p><p>In previous studies, ribosome-protected fragments or ‘footprints’ were generated by digesting eukaryotic polysome lysates with RNase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2011</xref>). In contrast to yeast and mammalian cell lines, we found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> ribosomes are highly sensitive to RNase I, potentially due to their unusual rRNA sequences and structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hancock et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jordan, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jordan et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pavlakis et al., 1979</xref>). By contrast, we found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> ribosomes tolerate micrococcal nuclease (MNase) over a wide range of concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). In contrast to RNase I, MNase has a strong 3′ A/T bias. This gives rise to a small amount of positional uncertainty with P-site mapping in MNase datasets, and prevents us from achieving the sort of sub-codon resolution seen in ribosome profiling datasets generated with RNase I.</p><p>Nonetheless, replicate experiments established that our measure of translation rate (the <italic>ribosome footprint density,</italic> defined as the number of ribosome-protected fragments per kilobase of coding region per million aligning reads in the dataset; RPKM), is highly reproducible and insensitive to changes in buffer conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>; full data in supplementary table 1 at Dryad: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn et al., 2013</xref>). Focusing on coding regions that had a minimum of 128 reads, we observed strong correlation between replicates (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.998; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and an inter-replicate standard deviation of 1.07-fold, comparable to our protocols in yeast and mammalian cells. Furthermore, our measurements are robust to the number of isoforms per gene, the fraction of sequence-degenerate positions in a gene, gene length, A/T content, and distribution of ribosome density within a gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Development of a ribosome profiling protocol for <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos</title><p>In early (0–2 hr) <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, the vast majority of transcripts are maternally supplied and therefore regulated by post transcriptional processes, such as poly- or deadenylation, capping or de-capping, localization, degradation, and control of translation initiation. The early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo has thus been an important system for the study of post-transcriptional and specifically translational regulation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lasko, 2011</xref>).</p><p>To enable the broad analysis of these processes, we developed a sample harvesting strategy that captures the translational state of early embryos with minimal perturbation. Specifically, we developed a cryolysis protocol in which embryos are collected directly from egg-laying dishes into liquid nitrogen, homogenized while frozen, and thawed in the presence of translation inhibitors to prevent post-lysis translation. Notably, we omit dechorionation and rinsing, steps which could induce cold shock, anoxia, and related translational artifacts.</p><p>We collected replicate samples of 0–2 hr embryos, and subjected them to ribosome profiling and RNA-seq of poly(A)-selected mRNA. A subset of ribosomes partition into heavy polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with reports that a distinct subset of messages is well-translated at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qin et al., 2007</xref>). Ribosome density measurements from replicate embryo collections are correlated nearly as well (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.984; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; supplementary table 1 at Dryad: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn et al., 2013</xref>) as measurements from technical replicates from a single culture of S2 cells (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.998; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

(<bold>C</bold>) Ribosome protection assay. A 320 nucleotide fragment of enolase (FlyBase accession: FBgn0000579) was amplified using oligos oJGD123 &amp; oJGD124 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). A body-labeled probe against this sequence was transcribed from this template using α32P-UTP and the T7 MaxiScript kit (Ambion). S2 cell lysates were prepared as in methods and aliquoted. Aliquots were digested as in methods, except with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 U MNase/μg total RNA. Monosomes were sedimented through a sucrose cushion, resuspended in 600 μl 10 mM Tris pH 7.0, and their RNAs extracted as in ‘Materials and methods’. Concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 5 μg of each sample was hybridized to 50,000 CPM of probe overnight at 42°C. Single-stranded regions were digested with RNase A/T1 and the remaining footprint: probe duplexes detected using the mirVana micro-RNA detection kit (Ambion), resolved on a 15% TBE-urea gel (Invitrogen), and visualized on a Storm phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics by GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). For size markers, we end-labeled the Novex 10 bp dsDNA ladder (Invitrogen) with 32P. Over two-fold range of nuclease concentrations, the ∼30 nt peak corresponding to ribosome-protected footprints remains constant in size and intensity, indicating a lack of degradation consistent with the unchanged monosome peak height across this range of digestion conditions in (<bold>B</bold>). Also visible is a roughly 60 nt band which we infer to be protected by adjacent ribosomes (disomes) that sterically exclude the nuclease. This interpretation is consistent with the presence of a small disome peak in digested samples (c.f. panels <bold>B</bold> and <bold>D</bold>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We then plotted the median value across all normalized coverage vectors at each position. Peaks are visible in the start and stop codons of embryo samples. Consistent with our previous work, stop codon peaks are missing from S2 cell samples because terminating ribosomes release during our 2-min treatment with translation inhibitors.

Second, our measurements of 5′ UTR density are indistinguishable whether we enrich digested monosomes by sedimentation through a sucrose cushion (which collects all heavy particles) or specifically separate them from preinitiation complexes by fractionation of a sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the dominant signal contributing to our measurement of footprint density in 5′ UTRs is derived from fragments protected by 80S ribosomes. Third, because initiation and termination of translation are slow compared to elongation, initiation and termination events produce peaks of ribosome density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>). Such peaks are frequently visible at the boundaries of predicted uORF sequences (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), again arguing that reads aligning to 5′ UTRs represent translation events. Given the known roles of uORFs in regulating both the translation and the stability of mRNAs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meijer and Thomas, 2002</xref>) we anticipate that our methods will facilitate future analyses of the contributions of uORFs to control of gene expression throughout fly development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A subset of genes exhibit stop codon readthrough, resulting in C-terminal protein extensions</title><p>Comparative analysis of the genomes of 12 sequenced <italic>Drosophila</italic> species has provided a powerful strategy for annotating protein-coding regions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2011</xref>). Using this approach, 283 transcripts in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> were demonstrated to contain clear phylogenetic signatures of amino acid conservation in the region between the annotated and next in-frame stop codons. It was therefore concluded that these regions encode C-terminal protein extensions (hereon called ‘predicted extensions’), produced by stop codon readthrough events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jungreis et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In our data, the density of ribosomes on 3′ UTRs is several orders of magnitude lower than in coding regions and 5′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), and many genes show highly efficient termination (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, a subset of transcripts exhibit high footprint density within the predicted extensions. To determine whether the footprint density was consistent with stop codon readthrough (as opposed to alternate explanations, like frameshift), we manually scored each predicted extension whose corresponding structural gene was sufficiently expressed in our embryo sample (158 in total). An extension was scored positively if there existed ribosome density in the extension, ribosome density vanished or unambiguously decreased following the first in-frame stop codon, and positions occupied by ribosomes in the putative extension evenly covered the majority of the extension’s length (see ‘Materials and methods’ for further details). By these criteria, 43 of the 283 transcripts predicted to undergo stop codon readthrough contained ribosome density consistent with a readthrough event (example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, full data in supplementary table 2 at Dryad: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn et al., 2013</xref>), including one example of double readthrough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Footprints in C-terminal extensions exhibit a length distribution very similar to footprints in coding regions, while those derived from non-coding sources, such as snoRNAs and tRNAs, show dramatically different length distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, footprints aligning to extensions appear to be protected by 80S ribosomes.</p><p>Finally, we sought to determine whether the ribosomes that appear to translate extensions are engaged in active translation, as opposed to some aberrant process of stalling or slippage (e.g., as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Skabkin et al., 2013</xref>). Because terminating ribosomes produce a characteristic peak of ribosome density over annotated stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>), we asked whether the stop codons that terminate the C-terminal extensions also showed this behavior. Indeed, C-terminal extensions exhibit peaks at their stop codons, clearly arguing that footprint density in C-terminal extensions is attributable to actively-translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Because this meta-gene analysis represents a group average, we also compiled individual statistics on ribosome release in a manner similar to the RRS score described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guttman et al. (2013)</xref> . Briefly, we tabulated the ratio of the total number of reads aligning within a five codon window immediately downstream of a stop codon to the number of reads aligning to the five codon window immediately upstream of that codon, with the expectation that if ribosomes terminate at a given stop codon, the score for that codon should approach zero. We performed this calculation separately for: (1) stop codons that terminate annotated coding regions, (2) stop codons that terminate C-terminal extensions, and (3) as a negative control, randomly selected codons internal to annotated coding regions. We find that the scores of stop codons that terminate C-terminal extensions fall within the distribution of scores for stop codons that terminate annotated coding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), again arguing that the read density covering putative C-terminal extensions are in fact produced by ribosomes that have undergone stop codon readthrough rather than other processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Readthrough produces detectable translation products</title><p>It is possible that the population of ribosomes that read through stop codons is engaged in a pathological translation process that might not produce detectable protein products. We therefore asked whether we could detect translation products by immunoprecipitation (IP) and western blotting. We created reporter constructs for a panel of transcripts including five predicted and 10 novel extensions that exhibited readthrough in both 0–2 hr embryos and S2 cells. In each construct, we fused Venus (a GFP variant) upstream of a portion of each transcript containing the C-terminal 120 codons of the annotated coding sequence and the entire endogenous 3′ UTR. To visualize readthrough, we fused a double FLAG epitope to the C-terminus of the putative C-terminal extension. We transfected these constructs into S2 cells, immunoprecipitated the reporter at the N-terminus using anti-GFP beads, and detected the extensions by western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. We detected readthrough products of the correct size for eight of the reporters, arguing that at least this subset of extensions yields C-terminally extended proteins in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>While we did not seek to detect C-terminally extended proteins generated by endogenous transcripts (e.g., through mass spectrometry), we do believe our reporter constructs to be at least as faithful as those used in earlier literature, as we included substantially more nucleotide context (120 codons upstream of stop plus the entire endogenous 3′ UTR) than other groups screening through candidate genes to find readthrough signals (2–8 codons upstream and 3–15 codons downstream of the stop codon; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fearon et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Namy et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Extensions are not products of selenocysteine insertion, genomic polymorphisms, or mRNA editing</title><p>The appearance of stop codon readthrough, both in ribosome profiling data and in IP-westerns, could result from several other processes, such as selenocysteine insertion, genomic mutation of stop codons to sense codons, or the editing of stop codons in mRNAs. We consider each of these in turn.</p><p>UGA stop codons may be decoded by specialized translation machinery as the unconventional amino acid selenocysteine if the 3′ UTR contains a selenocysteine insertion (SECIS) element. However, UGA stop codons represent only 25% of the readthrough events we report, and none of these are annotated as selenoproteins in either FlyBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50a">Marygold et al., 2013</xref>) or SelenoDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castellano et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, we were unable to detect SECIS elements in any of their 3′ UTRs using SeciSearch 2.19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kryukov et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, at most, even unannotated selenocysteine insertion events could only account for a small fraction of the readthrough events we report.</p><p>We also exclude the possibility that readthrough might result from genomic polymorphisms or RNA editing at the stop codon. Because both types of events would be represented in our data as mismatches between read alignments and the reference transcript sequence, we counted the total number of matching and mismatching reads covering each nucleotide position in each stop codon in our mRNA-seq and ribosome footprint datasets. For each dataset, we calculated a global average proportion of mismatching reads, and used the binomial test to identify stop codon nucleotides whose individual proportion of mismatches significantly deviated from the corresponding global average.</p><p>Together, the mRNA and footprint datasets identified a total of 10 nucleotide positions whose mismatch rates significantly exceeded the average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Three positions contained genomic polymorphisms that changed one stop codon to another stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>, green). Two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>, red) contained genomic polymorphisms that converted the stop codon to a sense codon. These two transcripts were therefore excluded from further study. The remaining five positions contained a variety of mismatches each occurring at low frequency. These observations are inconsistent with the presence of a genomic polymorphism at those positions, which should cause a 50% or 100% frequency of a single mismatch, depending on whether the polymorphism is hetero- or homozygous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>, black).</p><p>An alternate explanation for a low but elevated proportion of mismatches is RNA editing, the conversion of one nucleotide to another in an mRNA. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the only mechanism known to edit mRNA is the deamination of adenine to inosine, which is converted to guanine by reverse transcriptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ramaswami et al., 2013</xref>). A-to-I editing thus appears in sequencing data as a preference for A-to-G transitions among mismatches. Of the five mismatching positions we could not ascribe to genomic polymorphisms, four contain thymine or guanine rather than adenine residues in the reference sequence, and therefore cannot be edited by this pathway. We therefore attribute these mismatches to sequencing error. The majority of mismatches at the single remaining position are transversions from adenine to thymine, similarly arguing that these mismatches are more likely due to sequencing error than to A-to-I editing.</p><p>Formally, it is possible that a minor fraction of transcripts are edited, but that this fraction, even if small as measured in the RNA-seq or total footprint data, might account for all of the stop codon readthrough we observe. Analysis of the ribosome footprint data allows us to explore this possibility directly. Specifically, were this the case, the sequences of all the footprints deriving from ribosomes that have undergone readthrough—namely, those whose A-sites have already translated the stop codon—should contain evidence of editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, top). We therefore separately analyzed the footprints deriving from this specific pool of ribosomes. Our dataset provided sufficient coverage to test 419 of 450 such positions (93% of the total). Of these, only four stop codon positions exhibited significantly elevated levels of mismatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, bottom). All of these were identified in the mRNA and total footprint datasets above as having genomic polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>). Thus, our most stringent dataset contains no positive evidence of RNA editing.</p><p>Further, this dataset contains positive evidence against RNA editing. Under the null hypothesis that A-to-I editing drives readthrough, one would expect nearly all footprints (for our purposes, conservatively assuming 90%) in the A-site footprint dataset to contain an edited base. Under this assumption, we used a binomial test to estimate the probability of observing the proportion of A-to-G mismatches in the A-site footprint dataset at each adenine residue sufficiently covered by reads (217 positions, representing roughly 50% of A positions in all readthrough events reported). In this analysis, all positions contained significantly fewer A-to-G mismatches than expected under the hypothesis of A-to-I editing, (Bonferonni-corrected p&lt;&lt;0.05 for all transcripts), indicating that A-to-I editing plays no part in any of the readthrough events we could test.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Readthrough occurs in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and human foreskin fibroblasts</title><p>Because we detected far more readthrough events in <italic>Drosophila</italic> than were predicted from phylogenetic data, we collected yeast datasets and examined them for empirical evidence of readthrough.

Therefore, libraries prepared with RNase I (e.g., yeast and mammalian libraries) offer superior spatial resolution along mRNAs. In such libraries, the locations of ribosome-protected footprint fragments in coding regions exhibit a characteristic three-nucleotide periodicity or <italic>phasing</italic> from which reading frames can be deduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2011</xref>). We therefore tabulated the phasing of ribosome-protected footprint fragments in all annotated coding regions, putative C-terminal extensions, and the 40 codon windows downstream of the putative extensions as an approximation of the portion of the 3′ UTR distal to the putative extension (hereafter called ‘distal 3′ UTRs’). To control for cloning biases caused by skewed nucleotide frequencies at each phase, we tabulated the phasing of randomly-fragmented mRNA fragments that were cloned using the same protocol and aligned to the same regions. Non-random phasing consistent with translation is apparent in both the coding regions and the putative extensions, but not the distal 3′ UTR (p=3.98 × 10<sup>−26</sup>, Χ<sup>2</sup> test, footprints vs mRNA fragments in extension, dof = 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Importantly, the major component of phasing in the putative extensions occurs in the same reading frame as that of coding regions, indicating that readthrough (as opposed to, e.g., frameshift) is a major contributor to protected fragment density in 3′ UTRs in yeast.

In the first scenario, readthrough rates for all transcripts should increase or decrease monotonically in one cell or tissue type compared to another. In the latter two scenarios, readthrough rates should increase for some transcripts, but decrease for others. We identified four significant increases and five significant decreases in readthrough rate in embryos compared to S2 cells, indicating that readthrough is at least in part regulated on a transcript-by-transcript basis. The distribution of fold-changes in readthrough rate spans several orders of magnitude, indicating that transcripts that are robustly read through in one cell type are not necessarily read through in another (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This result implies that extensions function in specific cellular or developmental contexts, consistent with earlier reports that readthrough of specific genes is regulated in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson and Cooley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Because we observe such a large magnitude of regulation, we believe the 350 readthrough events we report here to represent a small subset of a larger group that occur throughout the lifetime of an individual fly.

With the exception of the readthrough signal identified in Tobacco mosaic virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Skuzeski et al., 1991</xref>), the majority of readthrough events that have been mechanistically characterized are regulated by two or more such factors, often in complex, context-specific ways. For example, downstream nucleotide contexts which promote readthrough of one stop codon can inhibit readthrough of other stop codons, and these effects can be non-linearly synergistic with upstream nucleotide contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonetti et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Such complexity is advantageous insofar as it allows readthrough rates to be independently regulated for each transcript, consistent with our own observations. Unsurprisingly, however, this complexity has hindered efforts to identify simple <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence elements that deterministically predict readthrough, and underscores the importance of having a method to measure readthrough empirically in a physiological setting in vivo<italic>.</italic> By using ribosome profiling to measure readthrough rates over a variety of tissue types and developmental stages, it may be possible to decompose the regulatory complexity into individual components, and then determine the <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements that collaborate to regulate readthrough in tissue-specific manners.</p><p>Just as alternative splicing provides a means for proteins to acquire new domains or functional modules, we propose, along with the Lindquist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">True and Lindquist, 2000</xref>) and Kellis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jungreis et al., 2011</xref>) groups, that stop codon readthrough can provide a mechanism for proteins to evolve at the C-terminus. In this model, transcripts that contain contexts favorable to leaky termination would yield substoichiometric, C-terminally extended populations of cellular proteins. If a particular extension is deleterious, natural selection can favor mutations in the corresponding mRNA that promote efficient termination rather than readthrough. If, instead, the extension provides a fitness advantage, selection can act upon both its amino acid sequence (to tune its function), as well as the nucleotide sequence of its mRNA (to increase or otherwise regulate its readthrough rate). In extreme cases, where an extension is universally advantageous, a mutation that changes a stop codon to a sense codon might become fixed, resulting in a constitutively extended gene. Conceivably, the two C-terminal extensions that we discovered to contain sense codons in place of their annotated stop codons could be the end result of this process.</p><p>Several lines of evidence are consistent with this evolutionary model. First, non-zero readthrough rates (0.02–1.4%) have been observed even for control non-readthrough reporter constructs in [<italic>psi</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>] yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fearon et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonetti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Namy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keeling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Torabi and Kruglyak, 2011</xref>) and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Firth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Napthine et al., 2012</xref>), arguing that under typical conditions in a variety of eukaryotes, there is a small pool of C-terminally-extended proteins, originating from a wide variety of genes, available for selection to act upon.</p><p>Secondly, in specific circumstances, selection appears to favor leaky termination and its extension products. Torabi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Torabi and Kruglyak, 2011</xref>) reported that in a panel of wild strains of [<italic>psi</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>] yeast, allelic combinations of <italic>SUP45</italic> and <italic>TRM10</italic> that promote and inhibit readthrough appear to be in balancing selection, implying that a low baseline level of readthrough is beneficial. Similarly, numerous reports have demonstrated that wild strains of yeast exhibit [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]-dependent fitness advantages in a variety of stress conditions, arguing that functions conferred by C-terminal extensions can provide adaptive advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">True and Lindquist, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Halfmann et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Thirdly, extensions have a high probability of conferring function without prior tuning by natural selection. This point is illustrated by the studies of Kaiser and Botstein, which demonstrated that a large proportion—roughly 30%—of randomly-generated peptide sequences are functional, insofar as they can relocalize a cytosolic form of invertase to the nucleus, mitochondrion, or endoplasmic reticulum in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaiser et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaiser and Botstein, 1990</xref>). Given the large number of short peptide signals now known (e.g., D-boxes, KEN-boxes, SH3 binding epitopes, phosphorylation sites, etc), it is likely that a far greater fraction of random peptide sequences contain at least one functional signal. Consistent with this hypothesis, we discovered C-terminal extensions that are not phylogenetically conserved nonetheless contained functional NLSes in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> Furthermore, because these short signals are modular, their addition to the C-terminus of a protein can confer novel function, without requiring modification or coevolution of the host protein. In this way, even novel C-terminal extensions arising purely from termination failure can immediately alter the behavior of their host proteins, in beneficial or deleterious ways, and thus come under selection. Over evolutionary time, this process could yield phylogenetically conserved readthrough events or, in extreme cases, constitutively extended proteins.</p><p>Our model predicts that, at any given moment, ribosome profiling should detect a broad spectrum of conservation among readthrough events: at one extreme are ancient, phylogenetically conserved extensions, and, at the other, extensions of recent evolutionary origin. Between these, one would find extensions under varying degrees of age, conservation, and selection. This notion is borne out in our data: in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> a subset of readthrough events are well supported by conservative codon substitutions across the phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jungreis et al., 2011</xref>), but a far larger set is not conserved between species. In aggregate, this non-conserved group shows weak but statistically significant signals of selection among fifty wild-type individuals of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting that a fraction of this group is undergoing protein coding selection. The remainder might include many other different groups of extensions: namely, a group of extensions undergoing diversifying selection, a group of deleterious extensions undergoing counterselection, and a group of selectively-neutral extensions subject to genetic drift.</p><p>Finally, our model predicts that conserved extensions should on average exhibit higher readthrough rates than novel extensions, because only a subset of the latter group would have been selected for function and regulation. Our data is also consistent with this prediction: the median readthrough rate for the conserved extensions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is 5.2%, while the median for the novel extensions is 1.7%. Notably, 62% of the novel extensions we identified in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> 95% of the extensions in human foreskin fibroblasts, and 40% of the extensions in yeast undergo readthrough at rates comparable to those of phylogenetically conserved extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), arguing for the importance of these subsets.</p><p>Broadly, our work builds upon the growing amount of evidence that eukaryotic genomes and proteomes are far more plastic than previously thought, particularly with regard to translation and coding. In addition to the large number C-terminal extensions we report, various groups have used ribosome profiling to determine that large numbers of genes are regulated by uORFs that initiate at near-cognate start codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brar et al., 2012</xref>), that many genes can be N-terminally extended in a regulated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritsch et al., 2012</xref>), and even that many parts of mammalian genomes are decoded in multiple frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Michel et al., 2012</xref>).

Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elife.elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Ribosome profiling reveals pervasive and regulated stop codon readthrough in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Nahum Sonenberg, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The consensus opinion of the reviewers is that this study is a thorough, compelling analysis that describes the development of a ribosome profiling assay for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and provides the first genome-wide experimental analysis of stop codon readthrough. The data support most of your conclusions.</p><p>The important conclusions are that:</p><p>A) Readthrough is more pervasive than expected, and the majority of readthrough events observed were not predicted phylogenetically.</p><p>B) The C-terminal protein extensions show evidence of selection, contain functional subcellular localization signals, and their readthrough is regulated, arguing for their importance.</p><p>C) The readthrough might regulate gene expression and protein function, and to add plasticity to the proteome during evolution.</p><p>However, the reviewers raised several concerns and questions as described below.</p><p>1) You note that the locations of ribosome-protected footprint fragments from yeast and human ribosome profiling datasets exhibit 3-nucleotide periodicity from which reading frames can be deduced. Does the fly data provide enough resolution to also show such periodicity? If not, why?</p><p>2) The reviewers agree that you need to indicate more clearly the mean level of readthrough you observe with the predicted and novel extensions. You could have discussed this in a couple of places, but you didn't seize upon those opportunities. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> appears to show that the mean readthrough rates observed range from 1-3%. However, only a couple of rather cryptic references that addressed this point are in the text. In the Results section you state that the human, yeast and fly samples cover similar ranges of efficiency. In the Discussion, you state that the readthrough rates range beyond 10%, while the baseline readthrough is much lower (0.0-1.4%). You need to address the mean level of readthrough more directly in the text since the level of readthrough you observe directly relates to your functional significance arguments in the Discussion. Have you tried to show that one of the newly discovered endogenous proteins has a longer isoform than the predicted size encoded by its corresponding coding region? If not, this needs to be noted.</p><p>3) Recent studies have shown that dedicated recycling factors (Rli1 in yeast and ABCE1 in mammals) are required for efficient ribosome release following translation termination. A key concern related to your predicted and novel extensions is whether the ribosomes distal to the stop codon represent translating ribosomes, or simply ribosomes that may not have properly released from the mRNA following termination at the stop codon. In a recent Cell paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guttman et al, 2013</xref>), a parameter called the Ribosome Release Score (RRS) was used to discriminate between translated protein-coding regions and non-coding transcripts with similar ribosome densities. Could you apply that parameter to the stop codons of the predicted and novel extensions to provide further confidence that you truly represent translated extensions, rather than 3´-UTRs that simply don't release ribosomes? The Guttman paper should be cited.</p><p>4) Discussion: You state that readthrough is pervasive, biologically regulated, and functionally consequential, and thus provides an important mechanism to regulate gene expression and function. In light of my concern about the level of readthrough you are generally observing (1-3%), the reviewers think this is somewhat overstating your results. Until you have eliminated one or more of these C-terminal extensions and shown that it results in an adverse phenotype, you cannot say that these extensions are “functionally consequential”.</p><p>5) The evolutionary analysis presented near the end of the paper is problematic.</p><p>You partitioned the observed examples of readthrough into those that had been predicted by Lin et al. to have signatures of coding conservation (predicted readthrough) and those that didn't (novel readthrough). Then you use three pieces of data to argue that the novel readthroughs are under purifying selection to maintain their coding capacity, and that they are of recent evolutionary origin.</p><p>First, you used PhyloCSF to score the novel readthrough, finding that few score positively and that you have the same distribution of scores as non read-through 3'UTRs. You posit that there are only two possible explanations for this - that the novel readthrough are selectively neutral, or that you are of too recent origin to leave a detectable phylogenetic signature. But it is also possible that you have a signature, but it is simply too weak to detect with the model used by PhyloCSF. We come back to this point below.</p><p>Next, you compared predicted and novel readthrough, UTRs from non read-through genes, and coding sequence using an algorithm that separates coding and non-coding sequence using nucleotide frequencies, finding that novel readthrough were somewhere in between coding and predicted readthrough on the one hand and non-coding sequence on the other.

Does the fly data provide enough resolution to also show such periodicity? If not, why</italic>?</p><p>The fly data do not provide sufficient resolution to show periodicity. Because our standard nuclease, RNase I, destroys <italic>Drosophila</italic> ribosomes, we prepared the fly libraries with micrococcal nuclease (MNase), which <italic>Drosophila</italic> ribosomes tolerate well over a wide range of concentrations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). While RNase I is an unbiased enzyme, MNase has a strong 3' A/T bias. As a result, MNase-digested footprints are longer than RNase-digested footprints, and not always fully resolved to the edges of ribosomes. This fact gives rise to a small amount of positional uncertainty with P-site mapping in MNase datasets. We handle this uncertainty in our P-site assignment strategy by assigning a fraction of the P-site over a neighborhood of adjacent nucleotides determined by the length and endpoints of each read alignment as detailed in the methods section of our manuscript and as previously performed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oh et al., 2011</xref>. We had already included a discussion of mapping in the Materials and methods (section “Sequence processing and alignment”), but have now included an explicit discussion of why periodicity is not visible on fly data in two places in our main text.</p><p><italic>2) The reviewers agree that you need to indicate more clearly the mean level of readthrough you observe with the predicted and novel extensions. You could have discussed this in a couple of places, but you didn't seize upon those opportunities. For example,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5F</italic></xref> <italic>appears to show that the mean readthrough rates observed range from 1-3%. However, only a couple of rather cryptic references that addressed this point are in the text. In the Results section you state that the human, yeast and fly samples cover similar ranges of efficiency. In the Discussion, you state that the readthrough rates range beyond 10%, while the baseline readthrough is much lower (0.0-1.4%). You need to address the mean level of readthrough more directly in the text since the level of readthrough you observe directly relates to your functional significance arguments in the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>We have added specific references to median levels of readthrough observed in the text. To set a threshold for biological significance, we now discuss readthrough rates in comparison to the distribution we observe for the phylogenetically conserved extensions in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. The rationale is as follows: because the phylogenetically conserved readthrough events are likely to be conserved because they are functional, and because only a specific fraction of these extensions have observable amounts of readthrough in our samples, we infer that this specific group, when translated, is translated at a rate that is biologically functional. We therefore re-framed our text to explicitly compare readthrough rates of various extensions against this phylogenetically conserved group of extensions in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster.</italic> We note this first when discussing readthrough in yeast and humans:</p><p>“To estimate how many of the novel extensions we detected might be translated at a biologically significant level…”</p><p>And we explicitly state the median readthrough rates we observe in our Discussion:</p><p>“Finally, our model predicts that conserved extensions should on average exhibit higher readthrough rates than novel extensions…”</p><p><italic>Have you tried to show that one of the newly discovered endogenous proteins has a longer isoform than the predicted size encoded by its corresponding coding region? If not, this needs to be noted</italic>.</p><p>We have amended the text to indicate that we did not seek to detect endogenous proteins. The readthrough reporters we designed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> contain 120 codons upstream of the annotated stop codon, and the entire endogenous 3' UTR, the latter modified only to include a double FLAG epitope upstream of the extension's termination codon. Because we included so large a region of the endogenous mRNA in our constructs, we believe that they report readthrough at least as faithfully as those traditionally used in the literature to screen readthrough contexts, which include much less endogenous sequence (as few as 2–8 codons upstream and 3-15 codons downstream of the stop; Fearon et al<italic>.</italic>, 1994; Feng et al<italic>.</italic>, 1992; Harrell et al<italic>.</italic>, 2002; Namy et al<italic>.</italic>, 2002; Namy et al<italic>.</italic>, 2003), with the exception of a number of excellent papers that deduce the minimal requirements for readthrough in specific virus or host transcripts (Cimino et al<italic>.</italic>, 2011; Firth et al<italic>.</italic>, 2011; Napthine et al<italic>.</italic>, 2012; Skuzeski et al<italic>.</italic>, 1991; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steneberg &amp; Samakovlis, 2001</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Recent studies have shown that dedicated recycling factors (Rli1 in yeast and ABCE1 in mammals) are required for efficient ribosome release following translation termination. A key concern related to your predicted and novel extensions is whether the ribosomes distal to the stop codon represent translating ribosomes, or simply ribosomes that may not have properly released from the mRNA following termination at the stop codon. In a recent Cell paper (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23"><italic>Guttman et al, 2013</italic></xref><italic>), a parameter called the Ribosome Release Score (RRS) was used to discriminate between translated protein-coding regions and non-coding transcripts with similar ribosome densities. Could you apply that parameter to the stop codons of the predicted and novel extensions to provide further confidence that you truly represent translated extensions, rather than 3´-UTRs that simply don't release ribosomes? The Guttman paper should be cited</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this is an important point. However, it is important to note that RRS score as developed and validated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guttman et al., 2013</xref> is not applicable for this specific purpose. The authors state explicitly that RRS is best suited to classify a transcript as containing or lacking a single, predominant long open reading frame, not to choose which stop codon in that transcript is utilized:</p><p>“RRS is not designed to identify specific translated regions within a transcript containing multiple overlapping or nearby translated regions” (Guttman et al<italic>.</italic>, 2013).</p><p>Therefore, in our manuscript we sought to control for this possibility in two other ways.</p><p>First, we required a 75% or greater decrease in ribosome density following the first in-frame stop codon as a preliminary filtering criterion before a given C-terminal extension was even examined for readthrough (see Materials and methods section “Identification of C-terminal protein extensions” subsection “Identification of novel extensions”).</p><p>Second, we demonstrated in a metagene analysis that ribosome footprint density covering the stop codons that terminate C-terminal extensions extensions is qualitatively similar to the density covering stop codons of annotated coding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In this analysis, clear termination peaks are visible over stop codons in both metagene averages, and, in each average, the normalized ribosome footprint density drops to negligible levels after the stop codon in question. Thus, the fact that ribosomes occupying the extensions show characteristic behaviors of termination (spikes at the stop codon, followed by a drop in density) at the C-termini of the extensions strongly argues that those ribosomes are engaged in active translation of extensions, rather than just sliding.</p><p>Nonetheless, we have included in this revised manuscript an additional analysis of ribosome release similar to the RRS score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). Briefly, we tabulate the ratio of reads in a 5-codon window downstream of a given stop codon to the number of reads in a 5-codon window upstream of that stop codon. This criterion differs from the various ways RRS was calculated in Guttman et al. principally in that RRS is additionally normalized for mRNA fragment density to control for transcript mis-annotation (Guttman et al<italic>.</italic>, 2013), something we did not consider in our study as we manually verified the structures of all transcripts for which we report readthrough.</p><p>We perform this RRS-like calculation on the following classes of codons: 1) stop codons that terminate annotated coding regions, 2) stop codons that terminate C-terminal extensions, and 3) randomly-selected codons internal to annotated coding regions. We find that the release scores for C-terminal extensions fall well within the distribution for those of annotated coding regions, which again supports the notion that the ribosome footprint density covering extensions represents bona fide translation events, followed by termination at the expected stop codon. In addition, we have cited both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guttman et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Skabkin et al., 2013</xref> and expanded our discussion of ribosome release to improve clarity of this issue:</p><p><italic>4) Discussion: You state that readthrough is pervasive, biologically regulated, and functionally consequential, and thus provides an important mechanism to regulate gene expression and function. In light of my concern about the level of readthrough you are generally observing (1-3%), the reviewers think this is somewhat overstating your results. Until you have eliminated one or more of these C-terminal extensions and shown that it results in an adverse phenotype, you cannot say that these extensions are “functionally consequential”</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate this objection and have changed our language accordingly. The sentence now reads:</p><p>“Our studies indicate that readthrough is far more pervasive than previously appreciated, is biologically regulated, and may append functional peptide signals to host proteins.”</p><p>Nonetheless, it is worth noting that finding a phenotype for a given protein is difficult. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene <italic>kelch,</italic> the first gene discovered to undergo readthrough in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> provides a good example. <italic>kelch</italic> is essential for female fertility, and has an extension notable for both its conservation (PhyloCSF score 7784, conserved throughout the sequenced <italic>Drosophila</italic> phylogeny) and length (787 amino acids). However, Robinson and colleagues found that expression of specifically the short form, but not of the long form, complemented the fertility defect observed in the null mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson &amp; Cooley, 1997</xref>). Nonetheless, given its conservation and length, it is hard to imagine that this extension is not functional. Robinson and colleagues therefore proposed that the long form of <italic>kelch</italic> may be more important in other tissues (e.g., the imaginal discs, where the long form is specifically up-regulated relative to the short form), but they did not create the conditional mutants necessary to test this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson &amp; Cooley, 1997</xref>).</p><p>That said, we are very interested in investigating the functions of specific extensions, and will probably start this work in yeast, which offers sophisticated genetic tools, a simpler life history, and several C-terminal extensions in essential genes that might yield interesting phenotypes. We hope this will provide fertile ground for future studies.</p><p><italic>5) The evolutionary analysis presented near the end of the paper is problematic</italic>.</p><p>We recognize these concerns and have adjusted our language in the text to highlight alternate interpretations of the data per the reviewers' concerns (discussed further below). In this revised manuscript we try to make clear the evolutionary model we present is a more speculative part of the discussion. As with any evolutionary question, multiple explanations may account for our observations. We present in the revised text what we believe to be a reasonable and plausible explanation. Importantly, we do not wish to overstate our results or to give false impressions of certainty. Rather, we hope our work will provide a point of entry into further investigations on the origins and functions of C-terminal extensions.</p><p><italic>You partitioned the observed examples of readthrough into those that had been predicted by Lin et al. to have signatures of coding conservation (predicted readthrough) and those that didn't (novel readthrough). Then you use three pieces of data to argue that the novel readthroughs are under purifying selection to maintain their coding capacity, and that they are of recent evolutionary origin</italic>.</p><p><italic>First, you used PhyloCSF to score the novel readthrough, finding that few score positively and that you have the same distribution of scores as non read-through 3'UTRs. You posit that there are only two possible explanations for this – that the novel readthrough are selectively neutral, or that you are of too recent origin to leave a detectable phylogenetic signature. But it is also possible that you have a signature, but it is simply too weak to detect with the model used by PhyloCSF. We come back to this point below</italic>.</p><p>We regret that our manuscript was unclear on an important point: our goal was to evaluate — regardless of evolutionary age — whether any of the novel readthrough events we identified occur because they are biologically important or, alternatively, simply because they can occur without incurring a significant fitness disadvantage (i.e., are selectively neutral or nearly neutral). The first way we approached this question was to look for evidence of selection, the presence or absence of which would favor one hypothesis over the other.</p><p>We did interpret the novel extensions we identified to be, on average, evolutionarily recent in origin because of their negative PhyloCSF scores. In so doing, we made two assumptions. First, we assumed that PhyloCSF's model for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> phylogeny should be sensitive to detect conservation among most, even if not all, conserved coding regions. Secondly, we assumed that protein-coding selection, if present, should yield similar signatures in the amino acid sequences of known coding regions and of putative C-terminal extensions (i.e., conservation, if present, should favor synonymous amino acid substitutions over non-synonymous changes, and the primary amino acid sequence should be important).</p><p>This first assumption is consistent with performance benchmarks of PhyloCSF, which demonstrate that it detects signatures of protein coding conservation 93% of known <italic>Drosophila</italic> coding regions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Lin et al<italic>.</italic>, 2011). Even when restricted to short (10–60 codon) regions, which are notably difficult to evaluate (Lin et al., 2008), PhyloCSF still achieves greater than 90% sensitivity, with roughly 98% specificity (Lin et al<italic>.</italic>, 2011). Given that the novel extensions we report largely fall within this size range (median: 16 codons; 76% 10 codons or longer), we think that a signal of conservation, if present, should be detectable by PhyloCSF with comparable sensitivity (provided our second assumption, that extensions should be have similarly in their conservation properties to known coding regions, is also reasonable; further discussed below). Therefore, while some conserved signals may score negatively purely by chance, the majority of conserved signals should score positively.</p><p>In the specific case that selection is present but sufficiently weak to be undetectable, we would expect PhyloCSF scores to approach zero. This expectation arises from the fact that the PhyloCSF score is actually a likelihood ratio, calculated as the log ratio of probabilities of observing a given set of triplet substitutions under a coding model of evolution versus a non-coding model of evolution. Therefore, positive scores indicate a higher probability of observing a given set of substitutions if the ancestral sequence were coding, while a negative score actually indicates a greater likelihood of observing those substitutions under a non-coding model. In other words, a negative score actually provides evidence in favor of a non-coding model rather than indicate the absence of evidence for a protein-coding model. Simultaneous absence of evidence of both models would a ratio of probabilities close to 1.0 and a log-ratio of 0. Instead, we find a median PhyloCSF score for the novel extensions to be -159.8 decibans, indicating that, on average, a non-coding model fits these extensions far better (10<sup>16</sup>-fold) than a coding model. Despite this fact, in our manuscript, we deliberately use more conservative language and merely note a “lack of phylogenetic evidence for amino acid conservation,” rather than “evidence against conservation of protein coding.”</p><p>Our second assumption is that phylogenetic conservation should exhibit the same signals for C-terminal protein extensions as for classical protein-coding regions. We think this assumption to be reasonable because a large group of extensions — 283 proposed by Jungreis et al., 43 confirmed by us — conform to this behavior, and because, to our knowledge, the circumstances in which conservation does not yield such phylogenetic signatures are few.</p><p>However, such circumstances do exist. The prion-forming domains of fungi, in which prion forming ability can be maintained even if primary amino acid sequence is scrambled, provide an example (Ross et al<italic>.</italic>, 2005). It is possible that some of the extensions we have identified fall into a similar category, but we believe this number not to be large, as there are few known protein domains that behave similarly to the fungal prion-forming domains in this particular regard.</p><p>Another circumstance in which an ancient extension might score negatively by PhyloCSF is one in which the act of reading through a stop codon is ancient and phylogenetically conserved, but the amino acid sequence of the resulting extension unimportant, relatively unconstrained, and evolving. This scenario is similar to, but less constrained than, the case of the prion-forming domains in fungi, but supposes that either the act of readthrough or signals that incidentally promote readthrough, rather than readthrough products, are what has been selected. This circumstance provides a specific explanation for why an extension might be unselected (and appear to be selectively neutral or nearly-neutral, a model we already account for), rather than another model to explain the data.</p><p>Notably, in this scenario, if an evolutionarily unconstrained extension acquires a biological function that is subsequently selected and fixed, the extension and its function may be reasonably interpreted to be evolutionarily novel even if the act of readthrough at the upstream stop codon is ancient, because the extension's primary amino acid sequence and the function it yields are in fact evolutionarily novel. This circumstance is in fact a special case of the evolutionary model we propose in our Discussion, in which there is simply a long time lag between selection upon the extension and the appearance of a readthrough event.</p><p><italic>Next, you compared predicted and novel readthrough, UTRs from non read-through genes, and coding sequence using an algorithm that separates coding and non-coding sequence using nucleotide frequencies, finding that novel readthrough were somewhere in between coding and predicted readthrough on the one hand and non-coding sequence on the other. You note that this is consistent with an “evolutionary trajectory” from non-coding to coding. However, it is also consistent with sequences that simply have weak coding propensity</italic>.</p><p>These interpretations are mutually consistent. Under the Z-curve model, a weak coding propensity corresponds to a Z-curve score that is intermediate between the CDS-like and 3'UTR-like distributions. Our goal is to evaluate explanations for why these sequences, as a group, would show such a distribution of weak coding propensities. One explanation is the evolutionary trajectory we describe in our manuscript. Another plausible explanation would be the inverse trajectory, from a CDS-like nucleotide character to a 3'UTR-like nucleotide character. This situation would be expected to occur if the novel extensions we identified by ribosome profiling were caused by recent acquisition of a stop codon somewhere in the <italic>melanogaster</italic> lineage, followed by degradation of the formerly-coding sequence downstream of that stop. However, in this case, these extensions would be expected to: a) on average score positively by PhyloCSF (because they would be conserved in other, more ancient lineages), and b) lack upstream stop codons in species other than <italic>melanogaster.</italic> They do not. We therefore do not favor this model.</p><p>A third model, that the novel extensions as a group show a weak coding propensity by chance, is rejected by the Mann-Whitney U test, which demonstrates that the distribution of Z-curve scores is sufficiently different from that of distal 3' UTRs not to occur by chance (<italic>p</italic> = 1.02 × 10<sup>-23</sup>, Mann-Whitney U test, distal 3' UTR vs novel extensions).</p><p><italic>Finally, you look at</italic> D. melanogaster <italic>SNPs to evaluate whether there is a preference for synonymous relative to non-synonymous SNPs in novel vs predicted read-through, finding that there is a weak preference for synonymous SNPs, less than found in predicted SNPs, and say this is consistent with “mild or recently-imposed selection”. This might not be correct. If you have two read-through events – one which evolved at the base of the genus</italic> Drosophila<italic>, and one along the lineage that separates</italic> D. melanogaster <italic>from</italic> D. simulans<italic>/</italic>D. sechellia <italic>– and posit that these read-through events are under identical selective pressure, then you would expect both to have identical preference for synonymous substitutions, regardless of when you evolved. There is good reason to assume that recently evolved sequences would be under any different strength of selection. If this novel hypothesis were correct, you would probably expect some, if not most, of the novel events to be polymorphic within the population, with some of these in the middle of selective sweeps. But, this would produce a different synonymous vs non-synonymous pattern (with an excess of non-synonymous SNPs perhaps)</italic>.</p><p><italic>It is odd to argue that the majority of read-through events are novel and under selection – something that you'd only expect to find if readthrough events had very short evolutionary half-lives or if there were some reason to have specifically evolved functional read-through events in</italic> D. melanogaster.</p><p>We regret that the language in our manuscript appears to have been unclear on another critical point: we did not intend to imply that the majority of extensions are both evolutionarily novel and under purifying selection, as this would yield the surprising and unlikely conclusions noted by the reviewers. Rather, we intended to state: 1) that the majority of extensions are not phylogenetically conserved as measured by PhyloCSF, and 2) that a subset of this group includes evolutionarily recent extensions that are under selection for protein coding.</p><p>The non-conserved set of extensions also includes other subsets, for example: 1) selectively neutral extensions subject to genetic drift, 2) novel extensions undergoing diversifying selection, and 3) deleterious extensions presumably not undergoing fixation and occurring only in a small subset of the population. The weak preference for synonymous SNPs among the novel extensions can be explained by the fact that this group is a heterogeneous mix of these various subsets, which themselves are subject to different magnitudes and directions of selective pressure. However, there need only be a subset of extensions undergoing purifying selection in order to make the preference deviate from the background level observed in distal 3' UTRs as we observed in our data. Granted, in order to be consistent with our observations, the effect yielded by this subset must exceed the contribution from the set of extensions undergoing diversifying selection. We have adjusted the language in our manuscript accordingly.</p><p>In addition, we have adjusted our Discussion section, to highlight our interpretation that only a subset of novel extensions are under protein-coding selection.</p><p><italic>The data are equally, if not more, consistent with the novel readthrough being subject to weak selection, with their origins unknown. One simple way to resolve this might be to run the Z-score program on orthologous UTRs of read-through and non-read-through genes across the genus. If these are novel to</italic> D. melanogaster<italic>, their scores should be significantly higher in</italic> D. melanogaster.</p><p>We are indeed interested in more precisely determining the phylogenetic ages of the extensions we report. We believe this will be possible as more insect species are sequenced and incorporated into the insect phylogeny, and as more individuals of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> are sequenced and their phylogenetic relationships modeled.</p><p>At present, it is present possible to set loose bounds on the evolutionary ages of the phylogenetically conserved extensions by running PhyloCSF on phylogenetic subtrees on the sequenced <italic>Drosophila</italic> phylogeny, with the expectation that PhyloCSF scores for a given extension should increase as those lineages that lack the extension are pruned from the tree. However, it is not possible to perform such an analysis on novel extensions that came under selection within <italic>melanogaster,</italic> as these will not be conserved between species and therefore will not be measurable by cross-species tools such as PhyloCSF.</p><p>Unfortunately, a cross-species Z-curve analysis is also unlikely to answer this question, because: 1) Z-curve scores, evaluated for different species on the classifier trained specifically for <italic>melanogaster,</italic> would be differentially affected species-wise by species-specific nucleotide composition biases and 2) Z-curve scores for different species evaluated on different classifiers trained individually on each species will not be directly comparable, as Z-curve scores — like neural network scores or SVM scores — lack well-defined theoretical interpretations outside the score distribution of elements scored by the same classifier.</p><p>The best way to approach this would be to develop a PhyloCSF-like tool that would work on single-species population genetic data. Unfortunately, such a tool has not yet been published. While we are interested in this analysis for future work, we believe that estimating the precise evolutionary origin of each extension is beyond the purview of this specific manuscript.</p><p>Nonetheless, we do believe that, for the sake of the evolutionary model we have presented here, it is sufficient to demonstrate that a subset of the C-terminal extensions we have identified by ribosome profiling are evolutionarily novel and/or unique to <italic>melanogaster,</italic> even if their precise dates of origin are not defined. For the reasons outlined above (and in our manuscript), we continue to believe this interpretation to be the most plausible and consistent with our observations, and we hope the aforementioned changes to the manuscript are in the reviewers' opinions sufficient.</p></body></sub-article></article>
