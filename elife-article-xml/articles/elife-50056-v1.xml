Because of the species specificity of HPVs, study of their natural transmission in laboratory animals is not possible. The papillomavirus, MmuPV1, which infects laboratory mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), can cause infections in the female cervicovaginal epithelium of immunocompetent mice that progress to cancer. Here, we provide evidence that MmuPV1 is sexually transmitted in unmanipulated, immunocompetent male and female mice. Female 'donor' mice experimentally infected with MmuPV1 in their lower reproductive tract were housed with unmanipulated male mice. The male mice were then transferred to cages holding 'recipient' female mice. One third of the female recipient mice acquired cervicovaginal infections. Prolonged infections were verified by histopathology and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analyses of both male and recipient female mice at the study endpoint. These findings indicate that MmuPV1 is a new model animal papillomavirus with which to study sexually transmission of papillomaviruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50056.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human papillomaviruses are responsible for about 5% of all cancers: infections with high-risk strains of the virus lead to the vast majority of cervical cancers, other cancers of the anus and genital area, as well as a growing fraction of head and neck cancers. In humans, these viruses are transmitted through sexual contact.</p><p>Other animals do not get infected by human papillomaviruses, and this makes it difficult to study in the laboratory how these viruses pass from one individual to another. However, a mouse papillomavirus has recently been identified: known as MmuPV1, it also causes cervical cancer in rodents, but it was unknown whether it was transmitted sexually.</p><p>To investigate this question, Spurgeon and Lambert experimentally infected female mice with MmuPV1 and allowed them to have intercourse with healthy males. When the males then were mated to healthy females, approximately a third of these female mice became infected with MmuPV1. Males that transmitted the virus were also found to have penile infections. These results show that, like the human papillomavirus, MmuPV1 spreads through sexual interactions.</p><p>Knowledge gathered by studying MmuPV1 could help to understand sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses that cause cancer. Additional work could look into how the virus leads to cancer and investigate the viral and host factors that contribute to sexual transmission. Further studies may also focus on testing drugs that prevent transmission or eliminate the persistent infections that can lead to cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>papillomavirus</kwd><kwd>virus infection</kwd><kwd>sexual transmission</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>Mus musculus</italic></kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA022443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambert</surname><given-names>Paul F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA210807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambert</surname><given-names>Paul F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA211246</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spurgeon</surname><given-names>Megan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA014520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambert</surname><given-names>Paul F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MmuPV1, a papillomavirus that infects laboratory mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), is discovered to be sexually transmitted, providing a new animal virus model to study sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses (HPVs).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Satterwhite et al., 2013</xref>), and oncogenic high-risk HPVs alone account for approximately 5% of cancers worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">zur Hausen, 2009</xref>). Despite the significant public health burden caused by these small DNA tumor viruses, research on papillomavirus sexual transmission has been severely limited due to the paucity of small animal preclinical models resulting from strict virus species-specific tropism. Mucosal tissues of the female reproductive tracts of rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Harvey et al., 1998</xref>), multimammate rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nafz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nafz et al., 2008</xref>), and rhesus macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wood et al., 2007</xref>) are susceptible to rabbit oral papillomavirus (ROPV), mastomys coucha papillomavirus 2 (McPv2), and rhesus macaques papillomavirus (RhPV), respectively. However, natural transmission of a papillomavirus through sexual contact has only been reported in rhesus macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ostrow et al., 1990</xref>). Unfortunately, cost and lack of suitable molecular biology tools and reagents for these models have generally deterred their broad scale use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Christensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Uberoi and Lambert, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The recent discovery of a murine papillomavirus (MmuPV1 or MusPV1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ingle et al., 2011</xref>) alleviates many of these limitations, allowing the study of papillomavirus infection and disease in laboratory mice, which are tractable, genetically modifiable, and relatively affordable. MmuPV1 infects and causes disease at both cutaneous and mucosal sites of several common strains of laboratory mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Uberoi and Lambert, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cladel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cladel et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cladel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Handisurya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Handisurya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Joh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sundberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).

The severity of disease is exacerbated by treatment with estrogen (E2) alone or in combination with ultraviolet B radiation (UVB), which induces prolonged systemic immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Uberoi et al., 2016</xref>), leading to precancerous lesions and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Here, we describe application of our MmuPV1 infection cervicovaginal model to study MmuPV1 sexual transmission. We report natural papillomavirus sexual transmission in immunocompetent, unmanipulated male and female mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rationale and experimental design for MmuPV1 sexual transmission studies</title><p>By 4 months following experimental infection with MmuPV1 in their lower reproductive tract and treatment with E2 and UVB, immunocompetent <italic>FVB/N</italic> female mice develop high-grade precancerous cervicovaginal lesions and SCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Spurgeon et al., 2019</xref>). These lesions were associated with highly productive MmuPV1 infections throughout the cervicovaginal epithelia, as evidenced by strongly positive immunohistochemical staining for the major viral capsid protein L1 within the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Spurgeon et al., 2019</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This observation prompted us to test whether MmuPV1 can be sexually transmitted. Cohorts of female mice (referred to as âDonorsâ) that were either mock-infected or experimentally infected with MmuPV1+UV+E2 were held for 4 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The female Donors were then used to establish monogamous breeding pairs with uninfected male mice (referred to as âmale Breedersâ) and breeding allowed for at least 3 weeks. Male Breeders were then transferred into a cage with an uninfected female mouse (referred to as a âRecipientâ) for at least 3 weeks. While the female Donors were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) and nonoxynol-9 to potentiate MmuPV1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Spurgeon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Roberts et al., 2007</xref>), it is important to emphasize that none of the male Breeders were experimentally manipulated prior to or during matings and the female Recipients were not experimentally manipulated unless indicated below. We performed four separate transmission experiments summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> using various conditions. In Experiments 1 and 2, breeding occurred for 3 weeks with both the Donor and Recipient, and Recipient female mice were treated with E2 for 2 months starting at 8 weeks post-breeding. In Experiment 3, a fraction of Recipients (nÂ =Â 4) were pretreated with Depo-provera 5 days prior to breeding, and in Experiment 4, male Breeders remained with Donors and Recipients for 8 weeks each instead of 3 weeks. For Experiment 4, the Donors from Experiment 3 were used as the source of MmuPV1. All experiments were conducted with wild-type <italic>FVB/N</italic> mice, totaling 9 mock-infected and 22 MmuPV1 Donor-positive breeding pairs. Prior to housing with male Breeders, we first assessed whether the female Donors harbored infections in their reproductive tracts by performing cervicovaginal lavage (CVL). DNA recovered from the CVLs were subjected to PCR to detect MmuPV1 DNA and the host gene, p53, as a positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). All female Donors were found to have MmuPV1 infections based upon the CVL/PCR tests. This confirmed our previously published results that MmuPV1+UV+E2-infected mice efficiently establish infections that persist for at least 4 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Spurgeon et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed the infections of these female Donors persisted for up to 10 months post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50056.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rationale and experimental design for MmuPV1 sexual transmission studies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A full-slide scan of a representative H and E-stained female reproductive tract from a Donor infected for 4 months with MmuPV1+UV+E2 with anatomical regions labeled.

Of the 7 Recipient females that acquired MmuPV1 infections in their reproductive tract, 6 became pregnant during the course of being housed with the male breeders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The single Recipient female that did not become pregnant had been pre-treated with the contraceptive Depo-Provera (Mouse #16 in Experiment 3*). Pregnancy in the Donor females was less penetrant with 4 out of the 7 Donor female mice initially housed with these same male Breeders having become pregnant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This lower penetrance likely reflects that the Donor Females were originally experimentally infected with MmuPV1 using a protocol that involves treatment with Depo-Provera, which can prevent estrus cycling for an extended period of time. We were interested in learning whether pups born to infected mums would acquire MmuPV1 infections. While our analysis was not exhaustive, we did not find evidence for MmuPV1 infections in the skin of several offspring of MmuPV1-positive Donor Females that we screened for E4 mRNA using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization.</p><p>To confirm that the MmuPV1-positive PCR results from the CVLs reflect persistent infections of the cervical/vaginal epithelium, we performed endpoint histopathological and MmuPV1-specific <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (RNAscope) analyses on the reproductive tract of a female Recipient mouse (Recipient #3), which was MmuPV1-positive at the endpoint by CVL/PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>). RNAscope used probes to detect viral transcripts containing the E4 region because that region is present in most early and late transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Xue et al., 2017</xref>). Several discrete regions of epithelia were positive for MmuPV1 viral transcripts. These regions correlated with histopathological signs of MmuPV1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Spurgeon et al., 2019</xref>), including disorganization of the stratified epithelium, areas of hyperkeratinization, karyomegaly, perinuclear halos similar to koilocytes, and condensed chromatin. We also observed evidence for a productive viral infection as indicated by cells staining positively for the viral capsid protein L1 by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), albeit at levels of detection that are much lower than that afforded by RNAscope-based detection of viral transcripts. The infected regions of epithelia were pathologically scored as having low-grade or mild dysplasia. This particular mouse was MmuPV1-positive by 6 weeks post-breeding, and treated for 2 months with estrogen starting at 8 weeks post-breeding. Our previous results indicate that neoplastic disease worsens in MmuPV1 and MmuPV1+E2-infected mice upon extended duration (4 or 6 months) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Spurgeon et al., 2019</xref>). It is therefore possible that MmuPV1-infected female Recipients may develop moderate to high-grade disease or even SCC if the infection is allowed to proceed for a longer period of time. We analyzed the reproductive tracts of additional Recipient female mice that were positive for MmuPV1 by CVL/PCR at the endpoint and found them to have sites of infections based upon MmuPV1 E4-specific <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (data not shown). These results confirm that sexual transmission of MmuPV1 can lead to persistent infections in the absence of genetic or environmental manipulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Male Breeders harbor infections in their reproductive organs</title><p>Because many female Recipient mice contracted MmuPV1 infections of their reproductive organs after being housed with male Breeders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we evaluated the reproductive organs of the male Breeders for the presence of MmuPV1. Attempts to detect the MmuPV1 by lavage of the male genitalia were not successful (insufficient DNA was retrieved based upon an inability to detect mouse p53 DNA by PCR; data not shown). Therefore we resorted to <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analysis of male reproductive organs obtained at the time of euthanasia. We identified several male Breeders with MmuPV1-positive foci of infection by RNAscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). All foci of infections were detected in epithelia of the penis, including the glans epithelium, mump ridge groove, and prepuce (foreskin)/preputial space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Phillips et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rodriguez et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Notably, many of these sites are anatomical locations infected by HPV in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Giuliano et al., 2007</xref>). We also observed evidence for productive viral infections in the penis using L1 immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar to our observation in the MmuPV1-positive Recipient females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), L1 was detected albeit atÂ aÂ lower levelÂ than that observed for E4 transcripts, which uses the sensitive RNAscope technology. Two of the male Breeders (Male #3 and Male #5) that had detectable MmuPV1 infections on their penis by the endpoint RNAscope analysis were associated with MmuPV1-positive female Recipients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The other two males that had detectable MmuPV1 infections on their penis did not appear to have transmitted MmuPV1 to Recipient females, based upon CVL/PCR. It remains possible that they did transmit, but the infections in the female Recipients were transient in nature and not caught by the intermittent CVL/PCR tests. Other males that were negative for MmuPV1-infections based upon endpoint RNAscope analysis did transmit MmuPV1 to female Recipients, suggesting they either had transient infections or else their foci of persistent infections were missed by the RNAscope analysis, which is very possible as only one section per male mouse was subjected to <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. Of the 4 MmuPV1-positive male Breeders we identified using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, only 1 Donor-Breeder mating resulted in pregnancy, whereas all 4 Breeder-Recipient matings resulted in pregnancies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50056.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Male Breeders harbor infections in their reproductive organs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Incidence of MmuPV1 infection via sexual transmission in male Breeders as determined by staining tissue for MmuPV1 E4 transcript using RNAscope.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Sexual transmission of murine papillomavirus (MmuPV1) in Mus musculus&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Neil Ferguson as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alison Anne McBride (Reviewer #2); Sam Campos (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers find the work novel, important, and acceptable with no additional experiments required, but they do ask you to address the points of clarification (including pregnancy) within the text and figures, as outlined in the reviews. We suggest (but do not require) addition of discussion and possible data regarding MmuPV1 serology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Demonstration of sexual transmission of a papillomavirus in a small animal model is a novel and important finding, especially considering that almost all of the HPV infections that initiate cancers are sexually transmitted. The finding can be considered rather unexpected since MnuPV was initially characterized as a cutaneous virus. The study is straightforward and limited in scope, but the primary conclusion is sufficiently supported by the data provided.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Several suggestions for modifying the text are as follows:</p><p>1) The Abstract should include some indication of the efficiency of transmission.</p><p>2) Subsection âEvidence for sexual transmission: Assessment of MmuPV1 infection status in female Recipient reproductive organsâ, first paragraph: were any of the differences in transmission rates significant according to standard criteria?</p><p>3) Subsection âMale breeders harbor infections in their reproductive organsâ: how long after initiating breeding with a donor female were these analyses undertaken?</p><p>4) Subsection âMale breeders harbor infections in their reproductive organsâ: if histological sections are available, it would be interesting to evaluate the lesions for L1 protein by immunohistochemistry as an indication of whether or not the infections were productive.</p><p>5) It also would helpful to know if the breeding of breeder males with recipient females resulted in pregnancy, as in indication that pairs actually mated. This information seems particularly relevant to the two infected males than apparently didn't sexually transmit infections.</p><p>6) Subsection âMmuPV1 Cervicovaginal Infection and Treatment of Donor Femalesâ: please indicate the source of the infectious virions. Also, some readers might benefit from defining &quot;VGE&quot; as &quot;viral genome equivalents&quot; here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Spurgeon and Lambert present a valuable study demonstrating sexual transmission of murine papillomavirus in mice. I believe that this is the first description of transmission of genital papillomavirus infection and so is of significant impact. The study is short, but straightforward and the results are convincing.</p><p>The figures are very nice, but Table 1 is very hard to follow. It is difficult to interpret whether each row is a mouse or group of mice, and whether the CVLs were performed several times on one mouse, or whether this number in parentheses represents the number of mice. It would also be better if the footnotes were incorporated into the table. I suggest generating a much more comprehensive table that could be presented as supplementary data and adding to the manuscript instead a figure with graphic timelines that describe the various treatment and breeding schedules. I think this would be much easier to follow.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Spurgeon and Lambert present the first experimental sexual transmission of mouse papillomavirus in immunocompetent FVB/N mice. Female &quot;donor&quot; mice were experimentally infected with MmuPV1 (along with UVB/E2 treatment). These mice were cohoused (mated with) uninfected male breeders for at least 21 days. These males were then cohoused with uninfected female &quot;recipients&quot; for at least 21 days. Transmission of MmuPV1 infections (both transient and prolonged) from donors to both male breeder and female recipients was documented. This study is a landmark achievement, opening the possibility of experimental MmuPV1 transmission studies in a genetically tractable model organism.</p><p>In my opinion there are no substantive concerns, only minor suggestions/clarifications (see below).</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) Some mention and/or discussion of any resulting pregnancies is warranted. Did any of the females get pregnant? Were they allowed to birth pups prior to being sacrificed? If so were any of the pups screened for infection? If so what was the outcome?</p><p>2) The diagram in Figure 1B is a bit confusing. As drawn it looks like female donors are housed with males for 4 months.</p><p>3) The PCR data in Figure 2A should be labeled better- the three rows of PCR (either MmuPV1 or p53) correspond to three timepoints post-breeding. What are these timepoints? Can the figure be labeled appropriately? Or were these timepoints different for each of the breeding pairs/recipients?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50056.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[â¦] Minor Comments:</p><p>Several suggestions for modifying the text are as follows:</p><p>1) The Abstract should include some indication of the efficiency of transmission.</p></disp-quote><p>We state in the Abstract that: âOne third of the female recipient mice acquired cervicovaginal infectionsâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection âEvidence for sexual transmission: Assessment of MmuPV1 infection status in female Recipient reproductive organsâ, first paragraph: were any of the differences in transmission rates significant according to standard criteria?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a two-sided Fisherâs exact test to compare transmission incidence between Experiment 4 (prolonged breeding with Donor and Recipient) and Experiment 1 (p=1.0), Experiment 2 (p=1.0), Experiment 3 (no pretreatment and Depo-Provera pretreatment combined; p=0.27), and Experiment 3* (only mice that received pre-treatment with DepoProvera) (p=0.57). As the p-values indicate, none of these comparisons reached statistical significance, and this is likely due to the small group sizes. Note in reviewing the text we realized that in the original submission we stated that the frequency of infection within Experiment 3 was 12.5% (i.e. 1 out of 8 Recipient Females infected). It was actually 14% (1 out of 7 mice). We made this correction to the text. The table accurately reflected the correct data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection âMale breeders harbor infections in their reproductive organsâ: how long after initiating breeding with a donor female were these analyses undertaken?</p></disp-quote><p>In Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 3*, males were co-housed with the donor female and recipient female for 3 weeks each. In Experiment 4, housing of males with donor females, as well as males with recipient females, was extended to 8 weeks. This information is now listed as a column in the revised Table 1, as well as in a new graphical timeline in revised Figure 1B. CVL/PCR was conducted on female recipients at various timepoints after breeding, and the representative time points shown in Figure 2A (listed as times following introduction to the male breeder) are now indicated in the figure legend for Figure 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection âMale breeders harbor infections in their reproductive organsâ: if histological sections are available, it would be interesting to evaluate the lesions for L1 protein by immunohistochemistry as an indication of whether or not the infections were productive.</p></disp-quote><p>We now included representative images of L1 immunofluorescence analysis in the revised Figure 2D for the female reproductive tract, and revised Figure 3B for the male reproductive tract. Overall, the amount of detectable L1 is lower than the level of detectable E4 transcript measured by RNAscope, reflective of the high sensitivity of the latter technique. We now refer to these results in the last paragraph of the subsection âEvidence for sexual transmission: Assessment of MmuPV1 infection status in female Recipient reproductive organsâ and in the subsection âMale breeders harbor infections in their reproductive organsâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It also would helpful to know if the breeding of breeder males with recipient females resulted in pregnancy, as in indication that pairs actually mated.

We had collected that data and now provide it in the revised Table 1 and discuss there data in the subsection âEvidence for sexual transmission: Assessment of MmuPV1 infection status in female Recipient reproductive organsâ, third paragraph and in the subsection âMale breeders harbor infections in their reproductive organsâ. Pregnancies were common in Recipient females except those few that were treated with the contraceptive Depo-Provera. Pregnancies were less penetrant in the Donor females, which likely reflects that they had been treated with the same contraceptive at the time they were experimentally infected with MmuPV1. Depo-Provera is known to cause extended periods in which females fail to cycle and therefore would prevent pregnancies. Males were housed with Donor females starting 4 months post infection. Likely the contraceptive was only beginning to wane in its contraceptive properties by that time point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection âMmuPV1 Cervicovaginal Infection and Treatment of Donor Femalesâ: please indicate the source of the infectious virions. Also, some readers might benefit from defining &quot;VGE&quot; as &quot;viral genome equivalents&quot; here.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer suggesting this clarification. We have provided this information in the subsection âMmuPV1 Cervicovaginal Infection and Treatment of Donor Femalesâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[â¦] The figures are very nice, but Table 1 is very hard to follow.

We have revised Figure 1B to include a more complete graphical representation of the different experiments and revised the table to be more inclusive of information. We think the table remains a critical summary of data that is not summarized elsewhere in the manuscript and therefore should not be made into supplementary data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â¦] Minor Comments:</p><p>1) Some mention and/or discussion of any resulting pregnancies is warranted.

If so what was the outcome?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding pregnancies, please see response to reviewer 1 comment 5. Regarding whether pups acquired infections from their infected mums, we did look for this by screening the skin of some pups born to Donor females by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. We did not see any evidence for vertical transmission; however, we did not do an exhaustive survey. We make note of this in the third paragraph of the subsection âEvidence for sexual transmission: Assessment of MmuPV1 infection status in female Recipient reproductive organs.â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The diagram in Figure 1B is a bit confusing.

We hope the modified figure more clearly conveys the experimental design.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The PCR data in Figure 2A should be labeled better- the three rows of PCR (either MmuPV1 or p53) correspond to three timepoints post-breeding. What are these timepoints? Can the figure be labeled appropriately? Or were these timepoints different for each of the breeding pairs/recipients?</p></disp-quote><p>The timepoints at which CVL/PCR was conducted were different for each of the recipients. This is in part because we tried to avoid performing CVL/PCR while females were overtly pregnant for fear that we would cause complications. Because we felt including this information as labels in the figure would be confusing and distracting, we now list this information in the figure legend for Figure 2A.</p></body></sub-article></article>
