responses. Conformational flexibility in regions of intrinsic disorder within A-kinase anchoring protein 79 (AKAP79) delineates PP2B access to phosphoproteins. Structural analysis by negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) reveals an ensemble of dormant AKAP79-PP2B configurations varying in particle length from 160 to 240 Å. A short-linear interaction motif between residues 337–343 of AKAP79 is the sole PP2B-anchoring determinant sustaining these diverse topologies. Activation with Ca2<sup>+</sup>/calmodulin engages additional interactive surfaces and condenses these conformational variants into a uniform population with mean length 178 ± 17 Å. This includes a Leu-Lys-Ile-Pro sequence (residues 125–128 of AKAP79) that occupies a binding pocket on PP2B utilized by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin. Live-cell imaging with fluorescent activity-sensors infers that this region fine-tunes calcium responsiveness and drug sensitivity of the anchored phosphatase.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30872.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Signaling molecules such as the hormone epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) activate a range of responses inside cells. The responses often involve proteins being chemically modified to change how active they are, which in turn controls specific processes happening inside the cell. One type of modification involves certain enzymes adding or removing molecules known as phosphate groups from specific proteins. For example, an enzyme called PP2B (also known as calcineurin) is able to remove phosphate groups from a variety of proteins.</p><p>PP2B plays crucial roles in many different processes in animals including immune responses, nerve cell signaling and heart activity, and is the target of several medicinal drugs that suppress the immune system. Since PP2B plays so many roles in the body, these drugs often have unintended side effects. Therefore, studying how the body regulates this enzyme may help us to understand what causes these side effects.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that PP2B is activated by calcium ions, which can act as signals in many different situations inside cells. A protein called AKAP79 anchors PP2B to specific locations in the cell so that it only operates where it is needed. Some evidence suggests that calcium ions affect how AKAP79 and PP2B interact, but it is not known how this works. Nygren et al. investigated how the PP2B enzyme and AKAP79 protein interact inside human cells and in cell-free systems.</p><p>The experiments showed that short regions within the AKAP79 protein are responsible for binding to PP2B. These regions and the flexible structure of the entire AKAP79 protein work together to fine-tune how PP2B responds to calcium ions. In the presence of higher levels of calcium ions, another ‘auxiliary’ region of AKAP79 also binds to PP2B. This auxiliary region binds to a site on the enzyme where an immunosuppressive drug called cyclosporine can also bind. This suggests that AKAP79 binding to PP2B may affect the sensitivity of the PP2B enzyme to cyclosporine.</p><p>This study demonstrates that the activity of PP2B can be precisely controlled by interactions with proteins such as AKAP79. Further work on these interactions may help develop more effective drugs that cause fewer side effects in patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anchoring proteins</kwd><kwd>AKAP79</kwd><kwd>calcineurin/PP2B</kwd><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>intrinsic disorder</kwd><kwd>short linear motifs</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01GM120553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veesler</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01DK105542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4P01DK054441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK073368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Flexibility is a defining feature of AKAP kinase-phosphatase assemblies and points toward a mechanism whereby combinatorial recruitment of binding partners tailors the overall conformation of the macromolecular assembly, allowing customized physiological roles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Processing information through cell signaling complexes utilizes all four levels of protein structure. Protein-interaction modules delineate the architecture of these macromolecular assemblies by aligning signaling elements in relation to scaffolding components. These structurally distinct protein folds often recognize primary structure determinants embedded within reciprocal binding surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scott and Pawson, 2009</xref>). Advances in electron microscopy (EM) emphasize that protein flexibility is another feature that influences how multivalent enzyme complexes adapt to the continually changing intracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saibil, 2000</xref>). For example, intrinsic disorder within regulatory domains of constrained protein kinases guides the phosphorylation of nearby substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith et al., 2013</xref>), whereas association of phosphatases with targeting subunits can bias catalytic efficiency toward certain phosphoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hendrickx et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nygren and Scott, 2015</xref>). Hence, conformational order and disorder act in concert to fine-tune intracellular signaling scaffolds.</p><p>Although protein kinases recognize consensus sequence motifs flanking phospho-acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yaffe et al., 2001</xref>), compartmentalization via association with anchoring and scaffolding proteins is an equally important determinant of substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scott et al., 2013</xref>). In parallel, phosphatase-targeting subunits orchestrate where and when dephosphorylation events occur in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ceulemans and Bollen, 2004</xref>). Additionally, anchored kinases and phosphatases often reside within the same macromolecular complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langeberg and Scott, 2015</xref>). Such pre-formed bi-directional signaling units modulate key physiological processes including immune responses, glucose homeostasis, renal water balance and excitatory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clipstone and Crabtree, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hinke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nygren and Scott, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sanderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whiting et al., 2016</xref>). A unifying molecular principle shared by these wide-ranging physiological responses is that signal termination through targeted phosphatases is the predominant regulatory step. Dephosphorylation resets the system to prime anchored enzyme assemblies for the next pulse or wave of signal. This concept is vividly illustrated in the heart where kinase-phosphatase signaling complexes repetitively respond to synchronized pulses of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP during excitation-contraction coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lygren and Taskén, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We investigate how intrinsic disorder influences the maintenance and mechanics of complexes between the calcium/calmodulin dependent protein phosphatase-2B (PP2B, also called calcineurin or PPP3) and the prototypic anchoring protein AKAP79. Stable interaction with PP2B proceeds through a PxIxIT-like motif that was originally identified in the NFAT transcription factors and the regulator of calcineurin (RCAN), whereas transient contact engages other binding surfaces including LxVP-related sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dell'Acqua et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Park et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodríguez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roy and Cyert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roy et al., 2007</xref>). We show that intrinsic disorder within dormant AKAP79-PP2B assemblies permits a range of extended configurations that are condensed into globular signaling complexes following activation with calcium. Cellular validation for this model is provided by live-cell imaging with fluorescent reporters of anchored PP2B activity. </p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Disorder and short linear motifs within AKAP79</title><p>Bioinformatic analyses indicate that AKAP79 consists of defined protein interaction modules linked by regions of intrinsic disorder. Analysis with IUPred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dosztányi et al., 2005</xref>) and PONDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 1999</xref>) predict extended regions of disorder within the first 350 amino acids of AKAP79, whereas the C-terminal portion of the anchoring protein is more ordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). This is consistent with evidence showing that the C-terminal region encompasses the PKA-binding helix (blue; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carr et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gold et al., 2006</xref>).

GST tags were removed by proteolytic cleavage. A macromolecular complex was assembled upon incubation of AKAP79 with molar excesses of PP2B holoenzyme and CaM overnight at 4˚C. Separation by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column provided a reconstituted AKAP79 complex containing all protein components as assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>, lanes 4–7). Limited degradation of certain protein components occurred during assembly of the macromolecular complex. MS/MS sequencing has previously detected PP2B degradation products of 30 and 45 kDa and there is also an untagged AKAP79 form at ~75 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gold et al., 2011</xref>). The apparent molecular mass of this protein complex was 450–550 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, quantitative analysis with in-line multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) revealed a monodispersed complex of 160 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). This corresponds to a 1:1:1:1 ratio of protein components within the AKAP79-PP2B-CaM sub-complex. Further characterization by SDS-PAGE confirmed the presence of each protein component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), while analysis by native PAGE detected a macromolecular complex in excess of 480 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Since intrinsically disordered proteins often elute from size-exclusion columns early, we suggest that AKAP79 complexes are disordered.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Conformational variability in AKAP79/PP2B assemblies</title><p>Dormant PP2B is auto-inhibited by a helical segment of its A subunit.

An important question is whether tethering to AKAP79 alters the activation of PP2B. Therefore, AKAP79/PP2B holoenzyme complexes formed either in the presence of the calcium chelator EDTA or with excess Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM were separated by size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Both complexes eluted from the HiLoad Superdex 200 s column with slightly differing retention times. However, although we sometimes observed the active complex (containing CaM) eluting slightly earlier than the dormant complex, the retention time discrepancies were not replicable, due to the fact that these purification steps were carried out to be preparatory rather than analytical. The protein composition of peak fractions (shaded areas) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A modified GraFix glutaraldehyde fixation protocol was used to preserve the integrity of each purified complex for subsequent structural analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kastner et al., 2008</xref>). Migration as a single high-molecular weight band on SDS-PAGE confirmed the stabilization of macromolecular assemblies.

Immunoblot analyses confirmed the presence of each protein component in the cross-linked macromolecular assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). We observed that the anti-PP2B B subunit antibody had some cross reactivity with CaM, which led to a slightly stronger western blot signal in the active complex than in the dormant complex.

We can therefore infer that amino terminal regions of the anchoring protein contact the B subunit of the active phosphatase holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, orange peptide).

Collectively, these results indicate that the LKIP motif serves to desensitize PP2B towards low levels of calcium, while still allowing the anchored phosphatase to maintain maximal activity when calcium concentrations are elevated. Our modified CaNAR fusion reporter does not contain PP2B anchoring motifs (LxVP or PxIxIT), therefore, our results suggest that the decrease is not due to competition for LxVP motifs. Rather, it is likely that upon Ca2+/CaM influx, engagement of the LKIP motif on AKAP79 stabilizes a conformation of PP2B that does not relieve auto-inhibition as readily as non-anchored phosphatase. Thus, we propose that the LKIP motif in AKAP79 serves to fine-tune the calcium sensitivity of anchored and active PP2B.</p><p>Finally, we investigated whether interaction with AKAP79 affects the sensitivity of PP2B to immunosuppressant drugs. Rationale for this experiment was provided by evidence that the LKIP region of AKAP79 binds at the immunophilin-drug binding site on PP2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>). Competition experiments performed with cyclosporin A/cyclophilin A cocktails (2 μM) diminished binding of PP2B to the N-terminal region of AKAP79 as assessed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>; top panel, lane 4). In contrast, the immunosuppressant drug had no effect on PP2B binding to AKAP79 fragments encompassing the PIAIIIT sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>, top panel, lanes 5–8). Coomassie blue staining of AKAP79 fragments served as a loading control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, bottom panel). Importantly, these results indicate that the LKIP motif and flanking determinants on AKAP79 not only modulate calcium responsive PP2B anchoring, but also may influence the clinical action of immunosuppressant drugs.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30872.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>AKAP79 and cyclosporin bind to a common surface on PP2B.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GST-pulldown experiments using N- and C- fragments of AKAP79 and testing for competition using cyclosporin/cyclophilin complexes, n = 3.

Using a combined negative-stain EM and chemical cross-linking strategy we discover that conformational flexibility within AKAP79-PP2B complexes is a fundamental element of their molecular action. A key facet of this emerging concept is that anchored signaling enzymes are not only tethered to subcellular organelles, but intrinsic disorder within ancillary targeting components confers a dynamic range of enzyme action. For example, flexible linker regions within each regulatory subunit (RII) of anchored Protein Kinase A (PKA) confer a ∼200 Å radius of motion to the associated catalytic subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). More recently we have shown that these anchored PKA holoenzymes remain intact, active and proximal to substrates within these newly defined signaling islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). In other cellular contexts, association with AKAPs exerts allosteric effects that protect PKC isoforms from ATP-competitive inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoshi et al., 2010</xref>). This may explain the mixed success of clinical trials with certain PKC inhibitors and how phosphorylation-dependent regulation of ion channels in the sympathetic nervous system is refractory to these small-molecule antagonists of PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosma and Hille, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mochly-Rosen et al., 2012</xref>). These observations indicate that protein-protein interactions contribute to the substrate preference of these often-promiscuous enzymes, and in a broader context point towards intrinsic disorder and conformational flexibility as inherent specificity determinants of anchored enzyme scaffolds.</p><p>Our findings expand on this concept, showing that unstructured regions within the prototypic anchoring protein AKAP79 contribute to targeting and modulation of protein phosphatase 2B. We have discovered short linear motifs (SLiMS) interspersed between regions of flexibility within AKAP79 that tailor phosphatase targeting interactions to permit local and dynamic control of protein dephosphorylation. Another new concept uncovered by our EM analyses is that phosphatase activation induces a topological reorganization of AKAP79-PP2B assemblies. We base this conclusion on single-particle EM evidence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> showing that upon addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin, dormant AKAP79-PP2B assemblies transition from an assortment of extended multi-lobal conformations into more globular structures. The crosslinking studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> implicate the PIAIIIT motif at residues 337–343 of AKAP79 as a stable PP2B-anchoring determinant that forms the conformational core for dormant assemblies. However, the bi-modal distribution in particle sizes highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> may reflect the differential deployment of other SLiMs that act synergistically with the PIAIIIT anchoring motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grigoriu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodríguez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roy et al., 2007</xref>). This configuration is radically altered upon activation with Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM as the aforementioned topological variants consolidate into a single population with a mean particle length of 178 Å. Hence, additional SLiMs are engaged within the active assembly to drive the formation of a more compact, but fully active phosphatase-anchoring protein unit.</p><p>Crosslinking data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> supports this finding, identifying four additional interactive surfaces between AKAP79 and the lower lobe of the catalytic core of the active phosphatase. In this study we focused on an 11-amino acid calcium-dependent interaction surface within AKAP79 that contacts the B subunit of PP2B. Although peptide array mapping in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> identifies binding determinants throughout this region, the predominant contact site is a Leu-Lys-Ile-Pro sequence located between residues 125–128 of the anchoring protein. There are several interesting features of this interactive surface. This sequence closely resembles an LxVP targeting motif that has been previously implicated in a variety of PP2B actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Escolano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nygren and Scott, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sheftic et al., 2016</xref>). The LxVP motif was originally identified as a rudimentary PP2B substrate recognition site that enhances dephosphorylation of the RII subunit of PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blumenthal et al., 1986</xref>). Subsequently, LxVP motifs were shown to augment PP2B binding and dephosphorylation of the NFAT transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grigoriu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodríguez et al., 2009</xref>). More recently, a variation on this theme was reported in the MAP kinase scaffolding protein KSR2 where an LxVP motif is utilized in conjunction with intrinsic disorder to ensure efficient dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues at sites distal to the PP2B binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brennan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dougherty et al., 2009</xref>). A parallel situation may arise in AKAP79 macromolecular assemblies, as flexibility surrounding the PP2B-binding regions of the anchoring protein may provide a means to extend the range of anchored phosphatase action.</p><p>Scrutiny of type I phosphatase (PP1)-targeting subunit co-crystal structures shows that the LKIP motif on AKAP79 is analogous to the MyPhonE or SILK motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hendrickx et al., 2009</xref>). These secondary binding determinants act in concert with RVxF targeting elements to manage the PP1 catalytic subunit in a variety of subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Egloff et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roy and Cyert, 2009</xref>). Live cell imaging with AKAP79-CaNAR FRET reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>) expand this concept by showing that a protein-protein interaction through LKIP sets distance parameters for anchored phosphatase activity that are contingent on the prior association of the PP2B A subunit with the PIAIIIT motif. Hence, the cooperative action of multiple enzyme-binding surfaces, along with the malleability of the AKAP, creates an elastic and adaptive signaling environment that permits the phosphatase to reach nearby substrates.</p><p>Molecular docking using the Rosetta FlexPepDock program uncovers another intriguing feature of the LKIP motif on AKAP79. This predictive approach reveals that the LKIP sequence recognizes a binding surface on PP2B utilized by the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jin and Harrison, 2002</xref>]). This is borne out by competition experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref> showing that excess cyclosporin antagonizes AKAP79-phosphatase interaction. This finding may have implications for how this signaling complex operates in a variety of pathological contexts. For example, tissue-specific ablation of PP2B from <bold>β</bold>-cells generates a diabetic state that includes defects in NFAT transcriptional signaling, diminished insulin biosynthesis and a loss of islet mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernal-Mizrachi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heit et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise, organ transplant patients who continually receive the PP2B inhibitor drugs cyclosporin and FK506 as immunosuppressives often experience increased blood glucose levels and hypertension as hallmarks of a clinical syndrome known as new-onset diabetes after transplant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heisel et al., 2004</xref>). AKAP150 knockin mice that lack the PIAIIIT motif and incorrectly target the active phosphatase display improved glucose handling and heightened insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hinke et al., 2012</xref>). This argues that mislocalization of PP2B is the predominant molecular event underlying these advantageous, albeit tissue-specific, metabolic phenotypes that counteract the symptoms of type II diabetes. Thus, small molecules or peptidomimetics that perturb PP2B tethering, but do not affect the catalytic activity, may boost insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsoukas et al., 2015</xref>). This theory is further consolidated by animal studies that deliver cell-permeable PxIxIT and LxVP peptides to achieve immunosuppression with fewer side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elloumi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Escolano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noguchi et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the structural insights in this study offer fresh mechanistic perspective on how AKAP79 assemblies influence calcium signaling. Live-cell imaging experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> show that engagement of the LKIP sequence attenuates anchored phosphatase activity at low levels of calcium. Importantly, these effects are relieved upon increased calcium influx. Thus, proximity or direct association with L-type calcium channels, as reported by others, may profoundly influence the temporal action of the anchored phosphatase. This is particularly relevant in the cardiovascular system, where transient calcium fluctuation is pronounced within the vicinity of L-type calcium channel-AKAP79/150 clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nieves-Cintrón et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nystoriak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nystoriak et al., 2017</xref>). A similar situation may arise in the brain where neuronal NMDA receptors, L-type calcium channels in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses and GABA receptors embedded within inhibitory synapses are reversibly controlled by AKAP79/150 associated pools of PKA, PKC and PP2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colledge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jurado et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oliveria et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sanderson et al., 2012</xref>). With this in mind, we postulate LKIP motifs on AKAP79/150 differentially regulate PP2B responses to calcium stimulation and hence balance the role of CaMKII phosphorylation at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Derkach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mulkey et al., 1994</xref>). Our discovery that flexibility is a defining feature of AKAP79 complexes points toward a mechanism whereby combinatorial recruitment of binding partners tailors the overall conformation of the macromolecular assembly. Such structural versatility represents a new means to shape AKAP79/150 kinase-phosphatase assemblies for their customized physiological roles.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bioinformatic predictions</title><p>For all predictions, the amino acid sequence of human AKAP79 was used.

Mutation of the PxIxIT motif in NFAT (PRIEIT) to PRAEAT was done to abolish direct PP2B binding. Fusing a short peptide from AKAP79 to the CaNAR2 sequence and testing whether this was capable of producing a FRET response to ionomycin confirmed the sufficiency of the AKAP79 PxIxIT motif. After fusing the full-length sequence of AKAP79 to CaNAR, mutants were made which were lacking residues 122–136, 337–343, or both.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Confocal imaging of AKAP79-CaNAR mutants</title><p>HEK293 cells were seeded on 12 mm poly-D-lysine and laminin coated coverslips (Fisher) and transfected with 0.3 μg of the wild type and mutant CaNAR reporter constructs. After 48 hr, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and permeabilized for 1 hr in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. Coverslips were blocked in PBS with 10% donkey serum for 2 hr at room temperature before primary antibody staining overnight with mouse anti-PP2B antibody (BD Biosciences). Samples were washed 3x and incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexafluor-555 secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with DRAQ5 (Cell Signaling Technology) for 15 min at room temperature and then washed 3x before mounting in ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen) onto glass microscope slides. Maximum projection images were acquired with a Zeiss scanning laser confocal microscope using a 63X oil immersion objective. HEK293 cells were obtained from GE Life Sciences (Cat. # HCL4517), maintained separately from other cells and were screened weekly to confirm the absence of mycoplasma contamination. As the origin of the cells was not central to the nature of these experiments, we did not further validate the identity of the HEK293 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Immunoprecipitation of AKAP79-CaNAR</title><p>2 μg of each AKAP79-CaNAR variant were transfected into HEK293 cells for 48 hr. Cells were lysed in IP buffer (0.5% NP-40, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors. After lysates were cleared, they were incubated with 2 μg of mouse anti-GFP (Life Technologies), and 25 μL of protein A/G agarose for 2 hr. Following this, the beads were washed in IP buffer 3x and then SDS sample buffer was added. The samples were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for western blotting as described above. 15 μg of lysate was used as an input.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>FRET measurements in response to ionomycin, high and low levels</title><p>CaNAR2pax was generated by substituting the isoleucine residues at positions 115 and 117 within the NFAT domain of CaNAR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mehta et al., 2014</xref>) with alanines (113-PRIEIT-118 to 113-PRAEAT-118) via site-directed mutagenesis, thereby eliminating the endogenous calcineurin-docking PxIxIT motif. AKAP-tethered CaNAR2pax constructs were subsequently generated by PCR-amplifying full-length wild-type AKAP79, AKAP79ΔLKIP, AKAP79ΔPIX, and AKAP79ΔLKIPΔPIX using HindIII/BamHI-linker primers and ligating the resulting PCR fragments into HindIII/BamHI-digested CaNAR2pax in pcDNA3, yielding AKAP79WT-CaNAR2pax, AKAP79ΔLKIP-CaNAR2pax, AKAP79ΔPIX-CaNAR2pax, and AKAP79ΔLKIPΔPIX-CaNAR2pax, respectively. All constructs were verified by sequencing.</p><p>HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco minimal Eagle Medium (Gibco) containing 1 g/L D-glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Prior to imaging experiments, cells were plated onto sterile 35 mm glass-bottom dishes, transfected with the indicated biosensor constructs at 70–80% confluency using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and then grown for an additional 48 hr. HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC (Cat. #CCL-2), maintained separately from other cells and were screened weekly to confirm the absence of mycoplasma contamination. As the origin of the cells was not central to the nature of these experiments, we did not further validate the identity of the HeLa cells.</p><p>Cells were washed twice with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco) supplemented with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2.0 g/L D-glucose, then imaged in the dark at 37°C. Ionomycin (Calbiochem) was prepared at a stock concentration of 1 mM in DMSO and directly added to imaging dishes at the indicated concentrations. Images were acquired on an Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a 40x/1.3 NA oil-immersion objective lens, a Definite Focus system (Zeiss), and an electron-multiplying cooled charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific) controlled by Metafluor 7.7 software (Molecular Devices). Dual emission ratio imaging was performed using a 420DF20 excitation filter, a 450DRLP dichroic mirror, and two emission filters (475DF40 for CFP and 535DF25 for YFP). Filter sets were alternated using a Lambda 10–2 filter changer (Sutter Instruments). Exposure times were 50–500 ms, and images were acquired every 30 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-22-1"><title>Class average dimensional analysis</title><p>Individual classes were measured in ImageJ and binned into 1 nm groups for histogram analysis.

ROIs were drawn around individual cells displaying clear, plasma membrane-localized fluorescence, defined by uniform fluorescence across the cell surface with no nuclear shadow or fluorescence from intracellular membranes, along with a highlighted cell border or the appearance of membrane ruffles/protrusions. Background correction of the fluorescence images was performed by subtracting the intensities of un-transfected cells or regions of the imaging dish with no cells. Time-courses were normalized by setting the pre-treatment emission ratio as equal to one. Graphs were plotted using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad), and statistical analyses were performed using the same software. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22-4"><title>Phosphatase activity assays</title><p>Free phosphate was measured using a colorimetric assay (Promega), and the average

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor.

The EM data provide a strong case that active CaM/MBP-AKAP79/PP2B complexes are more compact/globular than inactive MBP-AKAP79/PP2B complexes – with max dimension reduced to 178Å from 184-228Å. The subunit mapping data are also interesting, and are interpreted in a reasonable way for the resolution of the study. The EM studies are nicely bolstered by the crosslinking studies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which make a compelling case (strengthened further by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) that additional AKAP79/PP2B B and AKAP79/PP2B A (and PP2B B/A) interactions are acquired in the active complex that may influence the Ca++ sensitivity of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Overall the work is generally of high quality and provides new insight into the structural features of AKAP79, revealing a new short linear motif in AKAP79 that appears to functionally resemble the LxVP motif already known to provide a targeting function for PP2B substrates.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are additional (weaker) bands in the SDS PAGE profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and more notably <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>. In the latter, there are 3 bands, about 25% of the intensity of PP2B A, at 75 kDa, 45 kDa, and 30 kDa. What are these, and why do they migrate in SEC with the MBP-AKAP79/PP2B/CaM complex? The authors should mention/discuss these. Are they co-assembled proteolytic fragments, for example? They are not seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, so may form during manipulations? The extra bands are also evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. Can the authors be sure that these are not coming from contaminating particles that could cause affect EM particle picking? This is particularly important given that the length distribution is bimodal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. Could there be more than one covalent species?</p><p>2) It is puzzling that the EM data suggest that the active CaM/MBP-AKAP79/PP2B complex is more compact than the inactive MBP-AKAP79/PP2B complex, yet the former elutes slightly earlier from the SEC column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>/C (which would suggest the opposite). The authors should discuss this discrepancy. If the AKAP79-PP2B holoenzyme complexes exist in a variety of flexible and extended topologies, should this not be reflected in an earlier elution in SEC studies than the active complex?</p><p>3) A very basic summary of crosslinking/mass spectrometry data is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, but it is difficult to evaluate the information in any quantitative fashion. From a list of ~100 crosslinked peptides in either of the inactive and active complexes, 5 paired peptides are selected for discussion, with presumably several intramolecular interactions being summarized by the light grey semi-circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. What were the criteria used to filter the data. Is there some way to assess the relative abundance of any paired interaction versus the others. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, there are repeated entries for some pairs of peptides. What does this mean? There are apparent interactions of the LKIPCIKFPR peptide with a GAWASLKR peptide in the dormant complex, but there seem to be qualitative changes in the interactions of the LKIPCIKFPR peptide with the GAWASLKR peptide and others in the active complex.</p><p>4) The authors include images/FRET movies for AKAP79-CaNAR and AKAP79delL-CaNAR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, but not for the δ P version or lower ionomycin concentrations? Similarly, time course data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) are provided only for the high ionomycin concentration, not for the 100nM ionomycin studies. Inclusion of such additional figures would make the data more convincing. It is also not clear from the methods how the cells used for the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> were selected. It is stated that only cells with clear PM-localized fluorescence were used. How was this discerned? This issue should be explained more clearly in the methods. Also, how do the kinetics vary with expression level (if they do at all)?</p><p>5) The in vivo FRET analysis is interpreted to show that the LKIP motif decreases Ca++ sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The mechanistic basis for the decrease in Ca++ sensitivity is unclear. Is this because the LKIP motif competes with LxVP interaction motifs on substrates? If this is the mechanism, then this would not be a change in Ca++ sensitivity, as stated (?). Does the presence of a LxVP motif in the substrate affect activity of PP2B bound to AKAP or AKAP∆L complexes?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30872.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are additional (weaker) bands in the SDS PAGE profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and more notably <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>.

Using this sensitive approach, the additional bands at 45 kDa and 30 kDa were assigned as PP2B degradation products. The band at 75 kDa is the result of the loss of the MBP tag on AKAP79. We now cite the Gold et al. reference in the Results section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>The GraFix treatment results in stabilization of a single species at a consistent molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that this preparatory step results in further purification, excluding these minor contaminants. We include clarification of this point in subsection “Conformational variability in AKAP79/PP2B assemblies “in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is puzzling that the EM data suggest that the active CaM/MBP-AKAP79/PP2B complex is more compact than the inactive MBP-AKAP79/PP2B complex, yet the former elutes slightly earlier from the SEC column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>/C (which would suggest the opposite).

As the reviewer noted, we observe slightly different retention times of the complexes when purified using a HiLoad Superdex 200 SEC column. This may be explained by the presence of an additional component (CaM) that is incorporated into the active complex. However, these experiments were conducted on preparatory columns rather than analytical columns. Consequently, retention times varied from experiment to experiment. For this reason, we were uncomfortable drawing any firm conclusions regarding the slightly different SEC profiles of the active and dormant complexes. This information has been added in subsection “Conformational variability in AKAP79/PP2B assemblies” of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Nonetheless, and in keeping with the reviewer’s observation, we noted that the peak width (measured at half of the peak maximum) of the dormant complex was broader than that of the active complex. This may indicate structural heterogeneity within the dormant complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A very basic summary of crosslinking/mass spectrometry data is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, but it is difficult to evaluate the information in any quantitative fashion. From a list of ~100 crosslinked peptides in either of the inactive and active complexes, 5 paired peptides are selected for discussion, with presumably several intramolecular interactions being summarized by the light grey semi-circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. What were the criteria used to filter the data. Is there some way to assess the relative abundance of any paired interaction versus the others. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, there are repeated entries for some pairs of peptides. What does this mean? There are apparent interactions of the LKIPCIKFPR peptide with a GAWASLKR peptide in the dormant complex, but there seem to be qualitative changes in the interactions of the LKIPCIKFPR peptide with the GAWASLKR peptide and others in the active complex.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer notes, we discuss 5 paired peptides. These peptides represent the entirety of assigned intermolecular interactions between AKAP79 and PP2B subunits. We have clarified the basis for this selection in subsection “New intermolecular contacts between AKAP79 and active PP2B” of the revised manuscript.</p><p>The reviewer points out that many intramolecular interactions were observed, and in the scope of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, these interactions are represented by grey semi-circles. Each bar represents an individual protein sequence, and lines between different bars represent identified intermolecular interactions. The cross-linked mass spectrometry was carried out as a qualitative experiment (attempting to identify as many links as possible in both the active and inactive states), therefore we do not believe we can accurately make relative quantitative assessments of specific cross-links or compare the abundance of certain links in relation to other links.</p><p>Within the scope of the current experiments it is not possible to calculate the relative abundances of different peptide-pairs due to differential “flyability” of peptides. Individual peptide-pairs exhibit different chemical and physical properties (notably ionization efficiency and fragment efficiency), therefore we can observe varied spectral intensities or identification rates even when peptides are present in equimolar amounts. Repeated entries in the EDTA data were due to redundant cross-linked relationships. This redundancy explains the unclear relationships between the LKIPCKIFPR and GAWASLKR peptides in the dormant and active complexes. We have removed redundant observations in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, and have included expect scores and PPM errors for the best scoring relationship observed in both the active and dormant states to address this confusion. A description of this has been added to the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Although spectral counting has been used to quantitatively assess cross-linking/MS experiments, the current experiment was designed as a qualitative comparison of two states for these proteins in complex and we believe that retrospective quantitative analysis would not be accurate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors include images/FRET movies for AKAP79-CaNAR and AKAP79delL-CaNAR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, but not for the δ P version or lower ionomycin concentrations? Similarly, time course data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) are provided only for the high ionomycin concentration, not for the 100nM ionomycin studies.

It is stated that only cells with clear PM-localized fluorescence were used. How was this discerned? This issue should be explained more clearly in the methods. Also, how do the kinetics vary with expression level (if they do at all)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref> as requested. In addition, we have included supplemental movie files for these images.</p><p>For selection of cells included in the analysis, regions of interest (ROI) were drawn around individual cells that displayed clear, plasma membrane-localized fluorescence. This was defined by uniform fluorescence across the cell surface with no nuclear shadow or fluorescence from intracellular membranes, along with a highlighted cell border or the appearance of membrane ruffles/protrusions. We have included details regarding the methodology in subsection “CaNAR response and kinetic analysis”.</p><p>The kinetics do not vary with expression level (R-squared values of less than 0.1). We have included a discussion of this in subsection “The LKIP motif controls PP2B sensitivity to calcium/calmodulin”, and a supplemental figure demonstrating that these effects are not due to changes in expression (Figure S7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The in vivo FRET analysis is interpreted to show that the LKIP motif decreases Ca++ sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The mechanistic basis for the decrease in Ca++ sensitivity is unclear. Is this because the LKIP motif competes with LxVP interaction motifs on substrates? If this is the mechanism, then this would not be a change in Ca++ sensitivity, as stated (?). Does the presence of a LxVP motif in the substrate affect activity of PP2B bound to AKAP or AKAP∆L complexes?</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to note that we used a modified version of the CaNAR reporter that is fused to AKAP79. Modifications included removal of PP2B anchoring motifs (LxVP or PxIxIT) from the CaNAR portion of the original reporter. The reason for such modifications was to ensure that recruitment of PP2B has to proceed through the AKAP79 portion of the modified phosphatase activity biosensor, and thereby eliminates the possibility of LxVP competition. Thus, we can conclude that upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM influx, engagement of the AKAP79 LKIP motif stabilizes a conformation of PP2B that does not relieve auto-inhibition as readily as non-anchored PP2B. We have more clearly emphasized this point in subsection “CaNAR response and kinetic analysis”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
