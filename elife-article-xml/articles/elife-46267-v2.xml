arrest peptide (AP). Here, we present a 3 Å cryo-EM structure of the stalled human XBP1u AP. It forms a unique turn in the ribosomal exit tunnel proximal to the peptidyl transferase center where it causes a subtle distortion, thereby explaining the temporary translational arrest induced by XBP1u. During ribosomal pausing the hydrophobic region 2 (HR2) of XBP1u is recognized by SRP, but fails to efficiently gate the Sec61 translocon. An exhaustive mutagenesis scan of the XBP1u AP revealed that only 8 out of 20 mutagenized positions are optimal; in the remaining 12 positions, we identify 55 different mutations increase the level of translational arrest. Thus, the wildtype XBP1u AP induces only an intermediate level of translational arrest, allowing efficient targeting by SRP without activating the Sec61 channel.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>translational pausing</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>XBP1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>QBM (Quantitative Biosciences Munich) Graduate School Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shanmuganathan</surname><given-names>Vivekanandan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012.0282</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heijne</surname><given-names>Gunnar von</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>621-2014-3713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heijne</surname><given-names>Gunnar von</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15 0888</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heijne</surname><given-names>Gunnar von</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP26116006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kohno</surname><given-names>Kenji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK1721</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beckmann</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braunger</surname><given-names>Katharina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two integrated approaches shed light on how XBP1 arrest peptide induces intermediate level of translational pausing and identify hotspot positions to make it stronger.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polypeptide stretches, which can induce ribosomal stalling to regulate gene expression, are called ribosomal arrest peptides (AP). While being synthesized as a nascent chain, they traverse through the ribosomal tunnel and establish stable contacts with the tunnel wall. This eventually distorts one of the ribosomal active site, usually the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), and inhibits further peptide bond formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>). In some cases the capacity of APs to stall translation is not only dependent on the AP sequence but also requires an external co-effector molecule, such as arginine and tryptophan in the case of arginine attenuator peptide AAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang and Sachs, 1997</xref>) and TnaC leader peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gong and Yanofsky, 2002</xref>), to exert its function. In contrast, several bacterial APs stall independently of any additional small molecules, yet, are sensitive to pulling force on the nascent chain, thereby serving as force sensors (SecM [secretion monitor], MifM, VemP [Vibrio export monitoring peptide] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butkus et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ismail et al., 2012</xref>]). Depending on the context APs can inhibit translation during elongation (SecM, VemP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Su et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>), termination (TnaC, CMV uORF2 (cytomegalovirus upstream open reading frame 2) and SAM-DC uORF (S-adenosyl-methionine decarboxylase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janzen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raney et al., 2002</xref>) or both in some cases (ErmCL, MifM and AAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiba and Ito, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2000</xref>). Properties of these APs also vary in a way that some have a defined stall position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>), while others have multiple stalling sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiba and Ito, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Cryo-EM structures of these APs within the ribosomal tunnel provided further structural and mechanistic insights, and also enabled visualization of their unique conformation and interactions, which explain their ability to inhibit ribosomal translation. Strikingly, apart from establishing contacts with the ribosomal tunnel mostly between the PTC and the tunnel constriction formed by the ribosomal proteins uL4 and uL22, no structural consensus of APs has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>). To the contrary, so far the structures range from an entirely extended conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) to almost entirely folded in secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matheisl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Until now, most structures characterize prokaryotic APs, with the exception of ribosomal termination stalling mediated by CMV uORF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matheisl et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we analyzed the well-defined mammalian XBP1u AP, which plays a critical role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway.</p><p>UPR represents the central cellular response mechanism that alleviates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and adjusts ER activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). In mammalian cells, this pathway is mainly mediated by three transmembrane sensors that are located in the ER membrane: inositol requiring enzyme one alpha (IRE1α), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Of these three sensors, the evolutionarily most conserved is IRE1 (here, IRE1 denotes mammalian IRE1α and/or yeast Ire1); in lower eukaryotes such as yeast, it is the only known sensor mediating the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mori, 2009</xref>). Increasing levels of misfolded proteins during ER stress sequester BiP away from IRE1α, leading to formation of an active dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okamura et al., 2000</xref>) which is further activated by cluster formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aragón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Credle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kimata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2010</xref>). In yeast, direct binding of unfolded proteins to the luminal core regions of IRE1-dimer or -oligomer is required for the activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kimata et al., 2007</xref>), however, in mammals, direct binding model has been a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kohno, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The cytosolic domain of activated IRE1α then splices the <italic>XBP1u</italic> (X-box binding protein-1 unspliced) mRNA on the ER membrane, producing <italic>XBP1s</italic> (spliced) mRNA, which codes for an active transcription factor.

Once translocated to the nucleus, the XBP1s transcription factor activates genes encoding ER-resident chaperones and folding enzymes, the components of ER associated protein degradation and the proteins that function in secretory pathway, which together increase ER size and activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shaffer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sriburi et al., 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46267.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the IRE1α-XBP1u pathway mediating UPR.</title><p>Interaction of the XBP1u nascent chain with the ribosomal exit tunnel leads to translational pausing, resulting in SRP recruitment to the RNC, followed by targeting to Sec61 on the ER membrane.

XBP1u has two hydrophobic domains, HR1 and HR2, and a C-terminal AP of about 26 residues which pauses the translating ribosome when residing in the ribosomal exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagitani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yanagitani et al., 2009</xref>). During this temporary pause in translation, HR2 is exposed outside the ribosome exit tunnel and can recruit the signal recognition particle (SRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanda et al., 2016</xref>). As a result, the paused XBP1u ribosome-nascent-chain mRNA complex (XBP1u-RNC) is targeted to the Sec61 protein-conducting channel on the ER membrane, where mRNA splicing by IRE1α is now possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>). Given the moderate hydrophobicity of HR2, translational pausing is required for efficient recruitment of SRP by the stabilized XBP1u-RNC, and is critical for proper IRE1α-mediated UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have used two complementary approaches, structural analysis and saturation mutagenesis, in order to decipher the structural basis and mechanism of the XBP1u AP activity. We show that the XBP1u AP makes extensive contacts with ribosomal tunnel components and forms a unique turn in close proximity to PTC in the ribosomal exit tunnel. Notably, the conformation of the XBP1u AP is unaltered within the ribosomal tunnel when the paused complex is bound to SRP or to the Sec61 complex, implying that the XBP1u AP does not function as a force-sensitive switch in the UPR pathway in vivo. By saturation mutagenesis, we observe that many but not all XBP1u residues constituting the turn are optimized for translational arrest. Finally, we identify XBP1u AP variants of increased arrest potency that may be useful as tools for in vitro force-sensing studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and cryo-EM analysis of XBP1u-paused ribosome-nascent chain complexes</title><p>We structurally characterized the paused ribosomal complex (XBP1u-RNC) by cryo-EM and single particle analysis using a mutant version of XBP1u (S255A, full length numbering), which was shown previously to pause ribosomes more efficiently than wildtype XBP1u (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagitani et al., 2011</xref>).

The turn is comprised of eight residues from W249 to W256, and involves the C-terminal half of the characterized XBP1u AP. Notably, the beginning of the turn is only four residues away from the PTC, suggesting that the turn within the tunnel may be critical for the pausing activity of XBP1u. Of the eight turn-forming residues, six have been previously shown to be critical for pausing by alanine scanning mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagitani et al., 2011</xref>), c.f., below. Interestingly, residue 255 that has been mutated from Ser to Ala in the sequence used here is part of the turn: A255 is tightly packed in the structure and the larger Ser residue may be sterically more problematic, possibly explaining why the S255A mutation makes the XBP1u a stronger AP.</p><p>The turn is located in close proximity to the PTC, above the constriction at uL22 and uL4, the narrowest portion of the tunnel. The conformation of the XBP1u peptide in the distal parts of the tunnel is similar to that observed for a non-pausing mammalian nascent chain in the mammalian ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Voorhees and Hegde, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>) and to other known viral and bacterial APs (CMV, MifM and VemP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E-G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matheisl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sohmen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Su et al., 2017</xref>). However, the turn observed for XBP1u is unique, and is located in a part of the tunnel where some other APs adopt α-helical secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E-G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Interactions stabilizing the XBP1u peptide conformation</title><p>The turn in the XBP1u AP makes several key interactions with the tunnel wall and is in part in close proximity to the PTC. It is framed by two tryptophan residues (W249 and W256) and protrudes into a hydrophobic crevice in the tunnel, causing the displacement of the base G3904 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The corresponding base in prokaryotes, A2058, constitutes, together with A2059, the so-called A-stretch in the <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome which is critical for macrolide binding and drug-mediated ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilson, 2009</xref>). Moreover, in TnaC mediated translational arrest the hydrophobic crevice is proposed to play a critical role in recognizing free L-tryptophan in the ribosomal exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martínez et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that this region evolved also in eukaryotes to contribute to the sensing of nascent chains in the tunnel. The positively charged side chain of Arg251 in XBP1u forms a stabilizing salt bridge with the phosphate of A4388 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), whereas Gly250 and Gln253 engage in hydrogen bonds with A3908 and U4555, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,I</xref>). Finally, Trp249 stacks internally onto Gln248 of XBP1u, and the backbone carbonyl of Arg251 makes a hydrogen bond to Lys257 within the XBP1u nascent chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Lys257 also stacks onto U4532, and this stacking interaction might influence the movement of the critical PTC base U4531 (U2585 in <italic>E. coli</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

To that end, we compared the observed PTC conformation with the available mammalian and yeast ribosome structures, either with or without accommodated A-site tRNA, respectively. Since the XBP1u-stalled RNC carries P- and E-site tRNAs but has an empty A-site, we first compared it to the reconstruction of a human 80S ribosome in the post state without A-site tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrmann et al., 2015</xref>) and of a rabbit 80S ribosome in a pre-accommodation state trapped by didemnin B treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shao et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both 80S ribosomes display the classical uninduced state of the PTC before full accommodation of tRNA in the A-site, first described for bacterial ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmeing et al., 2005</xref>). It is characterized by U4531 (U2585 in <italic>E. coli</italic>) in a typical upward conformation, and C4398 (C2452 in <italic>E. coli</italic>), which is part of the so-called A-site crevice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen et al., 2003</xref>), in the typical out-position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast to some bacterial APs, we observed U4531 (U2585) in the XBP1u-stalled RNC in its canonical upward conformation. Although it interacts with the side chain of Met260 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), it appears that this base would not be hindered to switch downwards upon A-site accommodation to adopt the induced conformation. However, another nucleotide, C4398 (C2452), is in the closed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), a position that under normal conditions is observed only after A-site accommodation, as in the reconstruction of the yeast 80S ribosome with A-, P-site tRNA and eIF5a (PDB 5GAK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>). C4398 (C2452) is stabilized in the closed conformation by Leu259, which, in contrast to Met260, cannot be mutated to alanine without almost entirely loosing stalling activity (see below). Notably, this base has been implicated in A-site tRNA accommodation and peptidyl transferase activity. Therefore, the premature positioning of C4398 (C2452) in the closed conformation due to its interaction with Leu259 in an unusual conformation provides a mechanistic explanation for PTC inactivation by inhibition of A-site tRNA accommodation: Leu259 would simply clash with the incoming Asn261 tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Therefore, inhibition or delay of tRNA accommodation into the A-site appears to be the main mechanism for translational pausing by the XBP1u AP. This idea is further supported by the observation that we do not find a stable class of ribosomes in our population of stalled RNCs that carry a canonical A-site tRNA. Moreover, it can be easily imagined how pulling force applied to the nascent chain can rectify the only mildly perturbed geometry of the PTC and thereby alleviate stalling. Since we detect a substantial fraction of the RNCs in the rotated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) we cannot exclude that the XBP1u structure may also perturb translocation as well as preventing rapid A-site tRNA accommodation. However, we do not observe any perturbation of the P-tRNA 3'-CCA end pairing with the P-loop in 28S rRNA, as was seen in other cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46267.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Silencing of peptidyl transferase activity by XBP1u nascent chain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Conformation of C4398 in XBP1u-RNC (blue).

Due to the AP-triggered prolonged dwell time on the ribosome, the HR2 domain of XBP1u gains sufficient affinity to be recognized by SRP. In order to analyze this special mode of SRP recruitment, and to study the state of the nascent chain within the tunnel when engaged by SRP, we generated cryo-EM structures of the paused XBP1u-RNC complex reconstituted in vitro with mammalian SRP or the Sec61 complex.</p><p>We reconstituted the purified paused XBP1u-RNC with dog SRP in vitro (see Materials and methods for details) and subjected the sample to cryo-EM analysis. After sorting for the presence of SRP and further refinement, a final reconstruction was obtained representing the paused XBP1u-RNC in the post state bound to SRP. We found the characteristic L-shaped density of SRP with its Alu-domain bound to the subunit interface connecting to the S-domain at the exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The final reconstruction had an average resolution of 3.7 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and the SRP itself was resolved between 5–10 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). A recently published engaged SRP model (PDB 3JAJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Voorhees and Hegde, 2015</xref>) fits well with our observed density, and individual segments were manually inspected and fitted as rigid bodies in Coot. Analysis of the hydrophobic groove of the SRP54 M-domain, which is known to mediate the recognition and binding of canonical signal sequences, revealed a clear rod-like density resembling that of a signal sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Since the only sufficiently hydrophobic peptide stretch available is HR2 of XBP1u, it is highly likely that this density indeed represents the SRP-bound HR2 domain, bound in a conformation indistinguishable from that of normal SRP-bound signal sequences. Hence, we conclude that the exposed HR2 domain on the paused XBP1u-RNC forms a helical structure upon successful SRP recruitment, which makes a canonical interaction with the M-domain of SRP54. Notably, the nascent chain density was sufficiently well resolved within the tunnel of the XBP1u-RNC-SRP complex to allow for molecular model building. At the given resolution, the conformation of the AP is identical in the presence of SRP to that of the RNC alone. The finding that SRP binding to paused XBP1u-RNCs does not lead to perturbation of the nascent chain within the tunnel strongly suggests that this state maintains the RNC in the paused state.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46267.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM structures of XBP1u-RNC with SRP and Sec61.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cryo-EM reconstruction of XBP1u-RNC with SRP: small (yellow), large (gray), SRP (orange) and hydrophobic region 2 of XBP1u (purple).

Cryo-EM analysis after solubilization with digitonin resulted in a complex paused in the post state and indeed bound to Sec61. We observed clear density for the Sec61 translocon at the tunnel exit and for the P-site tRNA-attached to nascent chain in the ribosomal tunnel. The average resolution was 3.9 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>) and the Sec61 complex resolved to a modest resolution of around 8 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), due to flexibility as observed before. We performed flexible fitting of the Sec61 structure based on the position of the transmembrane segments in order to analyze the functional state of the translocon and search for additional density possibly representing the HR2 motif. When comparing with known structures of Sec61, we found that our structure represented the idle state with the lateral gate of the translocon, mainly formed by TM2 and TM7, in a closed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We could not identify any additional density for the HR2 domain of XBP1u on or near the Sec61 complex, indicating a rather weak or transient interaction. Considering the low hydrophobicity of the HR2 domain and previous biochemical evidence that less than 10% of XBP1u becomes integrated into the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>), our data are in full agreement with the idea that HR2 can interact with, but cannot productively engage and gate, the Sec61 translocon.</p><p>The structure of the XBP1u nascent chain in the XBP1u-RNC-Sec61-complex is indistinguishable from the structures observed in the XBP1u-RNC and the XBP1u-RNC-SRP complexes, with RMSDs between the structures in the range of about 1 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This finding strongly suggests that there is no change in the pausing efficiency during or after successful targeting to the ER membrane, and XBP1u is therefore unlikely to act as a force-sensitive translational switch in the UPR. Probably the long linker length of 52 amino acids between the HR2 domain and the arrest peptide prevents any potential force applied to HR2 upon interaction with SRP or Sec61 to be transmitted to the XBP1u AP. It should be noted that the above structures are obtained via in vitro reconstitution with SRP and Sec61, and also with previously described stronger stalling version (S255A) of the XBP1u AP. In our experimental conditions, without the presence of translational factors these reconstituted complexes do not have an opportunity for further elongation even if they become transiently competent for further translational elongation on the ER membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Saturation mutagenesis of the XBP1u AP</title><p>With the structure in hand, we further characterized the XBP1u AP by saturation mutagenesis.

Not surprisingly, the turn region W249-W256 stands out: five of the eight turn residues are optimal for translational arrest. Outside the turn region, P244 and Y241 are both located in the tunnel constriction, between uL4 and uL22. P244 makes a hydrogen bond to R71 in uL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>) that may be weakened if the highly constrained backbone geometry of P244 is not maintained, and Y241 makes an apparently important stacking interaction with C2794 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, some residues in the wildtype AP are clearly sub-optimal in terms of arrest potency, and we find no less than 55 mutations in Q242, P243, F245, L246, C247, Q248, Q253, P254, S255, K257, L259, and M260 that lead to reduced <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>Beyond the original S255A mutation, mutations in three other key residues C247, Q253, and P254 within the AP lead to particularly strong increases in translational arrest, with <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> values in the range 0.2–0.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Mutation of C247 to charged or polar residues increases the stalling strength. These residues presumably interact with the ribosomal tunnel by forming hydrogen bonds or salt-bridges with the phosphate backbone of rRNA, but the precise interactions cannot be easily predicted from the structure. Q253 is part of the turn, and mutating it to Asn leads to strong increase in the translational arrest. Q253 is positioned in the immediate vicinity of the extremely mutation-sensitive residue A255, and shortening the side chain by one carbon might make the turn better accommodated and more stable in the tunnel, while still allowing hydrogen bonding to U4555 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Nine mutations in the neighboring residue P254 also increase the stalling strength, albeit to varying levels. The XBP1u turn is similar to a β-turn, but does not satisfy all the geometrical parameters and therefore is probably less stable than a canonical β-turn. Proline is not favored in β-turns, and its presence in the turn of the XBP1u nascent chain might be a result of evolution favoring weaker translational pausing instead of a highly efficient arrest.</p><p>Interestingly, mutations Q253→[L, C] led to a reduction in <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), despite the fact that the same mutations led to an increase in <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> in the first screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Because the mutant AP has a Cys residue in position 254, we considered that the enhanced arrest potency may be due to the formation of a disulfide bond with a ribosomal protein, or within the nascent chain itself.

We have determined the first high-resolution structure of a mammalian AP stalled in the ribosome exit tunnel and have carried out an extensive mutagenesis analysis, providing insights into its mode of action.</p><p>As with previously described APs, XBP1u apparently functions in a unique manner. The XBP1u AP forms a turn within the uppermost part of the tunnel to distort the PTC, thereby inhibiting translational activity. PTC bases which are known to be critical in translation elongation and termination are U4531 (U2585), U4452 (U2506) and A4548 (A2602) and, consequently, these bases are often perturbed by APs to inactivate ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>). Among these, the most often distorted base is U4531 (U2585) which needs to be precisely positioned for both peptide bond formation and nascent chain release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmeing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Youngman et al., 2004</xref>). U2585 is usually either stabilized in an inactive alternative conformation or prevented from moving into the so-called induced state upon A-site tRNA accommodation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matheisl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Su et al., 2017</xref>). However, in case of the XBP1u AP U4531 (U2585) appears to be neither restricted nor conformationally perturbed.</p><p>Yet, when analyzing the position of other bases in the PTC, we found not the usual ones but C4398 (C2452) in a closed state before A-site tRNA accommodation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This premature closed conformation of C4398 narrows the A-site tRNA cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gürel et al., 2009</xref>) induced by its proximity to Leu259 of the XBP1u nascent chain, which is positioned such that it would clash with an incoming A-site Asn-tRNA. Taken together, the XBP1u nascent chain with its interactions and unique turn adopts a distinct final conformation in order to induce this mode of PTC perturbation. Therefore, compared to previously described APs, XBP1u functions similarly to some of them by preventing A-site tRNA accommodation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arenz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sohmen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Su et al., 2017</xref>), however, in a unique manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46267.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the XBP1u pausing motif in the exit tunnel.</title><p>XBP1u residues color coded for number residues potency based on mutagenesis data.

Notably, our saturation mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that the XBP1u AP has not evolved to maximize its resistance to pulling forces on the nascent chain, and that many more enhancing mutations exist. P254 plays a critical role in this regard, since nine other residues in this position can all impart stronger arrest potency on the AP. The large increase in translational arrest caused by the Q253N mutation (but no other mutation in this position) points to a very specific requirement for size and hydrogen-bonding capacity in this particular position in the AP. Stronger versions of the XBP1u AP can be useful as force sensors to study cotranslational processes such as membrane-protein insertion into the ER.</p><p>We also found that the mildly hydrophobic HR2 segment of XBP1u is likely to be recognized as a canonical signal sequence by SRP, with clear density visible in the SRP54 M-domain. However, HR2 cannot engage productively with the Sec61 translocon as a signal sequence, which is consistent with previous reports of minimal membrane insertion observed for XBP1u HR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanda et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, we observed that the nascent chain conformation is unaltered within the tunnel in three distinct stages of ER targeting of the ribosome-XBP1u complex: during ribosomal pausing, after recruitment of SRP and upon interaction with Sec61 translocon, arguing against the idea of a force-mediated release of translational stalling after targeting to the ER membrane. However, although we show that the conformation of the XBP1u AP is unaltered in our minimal in vitro reconstitution experiments, we need to consider the possibility of force mediated release of these arrested ER targeting complexes in vivo. Previous biochemical studies and our structural evidence shows that HR2 domain of XBP1u does not engage productively with Sec61, but a subtle pulling force by the translocon might be exerted on the moderately hydrophobic HR2 domain. We cannot exclude that such a dynamic subtle pulling by the translocon, which was not possible to be visualized in our cryo-EM structures using in vitro translation conditions, might be enough to release weaker wildtype XBP1u AP in vivo.</p><p>Independently of the nature of this interaction, however, the linker length between the pausing site and the beginning of the HR2 region of XBP1u may also be responsible for uncoupling of HR2 interactions from arrest peptide conformation. From our force profile analysis, the maximal accumulation of full-length product (i.e. maximal force) occurred at a linker length of 43 amino acids, whereas in stalled XBP1u HR2 is around 52 amino acids distant from the PTC, and hence will hardly exert significant pulling force even if inserted into the ER membrane.</p><p>Based on our findings, we propose a structural and mechanistic explanation of XBP1u’s role in the UPR. The XBP1u AP interaction with the ribosomal tunnel pauses ribosomes sufficiently as for the mildly hydrophobic HR2 domain to gain competence for SRP recruitment. The recruitment of SRP ensures proper co-translational targeting, and subsequent localization of the XBP1u mRNA, to the Sec61 translocon on the ER membrane, ensuring efficient cleavage of the <italic>XBP1u</italic> mRNA by IRE1α. The observed unaltered states of the XBP1u nascent chain within the ribosomal tunnel suggest that neither SRP nor Sec61 release the translation stall induced by the XBP1u AP. This is consistent with the previous finding that HR2 is not hydrophobic enough for efficient membrane insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>If XBP1u-induced pausing is not released by force, we rather envision two alternative scenarios regarding the fate of the properly targeted, paused complex. First, the pausing may resolve autonomously with the given short half-life or, second, the paused complex is recognized by the Pelota/Hbs1 surveillance system as shown in yeast and recycled. The former is more likely in vivo, since the wildtype XBP1u AP is even weaker than the S255A mutant used in this study. In addition, it has also been shown biochemically that the pause is released when incubated longer during in vitro translations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagitani et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the pausing of XBP1u might have evolved as a precise timer, which can pause ribosomes temporarily in order to allow co-translational localization of its polysome-carrying mRNA on the ER membrane for efficient splicing by IRE1α. Interestingly, the mild pausing phenotype is induced by a tight turn of the AP within the exit tunnel, and mirrored by a rather minimal perturbation of the PTC through re-positioning of just one nucleotide, C4398.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning of mutant <italic>XBP1u</italic></title><p>The mutant (S255A) XBP1u (XBP1u-del-HR1-mu), which was derived from full length XBP1u (S255A) mutant as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagitani et al., 2011</xref>), was then truncated to have only the HR2 domain and pausing motif with N-terminal (8X-His, 3X-Flag and 3C protease cleavage site) and C-terminal (HA-tag) for affinity purification and detection purposes.

The rotated state from the initial 3D classification with 94,923 particles was also refined with a 60S mask to 3.1 Å overall resolution.</p><p>A total of 10,136 micrographs were collected for XBP1u-RNC-SRP dataset and 6668 were finally subjected to automated particle picking, and further processed as mentioned above. The final sub-sorted class of post state-RNC with SRP was refined with a mask for 60S and SRP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Molecular modeling and refinement of the XBP1u-RNC</title><p>For the post state XBP1u-RNC, pdb 5LZV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shao et al., 2016</xref>) was used as the initial 80S molecular model of the rabbit 80S ribosome to dock into the sharpened density. The initial fit was done with UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>), the model was further adjusted manually in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) and refined using phenix.real-space_refine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) with restraints obtained with the command phenix.secondary_structure_restraints. All manual adjustments for the final model were done to fit into corresponding local resolution filtered map generated with Relion 2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimanius et al., 2016</xref>). Following bases of the 28S rRNA were manually inspected and adjusted in Coot: C2794, G3904, A3908, A4388, C4398, U4531 and U4532. P- and E- tRNA, mRNA was also inspected manually for proper fit into the density.</p><p>For the rotated state model, first the large subunit (60S) was fitted. For fitting the 40S, the 40S was split into two parts: the head and the body. Split small subunit models were fitted using Coot and then joined together. P/E- tRNA from the pdb 3J77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Svidritskiy et al., 2014</xref>) and A/P- tRNA from pdb 3JBV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) were used as initial models in the rotated state.</p><p>Refinement for rotated state and XBP1u-RNC with SRP and Sec61 were performed as mentioned above. SRP and Sec61 models were rigid body docked and fitted in Coot, and initial models were from pdb 3JAJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Voorhees and Hegde, 2015</xref>) and 6FTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braunger et al., 2018</xref>). Molprobity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) was used to calculate the statistics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) of all the final refined models.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Figure preparation</title><p>Figures displaying electron densities and models were generated with either UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>), ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goddard et al., 2018</xref>) or Pymol (Version 1.8.2 Schrödinger, LLC).

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ramanujan Hegde as the Reviewing Editor and David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alexander Mankin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors probe the molecular mechanism of translation stalling induced by the protein XBP1u, presently the only well-defined eukaryotic protein with an arrest peptide (AP) with a known function. The authors use cryo-EM to determine high-resolution structures of XBP1u-stalled ribosome nascent chain (RNC) complexes at three different steps: paused but not engaged with SRP, paused then subsequently assembled with SRP, and paused then subsequently assembled with the Sec61 translocon. The authors also use saturation mutagenesis of the AP and a system to detect force generation to test the potency of the XBP1u AP. This systematic mutagenesis verifies the key residues for stalling and identifies a palatte of variant APs with both stronger and weaker stalling propensity, which are likely to serve as useful tools in future force measurement studies. The two major conclusions of the paper are that the XBP1u AP adopts a turn structure in the ribosome exit tunnel with well-defined geometry that does not seem to be perturbed substantially by later events in the Sec61 targeting reaction. SRP binding to the hydrophobic stretch is indistinguishable from other SRP structures (at the reported resolution), and the XBP1u sequence is unable to stably engage the Sec61 pore. All of these results are consistent with XBP1u AP-induced pausing serving a kinetic role to enable XBP1u to be targeted to the Sec61 translocon. It's important to note that the authors used a &quot;stabilizing&quot; mutation in the AP, further emphasizing that the natural context is likely to be transient.</p><p>Overall, this is very interesting paper, the quality of the data is high, and it is generally well written. The main issues raised by the reviewers include over-interpretation of some of the findings, the need for a more complete description of some of the figures, and improved details in parts of the Materials and methods. All of these issues can be addressed without additional experimental work. The following issues should be addressed in preparing a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) The authors' claims that SRP and Sec61 do not participate in relieving pausing may lack strong experimental support and should therefore be qualified. In essence, they are looking at an artificial situation in which a purified stalled complex is mixed with SRP and/or Sec61 under conditions where there is no opportunity for elongation. Thus, it might be the case that upon initial SRP or Sec61 binding, a subtle pulling force would allow tRNA accommodation, after which the pause is relieved. Without any such tRNAs in the experimental system, the structure might simply reflect relaxation to the lowest energy state. Without carefully controlled pausing experiments in a translationally competent system with and without SRP and/or Sec61, their roles in relieving pausing cannot be deduced. The experimental evidence merely indicates that neither SRP nor Sec61 stably and quantitatively pull the nascent chain out of its arrested state in this experimental system. in vivo however, it might be that a transient tug (e.g., of HR2 engaging the Sec61 lateral gate) is enough to relieve the pause, but such a weak or dynamic HR2-Sec61 interaction is not captured in structure. Thus, the conclusions about the possible roles of SRP or Sec61 should be qualified, with alternatives such as the above included for completeness.</p><p>2) There is considerable discussion about the UPR in both the Introduction and Discussion. However, the study is mostly about a structure-function analysis of a stalling sequence, so an introduction providing a reader sufficient background on translation pausing and stalling mechanisms would be more appropriate. We believe that a change in emphasis of the Introduction and Discussion away from the UPR and more toward stalling mechanisms to be a very important.</p><p>3) The authors state that they were &quot;surprised&quot; to learn that the XBP1u AP has not evolved for maximal stalling. However, it was already shown some time ago that the AP can be mutated to enhance stalling, and in fact, they use such a mutant for their structures. Thus, the conclusion that the AP has not evolved for maximal stalling is neither new nor surprising. More generally, we do not feel the authors can draw conclusions on the evolution of the AP without information about whether the stall strength is conserved across species whose APs have variant sequences. The authors should re-write these sections accordingly.</p><p>4) All figures should clearly state what map is displayed and a σ value if possible. This will allow a reader to better judge how convincing the structural results are. For example, does Figure 3 depict a 2Fo-Fc map, or the sharpened EM density map? The former would be a less convincing result than the latter.</p><p>5) The mechanism of translational arrest would be significantly more convincing if the authors provided evidence that their data directly supports the relatively small changes they report to nucleotides in the PTC. A supplemental figure would be helpful that depicts the density for these residues in a sharpened EM density map.</p><p>6) Given the author's extensive mutational analysis, there is only a brief discussion about how the mutational data support the proposed model for the conformation of the nascent chain in the exit tunnel. It seems the authors have missed an opportunity to elaborate on how residues involved in either the turn or specific hydrogen bonding interactions with the ribosome or the nascent chain itself support their model. The authors could comment on whether the mutagenesis supports each of the nascent chain interactions described in the structural part of the paper.</p><p>7) The diagram in Figure 1 shows the HR2 sequence inserted into Sec61. The authors might wish to depict this differently to avoid implying that HR2 engages Sec61, which the findings suggest it does not do, at least not stably.</p><p>8) Figure 2 legend – &quot;Traverse&quot; should probably be &quot;Transverse&quot;; might be helpful to define N-tag and C-tag in the legend (or on the figure).</p><p>9) It is somewhat confusing to refer to different regions of the exit tunnel as 'upper' and 'lower,' as there is no convention in the field (see second paragraph of subsection “Generation and cryo-EM analysis of XBP1u-paused ribosome-nascent chain complexes”). Perhaps something like &quot;proximal&quot; or &quot;distal&quot; relative to the PTC?</p><p>10) Subsections “Generation and cryo-EM analysis of XBP1u-paused ribosome-nascent chain complexes” and “XBP1u nascent chain in the ribosomal tunnel”: No biochemical verification is provided to document that the rabbit ribosome would stall at the 'right' codon of XBP1u template in the constructs they used to prepare the complexes for cryo-EM reconstructions. Ideally, it would be good to provide biochemical evidence that the stalling takes place at the expected codon of the mRNA. Without this evidence the discussion of the complex, in particular the discussion of the fitting of the nascent chain sequence within the density, should be more tentative.</p><p>11) Subsection “PTC silencing by the XBP1u peptide”: The discussion of the induced/uninduced state of the PTC and the role of C4398 in the mechanism of stalling is confusing. The author say first that '80S ribosomes display the classical uninduced state of the PTC&quot;. However, few lines down we find that C2439 &quot;is in the closed conformation, a position that.[…] is observed only after A-site accommodation&quot;. Furthermore, while clash of Asn261 with the incoming A-site tRNA makes sense as a part of the stalling mechanism, the pre-accommodation of C2498 is more questionable and in theory its 'pre-arrangement' could facilitate tRNA accommodation. Either the possible negative role of C2498 should be explained better or it should be left out from the proposed mechanism.</p><p>12) The placement of HR2 hydrophobic segment in the proximity to the SRP54 M-domain is drawn from the generally acceptable yet very indirect reasoning. Therefore the statement that &quot;We. […] show that HR2 segment is recognized as a canonical signal sequence by SRP&quot; is a clear overstatement.</p><p>13) Subsection “Saturation mutagenesis of the XBP1u pausing motif”: The mutagenesis experiments have been done in the context of the artificial construct where (likely) pulling force alleviates the arrest. As authors indicate in the Discussion, pulling force plays either no or very limited role in the normal operation of the XBP1u stalling system. Therefore, all the effects they observed with their mutations should be presented and discussed in the context of affecting sensitivity to the pulling force rather than as increasing or decreasing stalling efficiency of the XBP1u arrest peptide. Stalling efficiency and resistance of stalling to the pulling force might be related, or might not. The remedy would be to use an independent method, e.g. toeprinting, to demonstrate that the selected 'better' peptides exert more efficient stalling in the absence of the pulling force; but this has not been done. Thus, the authors should be more cautious in their interpretation.</p><p>14) The constructs used for cryo-EM complex preparation are not described in sufficient detail. The authors should present at least the amino acid sequences of the encoded protein(s) and ideally, also the nucleotide sequences of the constructs used.</p><p>15) Subsection “Interactions stabilizing the XBP1u peptide conformation”: In regards to interactions of W249 and W256 with the hydrophobic crevice in the tunnel, it is probably worthwhile mentioning that Martinez et al. (NAR 42, 11245) proposed that his crevice is involved in recognition of Trp during the TnaC-controlled translation arrest.</p><p>16) For the citation of Schmeing et al., 2005 in the Results remove &quot;Martin&quot;</p><p>17) Figure 2 legend. 'AP' segment is labeled as 'PS' in panel A.</p><p>18) Neither PKRM, nor RM are common acronyms. Define at the first mentioning.</p><p>19) Rephrase: 'mRNA was linearized'</p><p>20) Materials and methods section: &quot;incubated with beads…&quot; What beads? How much? And later in the section: if 'beads' should it then be supernatant, not 'flow-through'?</p><p>21) The authors do not include a complete list of linkers used in Figure 6B. This needs to be added as a supplementary table.</p><p>22) Figure 6 is hard to follow. Some descriptions are scattered in the text. For panel B, the authors should note the length of the SecM AP (since L is defined from the end of H to the end of the AP, and 20 aa does not make sense for XBP1u AP). Panels C and D axes are not labeled, and could also use a key for what 0 and 1 mean. The authors could also mark the positions that are already optimal in the WT sequence, in panel C, including a note of the 8 in the turn motif. This would help readers see the 6/8 mentioned in the text.</p><p>23) The authors detect a substantial fraction of the RNCs in the rotated state, suggesting that the AP structure perturbs translocation as well as likely preventing rapid A-site tRNA accommodation. Do the authors see any perturbation of the P-tRNA 3'-CCA end pairing with the P-loop in 28S rRNA, as was seen in the SecM-Pro case (https://elifesciences.org/articles/09684) and more recently with compounds that can stall translation (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/315325v2)? The authors should comment on this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46267.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, this is very interesting paper, the quality of the data is high, and it is generally well written.

Perhaps something like &quot;proximal&quot; or &quot;distal&quot; relative to the PTC?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed the text exactly as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsections “Generation and cryo-EM analysis of XBP1u-paused ribosome-nascent chain complexes” and “XBP1u nascent chain in the ribosomal tunnel”: No biochemical verification is provided to document that the rabbit ribosome would stall at the 'right' codon of XBP1u template in the constructs they used to prepare the complexes for cryo-EM reconstructions.

Without this evidence the discussion of the complex, in particular the discussion of the fitting of the nascent chain sequence within the density, should be more tentative.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed have not provided any additional biochemical evidence that the XBP1u stalling occurs at the expected site in our system. However, there is clear evidence in the literature that a unique stall site with Met260 as the most C-terminal amino acid is employed by the highly conserved nascent XBP1u in mammalian cells (Ingolia et al., 2011). Moreover, the structural detail of our reconstruction is resolved for the relevant part of the nascent XBP1u chain between 3.0 and 3.5 Å (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). This level of detail allowed for an unambiguous building of the molecular model (Figure 3), in particular with several bulky amino acid side chains (M260, K257, W256, H252, etc.) serving as clear landmarks for the correctness of the building process. It would not be possible to build a nascent chain model into the density after changing the register by +/- 1 or more amino acids. The identity of the stall site is further confirmed by the perfectly matching density for the codon-anticodon helix and for the P-site tRNA representing AUG:methionyl-tRNA. Therefore, we feel confident that our fitting of the nascent chain sequence within the density is highly reliable and that additional biochemical evidence corroborating the stall site is dispensable. For these reasons we would like to leave the discussion regarding fitting of the nascent chain into the density essentially as it is and suggest to not use a more tentative wording.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Subsection “PTC silencing by the XBP1u peptide”: The discussion of the induced/uninduced state of the PTC and the role of C4398 in the mechanism of stalling is confusing.

Either the possible negative role of C2498 should be explained better or it should be left out from the proposed mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Apparently, the explanation regarding the conformations of the different bases was somewhat confusing as pointed out. In the revised text we made an effort to more clearly explain that on one hand the often perturbed U4531 (U2585) appears in our case in its normal uninduced conformation, whereas on the other hand, the C4398 (C2452) is stabilized by Leu259 in a prematurely closed or induced conformation, thereby together contributing to stalling by preventing A-site tRNA accommodation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The placement of HR2 hydrophobic segment in the proximity to the SRP54 M-domain is drawn from the generally acceptable yet very indirect reasoning. Therefore the statement that &quot;We.[…] show that HR2 segment is recognized as a canonical signal sequence by SRP&quot; is a clear overstatement.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested we re-phrased this sentence in order to account for the lack of direct evidence. It reads now: ‘…HR2 segment of XBP1u is likely to be recognized as…’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Subsection “Saturation mutagenesis of the XBP1u pausing motif”: The mutagenesis experiments have been done in the context of the artificial construct where (likely) pulling force alleviates the arrest.

Thus, the authors should be more cautious in their interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the mutagenesis screen was done under high pulling force, in contrast to the situation when the XBP1 AP performs its normal function in vivo. However, Figure 6B shows that a mutation (P254C) that increases the stalling strength at high pulling force does so also under low or negligible pulling force, arguing that stalling efficiency in the absence of pulling forces and resistance of stalling to the pulling force in fact are related and co-vary. We now address this issue in the text, and have also made it more clear that the data in Figure 6C and D were obtained under high pulling force.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The constructs used for cryo-EM complex preparation are not described in sufficient detail.
