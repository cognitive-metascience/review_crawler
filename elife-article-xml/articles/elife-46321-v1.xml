(salt-and-pepper) tuning superimposed on smooth global topography. Could this organization be a byproduct of impoverished experience in laboratory housing? We compared whisker map somatotopy in L2/3 and L4 excitatory cells of somatosensory (S1) cortex in normally housed vs. tactile-enriched mice, using GCaMP6s imaging. Normally housed mice had a dispersed, salt-and-pepper whisker map in L2/3, but L4 was more topographically precise. Enrichment (P21 to P46-71) sharpened whisker tuning and decreased, but did not abolish, local tuning heterogeneity. In L2/3, enrichment strengthened and sharpened whisker point representations, and created functional boundaries of tuning similarity and noise correlations at column edges. Thus, enrichment drives emergence of functional columnar topography in S1, and reduces local tuning heterogeneity. These changes predict better touch detection by neural populations within each column.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sensory map</kwd><kwd>enrichment</kwd><kwd>columns</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>cerebral cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37NS092367</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feldman</surname><given-names>Daniel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sensory enrichment creates a more columnar, less salt-and-pepper whisker map in somatosensory cortex, showing that impoverished experience contributes to intermixed tuning in rodent sensory maps.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory maps are a defining feature of cortical sensory areas, and may enable efficient local network computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chklovskii and Koulakov, 2004</xref>). In rodents, maps for sensory features in L2/3 of primary sensory cortex exhibit strong tuning heterogeneity between nearby neurons, superimposed on a smoothly varying global topography. In these maps, discrete functional column boundaries are lacking and the neural ensemble activated by a single sensory feature is spatially dispersed. It is unclear whether this dispersed topography reflects sensory experience during development. Appropriate sensory experience is often required for development of topography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katz and Shatz, 1996</xref>), and L2/3 maps are robustly plastic to sensory experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buonomano and Merzenich, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Feldman and Brecht, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">LeMessurier and Feldman, 2018</xref>). This raises the question of whether dispersed, salt-and-pepper organization at cellular resolution is a natural feature of L2/3, or may reflect incomplete activity-dependent development due to impoverished sensory experience in rodent laboratory housing.</p><p>Sensory experience may be particularly relevant for development of whisker map somatotopy in rodent S1. Whiskers are tactile sensors represented in S1 by a topographic array of cortical columns, each centered on a L4 barrel. In the canonical whisker map, inferred from single-unit recordings, nearly all neurons are tuned for their column’s anatomically-corresponding whisker. However, recent studies using cellular-resolution population calcium imaging in L2/3 reveal that while average tuning within each column is topographically correct, tuning of individual neurons within each column is heterogeneous, with intermixed neurons tuned for either the columnar whisker or local surround whiskers. The set of neurons tuned for one whisker is dispersed across multiple columns in L2/3 without discrete functional column borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clancy et al., 2015</xref>). This globally smooth but locally scattered representation resembles salt-and-pepper maps of orientation tuning and retinotopy in rodent V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bonin et al., 2011</xref>) and frequency tuning in rodent A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanold et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Rodent housing conditions were standard or not reported in prior studies of dispersed, salt-and-pepper maps, but may affect map structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andermann and Moore, 2006</xref>). In particular, environmental enrichment and exercise increase the amount, complexity and salience of sensory stimuli, and promote cortical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diamond et al., 1976</xref>). Enrichment sharpens single-unit receptive fields and refines average map topography in forepaw S1 and A1 of young rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coq and Xerri, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Engineer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jakkamsetti et al., 2012</xref>), and in whisker S1 of adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polley et al., 2004</xref>). But how enrichment affects maps at sub-columnar and cellular resolution is unknown. If the dispersed, salt-and-pepper whisker map in L2/3 is a byproduct of inadequate sensory (or non-sensory) experience, environmental enrichment should increase columnar structure and refine map topography at the cellular scale.</p><p>To test this question, we raised young adult mice from P21 for 25–50 days in either standard laboratory housing with a single littermate, or in an enriched environment with tactile toys and 1–2 additional littermates, which enhances whisker contact as part of social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). We then characterized whisker tuning and somatotopic map organization in L2/3 or L4 excitatory cells using 2-photon imaging of GCaMP6s expressed conditionally using layer-specific Cre lines. Enrichment (EN) strongly increased columnar organization and reduced salt-and-pepper organization, which increased the efficiency of population coding of whisker deflections within each column. These effects occurred mostly in L2/3, not L4. Thus, enrichment greatly enhances columnar organization in L2/3 of S1, so that cellular-scale functional topography better matches the anatomical columnar map.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Whisker receptive fields measured by calcium imaging</title><p>We expressed GCaMP6s in either L2/3 pyramidal (PYR) cells or L4 excitatory cells of S1 by injecting Cre-dependent GCaMP6s virus into either Drd3-Cre mice for L2/3 PYR cell-specific expression or Scnn1a-Tg3-Cre mice for L4 excitatory-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik et al., 2012</xref>). After several weeks for expression, we imaged neural activity in D2 and adjacent whisker columns, using resonant-scanned 2-photon calcium imaging through a chronic cranial window. Imaging was performed under anesthesia, while applying calibrated whisker deflections. We randomly interleaved deflection of 9 whiskers in a 3 × 3 grid centered on D2, using brief 5-pulse deflection trains, plus no-stimulation ‘blank’ trials (50–70 repetitions of each stimulus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Whisker-evoked ΔF/F responses were measured from regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to GCaMP6-expressing somata. ROIs were considered significantly whisker-responsive if the distribution of whisker-evoked ΔF/F (quantified in a 1 s period after whisker deflection) was greater than blank trials (permutation test, α = 0.05 corrected for nine whiskers, see Materials and methods). Analyses were restricted to whisker-responsive ROIs. Receptive fields of 3 example L2/3 cells in one column are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. Imaged neurons were localized post-hoc relative to column boundaries by histological staining and alignment by surface blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We confirmed that GCaMP6s-based receptive fields were similar to spiking-based receptive fields by simultaneous juxtacellular spike recording and GCaMP6s imaging in 10 whisker-responsive L2/3 neurons.

We quantified each cell’s response to a reference whisker as evoked ΔF/F relative to spontaneous activity (blank trials), and then calculated the mean response across cells as a function of distance to the reference whisker’s column center. This analysis only includes whisker-responsive cells. We first studied L2/3 PYR cells in Drd3-Cre mice. For L2/3 cells in normally-housed (NH) mice (11 imaging fields, seven mice, 998 total cells, 475 responsive cells, age: P56 ± 11), the point representation was centered on the reference whisker’s anatomical column, and fell off gradually over several columns’ distance. Enriched (EN) mice (11 imaging fields, seven mice, 1257 total cells, 874 responsive cells, age: P63 ± 16) showed an elevated mean response in the reference column and just around it. This was observed in the central bin (0–75 μm from column center; NH: 0.59 ± 0.06, EN: 0.77 ± 0.04; p=0.0098, permutation test for difference in means) as well as at 150–225 µm (NH: 0.53 ± 0.02, EN: 0.60 ± 0.02; p=0.0028) and 225–300 µm (NH: 0.41 ± 0.02, EN: 0.51 ± 0.01; p=0.0001). But EN suppressed mean responses at the flanks of the point representation (375–750 μm, p&lt;0.05 for all bins) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This enhancement of responses in the home column and reduced responses some distance away was also apparent in 2D maps in which imaging fields were rotated to align the arc axis, and then ROIs were spatially binned relative the reference column center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We imaged L4 cells in Scnna1-Cre mice. We imaged from 107 responsive cells in L4 of NH mice (six imaging fields, five mice, 322 total cells, age: P70 ± 16). We found that the point representation was sharper in L4 than L2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

This was also observed in 2D maps around the reference column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To do this, the position of each ROI was determined in polar coordinates around the reference column center, in which angle was calculated relative to row-arc anatomical axes, and distance was expressed as a proportion of the reference column radius. ROIs were then spatially binned to calculate the point representation in this column-based reference frame. In L2/3, this confirmed that EN increased the mean response to a reference whisker in its home column, and revealed that EN sharpened the point representation primarily across whisker rows, not across arcs, and reduced spatial bias toward adjacent higher-arc whisker columns. In L4, this confirmed that EN weakened home-column responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To test whether enrichment also altered L4 barrel anatomical size, as occurs in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polley et al., 2004</xref>), we quantified barrel radius for nine identified barrels from CO-stained tangential sections through L4 of each Drd3-Cre mouse. Enrichment did not alter mean barrel radius (NH: 151 ± 7.2 μm, n = 6 mice, EN: 145 ± 4.6 μm [mean ± SEM], n = 7 mice (2-way ANOVA, factors: enrichment and barrel identity, p=0.7 for enrichment factor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). There was also no change in barrel radius in Scnn1a-Cre mice, which have a slightly smaller barrels (NH: 118 ± 6.6 μm, n = 5 mice, EN: 124 ± 6.9 μm, n = 6 mice, p=0.01 for enrichment factor). Thus, the functional changes in L2/3 point representation occurred without gross changes in L4 barrel dimensions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Whisker map topography in L2/3 and L4 in normally housed mice</title><p>Because L2/3 exhibits pronounced salt-and-pepper tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clancy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peron et al., 2015</xref>), the sharpened point representation in L2/3 could reflect altered homogeneity of whisker tuning in each column. To test this, we first quantified salt-and-pepper organization in NH mice for L2/3 PYR cells (in Drd3-Cre mice) and L4 excitatory cells (in Scnna1-Cre mice). Prior studies of salt-and-pepper tuning did not distinguish between cell types in L2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clancy et al., 2015</xref>), and did not examine L4.</p><p>L2/3 PYR cells in NH mice had intermixed tuning for different whiskers in each individual column. We first identified the best whisker (BW) for each cell, defined as the whisker that evoked the absolute largest mean ΔF/F. Cells with different BWs were intermixed in each column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). 53% (31/58) of responsive cells within 0–75 µm of a column center had a BW that matched the column’s anatomically-mapped whisker (termed the columnar whisker, CW). The fraction of cells tuned to a reference whisker fell off gradually with cortical distance from that whisker’s column center, to 16% (66/406 cells) at 225–300 µm and 1% (6/419 cells) at 525–600 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This distribution is broad compared to mean anatomical column radius (151 ± 7.2 μm). We also assessed tuning with a more rigorous approach that accounts for the statistical uncertainty in identifying the strongest whisker from limited stimulus repetitions. For this, we identified all whiskers that evoked a mean ΔF/F that was statistically indistinguishable from the BW (see Materials and methods). A cell was considered tuned for the CW if the CW was among these statistically equivalent best whiskers (eBWs). By this measure, 67% (39/58) of L2/3 PYR cells within 0–75 µm of the column center were tuned to the CW. This fraction fell off gradually with cortical distance, to 43% at 225–300 µm (174/406 cells) and 10% at 525–600 µm (41/419 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This confirms salt-and-pepper tuning among L2/3 PYR cells in NH mice, and shows that the set of neurons tuned for a given whisker is dispersed across multiple columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clancy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We applied the same analysis in L4 of NH mice. Surprisingly, while L4 showed a slight trend for more homogeneous tuning at the center of a whisker column (0–75 um) than L2/3, this was not significant. 63% of L4 excitatory cells (30/48) had a BW that matched the CW, and 73% (35/48) had the CW among the eBWs. These values are not different from L2/3 (p=0.43 and p=0.67 respectively, Fisher’s Exact Test). However, the fraction of cells tuned to a given whisker fell off ~30% more sharply with distance in L4 than in L2/3, using either tuning measure. This difference was significant at distance bins from 150 to 375 µm from the column center (p&lt;0.05, Fisher’s Exact Test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, L4 exhibits more topographic precision in whisker tuning of single cells than L2/3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Enrichment decreases tuning heterogeneity in the salt-and-pepper map</title><p>Enrichment decreased local salt-and-pepper tuning heterogeneity in L2/3 in each column. For this analysis, we used the statistical definition of tuning in which a cell was considered tuned for a whisker if that whisker was among its statistically equivalent eBWs. In EN mice, 82% (111/135) of cells located 0–75 μm from a column center were tuned to the CW, which is greater than NH mice (67%, p=0.025, Fisher’s Exact Test).

To quantify this, we compared responses evoked by the CW with those evoked in the same cell by row- and arc-surround whiskers (SWs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). CW responses were higher in EN than NH (NH: 0.64 ± 0.03, EN: 0.71 ± 0.02; p=0.01, permutation test for difference in means). In NH, the SW one row dorsal to the CW (within-arc, −1 row) and one row ventral to the CW (within-arc, +one row) were 68% and 62% of the CW response, respectively. EN reduced responses to both these SWs (within-arc, −1 row: NH: 0.44 ± 0.02, EN 0.35 ± 0.02, p=0.001; within-arc, +one row: NH: 0.39 ± 0.02, EN: 0.29 ± 0.01, p=0.0001). As a result, these whiskers evoked only 49% and 41% of the CW response. This represents sharpening of the whisker receptive field across rows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In the within-row dimension, EN increased responses to the SW one arc rostral of the CW (within-row, +one arc: NH: 0.34 ± 0.01, EN: 0.53 ± 0.02, p=0.0001), and did not alter responses to the SW one arc caudal of the CW (within-row, −1 arc: NH: 0.57 ± 0.04, EN 0.55 ± 0.04, p=0.40). Thus, EN broadened receptive fields in the within-row dimension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These receptive field changes are consistent with the apparent changes in point representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p>In L4, EN reduced responses to most whiskers in rank-ordered receptive fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

The mean receptive field was sharper in L4 than L2/3 in both NH and EN, consistent with sharper point representation in L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). When receptive fields were examined in somatotopic space, CW responses were weaker in EN than NH (NH: 0.98 ± 0.09, EN: 0.81 ± 0.04, p=0.02), as were responses to the within-row, +one arc SW (NH: 0.54 ± 0.08, EN: 0.17 ± 0.02, p=0.0001), the within-row, −1 arc SW (NH: 0.67 ± 0.13, EN 0.33 ± 0.04, p=0.003), and the within-arc, +one row SW (NH: 0.23 ± 0.03, EN 0.11 ± 0.02, p=0.0007). The within-arc, −1 row SW was not sampled sufficiently in our L4 dataset to enable this comparison. Thus, EN sharpened L4 receptive fields, but by a global weakening of whisker responses, unlike in L2/3.

EN substantially reduced these signal and noise correlations for neurons outside the column, while preserving signal correlation and only modestly reducing noise correlation among neurons within the reference column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>).

The extent of such neuropil contamination is difficult to measure empirically, and 2-photon imaging studies apply different methods and degrees of correction. Above, we applied no neuropil correction in L2/3, because Drd3-Cre mice had relatively low neuropil signal, reflecting GCaMP6s expression in only ~50% of L2/3 PYR cells. We did apply neuropil correction in L4 (at weight r = 0.3, see Materials and methods), because Scnn1a-Cre drove denser GCaMP6s expression, and imaging deeper in cortex required higher laser power, which could increase out-of-focus fluorescence above the imaging plane. To confirm that the major effects of the study were robust to different levels of neuropil correction, we applied neuropil subtraction in both L2/3 and L4 at three weights (r = 0, r = 0.3, r = 0.7, see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Enrichment effects on tuning heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and point representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) were qualitatively unchanged across these levels of neuropil subtraction in both L2/3 and L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). The highest level of subtraction (r = 0.7) has been used in several prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) but here appeared to cause overcorrection for most ROIs in both L2/3 and L4, strongly reducing the number of ROIs that were whisker-responsive. Effects of enrichment on signal correlations were conserved for r = 0 and r = 0.3, but were lost for r = 0.7, likely because fewer cells could be analyzed (only responsive cells were analyzed). Effects of enrichment on noise correlations persisted across all neuropil subtraction levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>).

We built a neural population decoder that predicted CW deflection (relative to spontaneous activity) from single-trial ΔF/F from populations of imaged L2/3 neurons in Drd3-Cre mice. Each ROI was trained by logistic regression, on a subset of CW deflection and blank trials, to predict whisker deflection from ΔF/F in a 1 s window. Performance was tested on held-out trials. Single-ROI decoders performed above chance, with slightly better performance by EN cells than NH cells (fraction correct for NH: 0.63 ± 0.005, for EN: 0.65 ± 0.004, p=0.004, permutation test for difference in means). Population decoders were built by randomly selecting ensembles of 2–30 ROIs that were simultaneously imaged in the same field, and averaging the output of each ROI classifier to generate a population prediction on each trial. Because ROIs could be located in different whisker columns, we averaged performance across the set of CWs for those columns.

These decoders were tested for detection of reference whisker deflection versus a blank. Mean detection performance (on average across the population sizes) was greatest for ensembles centered near the whisker column center, and fell off with distance.

The point representation of a whisker among L2/3 cells spread across multiple columns, and fell off gradually without discrete columnar boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This was due in part to tuning heterogeneity within each column: only 48% of PYR cells in each column responded maximally to the CW, and only 65% had the CW among statistically equal best whiskers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In L4, enrichment more subtly sharpened the whisker map, via general weakening of whisker responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Our cellular-resolution mapping substantially extends this finding, by showing that juvenile enrichment strengthens CW responses, sharpens the L2/3 whisker map, and generates functional tuning boundaries in L2/3 aligned to anatomical column edges. By imaging in L4, we detected modest receptive field plasticity, which was not detected in L4 multiunit recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polley et al., 2004</xref>).

EN mice had modestly increased signal correlations within columns but substantially decreased signal correlation across columns, even for neurons located just ~100 μm apart across a column edge. Similarly, noise correlations were modestly decreased within columns, but strongly decreased across columns, even for neurons ~100 μm apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, enrichment enhanced tuning distinctions between columns, reduced shared noise between columns, and created sharper functional boundaries at column edges, evident from both signal and noise correlations. Local tuning heterogeneity still existed in L2/3 of EN mice, but functional columnar organization was stronger.</p><p>Greater differentiation of somatotopic tuning across columns could improve neural coding for whisker stimulus detection in each column. In addition, because noise correlations are often detrimental for sensory coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohn et al., 2016</xref>), their reduction may improve whisker sensory coding for downstream areas. Reduced signal and noise correlations across columns in L2/3 may reflect more rigid columnar segregation of L4-L2/3 and L2/3-L2/3 circuits, for example by reducing cross-columnar excitatory projections or enhancing cross-columnar inhibition. In L4, enrichment increased signal correlations within columns, which may reflect stronger recurrent excitation in each L4 barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ashby and Isaac, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Enrichment improves population coding of whisker deflection in L2/3</title><p>Sensory tuning and maps reflect average responses over many stimulus presentations, but perception and sensory-evoked behavioral responses occur on single trials.

Thus, the strengthening of CW-evoked responses, the reduction of spontaneous activity and noise correlations, and the higher proportion of CW-tuned neurons are sufficient to improve single-trial coding of whisker deflections in EN mice. Topographically, enrichment improved detection by ensembles in the home whisker column, but worsened detection by ensembles in neighboring columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, the columnar organization of effective decoding was sharpened, matching the sharper point representations in L2/3 of enriched S1.

While enrichment promotes more diverse tactile experience, it also likely increases social interactions and affects general activity levels. Which of these factors is dominant in driving whisker map plasticity was not tested. Enrichment strengthened and sharpened the L2/3 PYR cell map and drove emergence of functional boundaries aligned to columnar structure. Enrichment reduced, but did not eliminate, salt-and-pepper tuning heterogeneity in L2/3. Thus, salt-and-pepper organization is a robust feature of rodent L2/3 sensory maps, but its degree is flexible based on experience. Enrichment reduced both mean tuning similarity and stimulus-independent (spontaneous) firing correlations across columns. Thus, columns became more functionally independent, which predicts more accurate column-based encoding of whisker input. The circuit mechanisms for emergence of columnar structure in L2/3 remain to be identified.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additonal <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Scnn1a-tg3-Cre line</td><td valign="top">Jackson Labs</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:009613">IMSR_JAX:009613</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Drd3-Cre line</td><td valign="top">MMRRC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MMRRC_034610-UCD">MMRRC_034610-UCD</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">AAV1.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40</td><td valign="top">Penn Vector Core</td><td valign="top">Penn: AV-1-PV2821</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">AAV9.CAG.Flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40</td><td valign="top">Penn Vector Core</td><td valign="top">Penn: AV-9-PV2818</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MATLAB (version 2014b)</td><td valign="top">Mathworks</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">ScanImage</td><td valign="top">Vidrio Technologies</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014307">SCR_014307</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Igor Pro (version 6)</td><td valign="top">Wave Metrics</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000325">SCR_000325</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were approved by the UC Berkeley Animal Care and Use Committee and follow NIH guidelines.

Thus, in each NH cage, both mice were recovering from surgery at the same time, and in each EN cage, at least 2 out of the 3–4 mice were recovering at the same time.</p><p>Surgical recovery was quantified in a special cohort of 6 NH and 6 EN mice (separate from the mice used in imaging). Mice recovered to pre-surgical weight within 4 days (NH) or 5.5 days (EN), on average. General exploratory behavior was measured daily from 1 to 7 days post-surgery by placing each mouse in a clean cage with bedding but no toys or nesting material. After a 10 min habituation period, we quantified time spent in three spontaneous behaviors (locomoting, grooming, rearing) for a 10 min observation period. The prevalence of these behaviors did not differ between EN and NH mice, although EN mice showed a non-significant trend for more locomotor behavior (data not shown). Thus, general exploratory behavior during surgical recovery was roughly similar between NH and EN mice. Behavior in the home cage was not measured because enrichment objects and cage top obscured observation. Thus, surgical recovery was relatively fast and similar between NH and EN groups, and was a small fraction of total 35–40 day NH or EN duration before imaging (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>2-photon calcium imaging</title><p>Imaging took place 18 ± 4 days after virus injection for Drd3-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gong et al., 2007</xref>) and 34 ± 11 days after virus injection for Scnn1-Tg3-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik et al., 2012</xref>), as required for adequate GCaMP expression in L2/3 and L4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Imaging was performed once daily observation revealed stable numbers of fluorescent neurons with few or no neurons exhibiting nuclear expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tian et al., 2009</xref>). 2-photon imaging was performed using a Sutter Moveable-Objective Microscope with one resonant and one galvo scan mirror. We used a 16x, 0.8 NA water-dipping objective (Nikon). Excitation was delivered with a Coherent Chameleon Ti-Sapphire pulsed laser tuned to 920 nm. Fluorescence emission was filtered with a Chroma HQ 575/50 filter and detected with a Hamamatsu photomultiplier tube (H10770PA-40). Single Z-plane images (512 × 512 pixels) were collected at 30 Hz frame rate using ScanImage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pologruto et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Imaging was performed under low-dose isoflurane (&lt;1% in oxygen) combined with the sedative chlorprothixene (0.08 mg, i.p.), with body temperature stabilized at 37°C. L2/3 imaging fields were ~400 × 400 μm, located ~100–250 µm below the dura, and contained ~50–100 expressing neurons. In Scnn1a-Cre mice, smaller imaging fields were often used (~300 × 300 μm) to compensate signal-to-noise ratio for imaging depth.</p><p>nine whiskers in a 3 × 3 array centered on D2 were inserted into nine independent, calibrated piezoelectric actuators, positioned ~5 mm from the face. A plastic shield kept away nearby, non-stimulated whiskers. Whisker stimuli were presented as trains (five impulses, 100 ms apart) of individual deflections (300 µm rostrocaudal deflection, rise/fall time 4 ms, total duration 10 ms). Trains are necessary due to sparse spiking in L2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Kock et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barth and Poulet, 2012</xref>), and increase the likelihood of eliciting detectable GCaMP signals. We interleaved the nine whisker stimuli (5 s isi, random order) plus ‘blank’ trials in which no whisker was deflected. At each imaging field, 60 ± 10 repetitions of each whisker stimulus were presented, and imaging data was collected as approximately forty 80 s long movies. 1-2 fields were imaged in each mouse, several days apart.</p><p>After imaging was complete for all co-housed mice within a given cage, all mice in that cage were euthanized. The brain was removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for several days before the cortex was flattened and sectioned at 50 μm parallel to the cortical surface. Sections were processed for cytochrome oxidase to reveal the barrels in L4. Imaged neurons were localized relative to barrel column boundaries by alignment using surface blood vessels and Z-stacks of GCaMP expression collected during the imaging sessions, as well as by fiducial marks at the pial surface created by high-power laser scanning after imaging was complete. We used a custom MATLAB program to localize the centroids of the nine anatomical barrels that corresponded to the stimulated whiskers, and to calculate the X-Y coordinate of each ROI relative to these centroids.</p><p>Genetic expression of GCaMP is unlikely to affect basic L2/3 map development, because salt-and-pepper organization has also been observed with acute loading of OGB-1 AM, rather than genetic expression of GCaMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clancy et al., 2015</xref>). While GCaMP expression is commonly used to study cortical plasticity, we cannot rule out that GCaMP expression affects plasticity. Only 4% of cells in Drd3-Cre mice and 1.2% of cells in Scnn1a-Cre mice showed nuclear GCaMP fluorescence indicative of GCaMP overexpression, and were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell-attached recording</title><p>For simultaneous imaging and cell attached recordings, we injected a non-Cre-dependent GCaMP6s virus (AAV1-Syn-Flex-GCaMP6S-WPRE) at ~200 and ~300 µm below the dura at one stereotaxic location in S1. After allowing ~3 weeks for expression, a 2 mm diameter craniotomy was made over S1, as described for imaging experiments. Anesthesia and recording conditions were as described for imaging. We recorded juxtacellularly from GCaMP6s-expressing L2/3 neurons under 2-photon guidance using a recording pipette (3 µm tip, 3–5 MΩ) filled with fluorescent HEPES-buffered Ringers (in mM: 126 NaCl, 20 HEPES, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4, 14 D(+)Glucose, 50 AlexaFluor-594, pH 7.3, 290 mOsm). A loose seal configuration was obtained, and spike-associated currents were measured in voltage-clamp mode with holding potential adjusted to maintain a holding current of 0 pA. Spikes from the loose seal recording were collected simultaneous to GCaMP imaging. Whisker stimulation was as described for imaging experiments. Spikes occurring 0–100 ms after each whisker deflection were considered whisker-evoked for receptive field quantification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis</title><p>All data analysis was conducted in MATLAB using custom-written routines unless otherwise noted.

We did not observe substantial Z-axis motion. Fluorescence of each pixel was smoothed in time (moving median filter, four frames). Ellipsoid regions-of-interest (ROIs) were drawn manually over neuronal somata that appeared in all movies from an imaging field. The ROI signal was the mean fluorescence of its component pixels. For neuropil subtraction, a neuropil mask was created as a 10 pixel-wide ring beginning two pixels from the somatic ROI. Neuropil pixels that were correlated with any soma ROI (with r&gt;0.2) were removed from the neuropil mask. For L4 ROIs, mean fluorescence of the neuropil mask was scaled by 0.3 and subtracted from the raw somatic ROI fluorescence. For L2/3 ROIs, neuropil subtraction was not used in the main analysis, but is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>. Fluorescence time series of all ROIs were inspected manually to remove any movies in which mean brightness decreased &gt;~10% due to imaging errors (e.g., loss of meniscus under the objective lens). For each ROI, fluorescence time series were converted to ΔF/F defined as (F<sub>t</sub>-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, in which F<sub>0</sub> is the 20<sup>th</sup> percentile of fluorescence across the entire 80 s movie and F<sub>t</sub> is the fluorescence on each frame.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Quantification of whisker responses, receptive fields, and response magnitude</title><p>The whisker-evoked ΔF/F signal was quantified for each ROI on each trial as (mean ΔF/F in the 1 s period following whisker train onset) – (mean ΔF/F in the 0.5 s prior to the stimulus). Each cell’s 9-whisker receptive field was quantified from the median ΔF/F to each whisker across all stimulus repetitions. A ROI was considered significantly responsive to a given whisker if the distribution of evoked ΔF/F on whisker stimulus trials was significantly greater than on blank trials. This was computed using a permutation test: for each whisker, a vector of mean ΔF/F for each stimulus iteration was combined with mean ΔF/F for each blank trial (using the same frames as for measuring evoked activity). The combined distribution of means was split into two groups, and the difference in means of the two groups was measured. This was repeated 10,000 times, and the actual difference between the stimulus and blank distributions was compared to the distribution of permuted differences in means. A difference was considered significant if it was greater than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the permuted distribution. P values for each of the nine whiskers were corrected for multiple comparisons by False Discovery Rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). A ROI was considered whisker responsive if it was significantly responsive to at least one whisker above baseline activity. For L2/3 analysis, all whisker-responsive ROIs located within any of the nine columns corresponding to the stimulated whiskers were included. For L4 analysis, only responsive ROIs located within columns C1, C2, and C3 were included to ensure similar spatial sampling of the barrel field, since imaging field locations were less overlapping between EN and NH compared to L2/3.</p><p>For comparison of the magnitude of whisker-evoked responses across imaging fields, evoked ΔF/F was normalized to ΔF/F on blank trials. This was done by computing median evoked ΔF/F across all stimulus trials, and z-scoring to the distribution of ΔF/F on blank trials. This normalization enables comparisons across imaging fields and neurons with different levels of GCaMP expression, which yield different absolute fluorescence intensity and ΔF/F signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Quantification of L4 barrel size</title><p>To quantify barrel size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), the area of each barrel (C1:C3, D1:D3, E1:E3) was measured from the CO-stained tangential sections. Mean radius was calculated from the area, assuming circularity. Mean barrel size for each mouse was calculated as the mean across these nine barrels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>Normalized anatomical reference frame for spatial analysis across imaging fields</title><p>To combine imaging results across different imaging fields, ROI coordinates were transformed into a common reference frame. This was done by measuring XY position of each ROI relative to anatomical barrel centers, and rotating the coordinates for each imaging field around the column of interest to achieve the same anatomical orientation. Response or tuning measures for individual ROIs were plotted directly overlaid within this reference frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Alternatively, individually ROIs were spatially binned using k-means clustering so that each bin contained a similar number of ROIs, average response strength or tuning was computed for each bin, and the result was displayed as a Voronoi plot with each polygon representing a spatial bin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Signal and noise correlation analysis</title><p>Signal and noise correlation were computed between all pairs of simultaneously imaged, whisker-responsive neurons that were located within (for L4 cells) or above (for L2/3 cells) any L4 barrel. Cells located within or above L4 septa were not used for correlation analysis, to avoid ambiguity in localizing the precise barrel boundary. Thus, closely spaced cross-column cell pairs were located in adjacent barrel columns, not in column and adjacent septum. To compute signal correlation, we calculated for each ROI a 9-element vector composed of its mean response to each whisker over all stimulus repetitions. Each vector was individually Z-scored. Signal correlation was defined as the Pearson’s correlation of the vectors for a pair of neurons. To compute noise correlations, we constructed for each ROI, nine vectors (one for each whisker) containing the mean ΔF/F during the evoked window following each stimulus iteration. Each vector was individually z-scored. We computed the Pearson’s correlation for each pair of neurons separately for each whisker, then computed the mean correlation for all whiskers. Distance between neurons was calculated as the Euclidean distance (µm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6"><title>Neural decoder</title><p>We constructed neural decoders to detect a whisker deflection compared to spontaneous activity from single-trial mean ΔF/F of individual ROIs and ensembles of ROIs. Each ROI was represented by a nine binary classifiers – one per whisker – that were trained by logistic regression to report the probability of a stimulus given the mean ΔF/F during the evoked window following a single whisker deflection, selected randomly from each stimulus iteration (structured as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGuire et al., 2016</xref>). For each logistic function coefficients were fit by logistic regression and K-fold cross validation to relate the mean ΔF/F on each trial to the probability of given whisker having been deflected. Each iteration of model fitting was performed on 80% of trials (including the given whisker and blank trials), and performance was assessed on the remaining 20% of trials. For single ROI decoders, predictions were made by selecting the highest probability on a given trial. The fitting and testing process was repeated 500 times for each single ROI decoder, and performance was averaged across iterations.</p><p>For ensemble decoding, simultaneously-imaged ROIs were clustered into ensembles either randomly or based on position within the imaging field using k-means clustering. To sample a range of ensemble sizes and positions, clustering was performed for each field while varying the number of ensembles between two to as many ensembles as responsive ROIs. This was repeated separately for each whisker, and positions used for clustering were normalized relative to the reference whisker. This yielded ensemble sizes of 2:42, with 4242 ± 1400 total ensembles per NH field, and 9630 ± 1501 ensembles per EN field. For ensemble decoders composed of random sets of ROIs, we trained and tested ensemble decoders of 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 ROIs located within the same imaging field. For each ensemble size, we tested the lesser of 500 or N-choose-K ensembles (where N is the total number of responsive ROIs in the field and K is the ensemble size) randomly drawn from each imaging field. We used a maximum of 30 ROIs per field, in order to include as many imaging fields as possible in this analysis. To predict single-trial stimuli from ensembles, the output of each ROI classifier was normalized so that each unit had the same weight in population decoding. The population stimulus prediction was calculated by summing the probabilities of each trial type (stimulus or blank) over all units in an ensemble and selecting the trial type with the maximal summed probability.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the GENIE project (HHMI Janelia Research Campus) for GCaMP6s virus, and thank Paley Han for mouse colony management and Katherine Smith for experimental support.

The authors’ house mice either in enriched or normal home cages and assess response properties with 2-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. The authors find more sharply delineated functional columns and a higher degree of whisker selectivity as a result of enrichment. My views on the paper are the following:</p><p>1) This is a good study. Enrichment effects have been studied before in barrel cortex and other cortices, but the authors go well beyond, what has been done previously. The current study achieves this novel depth of analysis by 2-photon imaging and careful analysis of the data.</p><p>2) The authors’ should describe their enrichment procedures in more detail. In the current version of the manuscript these procedures mainly figure in just one subpanel. Having said that more detail on enrichment procedures should be provided, I would also like to add that I am not sure that the effects described here are a result of 'tactile enrichment'. If I got it right multiple parameters differed between enriched and non-enriched conditions (cagemates’ toys etc.). Since it is not clear which parameter drove the changes described here, it might be indicated to drop the term 'tactile' from the title.</p><p>3) It would be great if the authors could comment on the effects of enrichment on directional tuning. Such an analysis would be most welcome, because the organization of directional tuning in barrel cortex is controversial. I am not sure, however, if the authors’ stimulus design will allow such an analysis post hoc. If such an analysis is therefore not possible, I would not require a redo of the experiments to answer this question.</p><p>4) The authors might want to discuss more broadly and prominently the specifics of the transgenic mouse lines and the potential side effects of GCamp expression and transgenic procedures on their results. Thus, rather than merely referring to neurons as L4-cells it might be necessary to specify the Cre-line used for targeting.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper directly addresses a lurking, unproven hypothesis, that more diverse, natural and/or behaviorally-relevant vibrissal use increases the systematicity/smoothness of vibrissa map organization in L2/3. Whilst data from Polley et al., 2004 using an extreme enrichment environment somewhat implies this result, their methods did not allow for laminar precision, and the extremity of the conditions used made the findings inconsistent with implementation in typical barrier facilities. Also, that finding was in rats, a far less relevant model given current bias' in model animal selection for vibrissal studies, and some of the findings here directly disagree with conclusions in that study.</p><p>These present results are particularly important because this model is widely used to understand the connection between plasticity and brain organization. This finding impacts the interpretation of hundreds of prior papers, and will substantially change procedures used in subsequent studies (or, future authors will be required to indicate why they have not made such a change). The present results are also really nicely collected, analyzed and presented – put simply, they make an important finding easy to understand.</p><p>1) Did enriched mice survive the initial viral injection surgery more robustly than the non-enriched (probability of death or complications, rate of weight re-gain post-surgery, amount of time before being returned to the home cage and fellow mouse partners, anything else?) The amount of whisker use will directly relate to the health of the animal post-surgery, posing a potential confound unrelated to enrichment per se (except insofar as healthy mice are, well, healthy). I can imagine many kinds of data analysis and straightforward double-blinded surgery experiments that would satisfy this concern, but something specific should be done to address it.</p><p>2) Were the anatomical L4 barrels themselves different in any way? Diameter/size, smoothness of the wall, number or size of sub-zones (ala Land's work), anything else? The effects are interesting either way, but it is a major source of information in the existing data that could be robustly related (or, shown unimportant) to the functional changes.</p><p>3) Were the mice left solo after their cage mate was taken (and sacrificed) also used? If so, is there a relationship between map patency and how long after the removal of imaged mouse #1 that imaged mouse #2 was imaged? This might give at least a clue as to the import of social touch in the effects observed.</p><p>4) Z-scoring to baseline begs the question of whether there were differences in baseline activity levels (and, therefore, 'noise' in the estimate). Were there differences?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46321.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers agreed on the following key requests to be addressed in the revision:</p><p>1) Clarify the enrichment conditions (here, please make use of the generous space at eLife by including additional figures, or videos, and descriptions of the enrichment setting), and discuss beyond-tactile effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We now describe enrichment conditions in detail (Results and Materials and methods), including in new Figure 1—figure supplement 1.

This would ideally be supported by additional analyses / control data.</p></disp-quote><p>The first concern was whether GCaMP expression or transgenic procedures influenced the results (reviewer 1). We addressed this in several ways – by showing that GCaMP overexpression (i.e. nuclear expression) was very low; by pointing out that basic salt-and-pepper map topography has been observed without GCaMP by using non-genetic expression of OGB-1 AM; and by clearly presenting the mouse genetic backgrounds. While there are some differences in genetic background, both Drd3-Cre and Scnn1a-Cre lines are on primarily a C57BL/6 background, so we think that comparison of map topography between these lines is reasonable. See reviewer 1 point 4.</p><p>The second concern was whether there were differences in post-surgical health between enriched and normally housed mice, which could have led to altered exploration and thus different extents of use-dependent map sharpening (reviewer 2). We addressed this by quantifying surgical recovery in a new cohort of EN and NH mice. We now show that surgical recovery time was similar between EN and NH mice (4-5 days), and was brief compared to the total EN or NH exposure time (35-40 days). We also show that spontaneous behavior was similar between EN and NH groups during this surgical recovery period. This suggests that differences in surgical recovery are not responsible for the differences in map topography.

Since it is not clear which parameter drove the changes described here, it might be indicated to drop the term 'tactile' from the title.</p></disp-quote><p>We now describe enrichment in detail, both in the Results (subsection “Enrichment sharpens the point representation of a single whisker in L2/3”) and Materials an methods (subsection “Enrichment”), and we have added new Figure 1—figure supplement 1 that shows the enrichment toys and how they were combined in enriched cages, and shows example enriched and normally-housed cages.</p><p>We agree that enrichment constitutes more than just increased tactile experience, and that changes in the whisker map may be driven by a combination of sensory experience, increased social interactions, greater activity levels, and other factors. We now discuss this explicitly in Results: “This enriched environment will enhance not only tactile experience, but also social interaction, activity level, and other factors, all of which could drive cortical plasticity.” And in Discussion: “While enrichment promotes more diverse tactile experience, it also likely increases social interactions and affects general activity levels. Which of these factors is dominant in driving whisker map plasticity was not tested.”</p><p>To reflect the multi-faceted nature of enrichment, we have changed the title from effects of “tactile enrichment” to simply “enrichment”. This does not weaken the overall conclusions of the paper, which remain that salt-and-pepper, dispersed sensory maps partially reflect inadequate experience in rodent laboratory housing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be great if the authors could comment on the effects of enrichment on directional tuning. Such an analysis would be most welcome, because the organization of directional tuning in barrel cortex is controversial. I am not sure, however, if the authors’ stimulus design will allow such an analysis post hoc. If such an analysis is therefore not possible, I would not require a redo of the experiments to answer this question.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion, but unfortunately we did not apply different directions of whisker stimuli, so we cannot assess direction tuning in our data set. Prior papers on the direction map indicate that age and/or experience is critical to create a discernible direction map in L2/3, and a future study that clarifies this at single-cell resolution would be nice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors might want to discuss more broadly and prominently the specifics of the transgenic mouse lines and the potential side effects of GCamp expression and transgenic procedures on their results. Thus, rather than merely referring to neurons as L4-cells it might be necessary to specify the Cre-line used for targeting.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point which we had not emphasized enough in the first version. We now describe the transgenic mouse lines more completely, and discuss possible impacts of the transgenes and background strain differences on map organization. To emphasize to readers that L2/3 and L4 cells were defined by the Drd3-Cre and Scnn1a-Cre transgenes, rather than just by layers, we re-state at the beginning of each major Results section that L2/3 cells were from Drd3-Cre mice and L4 cells were from Scnna1-Cre mice.</p><p>Possible effects of background strain. Drd3-Cre mice were obtained from MMRRC on a mixed C57BL6/FVB background, and were crossed to C57BL/6 mice for several generations before generating the mice used in these experiments. Scnn1a-Cre mice were obtained on a C57BL/6 background from JAX and maintained on a C57BL/6 background. Thus the genetic backgrounds of both strains are similar (primarily C57BL/6). Drd3-Cre mice were slightly larger than Scnn1a-Cre mice, and had somewhat larger anatomical barrels (now shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2), indicating that some strain differences do exist. However, these differences in anatomical barrel size (by ~25 μm) were much smaller than the differences in point representation between L2/3 and L4 (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 1). To show the reader these differences (and that they were small in scale), we explicitly plot the mean anatomical barrel size overlaid on the functional maps in the key figures (Figure 2 all panels, Figure 5E-F).</p><p>Possible effects of transgenes. The Drd3-Cre transgene does not appear to strongly impact basic somatotopic map organization in L2/3, because we previously observed salt-and-pepper organization in L2/3 in wild-type C57BL/6 mice (Clancy et al., 2015) that was essentially identical to that observed here in Drd3-Cre mice. We do not know if the Scnn1a-Cre transgene perturbs L4 map organization. We now discuss these issues explicitly in Materials and methods (subsection “Animals”). The Discussion also now states the key premise in this study design: “This comparison between L4 and L2/3 assumes that Drd3-Cre and Scnn1a-Cre mice have overall similar somatotopic map organization.”</p><p>Possible side effects of GCaMP expression. We previously observed salt-and-pepper organization in L2/3 using acute loading of OGB-1 AM, rather than GCaMP (Clancy et al., 2015). Thus, basic map organization is not an artifact of GCaMP expression. While it is possible that GCaMP expression impacts plasticity, GCaMP expression is commonly used in cortical plasticity studies. Only 4% of cells in Drd3-Cre mice and 1.2% of cells in Scnn1a-Cre mice showed nuclear GCaMP fluorescence indicative of GCaMP overexpression, and were excluded from analysis. Thus, GCaMP overexpression was not a major problem in this study. We now discuss these issues in Materials and methods (subsection “2-photon calcium imaging”).</p><p>Overall, these issues are now discussed much more clearly, and while some strain differences may be present, we don’t think these account for the functional differences in whisker maps between layers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) Did enriched mice survive the initial viral injection surgery more robustly than the non-enriched (probability of death or complications, rate of weight re-gain post-surgery, amount of time before being returned to the home cage and fellow mouse partners, anything else?) The amount of whisker use will directly relate to the health of the animal post-surgery, posing a potential confound unrelated to enrichment per se (except insofar as healthy mice are, well, healthy). I can imagine many kinds of data analysis and straightforward double-blinded surgery experiments that would satisfy this concern, but something specific should be done to address it.</p></disp-quote><p>Surgical morbidity and mortality were low and equivalent between NH and EN groups. Including all mice (even those with cloudy cranial windows or low GCaMP expression, where imaging could not be performed), 5.5% of NH mice and 4.8% of EN mice had post-surgical mortality. No mice had morbidity sufficient to remove them from the study. Immediate post-surgical recovery from anesthesia was fast, with mice returned to the home cage within ~ 1 hr post-surgery, once they recovered posture and locomotion. This immediate recovery appeared similar between NH and EN groups.</p><p>Slower phases of surgical recovery were quantified in a new cohort of 6 NH mice and 6 EN mice. These mice received standard headplate and cranial window surgery, but not viral injection. NH and EN mice recovered to pre-surgical weight within 4 and 5.5 days, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). The slight delay for EN mice may reflect difficulty learning to navigate the enriched environment while carrying imaging headgear. We examined general exploratory behavior during this recovery period by placing each mouse, daily, in a clean cage with bedding but no toys or nesting material. After a 10-min habituation period, we quantified time spent in 3 spontaneous behaviors (locomoting, grooming, and rearing) for a 10 min observation period. The prevalence of these behaviors did not differ between EN and NH mice, although EN mice showed a non-significant trend for more locomotor behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). Behavior in the home cage could not be quantified because enrichment objects and the cage top obscured observation. Thus, these measurements suggest that exploratory behavior during the recovery period was roughly similar between EN and NH mice.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46321.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of surgical recovery between NH and EN mice.</title><p>Data are from a new cohort of 6 NH and 6 EN mice, all C57BL/6 wild-types.

We explicitly report that the duration of surgical recovery (4-5.5 days) was brief relative to the total duration of NH or EN before imaging (35-40 days, Table 1). Overall, we believe that surgical recovery was short enough, and similar enough between NH and EN groups, that whisker map changes are more likely attributable to the NH or EN environment, rather to differences in surgical recovery per se in that in environment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Were the anatomical L4 barrels themselves different in any way? Diameter/size, smoothness of the wall, number or size of sub-zones (ala Land's work), anything else? The effects are interesting either way, but it is a major source of information in the existing data that could be robustly related (or, shown unimportant) to the functional changes.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question, especially because Polley et al., 2004 reported subtle enlargement of L4 barrels using a vigorous enrichment paradigm in adult rats. To test if a similar effect occurred in our mice, we analyzed flattened tangential CO-stained sections from all mice in which all 9 barrel columns (C1:C3, D1:D3, E1:E3) had been sampled. We calculated the radius of each barrel. Enrichment did not alter mean barrel radius in either Drd3-Cre mice or Scnn1a-Cre mice. This is now reported in Results (subsection “Enrichment sharpens the point representation of a single whisker in L2/3”, last paragraph), and new Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><p>We did not analyze wall smoothness or sub-barrel patterns (Land), because in our hands they could not be reliably enough visualized or quantified. Please note that Land and Erickson (J. Comp. Neurol. 2005) report that mice lack sub-barrel structures, unlike rats. Thus, the functional changes that we observed in the whisker map occurred without gross changes in barrel anatomy, although we cannot rule out subtle structural plasticity not observable in average CO staining patterns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Were the mice left solo after their cage mate was taken (and sacrificed) also used? If so, is there a relationship between map patency and how long after the removal of imaged mouse #1 that imaged mouse #2 was imaged? This might give at least a clue as to the import of social touch in the effects observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not remove cage mates, because we wanted to maintain a constant social environment over the duration of the experiment. Instead, when one co-housed mouse was finished with imaging, it remained in the shared cage until all mice in that cage were finished with imaging. Then all mice were sacrificed and processed for histology. This is now stated in Results (subsection “2-photon calcium imaging”). We agree it would be interesting to examine the impact of social touch in particular on enrichment effects, but we don’t have the data to do this here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Z-scoring to baseline begs the question of whether there were differences in baseline activity levels (and, therefore, 'noise' in the estimate). Were there differences?</p></disp-quote><p>We reported in Figure 4C that spontaneous activity (measured as median ΔF/F on blank trials) was decreased in L2/3 of EN mice relative to NH mice. In response to this reviewer comment, we tested whether the reduction in spontaneous activity could fully explain the increase in CW-evoked response magnitude or sharpening of whisker receptive fields, both of which were quantified in Figure 4A-B as whisker-evoked ΔF/F Z-scored to spontaneous activity. In the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1, we analyze response magnitude and receptive field sharpness using absolute ΔF/F, not Z-scored to spontaneous. By comparing mean absolute ΔF/F to the 4 strongest and 4 weakest whiskers for each neuron, we found that the mean response to the 4 strongest whiskers was greater in EN than NH mice, and the slope relating strongest- to weakest-whisker responses was greater in EN mice (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Thus, EN increases CW-response magnitude and sharpens receptive fields without Z-scoring to spontaneous.</p><p>Z-scoring to spontaneous provides a convenient measure of ‘signal-to-noise’ for sensory responses, and helps normalize for varying GCaMP expression levels across cells. Our presentation of Z-scored measures of responsiveness and tuning in Figure 4A-B is designed to estimate signal-to-noise in sensory coding. The neural decoders (Figure 7) test explicitly whether signal-to-noise is improved in EN mice, by predicting presence or absence of a whisker deflection from single-trial absolute (non-Z-scored) ΔF/F from either whisker stimulus trials or blank trials. The decoder analysis showed enhanced ability to detect CW deflection vs. blank from EN mice (Figure 7C), with a spatial profile (Figure 7D) that is consistent with the mean tuning changes reported in Figure 4B. Thus, our results are internally consistent, and show that EN both modestly increases absolute CW-evoked ΔF/F and reduces spontaneous activity, and that together these increase signal-to-noise of the sensory code to improve stimulus detection.</p></body></sub-article></article>
