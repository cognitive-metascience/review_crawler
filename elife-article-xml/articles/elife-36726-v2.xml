The γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory transmitter in the adult brain. However, in rodents, at fetal and postnatal stages, GABA induces a membrane depolarization due to elevated intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Ari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sulis Sato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Owens and Kriegstein, 2002</xref>). During the second postnatal week of life, the functional expression of the chloride extruder, K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> type 2 co-transporter (KCC2), causes [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to decrease and consequently shifts the chloride-dependent GABAergic responses towards a more hyperpolarized value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rivera et al., 2015</xref>). This developmental sequence is likely shifted toward fetal life in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Kriegstein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sedmak et al., 2016</xref>). Rodent studies showed that defective chloride homeostasis plays a role in phenotypes associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tyzio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2014</xref>), Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El-Khoury et al., 2014</xref>), Down syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deidda et al., 2015</xref>) and Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dargaei et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, pharmacological manipulations aimed at restoring low [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>i</sub> improve neurological symptoms in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tyzio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deidda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dargaei et al., 2018</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemonnier et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, unveiling the mechanisms controlling the schedule of the GABA developmental sequence is decisive to identify molecular targets to correct abnormal developmental trajectories.</p><p>Leptin is a 16 kDa cytokine produced and secreted mainly by the adipose tissue. In the adult, leptin regulates body weight and reproduction acting on specific hypothalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahima and Flier, 2000</xref>). However, rodent studies show that leptin can act beyond this classical role and may function as a neurotrophic signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouret, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harvey, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guimond et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briffa et al., 2015</xref>). In both humans and rodents leptin levels surge during intense period of neuronal growth and synaptogenesis. Leptin levels remain elevated in children with early onset ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rodrigues et al., 2014</xref>), Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blardi et al., 2009</xref>) and Fragile X syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lisik et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, maternal obesity which is associated with hyperleptinemia heightens the risk of ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rivera et al., 1999</xref>). These observations suggest that excess leptin early in life may play a role in neuropsychiatric disorders in humans.</p><p>Here, we examined how leptin impacts the GABAergic developmental sequence in the rodent hippocampus. We provide evidence that leptin controls the depolarizing-to-hyperpolarizing GABA switch during postnatal development and that maternal obesity associated with hyperleptinemia delays the GABA switch in offspring.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Advanced onset of GABAergic inhibition in leptin-receptor deficient mice</title><p>We first compared the efficacy of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor signaling in newborn long-form leptin-receptor (LepRb, the only leptin receptor able to activate intracellular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahima and Flier, 2000</xref>) deficient (<italic>db</italic>/<italic>db</italic>) and wild type (wt) mice. To this aim we obtained non-invasive loose cell attached recordings of CA3 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices from <italic>db/db</italic> and wt littermates and investigated the effect of bath application of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist isoguvacine (10 µM, 2 min) on their neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with the known depolarizing action of GABA in the newborn hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Ari et al., 2007</xref>), isoguvacine increased the firing of wt CA3 pyramidal neurons from P1 to P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Remarkably, in <italic>db</italic>/<italic>db</italic> mice, the excitatory action of isoguvacine was only observed at P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As early as P3, isoguvacine decreased the firing of the CA3 pyramidal <italic>db/db</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At P15, the effect of isoguvacine on the firing of the CA3 pyramidal neurons was similar in wt and <italic>db/db</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Next to determine whether the depolarizing-to-hyperpolarizing GABA developmental sequence was affected, we investigated the reversal potential of evoked GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents (eGABA<sub>A</sub>-PSCs) in <italic>db</italic>/<italic>db</italic> and wt littermates from P1 to P20 using gramicidin perforated voltage-clamp recording to prevent disruption of intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>i</sub>). GABA<sub>A</sub>-PSCs were evoked in the presence of the glutamatergic receptor antagonists; NBQX (5 µM) and D-APV (40 µM) while voltage clamping the neurons at various potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In wt CA3 neurons, the reversal potential of eGABA<sub>A</sub>-PSCs (E<sub>GABA</sub>) shifted from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing values during the second postnatal week of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In <italic>db</italic>/<italic>db</italic> neurons, this shift occurred earlier, few days after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, at P3 E<sub>GABA</sub> was −38 ± 8 mV in wt and −64 ± 3 mV in <italic>db</italic>/<italic>db</italic> neurons, p=0.023, two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t-test</italic>). In contrast the membrane potential at zero current was similar between wt and <italic>db/db</italic> neurons at all age investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

We found that circulating leptin levels were low at birth in wt, rose to a peak by the end of the first postnatal week and declined to low levels during the third postnatal week of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, this developmental profile of leptin levels paralleled the developmental difference in E<sub>GABA</sub> observed between wt and <italic>db/db</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Therefore, leptin levels surge during a critical developmental window in wt mice, and E<sub>GABA</sub> is impaired during this critical window in <italic>db</italic>/<italic>db</italic> mice. However, correlation does not mean causality. To address this point we used, newborn leptin-deficient (<italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic>) mice. We found that <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice also exhibit an advanced emergence of GABAergic inhibition in vivo, an effect partially restored by subcutaneous recombinant leptin injections to mimic the leptin surge occurring in wt mice in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Altogether, these data show that leptin surge controls chloride homeostasis and the emergence of functional GABAergic inhibition in vivo.</p><p>The developmental switch in GABA polarity is mainly due to the functional expression of KCC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Medina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rivera et al., 1999</xref>). We therefore assessed mRNA expression of this Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter in wt and <italic>db</italic>/<italic>db</italic> mice at P6 using quantitative qRT-PCR from isolated hippocampi. KCC2 mRNA levels were enhanced in <italic>db/db</italic> hippocampi compared to wt (from 1.6 ± 0.1 in wt to 2.6 ± 0.3 in <italic>db/db</italic> mice, n = 6 for both, p=0.038, two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, not shown). In contrast, NKCC1 mRNA levels were not altered (1.1 ± 0.2 and 1.2 ± 0.2 in respectively wt and <italic>db/db</italic> mice, n = 6 for both, p=0.7, two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, not shown). To determine whether increased mRNA levels results in increased expression of KCC2, we assessed KCC2 protein levels in P6 hippocampi by western blotting. KCC2 protein expression was up-regulated in <italic>db/db</italic> hippocampi compared to wt (+33 ± 6%, n = 6 wt and 5 db/db hippocampi, p=0.02 two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, Figure 3F). Immuno-labeling confirmed that KCC2 protein expression was up-regulated in <italic>db/db</italic> hippocampi at P6 compared to wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To address this point, we first evaluated the effect of a transient exposure to leptin (100 nM, 24 hr) on Cl<sup>-</sup> homeostasis on immature hippocampal cultures (6 DIV) when KCC2 activity is low, and in more mature cultures (15 DIV) when KCC2 activity is high and GABA had switched to hyperpolarized values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedel et al., 2015</xref>). Using gramicidin perforated voltage-clamp recordings, we assessed the reversal potential of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated currents (E<sub>GABA</sub>) induced by brief focal applications of isoguvacine in the presence of the NKCC1 blocker bumetanide (10 µM), to exclude cross regulation between the 2 co-transporters. We found that leptin treatment had no effect on E<sub>GABA</sub> in immature neurons (E<sub>GABA</sub> = −61 ± 1 mV in control (19 neurons) and −61 ± 2 mV in leptin-treated (19 neurons) cultures, 3 cultures for both, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), but induced a depolarizing shift of isoguvacine currents from −99 ± 2 mV in control (21 neurons) to −85 ± 2 mV in leptin-treated (13 neurons) cultures (6 cultures for both, p=0.001, ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

We show that leptin exposure of hippocampal cultures leads to a depolarizing shift of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated responses and down-regulates KCC2 expression and membrane stability. Furthermore, in the absence of leptin signaling, hippocampal neurons show an early expression of KCC2 and an advanced development of GABAergic inhibition in vivo. Conversely, excess leptin down regulates the expression of KCC2 and delays the emergence of GABAergic inhibition in vivo. Previous studies have reported that the GABA switch is delayed in mice lacking oxytocin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tyzio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leonzino et al., 2016</xref>) or the thyroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friauf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sawano et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the functional maturation of GABAergic synapses depends on an optimal and timely balance level of hormones that accelerate (oxytocin, thyroid hormones) or retard (leptin) the GABA switch.</p><p>We have shown that leptin regulates the activity of KCC2 at the transcriptional and post-translational levels in vivo. The downstream pathway linking the long-form leptin receptor b (LepRb) and the functional expression of KCC2 remains to be elucidated. However, our data suggest that early in development, leptin surge promotes the phosphorylation of the threonine 906 and 1007 (T906/T1007) residues of KCC2 and reduces its membrane expression and activity via a WNK1-dependent pathway. This pathway seems to be quite specific in mediating leptin action, as we did not detect any changes in the phosphorylation of Ser940, a residue phosphorylated/dephosphorylated under other circumstances via protein kinase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). As development progresses, when leptin levels return to low level, the WNK1-dependent inhibitory action of KCC2 activity is removed allowing the depolarizing-to-hyperpolarizing transition of GABA actions in the developing rodent hippocampus. Our model is supported by several lines of evidence obtained in vitro. We have shown that genetic silencing or activation of WNK1, respectively, prevents or occludes the effect of leptin on E<sub>GABA</sub>. Moreover, we have shown that leptin treatment does not affect E<sub>GABA</sub> in immature cultured neurons, at a developmental stage when the activity of KCC2 is low and the activity of the WNK-pathway is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedel et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, we have shown that leptin enhances the phosphorylation of the T906/T1007 residues of KCC2, promotes the endocytosis of KCC2 and decreases its membrane expression. Of note, WNK1-regulated de-phosphorylation of the T906/1007 residues of KCC2 contributes to the depolarizing-to-hyperpolarizing GABA sequence in the developing hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inoue et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedel et al., 2015</xref>). Alanine substitutions of the T906/T1007 residues within the C-terminus of KCC2, mimicking a dephosphorylated state of KCC2, yield to hyperpolarized reversal potentials of GABA in neuronal cultures, ranging between −90 to −100 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Titz et al., 2015</xref>), that is the same order of magnitude to the values observed in <italic>db/db</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, the lack of leptin signaling in <italic>db/db</italic> and <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice may prevent the developmental WNK1-regulated changes in T906/T1007 KCC2 phosphorylation in vivo, thereby leading to an advanced emergence of GABA inhibition in the newborn rodent hippocampus.</p><p>Rodent studies show that the ability of GABA to depolarize immature neurons plays an essential role in the assembly of functional networks during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Ari et al., 2012</xref>).

This seems in contradiction with the classical satiety function of leptin since during pregnancy nutriments availability should be enhanced to optimize fetal growth. However, animal studies suggest the existence of a pregnancy-induced leptin resistance of the mother’s brain and accumulating evidence indicate that leptin has numerous actions before birth on fetal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briffa et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, leptin deficiency in this period is associated with long term consequences such as cognitive defects, anxiety, and depression. Conversely, leptin replacement alleviates these symptoms, suggesting that leptin is a crucial factor in brain development and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rivera et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, during pregnancy, leptin may act beyond its classical satiety role and operates as an important developmental signal of fetal brain development.</p><p>Our data also indicate that excess leptin delays the GABA switch in offspring. Defective chloride homeostasis primes the brain to malfunction contributing to autistic-like phenotypes associated with neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tyzio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deidda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, it is noticeable that bumetanide treatment, that restores low [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>I</sub> and alleviates autistic-like symptoms in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tyzio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2016</xref>), also improves the symptoms of ASD in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemonnier et al., 2017</xref>). The ability of leptin to regulate chloride homeostasis may therefore have important implications not only in health, but also in the emergence of neurological disorders associated with abnormal GABAergic transmission. ASD are often associated with higher levels of leptin in circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rodrigues et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rodrigues et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lisik et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, maternal obesity which is associated with hyperleptinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Valleau and Sullivan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tessier et al., 2013</xref>) increases the risk of developing mental and behavioral disorders in offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rivera et al., 2015</xref>), such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), ASD, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and impairments in cognition, which among many modifications, are associated with altered GABAergic transmission. Animal models of maternal high-fat diet-induced obesity also document persistent changes in offspring behavior such as hyperactivity, impairments in social behavior, depressive-like behaviors and diminished cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rivera et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, optimal levels of leptin are critical during development for a timely emergence of GABAergic inhibition. Epidemiological studies showed that the prevalence of obesity among childbearing age women has steadily increased during the past 20 years in most developed nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An and Xiang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flegal et al., 2012</xref>). Leptin thus lies at the crossroad between neurological, metabolic and nutritional disorders that may arise from societal changes in lifestyle, stress level and eating behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(M. <italic>musculus</italic>)</td><td>B6.Cg-Lepob/J</td><td>The Jackson <break/>Laboratory</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000632">IMSR_JAX:000632</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(M. <italic>musculus</italic>)</td><td>B6.BKS-Leprdb</td><td>The Jackson <break/>Laboratory</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000697">IMSR_JAX:000697</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected <break/>DNA construct</td><td>shLepR 3426</td><td>PMID:24877561, <break/>DOI: 10.1210/me.2013–1332</td><td/><td>Dr. G.

Control experiments were performed on wild type (wt) littermates. Animals were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with a 12 light/dark cycle and free access to food and water. Mice were genotyped following the Jackson Laboratory genotyping protocol (strains B6.Cg-Lep<sup>ob</sup>/J, ID 000632 and B6.BKS-Lepr<sup>db</sup>, ID 000697). For each experiment, tissues from littermate wt and KO mice were prepared and the persons assessing and quantifying the outcomes were blinded to the genotype of the mice.</p><p>To assess the effect of maternal obesity, 8 weeks old C57BL/6 females were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% kcal from fat, D12492, Research Diet) or a normal diet (ND, 10% kcal from fat, D12450B, Research Diet) during 6 weeks at the end of which they were weighed and mated.

Quantification of endogenous leptin was performed with Mouse Leptin ELISA Kit (BioVendor R and D) in the concentrated solutions following the manufacturer’s protocol. The measured concentration of samples was calculated from the standard curve and expressed as ng/ml.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Hippocampal slice preparation and electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Brains were removed and immersed into ice-cold (2–4°C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) with the following composition (in mM): 126 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 11 glucose, pH 7.4 equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Hippocampal slices (600 µm thick) were cut with a McIlwain tissue chopper (Campden Instruments Ltd.) and kept in ACSF at room temperature (25°C) for at least one hour before recording. Slices were then transferred to a submerged recording chamber perfused with oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) ACSF (3 ml/min) at 34°C.</p><p>E<sub>GABA</sub> measurement: Perforated patch-clamp recordings were made from CA3 pyramidal neurons using an axopatch 200B (Axon Instrument) or Multiclamp 700B (Molecular devices) amplifier. Glass recording electrodes had resistances of 4–7 MΩ when filled with KCl solution containing 150 mM KCl and 10 mM HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with Tris-OH. The pipettes were tip filled with a gramicidin-free KCl solution and then backfilled with the same solution containing gramicidin A (50 µg/ml, diluted from a 50 mg/ml stock solution in DMSO). After the access resistance had dropped (40 to 80 MΩ) and stabilized (15–30 min), a current-voltage relationship was constructed by measuring the peak amplitude of averaged evoked GABAergic synaptic current (3 single sweeps) at different holding potentials in 10 mV increment recorded in the presence of glutamatergic receptor antagonists (NBQX 5 µM and D-APV 40 µM). Measurements were not corrected for the liquid junction potentials. A linear regression was used to calculate the best-fit line of the voltage dependence of the synaptic currents. Spontaneous rupture into whole-cell was evidenced by large inward synaptic currents due to E<sub>Cl</sub> of 0 mV.</p><p>Isoguvacine effect on neuronal firing: Loose cell attached patch clamp recordings were performed from CA3 pyramidal neurons using an axopatch 200B (Axon Instrument) with glass electrodes (4–7 MΩ) filled with KCl solution containing 150 mM KCl and 10 mM HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with Tris-OH. After a baseline period of at least 10 min in the presence of NBQX (5 µM) and D-APV (40 µM), isoguvacine (10 µM) was bath applied for 2 min. The effect of isoguvacine was quantified as the mean frequency of action potential following application of isoguvacine (4–8 min) versus baseline frequency (−10–0 min). Synaptic activity was recorded with Axoscope software version 8.1 (Axon Instruments) and analyzed offline with Mini Analysis Program version 6.0 (Synaptosoft).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Whole hippocampi were obtained from P5-6 mice as described above. Hippocampi were homogenized in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8, containing proteinases and phosphatases inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche). Lysates were centrifuged (1.000 g for 10 min at 4°C) and the supernatant was heated at 90°C for 5 min with Laemmli loading buffer. Loading was 20 µg of proteins as determined using a BCA protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were separated in 7–15% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 2 hr at RT, then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBST containing 3% BSA overnight at 4°C or 2 hr at RT. Blots were probed with antibody against KCC2 (1:2000; rabbit, US Biological) and tubulin (1:10.000; ß-tubulin, mouse, Sigma). After washing with TBST, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in TBST containing 3% BSA for 60 min, washed with TBST, and then developed using the G:BOX gel imaging system (Syngene). Expression levels were estimated by ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Real-time qRT-PCR</title><p>Whole hippocampi were obtained from P6 mice as described above. RNA was isolated and quantified by reading the absorbance at 260 nm (NanoPhotometer, IMPLEN) using Mini RNeasy kit (Qiagen), then converted to cDNA using 1 µg RNA and a QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. PCR was carried out with the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche Applied Science) with 1 µL cDNA using the following oligonucleotides (QuantiTect Primer Assays, Qiagen): NKCC1 (Slc12a2; QT00197785), KCC2 (Slc12a5; QT00145327) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, QT001199633). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with a Roche LC480 Light Cycler (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Relative mRNA values were calculated using the LC480 software and GAPDH as the housekeeping gene. PCR was performed in replicate of 3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immuno-staining</title><p>Brains were removed from P6 mice and fixed overnight at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were rinsed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, 0.1M) and coronal sections (70 µM thick) were obtained using a vibratome (Microm HVM 650V). Section were incubated first for 1 hr in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.3% Triton X-100, then overnight at 4°C with a rabbit anti-panKCC2 primary antibody (1:4000; non commercial, gift from Dr. C. Rivera). Sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated for 2 hr with an Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000, FluoProbes). Sections were counterstained for Nissl bodies, rinsed in PBS and mounted on microscope slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector). Immuno-reactivity was visualized using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510 Meta, Zeiss) with a 20X air objective and a 63X oil immersion objective. Optical sections were digitized (1024 × 1024 pixels) and processed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). Analysis of the intensity of the distribution of KCC2 fluorescence was performed at high magnification (×63 objective) using the Image J program. The same straight line length (3 µm) was applied from the nucleus to the external cell compartment. The Plot profile values were analyzed and we normalized the fluorescence intensity to the highest intensity of the control condition. The intensity of KCC2 staining in neuronal cells was expressed as the mean ratio of KCC2/Neurotracer staining intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Primary cultures, transfection of rat hippocampal neurons, electrophysiological recordings, live cell immuno-labelling, immuno-staining and immunoprecipitation with phosphorylation site–specific antibodies</title><p>Hippocampi from 18-day-old rat embryos were dissected and dissociated using trypsin (0.05%) and plated at a density of 70,000 cells cm−2 in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% Nu-Serum (BD Biosciences), 0.45% glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (10 IU ml−1) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2014</xref>). On days 7, 10, and 13 of culture incubation (DIV, days in vitro), half of the medium was changed to MEM with 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen). For electrophysiology neuronal cultures were plated on coverslips placed in 35 mm culture dishes. Twenty-four hours before plating, dishes with coverslips were coated with polyethylenimine (5 mg/ml).</p><p>For the analysis of KCC2 immuno-staining, KCC2-GFP clusters and electrophysiological experiments, pyramidal neurons were selected based on their morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benson et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings were performed at 23–24°C as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedel et al., 2015</xref>) (details are in supporting information). Series resistance was monitored routinely at a Vh of −80 mV with 5 mV hyperpolarizing pulses, typically taking 10 to 15 min for the series resistance to stabilize at 15 to 60 MΩ). Data were low pass–filtered at 2 kHz and acquired at 10 kHz. Isoguvacine (30 mM) was focally applied (50 to 150 ms, 10,000 to 30,000 Pa) to the neuron soma and proximal dendrites through a micropipette connected to a Picospritzer (General Valve Corporation). Isoguvacine responses were recorded at voltages −120,–100, −80, and −60 mV. A linear regression was used to calculate the best-fit line of the voltage dependence of the synaptic currents. For analysis of Cl<sup>-</sup> extrusion kinetic all neurons were overloaded with identical amount of [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>i</sub> resulting in E<sub>GABA</sub>=-40 mV (~30 mM of [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>i</sub>). This was achieved by repetitive three-pulse applications of isoguvacine (100 ms pulses with interval 500 ms) at 0 mV followed by a single isoguvacine application (100 ms) at −40 mV until disappearance of the outwardly directed isoguvacine-induced current at −40 mV. This later corresponded to E<sub>GABA</sub>=-40 mV. 20 s after the loading protocol, a pair of 100 ms isoguvacine pulses at −40 mV and −80 mV (interval 500 ms) was applied every 10 s to monitor the E<sub>GABA</sub>. For quantification of Cl<sup>-</sup> extrusion kinetic, E<sub>GABA</sub> at each time point was first normalized to the mean control, pre-loading E<sub>GABA</sub> values. These normalized values were then normalized to the normalized E<sub>GABA</sub> obtained 20 s after the loading protocol (−49 ± 2 mV for control experiments, n = 7 neurons, 3 cultures).</p><p>For transfection of cultures growing in 35 mm dishes, 300 ml of Opti-MEM was mixed with 7 ml of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahima and Flier, 2000</xref> (Invitrogen), 1 ml of Magnetofection CombiMag (OZ Biosciences), and 1 to 1.5 mg of different pcDNAs premixed in desired proportions. The mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and thereafter distributed dropwise above the neuronal culture. Culture dishes were placed on a magnetic plate (OZ Biosciences) and incubated for 30 to 35 min at 37°C. Transfection was terminated by the substitution of 90% of the incubation solution with fresh culture medium. The experiments were based on cotransfection into the same cell of two different pcDNAs encoding a fluorescent marker of transfection (eGFP, 0.3 µg), shRNAs (1.2 µg) against leptin receptor or WNK1, scrambled shRNAs or WNK1 construct. We used two shRNAs targeting different regions on the LepRb gene. The efficacy of these shRNAs has been tested in a previous study on human kidney cells and cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhar et al., 2014</xref>). The efficacy of the WNK1 construct and shRNA has been tested in a previous study in PC-12 and N2a cell line and cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For immunocytochemistry on living neurons, rabbit anti-GFP antibody was diluted in culture medium and applied to neurons for 2 hr at 37°C, 5% CO2. Neurons were then rinsed three times for 10 min at room temperature with Hepes-buffered saline solution containing 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2.0 mM MgCl2, 2.0 mM CaCl2, 20 mM Hepes, and 10 mM D-glucose (pH 7.4), labeled with anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibody (dissolved in the Hepes buffered saline) for 20 min at 13°C and fixed in Antigenfix (Diapath). To reveal intracellular pool of live-labelled proteins, cells were subsequently permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, blocked by 5% goat serum and incubated during 1 hr at room temperature (RT) with anti-rabbit Alexa 647-conjugated antibody. Then, for visualization of the entire pool of overexpressed KCC2-pH<sub>ext</sub> cells were labeled overnight (4°C) with mouse anti-GFP antibody and for 1 hr at RT with anti-mouse Alexa 488-conjugated antibody. For control of the cell integrity during live-cell immunolabelling, one batch of cultures were routinely transfected with KCC2 construct harboring phluorine tag linked to the intracellular N-terminus of the transporter.</p><p>Images of labeled cells were acquired with an Olympus Fluorview-500 confocal microscope (oil-immersion objectives 40x, (NA1.0) or 60x (NA1.4); zoom 1–5). We randomly selected and focused on a transfected cell by only visualizing Alexa-488 fluorescence and then acquired Z-stack images of Alexa-488, CY3 and Alexa-647 fluorochromes emitted fluorescence using, respectively green (excitation 488 nm, emission 505–525 nm), red (excitation 543 nm emission 560–600 nm) and infra-red (excitation 633, emission &gt;660 nm) channels of the microscope. Each Z-stack included 10 planes of 1 µm optical thickness and taken at 0.5 µm distance between planes. The cluster properties and fluorescence intensities of each cell were analyzed with Metamorph software. First, we used the logical ‘NOT’ conversion of pairs of Alexa-647 and CY3 images to isolate in each focal plane the Alexa-647 signal that was not overlapping with CY3 fluorescence restricted to plasma membrane. This gave rise to additional images reflecting the fluorescence of the internalized pool of labeled clusters, called thereafter ‘NOT-conversion’. Second, the arithmetic summation for each Z-stack and channel was performed to collect the whole fluorescence of the different signals (Alexa-488 = total protein fluorescence; CY3 = plasma membrane restricted fluorescence; NOT-conversion = internalized restricted fluorescence; Alexa-647 = all surface labeled fluorescence). Third, a binary mask was created for each cell from Alexa-488 image to isolate the signal coming from the transfected neuron, and the fluorescence parameters (total fluorescence, single cluster fluorescence as well as density and brightness of clusters) were analyzed for each channel (Alexa-488, CY3, NOT-conversion and Alexa-647) in regions overlapping with the binary mask. The analysis parameters were the same for each experiment and all experiments were done blind. After analysis, data were normalized to the mean value of cells transfected with KCC2-pHext + scrambled shRNA.</p><p>For immuno-staining, hippocampal cultures (75,000 cells/cm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An and Xiang, 2016</xref>), DIV 14) were fixed in 4% PFA-sucrose for 10 min. Coverslips were washed in PBS for 15 min and incubated in 0.2 M glycine for 10 min. Blocking was done in 1% BSA/0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min to permeabilize cells and reduce nonspecific binding. Cultures were washed and incubated with a rabbit anti-panKCC2 (1:4000; non commercial, gift from Dr. C. Rivera) coupled to chicken anti-MAP2 (1:2000, Microtubule-associated protein 2, Sigma) antibodies in PBS overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies were visualized after staining with the appropriate goat anti-rabbit and anti-donkey IgG conjugated to Cy3 (1:1000, chemicon) and Alexa488 (1:1000, FluoProbes), respectively in 1% BSA/PBS for 60 min. Cultures were washed and coverslips mounted using Vectashield (Vector). Sequential acquisition of immunoreactivity was visualized using laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta) with a x63 oil-immersion objective. In each image, laser light levels and detector gain and offset were adjusted to avoid any saturated levels. Confocal micrographs are digital composites of a Z-series scan of 4–6 optical sections through a depth of 4–5 µm.</p><p>For the immunoprecipitation with phosphorylation site–specific antibodies, KCCs phosphorylated at the KCC2 Thr906 and Thr1007 equivalent residue were immuno-precipitated from clarified control and leptin (100 nM, 24 hr) treated-hippocampal culture lysates (centrifuged at 16,000 g at 4°C for 20 min) using phosphorylation site–specific antibody coupled to protein G–Sepharose. The phosphorylation site–specific antibody was coupled with protein G–Sepharose at a ratio of 1 mg of antibody per 1 ml of beads in the presence of lysate (20 mg/ml) to which the corresponding nonphosphorylated peptide had been added. Two milligrams of clarified cell lysate was incubated with 15 mg of antibody conjugated to 15 ml of protein G–Sepharose for 2 hr at 4°C with gentle agitation. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl and twice with 1 ml of buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with 1 × LDS sample buffer.</p><p>Cell lysates (15 mg) in SDS sample buffer were subjected to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated for 30 min with TTBS containing 5% (w/v) skim milk. The membranes were then immunoblotted in 5% (w/v) skim milk in TTBS with the indicated primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Antibodies prepared in sheep were used at a concentration of 1 to 2 mg/ml. The incubation with phosphorylation site–specific sheep antibodies was performed with the addition of the non-phosphorylated peptide antigen (10 mg/ml) used to raise the antibody. The blots were then washed six times with TTBS and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies diluted 5000-fold in 5% (w/v) skim milk in TTBS. After repeating the washing steps, the signal was detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. Imumunoblots were developed by ChemiDoc Imaging Systems (Bio-Rad). Figures were generated using Photoshop and Illustrator (Adobe). The relative intensities of immunoblot bands were determined by densitometry with ImageJ software.</p><p>Antibodies used for western blots were raised in sheep and affinity-purified on the appropriate antigen by the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy Unit (DSTT) at the University of Dundee; other antibodies were purchased. NKCC1 total (S022D, first bleed, raised against residues 1–288 of human NKCC1); KCC2a phosphoT906 (S959C, first bleed; raised against residues 975–989 of human KCC3a phosphorylated at T991, SAYTYER(T)LMMEQRSRR); KCC2a phosphoT1007 (S961C, first bleed; raised against residues 1032–1046 or 1041–1055 of human KCC3a phosphorylated at T1048). KCC2 Ser940 antibody (NBP2-29513, Novus Biologicals). KCC2 total antibody (S700C, first bleed; raised against residues 1–119 of human KCC2A); The anti-β-Tubulin III (neuronal) antibody (T8578) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase used for immunoblotting were obtained from Pierce. IgG used in control immunoprecipitation experiments was affinity-purified from pre-immune serum using Protein G-Sepharose.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Reagents</title><p>The following reagents were purchased from the indicated sources: 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX) and D-2-amino-5-phosphovaleric acid (D-APV) from the Molecular, Cellular, and Genomic Neuroscience Research Branch (MCGNRB) of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH, Bethesda, MD, USA).

To ensure the consistency and reproducibility of our results, we conducted repeated trials in different cell cultures, acute brain slice and hippocampi prepared from at least three different animals for each experimental condition. In this study, the persons performing experiments and analyzing the data were blinded to the genotype of the mice. These include electrophysiological recordings on acute slices, western blot, and PCR. The one way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test was used for multiple comparisons between experimental conditions. A two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to analyze difference between two individual groups. A two-tailed paired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to analyze differences within one group across conditions, that is frequency of action potential before and after isoguvacine. All data are expressed as Mean ±standard error to the mean (S.E.M.). Data are judged significantly different when p&lt;0.05.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work by Dumon et al. investigates the role of the adipolytic hormone Leptin. The loss of leptin or its receptor delays the maturation of GABAergic inhibition and maternal obesity, which is associated with hyperleptinemia, delays the switch from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing inhibition. The study examines the effect of leptin on the KCC2 transporter and finds that leptin shifts the reversal potential of GABA to more positive values and delays the extrusion of chloride in cultured cells preloaded with chloride. Using an immunolabeling protocol, the authors show that leptin treatment causes a decline in the expression of the KCC2 transporter inserted in the neurons' membrane but increases the amount of the internalized transporter in the cells' cytoplasm, suggesting a reduced membrane bonding of KCC2 in cultured cells. Applying a maternal obesity model, the authors show that hyperleptinemia during maternal obesity delays the developmental switch of GABA reversal potential and down regulates KCC2 in the offspring. It is a technically well-performed study with many controls and several genetically modified mouse lines. The data are very convincing and of interest to a broad readership. Some aspects were, however, not clear as outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors make the point that phosphorylation of the C-terminus in particular the threonine 906 and 1007 residue inhibits KCC2 activity and enhances its endocytosis. The authors therefore assed the phosphorylation state of KCC2. They mention in the text that the amount of phosphorylated KCC2 increased after leptin treatment. The Western plot shown in Figure 2C, however, indicates the opposite. Moreover, based on the statement of the authors relative expressions of phospho-S940 were unchanged, however, Figure 2C again indicates a reduction. Please clarify.</p><p>2) One of the reviewers stated that experiments shown in Figures 1 and 2 do not contribute in any way to clarify if leptin (and its receptor) are contributing to the timing of the GABA shift, but they just indicate that leptin is capable to modulate E<sub>GABA</sub> (and KCC2) in more mature neurons in which the GABA shift has already occurred. Therefore, we suggest to move the figures to the second part of the manuscript or to the supplement.</p><p>3) Next, the authors tested whether WNKI activity is required for the KCC2 T906 and T 1007 phosphorylation. By using sh-RNA for downregulation of WNK1 or by using a constitutively active WNK1 mutant, the authors show that indeed WNK1 is required for the depolarizing shift induced by leptin treatment. Here, it would be important to examine by using Western blot analysis, whether the expression of the NKCC2 transporter was altered and, thus, may influence the measurement of the chloride reversal potential. This criticism applies also to the data shown in Figure 3.</p><p>4) All experiments shown in Figures 1 and 2 are based on cultured cells. Please provide information on the nature of the recorded cells (glutamatergic / GABAergic), if possible.</p><p>5) The authors should suggest what behaviors and physiologic parameters might be altered secondary to increased or decreased leptin during perinatal overnutrition.</p><p>6) In the Abstract, the factors controlling the GABA shift are mentioned as &quot;largely unknown&quot;. On the contrary, several factors have been shown to be involved in the regulation of the GABA shift. The author should reduce their claim here, as leptin is just one of the many factors that &quot;sets the tempo for the emergence of the GABAergic inhibition&quot; in the hippocampus.</p><p>7) The authors should show if and how leptin modifies E<sub>GABA</sub> and KCC2 expression during neuronal maturation in culture at different DIV. This is an important point because effects and signaling mechanisms of factors modulating KCC2 and the GABA shift could change during the maturation of hippocampal neurons in culture (Leonzino 2016).</p><p>8) Quantification of NKCC1 should also be performed to check for cross regulation between the two cotransporters.</p><p>9) An alternative method for KCC2 quantification should be applied.

However, the amount of total KCC2 was also strongly diminished. In the manuscript we therefore referred to the relative amount of the phosphorylated forms of KCC2 defined as the ratio of the phosphorylated forms of KCC2 to total KCC2. We found that although the amount of phospho-T 906 and 1007 was decreased, their relative amount was increased after leptin treatment. The relative amount of phospho-S940 was unchanged. We have amended the revised manuscript to clarify this point (subsection “Leptin controls chloride homeostasis in vitro”, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One of the reviewers stated that experiments shown in Figures 1 and 2 do not contribute in any way to clarify if leptin (and its receptor) are contributing to the timing of the GABA shift, but they just indicate that leptin is capable to modulate E<sub>GABA</sub> (and KCC2) in more mature neurons in which the GABA shift has already occurred.

We therefore assessed the expression of NKCC1 in non-transfected neuronal cultures treated with leptin (100 nM, 24h) and found that NKCC1 expression was decreased in leptin-treated cultures (subsection “Leptin controls chloride homeostasis in vitro”, second paragraph). How leptin down-regulates NKCC1 expression is presently unknown, but we found that the KCC2 to NKCC1 ratio was decreased, thus supporting the idea that chloride extrusion is reduced following leptin-treatment. Moreover, it should be noted that the measurement of E<sub>GABA</sub> in the neuronal cultures were performed in the presence of bumetanide 10µM to exclude any influence of NKCC1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) All experiments shown in Figures 1 and 2 are based on cultured cells. Please provide information on the nature of the recorded cells (glutamatergic / GABAergic), if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not done any specific experiments to characterize the nature of the recorded cells. However, based on morphological criteria and our previous experience (Chudotvorova et al., 2005), we believe that the neurons used for the analysis of KCC2-GFP clusters and for the electrophysiological experiments were glutamatergic cells. According to the study of Benson et al., 1994, most glutamatergic cells are spiny neurons with a pyramidal shaped soma, while most GABAergic cells are non-spiny and have more fusiform or polygonal shaped soma. The dendritic arbor is another criterion with glutamatergic neurons having more primary dendrites and shorter dendritic segments. This point is addressed in the revised manuscript (Materials and methods, subsection “Primary cultures, transfection of rat hippocampal neurons, electrophysiological recordings, live cell immuno-labelling, Immuno-staining and Immunoprecipitation with phosphorylation site–specific antibodies”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should suggest what behaviors and physiologic parameters might be altered secondary to increased or decreased leptin during perinatal overnutrition.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have amended the Discussion (fourth and fifth paragraphs). Human and rodents studies show that excess of leptin (maternal obesity, over nutrition) or deficit in leptin (maternal separation, under nutrition) increase the risk of developing mental and behavioral disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, anxiety, depression and cognitive impairments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the Abstract, the factors controlling the GABA shift are mentioned as &quot;largely unknown&quot;. On the contrary, several factors have been shown to be involved in the regulation of the GABA shift. The author should reduce their claim here, as leptin is just one of the many factors that &quot;sets the tempo for the emergence of the GABAergic inhibition&quot; in the hippocampus.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. As stated in our manuscript, oxytocin and the thyroid hormone also control the GABAergic developmental sequence. We removed this sentence from the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors should show if and how leptin modifies E<sub>GABA</sub> and KCC2 expression during neuronal maturation in culture at different DIV. This is an important point because effects and signaling mechanisms of factors modulating KCC2 and the GABA shift could change during the maturation of hippocampal neurons in culture (Leonzino 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for this suggestion. Indeed, if leptin down-regulates the expression of KCC2 by activating the WNK pathway, leptin can be expected to have no effect, or a moderate effect, in the immature neuron at a time when KCC2 expression is low and WNK activity is high as shown in our previous study (Friedel et al., 2015). In line with this assumption, we found no significant difference in our E<sub>GABA</sub> measurement between control and leptin-treated immature (6 DIVs) neuronal cultures (subsection “Leptin controls chloride homeostasis in vitro”, first paragraph, Figure 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Quantification of NKCC1 should also be performed to check for cross regulation between the two cotransporters.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee. As explained in the comment 3, we have assessed the expression of NKCC1 in <italic>db/db</italic> mice and leptin-treated neuronal cultures and have amended the manuscript accordingly. Western plot analysis revealed that NKCC1 expression was not different in <italic>db/db</italic> mice and wt mice (subsection “Advanced onset of GABAergic inhibition in leptin-receptor deficient mice”, last paragraph), while NKCC1 expression was reduced in leptin-treated neuronal cultures (subsection “Leptin controls chloride homeostasis in vitro”, second paragraph). Also, to exclude possible cross regulation between the two cotransporters, the measurements of E<sub>GABA</sub> in neuronal cultures were performed in the presence of bumetanide (10µM), and the effect of leptin-treatment were occluded by VUO463271 (10µM), highlighting the contribution of KCC2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) An alternative method for KCC2 quantification should be applied. One possibility is to perform biotynilation of membrane proteins followed by immunoprecipitation.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we tried to perform biotinylation experiments in neuronal cultures. We faced two problems. The first problem is the low relative amount of biotinylated KCC2. The second problem is biotin leakage, which results in the presence of a cytoplasmic protein (tubulin) in the biotinylated fraction. We are therefore not confident in the results we have obtained with this method. We therefore performed immuno-staining experiments as an alternative method to assess the effect of leptin on KCC2 expression. With this approach, we confirmed that KCC2 expression was up-regulated in db/db mice and down-regulated in leptin-treated hippocampal cultures (subsection “Advanced onset of GABAergic inhibition in leptin-receptor deficient mice”, last paragraph and subsection “Leptin controls chloride homeostasis in vitro”, second paragraph, Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p></body></sub-article></article>
