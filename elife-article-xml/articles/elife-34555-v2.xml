Current uncaging methods are limited by the random distribution of caged molecules within cells. We have developed a mitochondria-specific photoactivation method, which permitted us to release free sphingosine inside mitochondria and thereafter monitor local sphingosine metabolism by lipidomics. Our results indicate that sphingosine was quickly phosphorylated into sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) driven by sphingosine kinases. In time-course studies, the mitochondria-specific uncaged sphingosine demonstrated distinct metabolic patterns compared to globally-released sphingosine, and did not induce calcium spikes. Our data provide direct evidence that sphingolipid metabolism and signaling are highly dependent on the subcellular location and opens up new possibilities to study the effects of lipid localization on signaling and metabolic fate.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34555.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fatty or oily molecules called lipids are essential components of the membranes of cells and important signaling molecules too. They are made in specific compartments of the cell, but most are found in all membranes, albeit in varying amounts. Their widespread distribution suggests that there are extensive networks for transporting lipids within cells. Yet scientists know little about lipid transport inside living cells because it is difficult to detect their movements.</p><p>Mitochondria are cellular compartments that are often referred to as the “powerhouses of the cell”. Many lipids are found in mitochondria including one called sphingosine, which is a common component of many other cell membranes too. Sphingosine can increase the concentration of calcium ions inside the cells, and when converted to a molecule called sphingosine 1 phosphate it forms a signaling molecule that regulates fundamental processes like cell survival and migration. However, it was not known if sphingosine localized in the mitochondria was processed differently to the same molecule elsewhere in the cell, or if its signaling activity was affected by its location.</p><p>In the laboratory, Feng et al. synthesized an inactive sphingosine-like molecule that would only localize to mitochondria and which could be activated with a flash of light. By adding this molecule to human cells, they showed that sphingosine could be converted to sphingosine 1 phosphate within the mitochondria, before being exported rapidly to another compartment in the cell. The experiments allowed Feng et al. to observe the process in enough detail to to conclude that, despite its rapid transport, when localized only inside mitochondria, sphingosine could not trigger its normal signaling response.</p><p>This new light-activated lipid molecule will be a useful tool for many researchers studying both metabolism and signaling. In principle, a similar tool could be developed for many compounds and it should also be possible to localize the compound to different locations within the cell. This new generation of compounds would give scientists a better understanding of mitochondria biology. They could be applied to the study of diseases where the mitochondria do not function as they should, for example Barth syndrome, where a mitochondria specific lipid called cardiolipin is not properly synthesized.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>photoactivation</kwd><kwd>sphingolipids</kwd><kwd>coumarin</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII3-154405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riezman</surname><given-names>Howard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Centre for Competence in Research in Chemical Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>51NF40-160589</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winssinger</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name><name><surname>Riezman</surname><given-names>Howard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harayama</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Caged, photoactivatible sphingosine localized to mitochondria permits demonstration of the importance of subcellular localization on lipid metabolism and signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sphingolipids are one of the major lipid species in cellular membranes of all eukaryotic cells. Apart from maintaining structural properties of membranes, at least four sphingolipid metabolites, sphingosine, ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P), are also signaling messengers that regulate fundamental cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera-Romero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hannun and Obeid, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maceyka and Spiegel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atilla-Gokcumen et al., 2014</xref>). Due to their essential roles, aberrant sphingolipid levels are linked to a broad range of diseases, including cancers, diabetes, inflammation and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maceyka and Spiegel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Platt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guri et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, sphingolipid messengers could serve distinct functions depending on their subcellular localization, but this is currently difficult to address (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hannun and Obeid, 2008</xref>). For example, extracellular S1P activates receptors on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Van Brocklyn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2000</xref>), while S1P generated inside the nucleus has been proposed to regulate histone acetylation through direct interactions with the histone deacetylases (HDAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hait et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, several protein domains have been suggested to bind to S1P, which might affect the recruitment of many PH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vonkova et al., 2015</xref>). Although cellular localization is likely to be an important regulator of the metabolism and functions of sphingolipids, there is no direct evidence to demonstrate this.</p><p>In the last years some new techniques were introduced to explore lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wenk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">da Silveira Dos Santos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papan et al., 2014</xref>) and to map lipid-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haberkant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saliba et al., 2016</xref>). While proven to be valuable tools, they do not permit the acute manipulation of lipid amounts in living cells. Recently developed optogenetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levskaya et al., 2009</xref>) or chemical induced dimerization techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feng et al., 2014</xref>) have been applied to rapidly change lipid levels by controlling the localization of lipid-metabolizing enzymes in living cells. Additionally, photoswitchable fatty acids and their derivatives also enables precise optical control of specific signaling lipid-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frank et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frank et al., 2016</xref>). However, successful design often requires detailed mechanistic understanding of the protein-lipid interactions. Alternatively, photoactivation ('uncaging’) has become a common way to quickly increase the lipid supply. This method requires the chemical protection of the lipid head group using a photo-labile moiety, which blocks the lipid bioactivities. Once inside cells, a strong light flash can easily remove the protecting group within milli-seconds to seconds, and thereby release the bioactive lipids with high temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Höglinger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klán et al., 2013</xref>). Equipped with confocal fluorescence microscopy, the uncaging approach offers a convenient platform to study lipid signaling at the single cell level with minimal perturbation. To date, a number of caged lipids, including sphingosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Höglinger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Höglinger et al., 2017</xref>), S1P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiao et al., 1998</xref>), fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nadler et al., 2015</xref>), and phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Subramanian et al., 2010</xref>) have been successfully applied in lipid signaling studies.</p><p>To perform the photoactivation experiments, coumarin and nitrophenyl derivatives are widely used as caging groups to mask the bioactive small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klán et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, the caged molecules are usually distributed in the cell randomly. Selective uncaging is only achieved through sophisticated fluorescence microscopy that is able to produce a highly focused laser beam in a defined area at the subcellular level. This method has disadvantages, though, because it is very difficult to exclusively activate the compartment of interest due to the diffraction limit of light. More importantly, this 'selective uncaging’ strategy is limited to single-cell analysis, and hence is not suitable for biochemical assays that are needed to study metabolism. Only a few exceptions allow uncaging with subcellular specificity, either from the outer leaflet of plasma membrane because the probes cannot enter into cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nadler et al., 2015</xref>), or in mitochondria to uncouple the membrane potential, but the latter system did not permit to visualize the caged compound once inside the cell making it difficult to determine its precise localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chalmers et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report a new mitochondria-targeted photoactivation method, which enabled the rapid release of sphingosine inside the mitochondria in living cells. We combined this method with lipid analysis by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">da Silveira Dos Santos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han, 2016</xref>) to study mitochondrial sphingosine metabolism in intact cells. We observed that after photo-release, free sphingosine was rapidly phosphorylated into S1P, driven by sphingosine kinases. Inhibition of sphingosine kinases largely suppressed the S1P generation. We also applied this technique to monitor the turnover of sphingosine and compared the mito-caged sphingosine (Mito-So) with the globally distributed caged sphingosine (Sph-Cou) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Höglinger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Höglinger et al., 2017</xref>). In both cases, sphingosine was quickly lost indicating that these signaling sphingolipids are rapidly metabolized even when targeted to mitochondria. Using stable isotope-labeled caged sphingosine precursors, we investigated the conversion of sphingosine into ceramides and sphingomyelins after uncaging, and found that sphingosine metabolism was highly dependent on its subcellular localization. Mitochondria released sphingosine was used to continuously produce ceramides, whereas globally released sphingosine was more rapidly metabolized through sphingolipid metabolic network. Finally, we compared the two caged probes in calcium mobilization experiments. In contrast to the globally distributed Sph-Cou, the Mito-So failed to trigger calcium mobilization, demonstrating the importance of lipid localization in signal transduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synthesis and characterization of Mito-caged sphingolipids</title><p>Coumarin and nitrophenyl derivatives are the most popular caging molecules for biological studies. Although both can be efficiently cleaved from the caged molecules inside living cells, only coumarin-based molecules generate fluorescent signals and thus can be easily visualized under fluorescence microscopy.

Previously described diethylaminocoumarin caged sphingosine (Sph-Cou) was used as a reference compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Höglinger et al., 2015</xref>). We analyzed the caging probes by LC-MS at different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Most of the sphingosine was cleaved from the Mito-So after one minute, judging from the coumarin absorbance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Compared to Sph-Cou, both Mito-So and Mito-Sa were completely cleaved after two minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating the TPP-Cou-OH is an effective photolabile molecule. On the other hand, our measurement also indicated that the caged probes are fluorescent dyes that emit in the blue region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we treated Hela cells with Mito-So for 15 min in the presence of MitoTracker. 5 μM of Mito-So was used to obtain sufficient signals since it is a relatively weak fluorophore.

In addition, although sphingosine and sphinganine are structurally very similar, the sphinganine level remained stable after Mito-So uncaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). As a further control, we assessed the potential effects of UV light on the sphingolipid levels, by exposing the cells to continuous UV illumination without any caged probe and measuring the sphingosine and S1P levels. Although both lipids were slightly reduced after UV exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), the reduction is rather minimal and is in the opposite direction compared to the effects of uncaging, showing that the effect of UV illumination is insignificant under these conditions. Likewise, the major lipid species and ceramides were not affected after Mito-So and Mito-Sa uncaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that these photochemical probes, upon illumination, effectively released sphingoid bases with high spatiotemporal resolution. As sphingosine is the major sphingoid base in mammalian cells, we focused on Mito-So in the following studies.</p><p>Next, we sought to confirm that the elevated S1P after photo-releasing sphingosine required enzymatic phosphorylation and occurred after uncaging. Since sphingosine and S1P are interconvertible molecules, we assumed that the increased amount of S1P was due to phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinases. There are two isoforms of sphingosine kinases in mammalian cells, sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), both of which are capable of phosphorylating sphingosine into S1P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maceyka et al., 2005</xref>). To investigate the role of SphKs, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing strategy to generate a control and the double kinase knock-out cell line based on HeLa MZ cells(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harayama and Riezman, 2017</xref>).

The level of S1P in the control cells was not as high as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, most likely due to the intrinsic differences between the cell lines used initially and the cell line used for generating knockout cells, even though at the beginning they were both selected from HeLa cells.

Consistent with the results in the knockout cells, SKI-II treated cells generated less S1P, and increased the level of sphingosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). The SKI-II did not fully block S1P synthesis, which might be due to the fact that the SKI-II and sphingosine are competitive substrates for the kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">French et al., 2003</xref>), and/or the access of SKI-II to the mitochondria might be limited. Taken together, our results clearly show that the rapid S1P accumulation after uncaging was catalyzed by sphingosine kinases.</p><p>As we detected a significant amount of S1P rapidly after uncaging, it is essential to know whether the S1P accumulation was driven by very fast enzymatic reactions, or if phosphorylation occurred on the caged sphingosine molecules (Mito-So) prior to UV illumination. Therefore, we extracted lipids from cells that were incubated with Mito-So, uncaged them after extraction and measured sphingosine and S1P levels. There was no significant increase in S1P following this protocol, while, as expected, the amount of sphingosine was greatly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results show that sphingosine kinases were not able to use the caged lipids as substrates in vivo even though the hydroxyl group was available, which further supports our conclusion that S1P accumulation is due to sphingosine kinase activity on the uncaged sphingoid bases.</p><p>Although the sphingoid bases were initially photo-released in mitochondria, we cannot formally rule out that free bases were rapidly transported out of the mitochondria and phosphorylated in the cytoplasm. To investigate this issue, we isolated mitochondria from mouse liver and performed uncaging experiments using Mito-So (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Consistent with live-cell experiments, after UV irradiation, we detected an elevated sphingosine level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Importantly, we also observed a significant increase in S1P, which was suppressed by the addition of the SKI-II inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the phosphorylation of sphingosine into S1P was less efficient in purified mitochondria, which might have been due to the different experimental settings and the intrinsic activity of purified mitochondria compared to mitochondria in vivo. For instance, it is possible that the SPHKs are more efficient in their native environments than in isolated mitochondria. In addition, if some of the S1P generated inside mitochondria was exported during the experiments it would have been lost during our isolation and extraction procedure (see following). To make sure the newly generated S1P was not caused by the contamination of mitochondria during purification and therefore produced outside of the mitochondria, we added a large amount of S1P (10 pmol, approx. 10 times more than produced in vitro) in a mock experiment without Mito-So to the purified mitochondria, and then proceeded with pelleting and lipid extraction, but did not detect any significant change of either sphingosine or S1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). We therefore conclude that the S1P found in our assay was indeed inside mitochondria as extra-mitochondrial S1P was not detected in our assay, probably due to its relatively high solubility in aqueous buffers.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34555.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Sphingolipid analysis after Mito-So uncaging in purified mitochondria from mouse liver.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Mitochondria were incubated with Mito-So (10 μM) for 10 min, ±SKI II (50 μM), irradiated under UV light for 2 min on ice, incubated for 15 min at 37°C prior to pelleting by centrifugation and lipid extraction.

This is consistent with reports finding that sphingosine kinases are partially localized to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strub et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Metabolism of locally uncaged sphingosine</title><p>Sphingolipids are key components of cellular membranes as well as signaling molecules involved in essential physiological and pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maceyka and Spiegel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera-Romero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Platt, 2014</xref>). Their accumulation at specific intracellular locations could possibly be important for their physiological effects. Indeed, it has been proposed that sphingolipid signaling molecules could exhibit different cellular functions depending on their subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hannun and Obeid, 2008</xref>). Therefore, understanding their local metabolism is crucial to reveal the complexities of sphingolipid homeostasis and signaling.</p><p>To address the effect of subcellular localization on metabolism, we applied the photochemical probe to release sphingosine in mitochondria, and thereafter monitored the decay of sphingosine over time. We also performed parallel experiments using a recent reported caged probe (Sph-Cou, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Höglinger et al., 2015</xref>]) that releases sphingosine without subcellular selectivity.

Not surprisingly, in both cases, the released sphingosine was quickly metabolized without affecting the amounts of other major lipid species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). By simply fitting the time-course data with one-phase decay functions, we were able to estimate the half-lives of sphingosine. Notably, the decay of sphingosine (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 2.63 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) generated from Mito-So is much faster than the one from Sph-Cou (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 4.21 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Also, unlike the Mito-So, sphingosine released from Sph-Cou did not drop to the basal level even after 20 min, suggesting that part of the globally released sphingosine was stored inside cells, which prevented further metabolism during the time course.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34555.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Real-time metabolism of mito-caged sphingosine and globally-caged sphingosine in living cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structure of Sph-Cou.

To explore the rate of conversion to ceramide, we uncaged Mito-So in SphK dKO cells, where the latter pathways are blocked due to a lack of formation of S1P and quantified the sphingosine level over time. Even though major lipid species were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), sphingosine levels still declined over time, but the half-life was significantly longer than in wild type cells (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 4.2 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Since S1P formation and sphingoid base turnover were blocked, the most logical explanation is that sphingosine turnover was the result of its conversion into ceramide by ceramide synthases, but this did not affect the total ceramide pool since steady state levels of ceramide in HeLa cells are much higher than sphingosine or S1P levels.</p><p>In order to further investigate the metabolic fate of sphingosine into more abundant lipid species, it is important to distinguish the newly formed ceramide from the endogenous ones. For this purpose, we synthesized the d7-Mito-So and d7-Sph-Cou using heavy isotope labeled d7-sphingosine as a precursor. Following the same time frame and experimental settings, we measured the d7-sphingolipids over time after uncaging in live Hela cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). To better understand the sphingolipid metabolism under various subcellular contexts, we performed experiments using direct addition of the d7-sphingosine to cells, and compared this with the mito-released and globally-released sphingosine probes. Among the downstream sphingolipids, we focused on the formation of isotope-labeled C16 and C24 ceramides, the most abundant ceramides in HeLa cells, which also showed the most pronounced increase with negligible background signals in our study. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (left), we detected both d7-labeled ceramides immediately after uncaging of d7-Mito-So, demonstrating a rapid conversion to ceramide. The amount of newly formed ceramides steadily increased even after 20 min. Interestingly, globally localized d7-Sph-Cou generated a distinct metabolic pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, middle). Fewer ceramides were formed at 0 min and both ceramides reached their maximum after 5 to 10 min and dropped significantly after 20 min, suggesting that the ceramides were quickly consumed to synthesize other sphingolipids. As for directly added d7-sphingosine, we observed continuous accumulation and sharp increase of ceramides over time, indicating that sphingosine entered from outside was efficiently metabolized by cells. As the most abundant sphingolipids on the plasma membrane, sphingomyelins are produced by sphingomyelin synthases using ceramides as precursors in the biosynthetic pathway. We also analyzed the signals of d7 C16 sphingomyelin and observed that, while the signals were increased over time in all cases, the signals generated after global release of d7 Sph-Cou uncaging was close to reaching a plateau, unlike the externally added and mitochondrial released d7 Sph that were still in an early phase. The lower sphingomyelin signals, compared to ceramides, suggests that only part of the ceramide population was readily converted to sphingomyelin.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34555.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Real-time detection of d7-sphingolipids in living Hela cells after uncaging of d7-Mito-So, d7-Sph-Cou or direct addition of d7-sphingosine.</title><p>Values were normalized with respect to the amount of internal standards and were plotted as percentage of all lipid signals.

To investigate whether subcellular localization of sphingosine is relevant for this signaling event, we tested the Sph-Cou and Mito-So probes in live Hela cells using a ratiometric calcium dye (Fluo-4) as readout. As shown here, global uncaging of sphingosine quickly induced calcium release as previously reported, whereas mitochondria specific uncaging failed to trigger any calcium mobilization in the saame time frame ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). To verify that this is not due to a difference in total cellular amounts of sphingosine, we quantified the sphingosine levels generated from the two probes extracted from cells. Since the calcium curves were obtained from single-cell analysis which does not provide quantitative information of photo-released sphingosine, we incubated the two probes in culture dishes, extracted lipids, performed uncaging in the lipid suspension, and measured sphingosine levels by mass spectrometry (same protocol as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

This rapid movement raises the question of the influence of localization on metabolism and signaling. To address this, we have developed a highly efficient photo-cleavable probe (TPP-Cou-OH) that was easily installed on the amino group of free sphingoid bases, and which can be potentially applied to mask other functional groups, allowing the caging of a wide variety of lipids and other bioactive molecules. Carrying a hydrophobic and positively charged triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation, the caged probes accumulated in mitochondria, into which the entry is tightly regulated. As these probes are also fluorescent dyes, their subcellular localization could be conveniently visualized under fluorescence microscopy. With few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nadler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chalmers et al., 2012</xref>), most available caged molecules are randomly distributed, and thus spatiotemporal control has to rely on sophisticated microscopy at a single-cell level. In contrast, our caged probes can be used for single-cell microscopic analysis as well as biochemical experiments to follow metabolism.

Since mitochondria is major a hub of energy supply and has been highly associated with apoptosis, it is interesting to investigate the metabolism of mitochondrial sphingosine, and to compare this with the metabolism globally distributed sphingosine. Using the mitochondria-specific caged probe (Mito-So) and globally caged probe (Sph-Cou), we monitored the sphingosine level over time, from which we derived the half-lives of decay by fitting a one phase function. Our results indicate that mitochondria released sphingosine was quickly lost over time (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 2.63 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), whereas globally released sphingosine was slowly lost and did not come back to the basal level (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 4.21 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Since ceramides are much more abundant lipids than sphingoid bases in cells ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simanshu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shaner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canals et al., 2010</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we prepared stable isotope labelled caged sphingosine so that the newly produced ceramides can be distinguished from the endogenous pool of ceramides by mass spectrometry. After releasing sphingosine at different subcellular localizations, we have found that sphingosine can be metabolized through distinct metabolic patterns, depending on where free sphingosine is supplied. Focusing on two most abundant ceramides in mammalian cells, our data show that both C16 and C24 ceramides were continuously generated after Mito-So uncaging. Nevertheless, after Sph-Cou uncaging, both lipids were produced and also quickly consumed after 5 to 10 min. Since ceramide synthases (CerS), which catalyze the conversion of sphingosine into ceramide, are mainly located in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the lack of substrate accessibility to CerS may prevent immediate ceramide formation from liberated sphingosine in mitochondria. It is likely that the slow sphingosine exit from mitochondria resulted in the continuous increase of ceramides. On the other hand, globally uncaged sphingosine is easily accessible to CerS, which could explain the rapid ceramide production and degradation. We did not detect a preferential synthesis of ceramides with specific acyl chain length dependent upon the localized source of sphingosine. Interestingly, we detected less ceramides from globally released sphingosine. One possibility is that mitochondrial sphingosine is more efficiently, but less rapidly transferred to the ER, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>) the site of ceramide production. It is clearly shown from our data that sphingosine produced in the mitochondria can enter the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway, demonstrating that there is a pathway to transfer sphingosine from the mitochondrial matrix to the ER. Overall, the data provided here provide direct evidence that sphingosine metabolism is different depending upon its subcellular localization.</p><p>To provide further evidence that sphingosine localization is important for signaling processes, we investigated the impact of mitochondria-specific uncaging in lipid signaling studies. We demonstrated a role of compartmentalization in restricting sphingosine signaling for calcium release. Again, sphingosine produced in the mitochondria was clearly not equivalent to sphingosine produced elsewhere in the cell. This clearly shows that the mitochondrial sphingosine does not freely and rapidly diffuse in the cells because it would have produced a release of calcium. Why does it not produce a calcium release? Two factors might influence this. One, it could be that the exit from mitochondria is too slow to be seen in our time course. Second, it could be that the mitochondrial sphingosine is transported preferentially to the ER. This would be consistent with the increased efficiency of ceramide synthesis from mitochondrial sphingosine compared to global sphingosine. It is possible that externally added sphingosine is also targeted preferentially to the ER as it behaves similarly to mitochondrial sphingosine. One interesting question for the future is to determine where the sphingosine must be located to induce a calcium release from acidic stores. A similar approach as taken here that localizes caged-sphingosine to different intracellular locations could be used to address this question and determine if the sphingosine must be inside or outside of the lysosome. Furthermore, extending our concept of subcellular release of caged lipids to other compartments and other lipids should allow experimentation to understand the role of localization in lipid metabolism and signaling in general.</p><p>Lipid messengers play active roles in essential cellular functions and their metabolism is tightly regulated through a complex lipid metabolic network. Although it is believed that sphingolipids could have different functions depending on their subcellular locations, it is difficult to acquire direct evidence because of technical challenges to spatiotemporally control bioactive lipids. Our approach offers a novel technique that permits the elucidation of the relevance of lipid localization in bioactive lipid metabolism and signaling. Combining this technique with mass spectrometry (MS)-based lipidomic approach we were able to monitor real-time metabolism of a key lipid regulator in mitochondria. More importantly, our combined results provide direct evidence that sphingosine has distinct metabolism and signaling patterns depending on subcellular localization. We envision that site-specific photochemical probes will become valuable tools in lipid signaling and metabolism studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, chemicals and reagents were purchased from commercial sources (Sigma-Aldrich, Acros, Alfa-Aesar) and were used without purification.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The decision was reached after consultation between the reviewers. Unfortunately, based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers felt that the study had for the most part, been carried out with great care and rigor. However, they felt that significant additional work would be needed to show that the uncaged sphingosine phosphorylation actually takes place in mitochondria. Given their additional concerns, it was not possible to come to a more favorable disposition. Nevertheless, we hope you will find the comments constructive in revising the story for another journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper describes the synthesis and use of a novel, mitochondria targeted and caged derivative of sphingosine as a new approach intended for the investigation of compartment-specific sphingosine metabolism in the mitochondria. However, as implemented here, this approach does lacks confirmation that phosphorylation of sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) by sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) occurs in the mitochondria. Based on the finding that SphK1 is required and that SphK2 is known to be localized to the mitochondria, it is likely that sphingosine that is very rapidly released by uncaging in the mitochondria is rapidly transferred out of the mitochondria into other cellular compartments that contain sphingosine kinase enzyme activity as well as other sphingolipid metabolic enzymes. There are several major concerns, including evidence that levels of S1P are actually increased in the mitochondria, that mitochondrial functions are affected, and lack of evidence that SphK1 is present in mitochondria.</p><p>Several groups have reported that S1P has various physiological functions in the mitochondria. Although it is shown here that un-caging of mitochondrial targeted sphingosine is rapidly converted to S1P in cells, a reaction the authors consider takes place in the mitochondria, evidence is lacking to show that S1P generated in the mitochondria has a function in there. It is also important to substantiate that the increase in cellular S1P actually takes place in the mitochondria.</p><p>It has previously been shown that SphK2 is the main sphingosine kinase isoenzyme present in mitochondria. There is no published evidence to date that shows that SphK1 is also in mitochondria. It is necessary to determine whether SphK1 is a mitochondrial resident protein or not. If not, it is difficult to understand how conversion of sphingosine to S1P occurs in the mitochondria.</p><p>Subsection “Uncaged sphingosine and sphinganine are rapidly phosphorylated”, fourth paragraph: It is misleading to state that SphK1 and SphK2 carry out redundant functions. This was not shown by Mizugishi et al., 2005. Both SphK1 and SphK2 produce S1P, but their presence in different cellular locations suggests that they have compartment specific functions. Although several reports have shown that circulating S1P levels are increased in SphK1 knockout mice, S1P is produced by a compensatory increase in SphK2. This does not indicate that SphK1 and SphK2 have redundant functions but may have some compensatory functions.</p><p>Subsection “Metabolism of locally uncaged sphingosine”, first paragraph: This sentence is incorrect. &quot;local lipid metabolism&quot; was not monitored at all in this study. Total cellular levels of some sphingolipid metabolites, not local levels, were measured at various times. This was probably at some time after UV uncaging, although this was not stated in the figure legend. It is important to note that whole cell turnover of sphingosine and S1P is a complex process that involves synthesis, metabolism, and degradation. This approach does not reveal anything about rate of conversion of sphingosine to S1P or sphingosine kinase activity since the synthesis and degradation takes place in several subcellular compartments.

The figure legend does not explain if time (min) is after loading and then uncaging. Why are the S1P levels at 0 min in the SphK1/SphK2 double knockout cells only about 10% of those in the wild type cells? There should be no S1P in cells without SphK1 and SphK2 as S1P can only be produced by SphKs. Expression levels of SphKs should be determined and if present, cells should be characterized as partial deletions, not knockouts. The data on ceramides in panels C and F are meaningless as presented. They are expressed as mol% of total measured cellular lipids, not just sphingolipids, that make up around 99%. These cannot be compared with sphingosine and S1P levels expressed as pmol/million cells.

However, as implemented here, this approach does lacks confirmation that phosphorylation of sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) by sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) occurs in the mitochondria. Based on the finding that SphK1 is required and that SphK2 is known to be localized to the mitochondria, it is likely that sphingosine that is very rapidly released by uncaging in the mitochondria is rapidly transferred out of the mitochondria into other cellular compartments that contain sphingosine kinase enzyme activity as well as other sphingolipid metabolic enzymes. There are several major concerns, including evidence that levels of S1P are actually increased in the mitochondria, that mitochondrial functions are affected, and lack of evidence that SphK1 is present in mitochondria.</p></disp-quote><p>Even though we do not find this explanation likely, we accept this criticism and see the need to provide further evidence for S1P formation in mitochondria. To confirm that the phosphorylation of photoreleased sphingosine can occur inside mitochondria, we performed the uncaging assay using purified mitochondria from mouse liver, and observed a significant increase in S1P after uncaging. Together with control experiments showing that if S1P had been formed outside the mitochondria it would not be detected in our assay, our results provide clear evidence that sphingosine can be phosphorylated inside mitochondria. In addition, our studies on metabolism and signalling do not support a model that the mitochondrial sphingosine can easily diffuse in the cell. The new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> clearly show that sphingosine generates a different metabolic pattern depending on the location of the subcellular source. More importantly, we did not detect any calcium spike after photoreleasing mitochondrial sphingosine, in contrast to the calcium spikes after globally uncaging sphingosine. Taken together, our data show that sphingosine metabolism and signalling are highly dependent on its the subcellular localization, which is really the main point of the study.It is technically very difficult to quantify the movement of lipids intracellularly, but our data show, for the first time, that sphingosine or S1P can exit mitochondria and provide a framework to study the kinetics of this process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several groups have reported that S1P has various physiological functions in the mitochondria. Although it is shown here that un-caging of mitochondrial targeted sphingosine is rapidly converted to S1P in cells, a reaction the authors consider takes place in the mitochondria, evidence is lacking to show that S1P generated in the mitochondria has a function in there. It is also important to substantiate that the increase in cellular S1P actually takes place in the mitochondria.</p></disp-quote><p>To investigate in this issue, we performed an uncaging assay in purified mitochondria from mouse liver, and observed a significant increase in S1P after uncaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It has previously been shown that SphK2 is the main sphingosine kinase isoenzyme present in mitochondria. There is no published evidence to date that shows that SphK1 is also in mitochondria. It is necessary to determine whether SphK1 is a mitochondrial resident protein or not. If not, it is difficult to understand how conversion of sphingosine to S1P occurs in the mitochondria.</p></disp-quote><p>We can understand the reviewer’s point here, but this is not the intended focus of our manuscript. Our goal was not to determine the subcellular localization of sphingosine kinases. Our new data showing S1P formation in mitochondria shows that there must be sphingosine kinase activity in the organelle. This is enough for us. We chose not to localize the sphingosine kinases for two reasons, one, we feel that it distracts from the main point of the manuscript, two, it is quite possible that the localization of the two sphingosine kinases depends on the cell type. Therefore, without a physiological readout of S1P function in the mitochondria, in our opinion, the localization experiments have little added value. To make our point that S1P formation is enzymatic, we have only included the double knockout of both kinases to show this and have removed the single mutants from the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Uncaged sphingosine and sphinganine are rapidly phosphorylated”, fourth paragraph: It is misleading to state that SphK1 and SphK2 carry out redundant functions. This was not shown by Mizugishi et al., 2005. Both SphK1 and SphK2 produce S1P, but their presence in different cellular locations suggests that they have compartment specific functions. Although several reports have shown that circulating S1P levels are increased in SphK1 knockout mice, S1P is produced by a compensatory increase in SphK2. This does not indicate that SphK1 and SphK2 have redundant functions but may have some compensatory functions.</p></disp-quote><p>This was really not the point of the manuscript and now with the single mutants removed this comment is no longer relevant. Our meaning of redundant in this case was they both phosphorylate sphingosine and as far as we know their substrate specificity is the same.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Metabolism of locally uncaged sphingosine”, first paragraph: This sentence is incorrect. &quot;local lipid metabolism&quot; was not monitored at all in this study. Total cellular levels of some sphingolipid metabolites, not local levels, were measured at various times. This was probably at some time after UV uncaging, although this was not stated in the figure legend. It is important to note that whole cell turnover of sphingosine and S1P is a complex process that involves synthesis, metabolism, and degradation.

Since we performed uncaging in a specific subcellular location (mitochondria), and that most of the detected sphingosine comes after uncaging, it is correct to state it in this way. While sphingolipid homeostasis is a very complex process, our data demonstrate a role of subcellular localization in sphingolipid metabolism. We did not suggest that SphK1 is more important than SphK2. Some of the sphingosine phosphorylation may take place inside the mitochondria and some outside. In fact, this could be expected. We would like to point out that there are no data showing an export of sphingosine or sphingosine 1P from mitochondria, but this is clearly now the case with in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: The figure title is not correct – only total cellular levels of sphingosine and S1P were measured, not mitochondrial levels.

The S1P level in SphK dKO cells reflects the technical limit of the detection. Nevertheless, we have decided to remove the data on S1P and ceramides in this figure because the derivation of the half-life of S1P encompasses two events, generation of S1P from sphingosine as well as S1P metabolism and because we have introduced a new experiment that clearly shows the flux from localized sphingosine into ceramide using heavy-isotope labelled sphingosine.

We are preparing a manuscript for an analytical chemistry journal on the standard curves etc., but the description is a manuscript in itself and would be much too long. The extraction methods for other lipids including ceramides and sphingolipids is commonly used (Matyash et al., 2008). We simply do not agree about the use of percentage of all lipid signals. This does not cover up technical variance, but provides a method for normalization. The method reaches limitations when one has strong variations in a major lipid that then makes other lipid species appear to vary in the opposite direction, but this is not the case here.
