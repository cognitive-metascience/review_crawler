implications of our findings. We used a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image cones at and near the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. Cone density and other metrics were computed in units of visual angle and linear retinal units. The foveal cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to eye length. Despite retinal stretching (decrease in cones/mm<sup>2</sup>), myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density (increase in cones/deg<sup>2</sup>) in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes, offering the potential for better visual acuity. Reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes compared to emmetropes cannot be explained by increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47148.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human eye has many different parts that enable sight. The retina is the light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, and it contains the fovea, the region that provides the clearest vision. Light must be focused on the retina to create images, a feat achieved by the transparent parts at the front of the eye called the cornea and lens. These parts of the eye are called the optics.</p><p>Between birth and adulthood, significant changes take place in the eye. Most noticeably, the distance between the optics and the fovea grows by about seven millimeters. Cells called cone photoreceptors, which provide light sensitivity, migrate and pack into the fovea. Finally, the eye’s optics adjust to maintain a sharp focus. At the same time, the brain is learning how to process inputs from the eyes to generate mental images that realistically correspond to the physical world around it. The development of the eye is fascinating in its complexity, but for more and more people, the process does not go as expected.</p><p>Specifically, a growing proportion of the population has eyes that are too long. This means that, for light reflected by far away objects, the eye’s optics form an image in front of the retina instead of on it. As a result, images of distant objects cannot be seen clearly, a condition known as myopia or nearsightedness. Researchers have also discovered that nearsighted people see less clearly than those who do not use glasses, even when given a sharp image to examine at close range. It has been hypothesized that these deficits result from stretching of the retina as the eye becomes bigger.</p><p>Until recently, testing this hypothesis by looking at cone photoreceptors directly in the eye was impossible. This is because the optics of all eyes have small imperfections that distort the light passing through them, including any light used to take high resolution microscopic images of the fovea. This hurdle can be overcome using adaptive optics, which means adding a deformable mirror to the instrument being used to image the eye that can adjust to correct the distortion.</p><p>Wang et al. use a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to check the density of cones at the fovea in relation to the size of the eye. They show that although the center of the fovea has fewer cones when the eye is bigger, this effect is more than offset because the longer eye increases magnification. So, if a near-sighted person wearing contacts and someone who does not need glasses stood side-by-side admiring the full moon, the near-sighted person would most likely have more cones sampling the image and should therefore have a higher resolution view.</p><p>These findings rule out reductions in the density of cone photoreceptors as the cause or effect of visual deficits associated with near-sightedness, adding to the understanding of this common condition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adaptive optics</kwd><kwd>myopia</kwd><kwd>fovea</kwd><kwd>cone photoreceptors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY023591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bensaid</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name><name><surname>Tiruveedhula</surname><given-names>Pavan</given-names></name><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Jianqiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Roorda</surname><given-names>Austin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08EY025010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ravikumar</surname><given-names>Sowmya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T35EY007139</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yiyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30EY003176</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roorda</surname><given-names>Austin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Despite evidence of retinal stretching with eye growth, cone photoreceptor sampling density in the foveal center of humans actually increases with eye length.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There has been a rapid increase in prevalence of myopia, of all magnitudes, in the period between 1971–1972 and 1999–2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vitale, 2009</xref>). Across sub-populations grouped by race, ethnicity and gender, several studies report axial length of the eye to be the primary variable related to myopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">González Blanco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iyamu et al., 2011</xref>).

All studies that find myopic visual deficits implicate retinal stretching as a possible cause, but what is actually happening structurally at the foveal center during myopic progression is not known. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to more carefully investigate how the length of the eye affects cone density at and near the foveal center.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Models for how photoreceptors change with eye growth</title><p>Two types of cone densities will be discussed in this study. Linear density quantifies how many cones are within a fixed area, in square mm, and serves as a way to evaluate physical retinal stretching caused by eye growth. Angular density quantifies how many cones are within one degree visual angle, (the visual angle on the retina is measured from the secondary nodal point of the eye). Angular density serves as a way to evaluate the visual implications of eye growth as it governs the sampling resolution of the eye.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates three models, along the lines of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Strang et al. (1998)</xref>, of how photoreceptor structure might be affected by myopic eye growth. In the first model, called the global expansion model, the retina is proportionally stretched with increasing axial length - cones are more spaced out in longer eyes - and linear density decreases with eye length. Assuming that the secondary nodal point remains at a fixed position relative to the anterior segment, the number of cones within a fixed angular area will remain constant. Therefore, angular cone density will be constant with eye length. In the second model, called the equatorial stretching model, the posterior retina simply moves axially further from the anterior segment of the eye so that the linear density does not change with eye length. Since the retina is moving further from the secondary nodal point, more cones will fall within a fixed angular area and the angular cone density will increase with eye length. The final model, called the over-development model, describes a structural photoreceptor change that mimics the changes that occur during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Springer and Hendrickson, 2004</xref>) whereby the photoreceptors continue to migrate towards the fovea as the eye grows. In this scenario, longer eyes will show both increased linear cone density and an even steeper increase in angular cone density. The model is motivated by observations of increased linear cone density in the foveas of marmosets that underwent lens-induced eye growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Troilo, 1998</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47148.004</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Three models of myopic eye growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Global expansion shows an eyeball that is proportionally stretched.

Combined with confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Webb et al., 1987</xref>), adaptive optics offers the highest contrast <italic>en face</italic> images of the foveal photoreceptor mosaic ever recorded in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roorda et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Despite continued advances in image quality, previous studies investigating cone packing and eye length have not made their measurements at the foveal center, the most important region for spatial vision but the most difficult to image owing to the small size of photoreceptors. There are a number of studies on cone packing and eye length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elsner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kitaguchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obata and Yanagi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2013</xref>) and here we summarize the published results that are most relevant to our study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chui et al. (2008)</xref> investigated angular and linear cone density at 1 mm and three degrees eccentricity. They found a significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) in linear cone density as a function of eye length at 1 mm (which, by angular distance, is closer to the fovea in a longer eye than in a shorter eye) in all directions except in the nasal retina. They found that the angular cone density at three degrees (which, by linear distance, is closer to the fovea, in a shorter eye than in a longer eye) increased with eye length, but the trends were not significant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al. (2010)</xref> made similar measures, but closer to the fovea (from 0.10 mm to 0.30 mm eccentricity). They found that linear cone density decreased with eye length, but the trends were not significant at the smallest eccentricities (0.1 and 0.2 mm). When the data were plotted in angular units and angular distance from the fovea, they found that angular cone density trended toward an increase with eye length but none of the trends were significant. A more recent study measured peak cone densities in the fovea as well as axial length for 22 eyes of 22 subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilk et al., 2017</xref>) but they did not plot peak cone density as a function of axial length, as it was not the aim of their study.

This is the first comprehensive study of cones in living eyes at the foveal center, the area solely responsible for a human’s fine spatial vision. Our results show that although some expansion does occur (linear cone density decreases with axial length) the angular sampling resolution actually increases, on average, with axial length. Prior to this study, the relationships between cone density and axial length were only made outside of the fovea, the closest being 0.1 mm, or 0.3 degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Although an eccentricity of 0.3 degrees might seem close, it is noted that the cone density drops precipitously just outside of the location of peak density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Curcio et al., 1990</xref>) as does human vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poletti et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rossi and Roorda, 2010b</xref>). There are other factors that govern peak cone density, however; eye length accounts for anywhere between 31% and 39% of the variance in cone density at the foveal center.</p><p>Our finding that the slopes of cone density vs. axial length are in opposite directions when plotted in linear (negative slope) and angular (positive slope) units, supports an eye growth model that lies between the global expansion model and an equatorial stretching model. Previous studies from our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2010</xref>) and also from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chui et al. (2008)</xref> leaned in the same direction. None of the cone density studies provide insight into the reasons why the photoreceptor density would behave this way with eye growth, but the results do align with other observations reported in the literature. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atchison et al. (2004)</xref> used magnetic resonance imaging and found that eyeball dimensions in axial myopes are variable but are generally larger in all directions with a weak tendency to be preferentially greater in the axial direction. Their reported eye growth patterns lie between that illustrated for the global expansion and equatorial stretching models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Our results differ from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilk et al. (2017)</xref> whose data support a global expansion model (i.e. there is no detectable change in angular cone density with axial length; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). But it is important to point out that their study did not set out to address the same question and the number of subjects with long axial lengths was disproportionately low.</p><p>Our results also differ from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Troilo (1998)</xref> who studied retinal cell topography in a marmoset animal myopia model. Higher cone packing densities were observed in the experimentally enlarged eyes compared to normal eyes in the fovea. Their result followed the overdevelopment model, which is the reason why we included it as one of the possible outcomes of our study. In fact, the overdevelopment model is an extension of Springer’s model of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Springer and Hendrickson, 2004</xref>), which offers a biomechanical explanation for how cone packing increases at the foveal center in a developing eye. While our data do not support the overdevelopment model, it does not preclude the existence of biomechanical factors working in opposition to simple global expansion.</p><p>The fact that angular cone density (visual sampling resolution) increases with eye length (myopia), at the peak density and at the PRL, means that poorer performance by myopes on resolution tasks cannot be explained by a decrease in photoreceptor sampling. The deficit must arise at a post-receptoral level.</p><p>Low-level causes for myopic visual deficits might arise from differences in the connectivity between cones and ganglion cells. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atchison et al. (2006)</xref> suggested that abnormal eye growth may be associated with a loss of ganglion cells. Alternately, if ganglion cells pool signals from multiple cones, then they will impose the retinal sampling limit and reduce certain aspects of visual performance (acuity, for example). Recent electron microscopy studies of a human fovea have revealed extensive convergence and divergence connections between photoreceptors and ganglion cells, albeit in an eye from an individual who was born prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dacey, 2018</xref>). These discoveries challenge our current understanding of neural connectivity in the foveal center and force us to consider the possibility of interindividual differences in foveal cone wiring. More experiments are necessary to explore these ideas.</p><p>To explain why low myopes did not perform as well on an acuity task as emmetropes, even after correction or bypassing of high order aberrations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rossi et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coletta and Watson (2006)</xref> both raised the possibility that myopes might have become desensitized to high frequency information (low level myopic amblyopia) as a result of having less exposure to a high contrast visual environment. In this case, it might be possible to train myopes to take advantage of their higher sampling resolution, but one myope in a follow up study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rossi and Roorda (2010a)</xref> never reached the acuity levels of emmetropes in the same study.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Comparisons with previous studies</title><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>Peak cone densities</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Curcio et al.

Our range of peak cone densities measured over a 10 arcmin (~50 micron) sampling window was 118,491 to 204,020 with an average of 163,242 cones/mm<sup>2</sup>.

All reports of cone densities from adaptive optics studies in living eyes are lower than reports from histology. Two possible reasons for this are (i) the excised tissue in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Curcio et al. (1990)</xref> underwent more shrinkage than estimated or (ii) the adaptive optics reports are subject to selection bias, where individuals with the highest angular cone densities might have been excluded because the image were less well resolved rendering the cones images too difficult to label with confidence. In our study, we attempted to image 73 eyes from 46 subjects and only succeeded in resolving cones across a sufficiently large region at and around the fovea in 28 of them. The reason the images from 45 eyes were not analyzed was due to poor or inconsistent image quality arising from a number of factors: Images from four eyes (three subjects) were not analyzed because their refractive errors were too high (all above –8D) and we ran into the limits of the deformable mirror’s dynamic range. Images from 18 eyes (13 subjects) that were taken early on in the study were not analyzed because the optics of AOSLO were not tuned well enough to resolve foveal cones. Images from four eyes (two subjects) were not analyzed because of uncorrectable image degradation caused by keratoconus and corneal scarring. Images from two eyes (one subject) were not analyzed because of excessive aberrations caused by an orthokeratology refractive correction. The cause of poor or inconsistent image quality among the remaining 17 eyes were varied, including ocular surface dryness, excessive eye motion and small pupils. The average refractive error among these remaining 17 eyes was about the same as the successful eyes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-1-2"><title>Anisotropic density distribution</title><p>Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Curcio et al.

Fortunately, the latest generation of adaptive optics ophthalmoscopes are making it easier and are facilitating new discoveries within this retinal region. The pattern of how cone density changes with eye growth lands somewhere between the global expansion and equatorial stretching models. The cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to eye length. Despite retinal stretching, myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes. Reports of reduced best-corrected central visual acuity in myopes compared to emmetropes cannot be explained by decreased photoreceptor density caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Foveal imaging</title><p>We used our latest generation adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) for foveal imaging.

A scatter plot of the positions of the blinking dot relative to the retina was generated and was fit with a bivariate ellipse using free online MATLAB scripts downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.visiondummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/error_ellipse.m">http://www.visiondummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/error_ellipse.m</ext-link>. The bivariate contour ellipse area (BCEA), which is the area of the best-fitting ellipse encompassing 68% of the points in the scatterplot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castet and Crossland, 2012</xref>) was used to quantify the fixation stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and the exact location of the PRL within the imaged cone mosaic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Image processing and analysis</title><p>High quality images were generated from the recorded videos offline using custom software (MATLAB, The MathWorks, Inc, Natick, MA) to measure and correct for distortions caused by eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stevenson and Roorda, 2005</xref>). An open source version of the code is posted at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lowvisionresearch/ReVAS">https://github.com/lowvisionresearch/ReVAS</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agaoglu et al., 2018</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/ReVAS">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/ReVAS</ext-link>). Poor-quality frames were manually excluded and registered frames were averaged into a single high signal-to-noise image. The processed images were stitched together (Photoshop; Adobe Systems, Inc, Mountain View, CA) to create an approximately 1.8-degree montage of the foveal cone mosaic.</p><p>We used custom software to identify and label individual cones in the AO retinal images. The program allows the user to select a region of interest and manually add and delete cone labels. A combination of both manual and automated methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li and Roorda, 2007</xref>) were used to identify cone locations as the current version of the program does not adequately recognize cones in the foveal center where they are dim and smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2010</xref>). All the cone coordinates were selected and reviewed by two of the authors. In some cases cones were too dim to be seen but there was only a gap in the mosaic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruce et al., 2015</xref>). If a space that might have been occupied by a cone was dim or dark, we would assume it was a cone and mark its location. We rationalize this for two reasons: First, if there is a gap in the mosaic, then it is likely that a cell is occupying that space, otherwise the adjacent cells would migrate to fill it in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scoles et al., 2014</xref>). Second, in our experience and of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pallikaris et al., 2003</xref>), cones that appear dark in one visit, can often appear bright in the next. In other cases (uncommon) the contrast was low in some regions or there were interference artifacts in the images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meadway and Sincich, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Putnam et al., 2010</xref>), making the cone locations slightly ambiguous. In these instances, we made manual cone selections based on the assumption that the cones were all similar in size and close-packed into a nearly hexagonal array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Curcio et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>Continuous density maps were generated by computing cone density within a circular cone sampling window of 10 arcminutes in diameter around every pixel location across the image. All cones whose centers fell on or within the boundary of the sampling window were counted. The size of the cone sampling windows was chosen for several reasons. First, it encompasses the typical range of eye motion during a typical fixation task. Second, the area was large enough to generate smooth maps, but small enough to resolve local changes. Smaller cone sampling windows showed slightly higher densities (see Discussion) but were also associated with more variability in the identification of the location of peak cone density. Changes in density with eccentricity were generated by computing the density in five-arcminute annuli surrounding the point of peak cone density. For linear density measures we used annuli with 25-micron widths.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Retinal Magnification Factor calculation</title><p>The exact angular dimensions of the AOSLO images were computed by imaging a calibrated model eye in the AOSLO system, but the conversion to linear dimensions on the retinal image requires additional measurements, since the dimensions of each eye governs the actual size of the image on its retina. The conversion from visual angle to retinal distance requires a measurement of the axial length of the eye and an estimation of the location of the secondary nodal point. We did paraxial ray tracing, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al. (2010)</xref>, in a four-surface schematic eye model to estimate the location of the secondary nodal point. The corneal first surface radius of curvature, the anterior chamber depth and the axial length were measured for each subject with an IOL Master (Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). The radius of the curvature of the back surface of the cornea was computed as 88.31% of the front surface as per the Gullstrand eye model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 1994</xref>). The indices of refraction of the media and the radii of curvature of the front and back lens surface were taken from the Gullstrand schematic eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vojniković and Tamajo, 2013</xref>). Once determined, retinal image size is related to visual angle by the equation:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∘</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where <italic>I</italic> is retinal image size, <italic>x</italic> is axial length, <italic>AN</italic>’ is the distance from the corneal apex to the eye’s second nodal point, and θ is the visual angle. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, myopic eyes, which generally have longer focal lengths, have proportionally larger retinal images.</p><p>Other methods to compute the retinal magnification factor (RMF) might have been used. We did a paraxial ray trace to find the secondary nodal point using lens parameters from a 6-surface Gullstrand eye model, and found that the RMFs were essentially identical. When we computed the RMF using an equation proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al. (1994)</xref> we found that the RMF was overestimated for hyperopic eyes and underestimated for myopic eyes. This discrepancy arises from the fact that Bennett’s equation is based on the assumption that the focal point of the eye’s optics coincides with the retina, which it does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Despite this known error, when we redid the analysis using RMFs computed using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al. (1994)</xref> equation, we still found a significant trend of reducing linear density with axial length, but only at the position of peak cone density. Of course, all the angular density calculations are unaffected by differences in the RMF.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Given the trends of increased angular density as a function of axial length that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript &quot;Human foveal cone photoreceptor topography and its dependence on eye length&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>As you will see, both reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work. I am including the reviews at the end of this letter, as there are a variety of specific and useful comments in them. As you will see, the reviewers' comments relate primarily to data analysis and interpretation.</p><p>We look forward to receiving the revised version of your manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic> </p><p>Wang et al. tackle an issue of fundamental importance in understanding mechanisms underlying human myopia as well as the basic processing of foveal visual signals. In general, I find the data to be high quality and the presentation to be quite strong. That said, there are some &quot;moderate&quot; issues that I think are important regarding rigor and transparency. First, the repeatability of foveal cone density measures has not been established. While there are automated algorithms assessing parafoveal cone mosaic, and reliability and repeatability has been demonstrated at those locations, I think the foveal cone mosaic is sufficiently different from an analytical perspective to warrant repeated measures. Similarly, the choice of model eye to convert angular to linear could be discussed more and ruled out as a contributing factor to your results (given there may be other models for converting to/from linear and angular density). Lastly, statistically, I think there may be some issues with using two eyes from some subjects but only one from others. Many ocular parameters show interocular symmetry, so the non-independence of some of the data should be reviewed by someone with more statistical expertise than I have.</p><p>In addition, the choice of sampling window was not discussed. To the one extreme, one could take the reciprocal of the area of a single cone at the very center and have an overestimate of &quot;density&quot;. Or, one could sample over the entire retina and have an underestimate of peak density. I think some justification is warranted, 25 microns may be as good as any, but if you used either a different fixed window, or picked some number of cones (100?) and increased the window until 100 cones were found may reinforce the data. A smaller point, was the sampling window &quot;bound&quot; or did you just count cells in a given window? It might be easy to re-run the coordinates with different sampling approaches to see how dependent the relationships you report are or are not dependent on this.</p><p>Also, as shown by Cooper et al., density is one of the more &quot;sensitive&quot; metrics, meaning that just a couple cones in error during identification can result in big changes in density. Spacing is more robust, where a few missed cells will not affect the local spacing estimate. Did you look at NND or ICD in μm and arcmin? Do you find the same differences?</p><p>Finally, there are a couple of instances in Table 2 where the density at the PRL is actually higher than that reported as the &quot;peak foveal cone density&quot; (20124, OD; 20170, OS). This is likely an issue related to the sampling window, but worth looking at as it is counter-intuitive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic> </p><p>I am most impressed by this paper. It is exceptionally well done in my view, and sets the standard for work of this sort. Previous work in this area of research is carefully reviewed and critiqued, and it seems to me that every paper related to the measurements made in the present paper is included, although admittedly I am not all that familiar with the research addressing the issue of foveal cone density as a function of axial length.</p><p>I found the paper well written, clear and compelling. The figures are well done and convincing. I have no issues with the findings, techniques or conclusions, and the discussion and supplementary data were useful.</p><p>My one question and suggestion, for the discussion perhaps, is why the preferred retinal locus for fixation (PRL) is displaced in many eyes from the area of peak cone density (Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2). This is not a new finding as noted, but what is the present thinking regarding this? Could it be related to differences to foveal cone wiring as suggested in the Discussion for causes of myopic visual deficits? Is there a hint of this in Table 2 in which those subjects with longer axial lengths seem to have longer PRL distances from the foveal center? Some discussion of this would be useful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47148.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>Wang et al. tackle an issue of fundamental importance in understanding mechanisms underlying human myopia as well as the basic processing of foveal visual signals.

However, we used two experienced image analysts (two of the authors) working in tandem to carefully identify every cone in the mosaic. The criteria for labeling cones was described explicitly in the manuscript. The effort took countless hours and only images and data for which both analysts were confident were used for further analysis.</p><p>To undertake a reliability/repeatability study for this analysis would require training two or more new image analysts to the same level of the current analysts. Even if funds and personnel were available, the time delays incurred by such an effort would be prohibitive.</p><p>Nevertheless, we do appreciate the reviewers point and to that end we have made all the images and cone locations available for download to any other interested group. We envision that these data could be used for an independent analysis of repeatability and reliability or our careful selections could be used to train AI-based approaches to count cones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the choice of model eye to convert angular to linear could be discussed more and ruled out as a contributing factor to your results (given there may be other models for converting to/from linear and angular density).</p></disp-quote><p>Our conversion between visual angle and linear distance on the retina was done using the maximum biometric data available to us from a Zeiss IOLMaster device. We employed paraxial ray tracing methods that have been described and discussed in a previous paper from our lab (Li et al., 2010).</p><p>The primary aim of the ray trace is to find the secondary nodal point of the eye. The secondary nodal point is one of the cardinal points of a thick lens optical system. Nodal points have the important property that the visual angle of object subtended from the primary nodal point matches the angle of its retinal image subtended by the secondary nodal point. If one knows the distance from the secondary nodal point to the retina, then the actual size of the image of any object of known visual angle can be computed using simple geometric calculations. Since our biometry was limited to corneal curvature, anterior chamber depth and axial length, we had to make some approximations to some of the variables in the ray trace, specifically the thickness of the cornea, the power of the second surface of the cornea relative to the first surface, and the power and thickness of the crystalline lens. For these, we used parameters from the Gullstrand model eye for a two-surface lens.</p><p>As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we recomputed the retinal magnification factor (RMF, in microns per degree) for a four-surface lens model and obtained nearly identical results. Any further analysis with these RMFs would be nearly indistinguishable from what is already in the manuscript so we did not include them in this response.

The formula is</p><p>RMF = 1000*tan(1/1.336)*(AL-1.82)</p><p>where AL is the axial length in mm, 1.82 is the distance in mm from the corneal vertex to the second principal plane in the Gullstrand model eye, and 1.336 refers to the index of refraction of the vitreous.</p><p>Incidentally, we used the Bennett equation in an earlier paper (Rossi et al., 2007), but we’ve since learned that it produces incorrect results. As stated in Li et al. (2010), the Bennett formula underestimates the RMF for myopes and overestimates the RMF for hyperopes since “this method assumes that the retina and the eye’s back focal plane coincide, which is not the case in myopia [or hyperopia]”. Despite underestimating the RMF for high myopia, a significant decrease in linear density with eye length is still observed, although only at the location of peak foveal density.

In our cohort, the average standard deviation of eye movement during fixation was 3.94 arcminutes.

We computed peak cone density and location of peak cone density for all 28 eyes for a range of cone sampling windows. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>. The plots suggest that cone sampling windows of less than 10 minutes of arc may add more variability to the cone density estimates and fovea center identification. We added some more discussion about this in the final paragraph of the Materials and methods: Image Processing and Analysis section.</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47148.027</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>The right plot shows that the peak foveal cone density increases as the cone sampling window is decreased.</title><p>Note that the increase with reducing sampling window is linear until about 10 arcminutes. The left plot shows that the variability in the location of the peak foveal density remains consistent (within about 1.5 arcminutes of the mean) with cone sampling windows of 10 arcminutes or greater.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47148-resp-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, as shown by Cooper et al., density is one of the more &quot;sensitive&quot; metrics, meaning that just a couple cones in error during identification can result in big changes in density. Spacing is more robust, where a few missed cells will not affect the local spacing estimate. Did you look at NND or ICD in μm and arcmin? Do you find the same differences?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose not to compute any metrics other than density. In our case, we were confident that all cones were labeled. Under such conditions, density is the most informative metric to report.</p><p>With regard to sensitivity, the number of cones within the 10 arcmin diameter cone sampling window at the foveal peak ranged from 264 to 414. A couple of extra and/or missing cone labels would lead to errors of &lt;1%. With good images and careful identification of cones according to our criteria stated in the Materials and methods, density is actually a very sensitive metric.</p><p>Given the close-packed nature of the foveal cones, we opted to compute row-to-row spacing of cones directly from the density estimates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, there are a couple of instances in Table 2 where the density at the PRL is actually higher than that reported as the &quot;peak foveal cone density&quot; (20124, OD; 20170, OS). This is likely an issue related to the sampling window, but worth looking at as it is counter-intuitive.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for spotting our oversight of this discrepancy. After reviewing our analysis code (Matlab) we discovered some rounding errors, specifically in our conversions from distances to pixels, that led to a series of small errors in our densities, including the ones that led to the two discrepancies spotted by this reviewer. We have since redone all the analyses for all eyes and have generated an entirely new set of density values for which we are much more confident. The new peak densities are slightly higher than originally reported by an average of 1.2% and the densities at the PRL are higher by 0.3%. Because of the new density values, we had to rerun all the statistics, corrected all numbers in the final four columns of Table 2, made small correction to many numbers throughout the manuscript, made changes to Figures 4, 5, 6, 7, and the three supplementary figures. These changes have not affected the primary findings or conclusions of this paper in any way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>I am most impressed by this paper. It is exceptionally well done in my view, and sets the standard for work of this sort. Previous work in this area of research is carefully reviewed and critiqued, and it seems to me that every paper related to the measurements made in the present paper is included, although admittedly I am not all that familiar with the research addressing the issue of foveal cone density as a function of axial length.</p><p>I found the paper well written, clear and compelling. The figures are well done and convincing. I have no issues with the findings, techniques or conclusions, and the discussion and supplementary data were useful.</p><p>My one question and suggestion, for the discussion perhaps, is why the preferred retinal locus for fixation (PRL) is displaced in many eyes from the area of peak cone density (Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and 2). This is not a new finding as noted, but what is the present thinking regarding this? Could it be related to differences to foveal cone wiring as suggested in the Discussion for causes of myopic visual deficits? Is there a hint of this in Table 2 in which those subjects with longer axial lengths seem to have longer PRL distances from the foveal center? Some discussion of this would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>The displacement between the PRL and the location of peak cone density is of interest to us but we do not want to offer any more discussion in the manuscript than we have already since it would all be speculative. Also, despite what the reviewer might see, there is no correlation between axial length and PRL displacement in both angular and linear distance.</p><p>But here are some opinions:</p><p>The differences in cone density between the PRL and peak cone density is not visually significant, as the sampling resolution at either location is generally better than typical acuity performance, and the cones oversample the retinal image at both locations. This is not stated explicitly but is implicit from the discussion.</p><p>At this time, we have not performed sufficient functional measurements to reveal what, if anything, is optimized at the PRL vs. the position of peak cone density.</p><p>Our working opinion is that a choice for the PRL is made during development, at a time when biophysical factors that cause reshaping of the foveal region are still taking place. The fact that the PRL, peak cone density, foveal avascular zone, and base of the foveal pit are so well-aligned in the normally-developed adult eye means that the right choice was generally made.</p></body></sub-article></article>
