pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38986.001</object-id><p>While genomic sequencing routinely identifies oncogenic alterations for the majority of cancers, many tumors harbor no discernable driver lesion. Here, we describe the exceptional molecular phenotype of a genomically quiet kidney tumor, clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma (CCPAP). In spite of a largely wild-type nuclear genome, CCPAP tumors exhibit severe depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and RNA and high levels of oxidative stress, reflecting a shift away from respiratory metabolism. Moreover, CCPAP tumors exhibit a distinct metabolic phenotype uniquely characterized by accumulation of the sugar alcohol sorbitol. Immunohistochemical staining of primary CCPAP tumor specimens recapitulates both the depletion of mtDNA-encoded proteins and a lipid-depleted metabolic phenotype, suggesting that the cytoplasmic clarity in CCPAP is primarily related to the presence of glycogen.

For example, loss of fumarate hydratase (<italic>FH</italic>), succinate dehydrogenase (<italic>SDH</italic>), or isocitrate dehydrogenase (<italic>IDH</italic>) induces pathological accumulation of metabolites which potently inhibit alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes, inducing hypermethylation of the genome and a fundamental reprogramming of cellular identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wallace, 2012</xref>). Similarly, Otto Warburg observed that tumors take up and ferment large quantities of glucose to lactate in normoxia (<italic>i.e.</italic> aerobic glycolysis), leading him to propose that mitochondrial respiration defects are the underlying basis for cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Warburg, 1956a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Warburg, 1956b</xref>). Data from tumor genomics, imaging and metabolomics have now demonstrated that not all tumors exhibit signatures of aerobic glycolysis, and that alterations both intrinsic to mitochondria (<italic>e.g.</italic> mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion) and extrinsic to mitochondria (<italic>e.g.</italic> increased glucose uptake) can induce aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vyas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zong et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While disruption of mitochondrial respiration is generally not viewed as a driver of oncogenesis, a handful of individual cancer types are peculiarly enriched for mitochondrial dysfunction. A recent study described signals of positive selection for loss-of-function somatic mutations in mtDNA in thyroid cancers and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (chRCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grandhi et al., 2017</xref>). In parallel, genomic studies have established that many histologies of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are associated with disruption of mitochondrial respiration and metabolism. For example, the most common RCC histology, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), is characterized by biallelic loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (<italic>VHL</italic>) tumor suppressor and subsequent activation of hypoxia inducible factor (<italic>HIF</italic>), suppressing mitochondrial respiration in favor of glycolytic metabolism. Similarly, chRCCs and renal oncocytomas are characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the mitochondrial genome resulting in accumulation of respiration-defective mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>). Rare subtypes of RCC, such as those driven by biallelic loss of the mitochondrial enzymes <italic>FH</italic> or <italic>SDH,</italic> also potently disrupt normal respiratory function, lending further evidence to the recurrent pattern of mitochondrial dysfunction across RCC histologies.</p><p>While a variety of RCC histologies (including clear cell, hereditary leiomyomatosis, and <italic>TCEB1</italic>-mutated subtypes) are characterized by activation of <italic>HIF</italic>, a substantial proportion of <italic>HIF</italic>-activated RCCs harbor no clear genetic cause for <italic>HIF</italic> upregulation. In particular, we and others have described a <italic>HIF</italic>-activated subtype of RCC characterized by cells with clear cytoplasm arranged in a papillary architecture, known as clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma (CCPAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rohan et al., 2011</xref>). CCPAP was initially described in kidneys with end stage renal disease (ESRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tickoo et al., 2006</xref>), but was subsequently also described in patients with normal renal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rohan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gobbo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williamson et al., 2013</xref>). Clinically, CCPAP tumors are of low grade and stage, and are thought to be generally more indolent in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gobbo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ross et al., 2012</xref>). Morphologically, CCPAP tumor cells are unique in that their nuclei are oriented away from the basement membrane in a linear fashion, and they lack high-grade features including prominent nucleoli, mitotic figures, necrosis and sarcomatoid differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gobbo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williamson et al., 2013</xref>). A handful of molecular studies have reported that cytogenetically, CCPAP tumors show neither deletion of chromosome 3p nor mutation of <italic>VHL</italic>, the characteristic molecular features of ccRCC. They also do not exhibit gains of chromosomes 7 and 17, or loss of chromosome Y, as commonly described in papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rohan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gobbo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williamson et al., 2013</xref>). While several studies have now molecularly profiled CCPAP tumors, no genetic drivers of the disease have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rohan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ross et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lawrie et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The unknown genetic basis of CCPAP tumors is a typical example of the large class of molecularly profiled tumors for which no clear driver alteration has been identified. Indeed, a number of studies now describe efforts to characterize the ‘long tail’ of potential genetic drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). Within our own institution’s prospective sequencing cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zehir et al., 2017</xref>), nearly 8% of tumors show no alterations in the 341 cancer-associated genes assayed by the clinical sequencing panel. Here, we report that the outstanding molecular phenotype distinguishing CCPAP tumors from normal tissue (and from other kidney cancers) is predominantly metabolic. Through comprehensive molecular analysis, we find that while CCPAP tumors appear to harbor no recurrent somatic alterations in nuclear DNA, they are broadly characterized by depletion of mtDNA, a drop in mitochondrial RNA expression, and excess levels of sorbitol, glutathione, and NADH. These findings are recapitulated by immunohistochemical staining of primary CCPAP and ccRCC specimens, indicating that in spite of a paucity of evident genetic drivers, CCPAP tumors harbor a distinct metabolic phenotype. This study offers a glimpse onto the pathological consequences of extreme mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction, and may serve as an archetype for understanding tumors with few or no discernable driver alterations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CCPAP is identified as metabolic outlier compared to ccRCC</title><p>In our recent metabolomic analysis of ccRCC tumors (herein referred to as dataset RC12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hakimi et al., 2016</xref>), two tumors were identified as metabolic outliers.

To do so, we calculated the change in metabolite abundance (which we call differential abundance) in CCPAP samples compared to ccRCC samples. After adjusting for multiple-hypothesis testing, we identified 200 differentially abundant metabolites with q value &lt; 0.1 and a greater than 2-fold change relative to ccRCC (non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Of these, 152 were differentially abundant compared to adjacent normal kidney tissue, confirming the CCPAP-specific nature of these metabolic changes (at least 2-fold change and q &lt; 0.1, Mann-Whitney test). Among these, sorbitol was among the metabolites with the largest change in abundance, exhibiting an approximately 8.5-fold increase in CCPAP samples compared to ccRCC samples (64-fold when excluding the atypical, high-sorbitol ccRCC samples) and a 36-fold elevation compared to normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). To confirm the elevation of sorbitol, we independently quantified absolute sorbitol abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) in six tumor samples profiled in RC13 and 3 additional CCPAP tumors not profiled in RC13 (which we referred to as dataset RC15). We observed good agreement between the two quantifications of sorbitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>. Despite only having six overlapping samples measured in RC13 and RC15, similarly good agreement was observed for the majority of the other commonly measured metabolites (12/27 with Pearson correlation p&lt;0.1, 16/27 with Pearson correlation p&lt;0.2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Three other sugar alcohols (palatinitol, erythritol, and ribitol) were also elevated approximately 4-fold or greater in CCPAP compared to ccRCC (&gt;5 fold when excluding atypical, high-sorbitol ccRCC samples, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), suggesting that a metabolic pathway associated with production or degradation of polyols is differentially active in CCPAP tumors. Importantly, sorbitol could be positively disambiguated from other sugar alcohols of the same mass by virtue of its distinct retention index (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Results of the differential abundance analysis were highly similar when restricting to low stage ccRCC samples in RC13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Under physiological conditions, sorbitol can be produced in response to high levels of osmotic stress.

Notably, CCPAP tumors had significantly elevated levels (&gt;12 fold) of both reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG), the cell’s primary anti-oxidants. Increases in abundance of other metabolites involved in the response to oxidative stress were also evident, for example a 4-fold increase in ophthalmate relative to ccRCC (with even greater elevation relative to normal tissue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Soga et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, a variety of lipids, especially in the class of glycerophosphoethanolamines, were broadly downregulated in CCPAP relative to both ccRCC and normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>To further understand the metabolic reprogramming underlying CCPAP, we mapped metabolic changes in CCPAP and in ccRCC (from our earlier study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hakimi et al., 2016</xref>) onto a map of central carbon metabolism, augmented with the polyol pathway used to produce/metabolize sorbitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Doing so exposed a clear distinction between ccRCC and CCPAP metabolism. While ccRCC tumors exhibit elevated levels of several metabolites in upper glycolysis (<italic>e.g.</italic> glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P)), levels of G6P and F6P in CCPAP were not different from normal. In contrast, levels of sorbitol and fructose, the metabolites of polyol pathway, were elevated &gt;30 fold in CCPAP relative to normal tissue. While fructose levels were also elevated in ccRCC (compared to normal), the levels of fructose were 5-fold higher in CCPAP than in ccRCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>We also observed that the NADH/NAD ratio, a measure of redox potential of the cell and a potential readout of respiratory chain function, was also elevated in CCPAP tumors compared to normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Determination of the NADH/NAD ratio using metabolomics data is susceptible to artifacts; therefore, we examined our data for other metabolomic changes which may be associated with an elevated NADH/NAD ratio. Using the Recon2 genome-scale human metabolic reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thiele et al., 2013</xref>), we identified all metabolic reactions in the cell dependent on oxidation of NADH/reduction of NAD, and intersected the list of participating metabolites with those measured in our study. We retained all reactions for which we measured all substrates and products. Because several of the central metabolites participating in reactions using NADH/NAD were not quantified in our dataset (e.g. pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate), a number of canonical NAD-dependent reactions were not retained. However, we were left with a list of 5 reactions (related to xanthine metabolism, sorbitol metabolism, ascorbate metabolism, and uracil metabolism). For each of these reactions, we calculated the ratio of the abundances of the more oxidized metabolite to the abundance of the more reduced metabolite (specifically, fructose/sorbitol, uracil/5,6 dihydrouracil, xanthine/hypoxanthine, urate/xanthine, dehydroascorbate/ascorbate). In conditions of elevated NADH/NAD, we would expect the chemical equilibrium to shift these ratios lower. Consistent with this, 4 of 5 metabolite ratios exhibit a drop in CCPAP tumors consistent with an elevated NADH/NAD ratio (i.e. a drop in the ratio). Interestingly, such a drop is not evident in ccRCC tumors with normal sorbitol levels, but is evident in the two sorbitol-high ccRCC tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). While metabolite abundance is not a surrogate for metabolic flux, a clear pattern of increases to the constituent metabolites of the polyol pathway (and a concomitant lack of changes to metabolite levels in upper glycolysis) suggests that CCPAP tumors may be preferentially shunt carbon flux to sorbitol, potentially as an approach for regenerating NAD+ and relieving redox imbalance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CCPAP exhibits dysfunctional mitochondrial respiration associated with depletion of mitochondrial DNA and RNA</title><p>To further understand the molecular mechanisms driving CCPAP pathology, we utilized several cases of misclassified CCPAP which had been submitted to and profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium in the ccRCC (TCGA ID: KIRC) study.

Mitochondria are heterogeneously composed of proteins encoded in both the 16 kb circular mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) and the conventional nuclear genome (nDNA). While the vast majority of mitochondrially-localizing proteins are encoded in nDNA, there are 13 mtDNA-encoded genes that produce proteins, all of which are essential integral membrane components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain or ATP synthase. Although mtDNA (and mRNAs produced from mtDNA) are highly abundant and typically captured by conventional DNA (often in an off-target manner) and RNA sequencing, analysis of these 13 genes is not commonly reported by the TCGA consortium.</p><p>To evaluate the possibility that the mitochondrial genome may be impacted in CCPAP tumors, we re-analyzed mitochondrial DNA sequencing reads available in the TCGA data for CCPAP samples. In prior work, our group estimated mtDNA copy number across ~322 ccRCC samples profiled by the TCGA, including 2 CCPAP samples misclassified as ccRCC. Re-examining this data, we found that the 2 CCPAP tumors were among the four samples lowest in mtDNA copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, Mann-Whitney p-value 0.016). Depletion of mtDNA copy number in a tumor cell may lead to a drop in mtRNA, and a consequent drop in the capacity of the cell to conduct oxygen-dependent mitochondrial respiration. Therefore, we evaluated whether mtRNA was reduced in 5 CCPAP samples profiled by RNA-sequencing by the TCGA using previously computed mtRNA expression levels from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reznik et al., 2017</xref>). In agreement with our finding of mtDNA depletion, CCPAP samples exhibited a &gt; 2 fold reduction in mtRNA levels compared to ccRCC tumor samples (t-test using TPM estimates from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reznik et al., 2017</xref>, p-value 0.0002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and a &gt; 3 fold reduction in mtRNA levels compared to adjacent-normal tissue in the KIRC study (p-value 10<sup>−6</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Analysis using nuclear-DNA encoded, mitochondrially-localizing genes (rather than genes encoded in the mitochondrial genome) yielded similar results: of the 852 genes in the Mitochondrion GO geneset and expressed at a minimal level in CCPAP tumors, 411 were downregulated and 99 were upregulated in CCPAP tumors compared to normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with the down-regulation of mitochondrial function due to mtDNA depletion, we found when re-visiting CCPAP metabolomics data that the abundance of aspartate, a metabolite whose abundance is dependent on normal function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain for its production, was reduced 3.5-fold in CCPAP relative to adjacent normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Fumarate, another metabolite typically considered to mitochondria-specific, was also reduced 4-fold in CCPAP relative to normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Altogether, the evidence of mtDNA and mtRNA depletion suggests that expression of mtDNA-encoded proteins is suppressed in CCPAP tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CCPAP tumors harbor a largely intact nuclear genome</title><p>Given the distinct landscape of metabolic and transcriptomic alterations characterizing CCPAP, we sought to determine if CCPAP tumors were driven by genetic alterations similar to those driving more common kidney cancer types, for example ccRCC or pRCC.

Finally, using an allele-specific copy number detection algorithm (FACETS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shen and Seshan, 2016</xref>), we found that CCPAP tumors are remarkably ‘copy-number quiet,’ exhibiting few if any focal copy number alterations and no arm-level copy number alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).

We identified few genomic rearrangements in the 5 WGS samples (8–12 rearrangements per sample). However, none of these were high-confidence as they were reported by &lt;10 reads and were not associated with a copy number change.

We found no non-synonymous mutations in any gene in our manually curated list. We also examined the possibility that other changes, for example alterations to regulatory regions in the genome, may alter the gene expression of essential mtDNA maintenance genes in CCPAP.

Using ultra-deep duplex sequencing of mtDNA in CCPAP tumor and adjacent-normal or blood samples (eight total samples), we evaluated whether deleterious/pathogenic mtDNA somatic variants exist in CCPAP samples. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, we observed a handful of non-synonymous mtDNA mutations, with a frequency of &lt;1 non-synonymous somatic mutation per sequenced tumor.

Principal components analysis of this data indicated that CCPAP cases did not cluster separately, but instead co-localized with adjacent-normal kidney tissue, rather than ccRCC tumor samples. This suggests that, from a DNA methylation perspective, CCPAP tumors resemble normal kidney tissue.</p><p>Taken together, the results above suggest that CCPAP tumors harbor a (likely small) set of cryptic driver alterations which were not identified by our profiling efforts. Such alterations may include, but are not limited to, mutations to enhancer or promoter regions, as well as epigenetic alterations (<italic>e.g.</italic> methylation). Our failure to identify recurrent mutations or copy number alterations is not atypical in the context of our institution’s clinical sequencing experience; in fact,~8% of all tumors prospectively deep sequenced for alterations in 341 cancer-associated genes fail to show a single mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zehir et al., 2017</xref>).

High levels of glutathione and opthalmate (a glutathione analog) in CCPAP (relative to normal kidney tissue as well as to ccRCC) suggest the cells have been rewired to combat high levels of oxidative stress. Moreover, microRNA analysis showed that the miR200 family (miR200a,b,c, miR429), which has been shown to be induced by oxidative stress and which suppresses the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), are upregulated in CCPAP relative to ccRCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lawrie et al., 2014</xref>). To evaluate oxidative stress levels directly, we performed IHC staining of 8-oxo-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), a marker of oxidative stress, on CCPAP tumor tissue, ccRCC tumor tissue, as well as adjacent normal tissue. We found that the intensity of 8-oxo-dG was higher in CCPAP compared with ccRCC and adjacent normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). A more comprehensive quantification using tissue array samples comprised of different subtypes of renal cell carcinoma also showed CCPAP has the highest 8-oxo-dG H-score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Importantly, data from our group and others have repeatedly demonstrated that elevation of glutathione is generically observed across many RCC histologies, including but not limited to clear-cell, chromophobe, and oncocytomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hakimi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gopal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Priolo et al., 2018</xref>). Our data here suggests that an elevated response to oxidative stress is particularly pronounced in CCPAP tumors, but cannot be used to distinguish them from other histologies.</p><p>High levels of 8-oxo-dG may indicate excess DNA damage as well as oxidative stress. Specifically, oxidation of guanine bases is associated with a high prevalence of C:G &gt; A:T transversions, typically associated with Signature 18 in the COSMIC database of mutation signatures. To determine if high levels of 8-oxo-dG in CCPAP tumors may be a readout of oxidative DNA damage, we analyzed the trinucleotide context of somatic mutations in all available CCPAP tumor samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, CCPAP tumors did not show an enrichment of C:G &gt; A:T mutations, suggesting that the mutations arising in CCPAP are not the consequence of excess oxidative damage. Together with their low mutation burden, we interpret this to mean that 8-oxo-dG is reporting high levels of oxidative stress which are being sufficiently handled by the cell’s stress response (e.g. elevated GSH levels) so as to not generate excess oxidative-stress-associated somatic mutations.</p><p>When stained with Haemotoxylin and Eosin (H and E), both CCPAP and ccRCC tumors display a clear cytoplasm. In ccRCC, this clear cytoplasm arsises from accumulated lipid and glycogen contents removed during fixation and processing for histology. To compare the composition of clear cytoplasm in CCPAP to ccRCC tumors, we stained specimens from both tumor types with Oil Red O (for lipids) and PAS and PAS-Diastase (for glycogen). Both CCPAP and ccRCC stained positively for PAS and were sensitive to diastase treatment (PAS-diastase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating the presence of cytoplasmic glycogen in both tumor types. However, unlike ccRCC tumors which stained diffusely positive for Oil Red O, CCPAP tumors are Oil Red O negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Consistently, the RC13 metabolomics data indicated that CCPAP and ccRCC tumors showed elevated levels of maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose (surrogates of glycogen content) compared to normal tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Meanwhile, the RC13 metabolomics data showed that CCPAP tumors are depleted of a variety of lipid classes compared to both ccRCC and adjacent normal kidney tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Together, these results indicate that CCPAP tumors do not contain high levels of intracytoplasmic lipids, and that the cytoplasmic clarity in CCPAP tumors is due to reasons distinct from those in ccRCC tumors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we have described a distinct class of kidney tumors characterized not by their genetics, but by their metabolism. We subjected CCPAP tumors to a battery of comprehensive genomic profiling, much of which was beyond the conventional clinical-grade targeted genetic sequencing offered to cancer patients for identification of driver alterations. With the exception of a single recurrent genotype (mtDNA depletion), no clear pattern of somatic alterations was evident in CCPAP tumors. On the other hand, metabolic analysis readily distinguished CCPAP tumors from their ccRCC counterparts, and identified a striking metabolic disruption in the polyol pathway that defined the metabolic phenotype. While genetic/epigenetic alterations are certainly the drivers of all (or nearly all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mack et al., 2014</xref>]) cancers, our data reinforces the notion that such driver alterations need not be the distinguishing molecular feature of the tumor itself. In analogy to the morphology and histology of a tumor, which arise from the tumor’s somatic alterations but are fundamentally distinct characteristics for tumor diagnosis and treatment, we propose that metabolism itself may (at least for some tumor types) be equally illuminating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reznik et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, it suggests that the study of cancers of unknown driver (which account for ~8% of all sequenced tumors at our institution) may benefit from holistic (<italic>i.e.</italic> non-genomic) profiling, including but not limited to epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic measurements.</p><p>The severe respiratory dysfunction in CCPAP argue for a new schema for understanding metabolic reprogramming in renal cell carcinomas in general. As described earlier, each of the common types of RCC are characterized in part by mitochondrial dysfunction: <italic>HIF</italic> activation and suppression of mitochondrial biogenesis in clear cell RCC, <italic>FH</italic> mutations in HLRCC, and mtDNA mutations in chromophobe RCC. Rare subtypes of RCC further support the recurring theme of mitochondrial dysfunction: mitochondrial Complex II dysfunction in SDH-mutant RCC, and loss-of-function mtDNA mutations in renal oncocytomas. Therefore, we propose here a ‘mitochondrial spectrum’ to describe the metabolism of RCCs, which is defined by the respective quantity and integrity of mitochondria in each RCC subtype (as reflected by the H-score of MT-CO1 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). At the far left end are CCPAP tumors, severely depleted of mtDNA and respiratory capacity. At the other end are oncocytomas, which accumulate massive mitochondrial mass as a response to pathogenically mutated mtDNA. Resting between these two extremes are the remaining cancer types, beginning with mtDNA-depleted clear cell tumors and proceeding to chromophobe renal cell carcinomas. Looking ahead, it will be interesting to understand how each of these tumors copes with its respective form of mitochondrial dysfunction; that is, if a depletion of mtDNA induces a different metabolic adaptation than a loss-of-function mutation to mtDNA.</p><p>While CCPAP tumors exhibit a uniquely high abundance of sorbitol, this should not be misconstrued as an indicator that flux through the polyol pathway has increased. Without the direct measurement of metabolic flux, it is not possible to disambiguate whether increased levels of polyols reflect increased flux through the polyol pathway, or conversely are the consequence of decreased catabolism of metabolites downstream of polyol compounds. However, additional interpretation of the metabolomics data may offer a clue toward resolving this question. Both of the terminal components of the polyol pathway (sorbitol-6-phosphate and fructose) are elevated in CCPAP tumors and correlated to the levels of sorbitol. This suggests that, if the accumulation of sorbitol is due to decreased utilization of metabolites downstream of sorbitol, the ‘choke-point’ most likely occurs after fructose and/or sorbitol-6-phosphate. Furthermore, studies of metabolomic changes associated with mitochondrial disease indicate that sorbitol accumulation is not a generic consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction, although its elevation has been observed in the blood of patients with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Esterhuizen et al., 2017</xref>). Together, this suggests that a combination of factors likely contribute to the accumulation of sorbitol in CCPAP.</p><p>It is furthermore notable that although the metabolomic and transcriptomic evidence available is suggestive of a down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in CCPAP, these tumors did not exhibit an obvious compensatory up-regulation of glycolysis. Specifically, lactate levels in CCPAP tumors were not elevated relative to normal tissue or ccRCC, nor were any other intermediates of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). If glycolytic flux is indeed not increased in compensation, this may ultimately reflect the indolent and slow-growing nature of these tumors.</p><p>Different histologies of renal cell carcinoma are believed to arise from distinct cells in the human nephron. On the basis of gene expression data, ccRCC and papillary RCC (pRCC) are believed to derive from proximal tubule cells, while chromophobe RCC (chRCC) is believed to arise from the distal tubule. Because CCPAP is rare and slow-growing, no commercial CCPAP cell lines are available as models. To infer the cell-of-origin of CCPAP, we compared the transcriptomic profiles (from the TCGA) of ccRCC, pRCC, chRCC, and CCPAP with transcriptional profiles of microdissected regions of mouse kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheval et al., 2012</xref>). Doing so, we found that while ccRCC and pRCC tumors most resemble cells of the proximal tubule and chRCC tumors resemble cells of the distal tubule, CCPAP tumors resemble cells of the collecting duct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is consistent with prior immunohistochemical findings showing that CCPAP tumors stain positive for the collecting duct marker 34BE12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheval et al., 2012</xref>). Based on these findings, future efforts at developing in vitro models of CCPAP may benefit from use of collecting duct cells. It will be of particular interest to determine if the unique activity of the polyol pathway evident in CCPAP tumors is reflected in the metabolism of the collecting duct.</p><p>An interesting aspect of CCPAP RCC is that despite wild-type <italic>VHL</italic> and <italic>TCEB1,</italic> CCPAP tumors display upregulated <italic>HIF1</italic> protein as well as elevated levels of downstream HIF targets (<italic>CA9</italic>, <italic>GLUT1</italic>) by IHC staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rohan et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, our gene set enrichment analysis comparing CCPAP and normal tissues also show that the hypoxic response is among the most upregulated pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Meanwhile, CCPAP tumors displayed biomarkers indicative of elevated levels of oxidative stress compared with CCRCC or normal tissues. Conceivably, high levels of oxidative stress could inhibit prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) activity to prevent the hydroxylation of HIF and subsequent VHL-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mansfield et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan et al., 2007</xref>), which would be responsible for HIF activation in CCPAP. Other, previously undescribed mechanisms may also be the source of HIF activation in CCPAP. Interestingly, both HIF activation and oxidative stress have been shown to cause mtDNA depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mansouri et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suliman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shokolenko et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, it is possible the high level of oxidative stress and the consequent HIF activation in CCPAP could cooperatively induce mtDNA depletion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit Anti- <break/>TOM20 Antibody</td><td>Santa Cruz <break/>Biotechnology</td><td>Cat# sc-11415, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2207533">AB_2207533</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse Anti- <break/>MTCO1 Antibody</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab14705, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2084810">AB_2084810</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse Anti-8- <break/>Oxo-dG Antibody</td><td>Genox <break/>Corpooration</td><td>Cat# MOG-020P, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1106819">AB_1106819</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:400)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample acquisition and preparation for sequencing</title><p>Human whole exome sequencing library preparation and sequencing 51 Mb.

Briefly, the algorithm phases heterozygous SNPs with use of the 1000 genomes genotypes as a reference panel. The resulting haplotypes are corrected for occasional errors in phasing in regions with low linkage disequilibrium. After segmentation of the resulting b-allele frequency (BAF) values, t-tests are performed on the BAFs of each copy number segment to identify whether they correspond to the value resulting from a fully clonal copy number change. If not, the copy number segment is represented as a mixture of 2 different copy number states, with the fraction of cells bearing each copy number state estimated from the average BAF of the heterozygous SNPs in that segment. The Battenberg algorithm could not be applied to chromosome X since BAFs are uninformative for male subjects. For this chromosome, logR values were segmented and segmented logR values were converted to copy number estimates as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Loo et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Without application of the Battenberg algorithm, the resolution of subclonal copy number states is not possible, so copy number segments are called as single integer values (corresponding to the copy number state of the dominant cancer clone) on chromosome X.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Mutational signature analysis</title><p>Mutational signature analysis of the substitutions was performed using the R package DeconstructSigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosenthal et al., 2016</xref>).

primarily tumor/germline sequencing of primary human tumor specimens, and constitutes human subject data. To protect the privacy of the human subjects, we have included somatic mutation calls in Figure 4 Source Data 1, but have withheld germline information. Source data have been provided for Figures 1-5. Controlled access for TCGA sequencing data (RNA-sequencing and whole exome sequencing of CCPAP tumors) are available via GDC commons data portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/">https://gdc.cancer.gov/</ext-link>) by querying the 5 CCPAP sample IDs (BP-4760, BP-4784, BP-4795, DV-5567, BP-4177).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ralph DeBerardinis as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor.

In some forms of kidney cancer, these alterations result from recurrent driver mutations such as the loss of VHL, fumarate hydratase, or components of the succinate dehydrogenase complex. Here the authors use metabolic and molecular analyses to characterize a distinct type of renal cancer, clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma (CCPAP), which shares some histological characteristics with the much more common clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), but lacks the usual mutations observed in those tumors. A metabolomic analysis revealed numerous changes that distinguish CCPAP from either adjacent kidney tissue or ccRCC tumors; these included enhanced markers of oxidative stress and a large increase in sorbitol and other sugar alcohols. Other molecular analyses revealed marked suppression of transcripts related to mitochondrial metabolism, including transcripts from the nuclear genome and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The mtDNA copy number was also suppressed relative to kidney and ccRCC. Surprisingly, despite these consistent molecular and metabolic features, exome and genome sequencing failed to identify recurrent mutations in a modestly-sized cohort of CCPAP tumors. The authors conclude by arguing for non-genomic profiling including metabolomics as a means to classify tumors. Overall, the paper provides a thorough analysis of a rare but interesting subclass of tumors that may ultimately inform us about the role of metabolic alterations in tumor initiation or progression.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The metabolomic analysis is thorough, but based entirely on semi-quantitative measurements. It would improve the analysis if the authors could definitively quantify some of the more important metabolites, particularly sorbitol, which the authors define as a key metabolite in these tumors. The authors should also describe how they differentiated sorbitol from other sugars with the same mass.</p><p>2) The authors use the metabolomics data to infer a shift away from oxidative metabolism, but classical markers of impaired respiration (e.g. elevated lactate) are not observed in the heat map. This warrants discussion.</p><p>3) It is unclear whether the data really demonstrate a change in the NAD+/NADH ratio in CCPAP. This ratio should impact many metabolic reactions, so if possible the authors should highlight other metabolites from their data set in addition to sorbitol consistent with an impaired ratio. Using metabolomics to calculate the NAD+/NADH ratio is potentially fraught with artifacts, so an orthogonal method should be used to validate the ratio. Also, it is curious that the ratio is similar between ccRCCs and CCPAP, but CCPAPs accumulate much more sorbitol. Is sorbitol elevation a general consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction, or are there additional factors specific to CCPAP that favor soribitol accumulation?</p><p>4) The reviewers raised several questions about the sorbitol labeling experiment in Figure 6. First, the overall abundance of sorbitol in all these conditions is low; in the mock condition, the level is low enough that it is difficult to rule out modest labeling of the pool. Conditions should be altered (e.g. increasing the cell number) to yield a larger sorbitol pool for analysis. Second, this experiment should be extended beyond a single 16 hour time point. Analyzing sorbitol enrichment at several time points to thoroughly assess steady-state labeling, preferably together with quantitation of labeled sorbitol abundance, would better make the case for increased flux through this pathway in the context of electron transport chain inhibition. Third, interpreting the labeling data requires some knowledge of the rates of fructose uptake and the fractional labeling of fructose in the cells. Fourth, the relatively modest labeling of sorbitol argues that other carbon sources (e.g. glucose) contribute to the pool. This should be evaluated by performing similar experiments with labeled glucose.</p><p>5) The overabundance of sorbitol in vivo is interpreted as excess synthetic flux, but it is also possible that CCPAP tumors reduce utilization of polyol products. Any data to differentiate these possibilities should be included in the paper, or at least the authors should acknowledge this possibility in the Discussion.</p><p>6) Does depletion of mtDNA in CCPAP accompany reduced mitochondrial mass? If tissue is available, electron microscopy to estimate the mitochondrial mass content would help address this question.</p><p>7) There were concerns with the claim that CCPAP tumors experience oxidative stress. As with the NAD+/NADH ratio, it is difficult to obtain reliable measurements of GSH and GSSH using metabolomics. 8-oxo-dG may report oxidative stress, but it also indicates DNA damage. The authors should better assess oxidative stress in these tumors, or soften the argument that CCPAP and ccRCC tumors differ in oxidative stress.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38986.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The metabolomic analysis is thorough, but based entirely on semi-quantitative measurements.

We have taken several different approaches to confirm the validity of our metabolite measurements, see below.</p><p>a) Using a distinct metabolomic platform (RC15, see Materials and methods) we ran a standard curve with sorbitol to determine the absolute concentration of sorbitol in several CCPAP tumor samples, including both high- and low sorbitol CCPAP tumors (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). The levels of sorbitol in these tumors accumulate to on the order of 100 ug/mg of tissue, with significant differences between both high-sorbitol/low-sorbitol and tumor/normal samples. This data was in good agreement with the Metabolon measurements of sorbitol(Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). As part of this analysis, we also analyzed 3 additional CCPAP tumors in RC15 (samples 225, 350, and 396), and observed similarly high levels of sorbitol as of the samples profiled in RC13.</p><p>b) With regard to the question of disambiguating sorbitol from other sugars with the same mass, we returned to the original Metabolon data. As shown in a newly-included Figure 2—source data 2, sorbitol had a distinct retention index from other sugar alcohols with the same mass (e.g. 1843 for sorbitol vs. 1839 for mannitol). This is indicated in the first paragraph of the subsection CCPAP is metabolically characterized by alterations to sorbitol metabolism and oxidative stress pathways”.</p><p>c) We further evaluated whether data from the 6 samples profiled both by Metabolon (RC13) and the Michigan group (RC15) exhibited reproducible patterns. As shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, for the majority of metabolites profiled by both of the platforms, we observed similar patterns of abundance. However, some metabolites did show differences in abundance, which may arise from both biological variation (physically distinct areas of the tumor were profiled) as well as technical noise/error. This result is described in the aforementioned paragraph. As noted in point a above, sorbitol abundance was highly similar between the Michigan and Metabolon data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use the metabolomics data to infer a shift away from oxidative metabolism, but classical markers of impaired respiration (e.g. elevated lactate) are not observed in the heat map. This warrants discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and have now discussed this in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion. Briefly, we believe that, because these tumors are slow growing and largely indolent, they may not up-regulate glycolytic flux to the same extent as other, more malignant cancers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is unclear whether the data really demonstrate a change in the NAD+/NADH ratio in CCPAP. This ratio should impact many metabolic reactions, so if possible the authors should highlight other metabolites from their data set in addition to sorbitol consistent with an impaired ratio. Using metabolomics to calculate the NAD+/NADH ratio is potentially fraught with artifacts, so an orthogonal method should be used to validate the ratio. Also, it is curious that the ratio is similar between ccRCCs and CCPAP, but CCPAPs accumulate much more sorbitol. Is sorbitol elevation a general consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction, or are there additional factors specific to CCPAP that favor soribitol accumulation?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct. To clarify whether the NADH/NAD ratio was substantially changed in CCPAP relative to normal tissue, we used the Recon2 human metabolic reconstruction to identify all metabolic reactions in the cell which are dependent on oxidation of NADH/reduction of NAD. We obtained a list of all participating metabolites in these reactions, and then intersected that list with the metabolites measured in our study. We retained all reactions for which we measured all substrates and products. Because several of the central metabolites participating in reactions using NADH/NADH were not quantified in our dataset (e.g. pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate), a number of canonical NAD-dependent reactions were not retained. However, we were left with a list of 5 reactions (related to xanthine metabolism, sorbitol metabolism, ascorbate metabolism, and uracil metabolism). For each of these reactions, we calculated the ratio of the abundances of the more oxidized metabolite to the abundance of the more reduced metabolite (specifically, fructose/sorbitol, uracil/5,6 dihydrouracil, xanthine/hypoxanthine, urate/xanthine). In conditions of elevated NADH/NAD, we would expect the chemical equilibrium to shift these ratios lower. Consistent with this, of these 5 ratios, 4 exhibit a shift in metabolite levels consistent with an elevated NADH/NAD ratio (i.e. a depletion in the ratio). This is shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and mentioned in the last paragraph of the subsection “CCPAP is metabolically characterized by alterations to sorbitol metabolism and oxidative stress pathways”.</p><p>To determine if sorbitol accumulation has been observed in other contexts associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, we reviewed the literature. A review of metabolomic changes associated with (germline) mitochondrial disease discussed the pattern of metabolic changes associated with various mitochondrial diseases. Interestingly, only one report described an accumulation of sorbitol in patients with PEO, and even in this case, it was not discussed in the main text. Based on this, we speculate that sorbitol accumulation in CCPAP is the outcome of somatic genetic changes specific to the tumor and the cellular lineage. We describe this in the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The reviewers raised several questions about the sorbitol labeling experiment in Figure 6. First, the overall abundance of sorbitol in all these conditions is low; in the mock condition, the level is low enough that it is difficult to rule out modest labeling of the pool.

We performed experiments by using more cells (from 10 cm dishes instead of 6 well dish), labeling with either U13C-fructose or U13C-glucose, and harvesting at 5 additional time points (0h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 24h). We have included several of the key data points in Author response images 1-3, from which we have concluded that (1) both glucose and fructose contributed modestly to flux into sorbitol, and (2) that glucose/fructose-derived flux into sorbitol is not dependent on inhibition of electron transport chain activity (at least, in our model system). These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A-C</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Sorbitol Labeling from Glucose or Fructose in Mock Condition (<bold>A</bold>), Antimycin A Condition (<bold>B</bold>), and Rho-Zero Condition (<bold>C</bold>).</title><p>Left panel indicates total ion count.

It is possible that the extremely small pool of analyzed sorbitol led to an error in our labeling quantification. As the reviewers correctly suggested, increasing cell number and using several time points ameliorated this issue. As a result of these experiments, we have removed the data associated with the sorbitol labeling experiment from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The overabundance of sorbitol in vivo is interpreted as excess synthetic flux, but it is also possible that CCPAP tumors reduce utilization of polyol products. Any data to differentiate these possibilities should be included in the paper, or at least the authors should acknowledge this possibility in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that it is also possible the reduced utilization of sorbitol products can lead to the overabundance of sorbitol in vivo. We added a discussion of this in the main text:</p><p>“While CCPAP tumors exhibit a uniquely high abundance of sorbitol, this should not be misconstrued as an indicator that flux through the polyol pathway has increased. […] This suggests that, if the accumulation of sorbitol is due to decreased utilization of metabolites downstream of sorbitol, the “choke-point” most likely occurs after fructose and/or sorbitol-6-phosphate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Does depletion of mtDNA in CCPAP accompany reduced mitochondrial mass? If tissue is available, electron microscopy to estimate the mitochondrial mass content would help address this question.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for asking us to clarify. The clinical management of RCC (and the rarity of CCPAP tumors) makes it difficult to obtain CCPAP tissue for electron microscopy; preoperative biopsies are generally not done in the clinical care of RCC patients, meaning that the histology is only identified after the tumor has been removed and not amenable to electron microscopy. However, we have several additional pieces of data that we use to infer that mitochondrial mass is indeed reduced in CCPAP tumors relative to normal tissue:</p><p>a) We immunohistochemically assess the levels of TOM20, an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, in CCPAP and adjacent normal tissue. We consistently find that TOM20 is reduced in CCPAP relative to normal tissue. However, the degree of depletion was smaller than when using MT-CO1 as the immunohistochemical marker (Figure 5).</p><p>b) We examined the expression levels of nuclear-DNA-encoded genes localizing to mitochondria. These genes are broadly down-regulated in CCPAP relative to normal kidney tissue in the TCGA (subsection “CCPAP exhibits dysfunctional mitochondrial respiration associated with depletion of 219 mitochondrial DNA and RNA”, last paragraph, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). Specifically, of the 852 genes in the Mitochondrion GO geneset and expressed at a minimal level in CCPAP tumors, 411 were downregulated and 99 were upregulated in CCPAP tumors compared to normal tissue.</p><p>Together, these two pieces of data suggest that mitochondrial mass is indeed lower in CCPAP tumors, and (secondarily) that one of the most significant contributors to this reduction in mass is depletion of mtDNA itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There were concerns with the claim that CCPAP tumors experience oxidative stress. As with the NAD+/NADH ratio, it is difficult to obtain reliable measurements of GSH and GSSH using metabolomics. 8-oxo-dG may report oxidative stress, but it also indicates DNA damage. The authors should better assess oxidative stress in these tumors, or soften the argument that CCPAP and ccRCC tumors differ in oxidative stress.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have made several revisions to the manuscript in this regard:</p><p>a) Abundant data from the last 5 years have demonstrated that different mutation-generated biological processes leave distinct signatures of DNA damage, e.g. the preference for C&gt;A mutations at TpCpT trinucleotides in POLE-mutated tumors. Oxidative stress similarly induces preferential C&gt;A mutations. Using our whole genome and whole exome sequencing data, we analyzed mutation signatures from each our genomically profiled tumors. We observed that the majority of mutations were C&gt;T, which is not consistent with the expected bias towards C&gt;A mutations in conditions of high oxidative stress (subsection “Immunohistochemical Validation of the Molecular Phenotype of CCPAP”, third paragraph, Figure 5—figure supplement 2). We interpret this to mean that 8-oxo-dG is reporting high levels of oxidative stress which are being sufficiently handled by the cell’s stress response (e.g.elevated GSH levels) so as to not generate excess oxidative stress-associated somatic mutations. We elaborate on this in the aforementioned paragraph.</p><p>b) Data from our lab and many others have repeatedly indicated that apparently all histologies of RCC (clear cell, chromophobe, oncocytoma, CCPAP; perhaps not papillary RCC, there is only sparse data) have elevated GSH and GSSG levels. Therefore, it is unlikely that this is a distinguishing molecular feature of CCPAP, and we agree that our conclusions should be softened in the manuscript. We have revised the manuscript to indicate this in the aforementioned paragraph.</p></body></sub-article></article>
