Orai1 forms the pore subunit of CRAC channels and Stim1 is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor. Upon store-depletion, Stim1 translocates to domains of ER adjacent to the plasma membrane where it interacts with and clusters Orai1 hexamers to form the CRAC channel complex. Molecular steps enabling activation of SOCE via CRAC channel clusters remain incompletely defined. Here we identify an essential role of α-SNAP in mediating functional coupling of Stim1 and Orai1 molecules to activate SOCE. This role for α-SNAP is direct and independent of its known activity in NSF dependent SNARE complex disassembly. Importantly, Stim1-Orai1 clustering still occurs in the absence of α-SNAP but its inability to support SOCE reveals that a previously unsuspected molecular re-arrangement within CRAC channel clusters is necessary for SOCE.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00802.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00802.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00802.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Calcium is an essential element for many biological functions. In particular, the movement of calcium ions through the cell membrane has a central role in many of the signalling pathways that cells use to communicate with other cells. Signals are produced by calcium ions both entering and leaving the cell, with information being contained in the rate, location, and duration of the flow of ions.</p><p>Calcium is stored inside cells in a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, and when stores of calcium are low, special channels in the cell membrane called CRAC (calcium release activated calcium) channels are used to ferry more calcium ions into the cell. This process, known as store-operated calcium entry, relies on two important groups of proteins: the Stim proteins that sense when calcium stores are low; and, the Orai structural proteins that form the actual channel.</p><p>Previous work has shown that when the calcium stores are low, the Stim proteins—which reside in the endoplasmic reticulum—form clusters and these clusters then move to a part of the endoplasmic reticulum that is next to the cell membrane, where they join the Orai1 proteins to form larger clusters. However, to date it has been unclear whether Stim-Orai clustering at the cell membrane is sufficient for CRAC channels to open, or if additional steps are involved.</p><p>Miao et al. now show that another protein is involved in the formation of functional CRAC channels. Working with fruit fly cells, Miao et al. used genetic techniques to prevent the expression of various proteins that were thought to have a role in the movement of calcium ions through the cell membrane. One of these candidates, a protein called α-SNAP that is found in the internal fluid of the cell, was identified as having a central role in the import of calcium ions into the cell. Further work showed that α-SNAP re-organizes the Stim and Orai proteins to produce working CRAC channels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00802.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00802.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>CRAC channel</kwd><kwd>SNAP</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>Orai</kwd><kwd>Stim</kwd><kwd>SOCE</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rheumatic Diseases Core Center Piot and Feasibility Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH P30AR048335</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vig</surname><given-names>Monika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>α-SNAP mediated rearrangement of Stim1 and Orai1 molecules within CRAC channel clusters is required for store-operated calcium entry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Store-operated calcium entry or SOCE is activated in response to the depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores, and constitutes a primary mechanism of calcium influx in excitable and non-excitable cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Parekh and Putney, 2005</xref>). Store-operated calcium release activated calcium (CRAC) channels have been extensively studied for their role in the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) regulated gene expression in lymphocytes and other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lewis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crabtree and Olson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feske et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Parekh and Putney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vig and Kinet, 2009</xref>). Previously, genome-wide RNAi screens in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell lines led to the identification of ER-resident STIMs as the store sensors and plasma membrane (PM) resident Orai/CRACMs as the pore forming subunit of CRAC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Feske et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peinelt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Prakriya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yeromin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vig et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2006b</xref>). Stim1, and its homolog Stim2, contain a calcium-sensing EF-hand like domain facing the ER lumen. Upon store-depletion, Stim1 oligomerizes and concentrates in regions of ER directly adjacent to the PM, frequently referred to as junctional ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stathopulos et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stathopulos et al., 2008</xref>). While some factors involved in store-dependent and store-independent Stim1 clustering have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Honnappa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Smyth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Srikanth et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walsh et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krapivinsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lewis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Singaravelu et al., 2011</xref>), little is known about the final steps in CRAC channel activation. For instance, Orai1 multimers are thought to diffuse freely until trapped by Stim1 clusters in the ER–PM junctions, with active CRAC channels consisting of Orai1 hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Penna et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Park et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Madl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Walsh et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hou et al., 2012</xref>), however, it remains unexplored whether mere trapping of Orai1 by Stim1 in ER–PM junctions is sufficient or additional molecular steps enable optimal activation of SOCE. We hypothesized that additional cytosolic proteins might be necessary to impart functionality to Stim1–Orai1 clusters that constitute the CRAC channel complex and adopted a candidate-based approach based on our earlier genome-wide RNAi screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vig et al., 2006b</xref>).</p><p>Here we identify a direct and unexpected role for α-SNAP in the activation of SOCE. α-SNAP is a cytosolic protein with tetra-tricopeptide repeat (TPR)-like helical domains that bridges N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein (NSF) to soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes to promote their disassembly and SNARE recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clary et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2012</xref>). We find that α-SNAP directly and independently binds Stim1 and Orai1 to regulate the function and molecular composition of Stim1–Orai1 clusters that form the CRAC channel complex. This role for α-SNAP in SOCE is independent of its conventional role in facilitating NSF mediated SNARE complex disassembly. Thus, we have identified a novel role for α-SNAP and our data define a new α-SNAP dependent step in the physiological activation of SOCE via CRAC channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>α-SNAP depletion strongly reduces SOCE and NFAT activation</title><p>To test our hypothesis that additional proteins are needed to facilitate SOCE under physiological conditions, we used ∼200 to 500 base pair long double stranded RNA (dsRNA) to deplete the expression of six genes that we previously identified as candidates in a genome-wide RNAi screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vig et al., 2006b</xref>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kc cells. We found that knockdown of soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP) strongly reduces SOCE by day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Given the almost complete inhibition of SOCE in SNAP deficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, we hypothesized that SNAP might engage in novel, SOCE specific protein–protein interactions that may or may not involve NSF and SNAREs. α- and β-SNAP are the two mammalian proteins most closely related to <italic>Drosophila</italic> SNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). α-SNAP is ubiquitously expressed while β-SNAP expression is largely restricted to the brain. We depleted α-SNAP in HEK-293 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) using lentivirus-based RNAi constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and found SOCE to be strongly inhibited by day three compared to cells treated with control RNAi. By day five, depletion of α-SNAP caused cell rounding in adherent cell lines; we therefore restricted our analysis to adherent cells at early time-points. We confirmed the efficiency of α-SNAP knockdown for each experiment on western blots of whole cell lysates (WCLs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and by immunostaining cells with anti-α-SNAP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Importantly, when we reconstituted α-SNAP deficient HEK 293 cells with an RNAi resistant version of α-SNAP we found that SOCE was largely restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Defective SOCE in α-SNAP deficient HEK 293 cells could also be restored by over-expressing β-SNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). γ-SNAP is a third SNAP protein widely expressed in mammalian tissues but is less similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> SNAP and α-SNAP than β-SNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). γ-SNAP depletion failed to inhibit SOCE in HEK 293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) and γ-SNAP over-expression did not compensate for α-SNAP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00802.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>α-SNAP depletion inhibits SOCE and NFAT activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average Fura-2 ratios of Drosophila Kc cells treated with dsRNA targeting <italic>SNAP</italic> (red) or <italic>Rho-1</italic> (black) for 3 days, and stimulated with 1 μM TG to measure SOCE using flexstation.

To test this hypothesis and directly place α-SNAP in the molecular sequence of SOCE, we first asked whether the final molecular step of CAD domain mediated activation of SOCE via Orai1 is intact in α-SNAP depleted cells. To address this, we generated an inducible stable HEK 293 cell line, co-expressing Orai1 along with either full length Stim1 or just the soluble CAD domain of Stim1. As expected, α-SNAP depletion caused significant inhibition of SOCE in cells co-expressing full length Stim1 and Orai1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). However, SOCE in cells co-expressing the cytosolic CAD fragment of Stim1 along with Orai1, although overall smaller, was resistant to α-SNAP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and 5F</xref>). Similarly, basal calcium levels in cells co-expressing the cytosolic CAD fragment of Stim1 along with Orai1, although higher compared to WT HEK 293 cells, were unaffected by α-SNAP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Importantly, the lack of effect of α-SNAP depletion on CAD mediated constitutive and SOCE conclusively rules out any possible unknown effects on membrane potential or membrane trafficking of other components contributing to the activation of SOCE. Taken together, these data demonstrate that α-SNAP directly binds specific domains within Stim1 and Orai1 to enable a molecular step that precedes CAD mediated activation of SOCE in cells expressing full length Stim1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>α-SNAP regulates the molecular composition of CRAC channel clusters in ER–PM junctions</title><p>Because α-SNAP binds the CAD domain of Stim1, we wondered whether α-SNAP contributes to the formation of store-depletion induced Stim1 clusters in the junctional ER. To observe these plasma membrane proximal regions of ER in live cells and to determine whether α-SNAP depletion affects Stim1 clustering in the junctional ER, we used Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy. While the ability of Stim1 to oligomerize and translocate to the junctional ER upon store-depletion appeared normal in α-SNAP deficient cells, the size of Stim1-Orai1 clusters appeared larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We adopted a localized thresholding method to detect Stim1-Orai1 cluster boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), used it to quantify the size and intensity of individual Stim1–Orai1 clusters, and found that α-SNAP depletion increased the overall size of CRAC channel clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Because Orai1 is thought to be largely dependent on Stim1 for its clustering in ER–PM junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stathopulos et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Varnai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stathopulos et al., 2008</xref>), we hypothesized that this increase in cluster size could result from an increase in the density of Stim1 in the junctional ER or could reflect a specific defect in the ability of Stim1 to efficiently co-cluster Orai1. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first quantified the average intensity of CFP-Stim1 in individual Stim1–Orai1 clusters. We did not find an appreciable difference in the average intensity of CFP-Stim1 estimated from Stim1–Orai1 clusters in control or α-SNAP depleted, HEK 293 cells stably expressing CFP-Stim1 and Orai1-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data suggest that α-SNAP depletion does not affect the density of Stim1 in junctional clusters. Surprisingly, we found a significant increase in the average Orai1-YFP intensity in α-SNAP depleted clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), resulting in a significant decrease in the ratio of CFP (Stim1) to YFP (Orai1) across all CRAC channel clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) as well as in the majority of individual clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These changes and their inhibitory effect on SOCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) suggest that α-SNAP regulates an active molecular rearrangement within CRAC channel clusters that is necessary for obtaining optimal Stim1/Orai1 ratios required for the physiological activation of SOCE through CRAC channels. Indeed, two independent recent studies that experimentally manipulated Stim1:Orai1 ratios in junctional clusters showed that the amplitude of calcium selective CRAC currents correlates well with the ratio of Stim1 to Orai1 or CAD to Orai1 within CRAC channel complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mcnally et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hoover and Lewis, 2011</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00802.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>α-SNAP regulates the molecular composition of CRAC channel clusters in ER–PM junctions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stim1 translocation and Orai1 clustering in control and α-SNAP deficient cells.

Remarkably, over-expression of α-SNAP enhanced SOCE beyond what is typically seen in cells stably co-expressing Stim1 and Orai1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Next, we examined the relative average intensities of CFP and YFP in junctional clusters of cells stably expressing CFP-Stim1, Orai1-YFP and transiently transfected with α-SNAP or empty vector. Concomitant with an increase in SOCE, over-expression of α-SNAP significantly enhanced the ratio of CFP (Stim1) to YFP (Orai1) across all junctional clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) as well as majority of individual clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

Regulation of SOCE by α-SNAP is completely independent of its well-known role in NSF mediated SNARE complex disassembly. We demonstrate that Stim1–Orai1 clustering at ER–PM junctions is insufficient to fully activate SOCE unless followed by a α-SNAP dependent active molecular re-arrangement within CRAC channel clusters. Furthermore, our study opens the possibility that SNAP proteins are involved in organizing other membrane associated macromolecular complexes.</p><p>Several pieces of data presented here demonstrate a novel mechanism for α-SNAP mediated regulation of CRAC channel activity. Upon store-depletion, α-SNAP but not its usual binding partner, NSF, co-localizes with Stim1–Orai1 clusters. Secondly, dominant inhibition of NSF does not inhibit SOCE. α-SNAP depletion disrupts SOCE without affecting the resting and stimulated subcellular localization of Orai1 and Stim1. Furthermore, using deletion and point mutations in α-SNAP we show that the domains and residues crucial for facilitating SOCE do not overlap with those known to be essential for binding or activating NSF dependent SNARE complex disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnard et al., 1997</xref>). Finally, the identification of an NSF independent role of α-SNAP is consistent with our previously reported primary genome-wide RNAi screen, where neither silencing of SNARE proteins nor NSF specifically inhibited SOCE in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vig et al., 2006b</xref>).</p><p>A previous domain analysis of α-SNAP suggested that a hydrophobic loop within α-SNAP, although not directly essential for NSF activation, could function as a membrane attachment site to promote its recruitment to the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnard et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Winter et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, a similar role could explain the inability of the hydrophobic loop mutant of α-SNAP to efficiently bind Stim1 and Orai1 and co-localize with CRAC channel clusters to reconstitute SOCE.</p><p>Given that Stim1 and Orai1 can co-cluster in the junctional ER in α-SNAP depleted cells, our data suggest that Stim1 and Orai1 binding across ER–PM junctional space per se is not α-SNAP dependent. These data are consistent with many previous studies that have shown a direct interaction between Stim1 and Orai1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yeromin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vig et al., 2006a</xref>) and identified the CAD domain of Stim1 as a critical domain involved in Stim-Orai1 clustering as well as SOCE activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Park et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, mutagenesis studies within the CAD domain have identified distinct residues that regulate Stim1 clustering vs activation of SOCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Park et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>). Yet, the existence of non-functional Stim1–Orai1 coupling in a physiological context or the dependence of CRAC channel clusters on a third protein for regulating the final steps in SOCE activation has not been previously speculated. While several proteins have been previously identified to bind Stim1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Honnappa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Smyth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walsh et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krapivinsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lewis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Singaravelu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Soboloff et al., 2012</xref>), only CRACR2A and Junctate have been shown to bind both Stim1 as well as Orai1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Srikanth et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2012</xref>). Of these, CRACR2A has been shown to bind CRAC channel clusters in a calcium dependent fashion and its depletion inhibits the formation of Stim1 clusters. Therefore, consistent with the current model of SOCE where Stim1–Orai1 clustering is considered necessary and sufficient for the physiological activation of SOCE, CRACR2A regulates the formation of Stim1–Orai1 clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Srikanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lewis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Soboloff et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We find that α-SNAP binds distinct and non-overlapping domains of Orai1 and Stim1 when compared to CRACR2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Srikanth et al., 2010</xref>). More importantly, in contrast to CRACR2A, α-SNAP depletion inhibits SOCE without decreasing Stim1 clustering, the density of Stim1 in the junctional ER or the ability of Stim1 to bind Orai1. Therefore, for the first time, our studies have identified the existence of a crucial late step in the molecular sequence of SOCE that involves α-SNAP dependent active re-arrangement of Stim1 and Orai1 molecules within CRAC channel clusters necessary for the physiological activation of SOCE. We place the requirement for α-SNAP just after Stim1–Orai1 clustering but before CAD mediated activation of SOCE.</p><p>A fraction of α-SNAP binds Stim1 constitutively, however, binding to Orai1 likely stabilizes its interaction with and enhances its recruitment to the CRAC channel clusters since co-expression of the three proteins shows a significant increase in the percentage of cells showing co-localization of α-SNAP with CRAC channel clusters. In turn, co-expression of α-SNAP synergizes with Stim1 and Orai1 to amplify SOCE likely by ensuring that a higher percentage of Stim1–Orai1 clusters form functional CRAC channels. Interestingly, like in the case of α-SNAP depleted cells, we observed an increase in the size of CRAC channel clusters even in cells over-expressing α-SNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>), suggesting that the ratio of Stim1:Orai1 molecules within CRAC channel clusters determines the amplitude of SOCE rather than the size of clusters themselves or the absolute amount of Stim1 in the junctional ER. The increase in size could result from a disrupted stoichiometry between α-SNAP and a fraction of Stim1–Orai1 clusters in α-SNAP depleted as well as over-expressing cells. Alternatively, expansion in cluster size could result from an increase in the total amount of Stim1 in the junctional ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). Future studies employing sub-diffraction, single molecule imaging approaches would help elucidate the dynamics of α-SNAP dependent re-arrangement of Stim1-Orai1 molecules within junctional CRAC channel clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and transfections</title><p>Orai1-Myc and Flag-Orai1, and Stim1-Myc plasmids have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peinelt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vig et al., 2006b</xref>).

Illumination lasers, 405 nm (Coherent, Cube), and 488 nm (Coherent, Sapphire) were individually shuttered (Uniblitz, Vincent Associates), combined, expanded, collimated, and focused at the back focal plane of a 100X 1.4 NA objective (Olympus UPLSAPO). CFP or YFP images were sequentially acquired by the same objective and separated using a dichroic set ZT405/488/561/640rpc-ZET405/488/561/640m and filtered using ET450/40m or ET525/50m emission filters (Chroma). Images were captured using custom software on an EM-CCD camera (Andor, iXon DU-897). Orai1-YFP and CFP-STIM1 expressing cells were first imaged in the resting stage and their positions marked. After addition of 1 μM Thapsigargin (TG), the same cells were imaged to avoid any bias in selection of cells based on cluster brightness or morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantification of size and fluorescence intensity of clusters</title><p>TIRF images were uniformly scaled to generate a binary image mask (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and Orai-Stim cluster boundaries were detected by adapting Otsu’s thresholding method to perform localized thresholding in Matlab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/graythresh.html">http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/graythresh.html</ext-link>). The cluster mask was applied to corresponding Orai1-YFP and CFP-Stim1 images to obtain the size and average CFP or YFP intensity per cluster. Cluster size and intensity data were pooled from roughly nine cells per group and plotted as a histogram.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Bungarotoxin binding assay</title><p>A 13 amino acid bungarotoxin binding site (BBS) WRYYESSLEPYPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sekine-Aizawa and Huganir, 2004</xref>) was inserted into Orai1 extracellular loop between G207 and Q208. Orai1-BBS-YFP was stably expressed in U2OS cells. After RNAi treatment or transient over-expression of α-SNAP, cells were labeled with Alexa-647 conjugated α-bungarotoxin (BTX) (Invitrogen) for 30 min on ice. Samples were analyzed using FACS Caliber and FlowJo software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Andrey Shaw and Barry Sleckman for critical reading of this manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your work presents an investigation of the involvement of α-SNAP in the organization of two components of Store Activated Calcium Entry (SOCE): Orai1 and Stim. Orai1 and Stim1 interact and cluster at the ER-PM junction, and constitute the active CRAC channel. The ratio of Orai1:Stim1 is crucial for SOCE as reported recently (McNally et al., 2012). The surprising finding here is that α-SNAP function regulates the ratio of Orai1 and Stim1 clusters and, more importantly, this function is independent of NSF. The data on the requirement of α-SNAP in this process and its interaction with Orai1 and Stim1 represent a potentially important step in our understanding of SOCE. However, the data does not reveal how α-SNAP controls the size of the clusters containing Orai1 and Stim1. We would be willing to consider a revised version provided it contains new data that addresses the following two major issues.</p><p>1) Does the L294A α-SNAP mutant, which does support SOCE but not SNARE function, also bind STIM1 and Orai1 like WT?</p><p>Likewise, can the N-terminal half of α-SNAP, which colocalizes with STIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), rescue SOCE as well? This would also help to address whether the entire functional domain is contained in the N-terminal fragment of α-SNAP.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, you show that recombinant α-SNAP directly binds GST-fusion proteins containing Orai1 and Stim1 fragments. However, it is not clear which parts of α-SNAP are required for the interaction with Orai1 and Stim1. Thus, the α SNAP LOOP mutant might affect selectively binding to either Stim1 or Orai1, which is important to test.</p><p>Furthermore, based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, it appears that the binding of α-SNAP to the CAD domain of Stim1 is stronger than interactions with the CT domains containing the CC1 fragment. Thus, the binding of α-SNAP to the CAD domain may relieve a potential inhibition caused by the CC1 domain. Interestingly, upon expression of the CAD domain itself, depletion of α-SNAP does not reduce SOCE. Thus, a simple working hypothesis would be that binding of α-SNAP to the CAD domain of Stim1 releases a potential inhibition by the CC1 domain. This can be tested by using recombinant GST–CT Stim1 (already employed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and add increasing amounts of recombinant Orai 1 to obtain a rough estimate of the binding affinity. Addition of increasing amounts of α-SNAP should then increase the affinity of the Stim1–Orai1 reaction or alter the stoichiometry. In a control reaction, α-SNAP could be added to a reaction containing GST–CAD instead of GST–CT Stim1. Assuming that the CAD domain is already active, a-SNAP would not affect the GST–CAD–Orai1 interaction. This experimental set up could provide a mechanistic model of how α-SNAP affects SOCE.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00802.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Does the L294A α-SNAP mutant, which does support SOCE but not SNARE function, also bind STIM1 and Orai1 like WT</italic>?</p><p>Similar to WT α-SNAP, the L294A α-SNAP mutant can co-IP Orai1 as well as Stim1. These data have now been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> panels I &amp; J.</p><p><italic>Likewise, can the N-terminal half of α-SNAP, which colocalizes with STIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), rescue SOCE as well? This would also help to address whether the entire functional domain is contained in the N-terminal fragment of α-SNAP</italic>.</p><p>As suggested, we tested the ability of the N-terminal fragment of α-SNAP to reconstitute SOCE. Remarkably, the N-terminal fragment of α-SNAP can partially restore SOCE in α-SNAP depleted cells. These data suggest that the N-terminal fragment of α-SNAP is likely to contain a major part of the SOCE regulatory domain. These data have been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> panel C.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, you show that recombinant α-SNAP directly binds GST-fusion proteins containing Orai1 and Stim1 fragments. However, it is not clear which parts of α-SNAP are required for the interaction with Orai1 and Stim1. Thus, the α SNAP LOOP mutant might affect selectively binding to either Stim1 or Orai1, which is important to test</italic>.</p><p>We tested the ability of α-SNAP LOOP mutant to co-IP Orai1 and found a significant defect when compared to WT α-SNAP. These data are consistent with the inability of the loop mutant to bind Stim1, lack of co-localization with CRAC channel clusters, and its inability to reconstitute SOCE in α-SNAP depleted cells. The data have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> panel G.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, it appears that the binding of α-SNAP to the CAD domain of Stim1 is stronger than interactions with the CT domains containing the CC1 fragment. Thus, the binding of α-SNAP to the CAD domain may relieve a potential inhibition caused by the CC1 domain. Interestingly, upon expression of the CAD domain itself, depletion of α-SNAP does not reduce SOCE. Thus, a simple working hypothesis would be that binding of α-SNAP to the CAD domain of Stim1 releases a potential inhibition by the CC1 domain. This can be tested by using recombinant GST–CT Stim1 (already employed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and add increasing amounts of recombinant Orai 1 to obtain a rough estimate of the binding affinity. Addition of increasing amounts of α-SNAP should then increase the affinity of the Stim1–Orai1 reaction or alter the stoichiometry. In a control reaction, α-SNAP could be added to a reaction containing GST–CAD instead of GST–CT Stim1. Assuming that the CAD domain is already active, a-SNAP would not affect the GST–CAD–Orai1 interaction. This experimental set up could provide a mechanistic model of how α-SNAP affects SOCE</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, the binding of α-SNAP to the CAD domain of Stim1 is stronger than interactions with Stim1–CT domains containing the CC1 fragment. However, we are unable to understand how this result, in particular, suggests that α-SNAP relieves a potential inhibition caused by CC1.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting an alternate hypothesis. However, the major problem with testing this hypothesis is the gap in our current understanding of how CC1 mediated inhibition really works and whether the inhibition is relieved in a single molecular step, by Stim1 intrinsic intra-molecular structural changes, or with help from other proteins. Given the long list of potential candidates, this process may depend on a collaborative action of more than one protein.</p><p>Furthermore, because Stim1 has been shown to bind both the N- as well as the C-terminal domains of Orai1, only full length Orai1 can ideally be used to test this hypothesis. While we do have GST–CT Stim1, we do not have full-length purified Orai1 (a four trans-membrane protein). Because we do not have experience with multi-pass membrane protein expression, it will likely take us months to purify a reasonable amount of 4 transmembrane protein and we would still be testing a hypothesis that is based on incomplete information about CC1 mediated inhibition.</p></body></sub-article></article>
