visual hemifields. We show that in areas V1-V3 this overlap is due to two co-located but non-interacting populations of neurons, each with a receptive field serving only one hemifield. Importantly, the two populations share the same local vascular control, resulting in a unique organization useful for quantifying the relationship between neural and fMRI BOLD responses without direct measurement of neural activity. Specifically, we can non-invasively double local neural responses by stimulating both neuronal populations with identical stimuli presented symmetrically across the vertical meridian to both visual hemifields, versus one population by stimulating in one hemifield. Measurements from a series of such doubling experiments show that the amplitude of BOLD response is proportional to approximately 0.5 power of the underlying neural response. Reanalyzing published data shows that this inferred relationship is general.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09600.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09600.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09600.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a part of the brain becomes active, more oxygen-rich blood flows to it to keep its neurons supplied with energy. This flow of blood can be measured using a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Yet, it was not known exactly how the magnitude of the signal recorded from the oxygenated blood flow – dubbed the BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) signal – relates to the level of neural activity.</p><p>In most people, the brain area that processes fundamental visual information – called the visual cortex – receives signals from both eyes, sent via the optic nerves. The two eyes’ optic nerves are bridged together with a structure called the optic chiasm, which ensures that each side of the brain gets input from both eyes for one side of the visual field. However, in rare cases, a person may lack an optic chiasm, and instead each side of the brain processes information about both sides of the visual field seen by one eye. This condition is known as achiasma.</p><p>Bao et al. have now used fMRI and behavioral experiments to study the brain activity of a volunteer who lacks an optic chiasm. This revealed that each half of the visual field stimulates different neurons in the same brain hemisphere of an achiasmic visual cortex. The two sets of neurons do not interact with each other, but they do share the same local blood supply. Moreover, these sets of neurons are organized in such a way as to preserve normal vision, and can be controlled independently using visual stimulation.</p><p>If both sets of neurons are stimulated with the same visual input at the same time, they together trigger twice as much neural activity as when just one set is stimulated. This also causes an increased BOLD signal as more blood flows to that region of the brain. Bao et al. were therefore able to infer a mathematical relationship between neural activity and the BOLD signal. This revealed that the magnitude of the BOLD signal is proportional to the square root of the underlying neural activity. Reanalyzing previously published BOLD data from other fMRI studies of healthy humans and monkeys supports this conclusion.</p><p>Bao et al.’s study provides scientists with a human model for noninvasively studying the origins and neural underpinnings of fMRI measurements, which may change how we analyze and interpret brain-imaging results in the future. The biggest challenge that researchers will likely face is in recruiting individuals with this rare condition of achiasma.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09600.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09600.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ashiasma</kwd><kwd>anomalous retinotopy</kwd><kwd>luminance contrast response</kwd><kwd>fMRI BOLD signal</kwd><kwd>neurovascular coupling</kwd><kwd>BOLD nonlinearity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH/NEI R01-EY017707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tjan</surname><given-names>Bosco S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF BCS-1255994</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tjan</surname><given-names>Bosco S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The lower-level retinotopic visual cortex of humans born without the optic chiasm comprises two independent neuronal populations and forms a versatile model for quantifying the relationship between the fMRI BOLD signal and neural response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal has provided unprecedented insights into the workings of the human brain. The quantitative relationship between neural signals and the fMRI BOLD response is not precisely known and remains an active area of investigation. Most studies using the BOLD signal to infer brain activity rely on analytical methods (e.g., the general linear model) that assume a linear relationship between the BOLD signal and neural response, despite noticeable deviations from linearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boynton et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>The BOLD signal is indirectly related to local neural response through mechanisms associated with oxygen metabolism and blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoge et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thompson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffeth and Buxton, 2011</xref>). The neural response that is associated with information processing is itself multi-faceted. It comprises several interacting components, including subthreshold and suprathreshold electrical activities, the transport, release and reuptake of neurotransmitters, and various maintenance activities. Each of these components has its own metabolic and hemodynamic consequences. The common extracellular measurements of neural response include single- and multi-unit spiking activities and local field potential (LFP). While seminal studies have demonstrated a close relationship between the BOLD signal and these extracellular measurements of neural response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mukamel et al., 2005</xref>), the quantitative nature of this relationship has not been sufficiently characterized. More importantly, since the relationship between these extracellular measurements and the intracellular components of neural activity is complex, the measured relationship between the BOLD signal to any specific extracellular components (e.g., power in the gamma band of LFP) may not reflect the relationship between the BOLD signal and the totality of neural response.</p><p>Most applications of fMRI, particularly in human neuroscience, sidestep any need for explicitly estimating neural activity and instead rely on establishing a direct relationship between the BOLD response and the stimulus condition. The general approach is to assume the BOLD responses evoked at different times and in different stimulus conditions sum linearly. Boynton and colleagues (1996) studied how the BOLD signal varied with the contrast and duration of stimulus presentation in the striate cortex and found that the system is approximately linear, in the sense that the BOLD response evoked by a 12 s stimulus was well approximated by summing the responses from two consecutive 6-s stimulations, even though predictions based on stimulations of much shorter durations (e.g., 3 s) failed to accurately predict the long-duration stimulus response. While this and similar studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dale and Buckner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heckman et al., 2007</xref>) have clearly noted the lack of linearity, their general message of an approximately linear system has nevertheless been used to justify the broad application of the general linear model (GLM) in fMRI data analyses. While the neural response is not explicitly involved in this type of analysis, it is always in the background — any nonlinearity observed in the BOLD response, e.g., in surround suppression or adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grill-Spector and Malach, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kourtzi and Huberle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Larsson and Smith, 2012</xref>) is often attributed to the underlying nonlinear neural response. The implicit assumption in common practice is that the relationship between the BOLD response and the neural response is essentially linear, a view that is widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Logothetis and Wandell, 2004</xref>) but under-examined.</p><p>An extensive set of biophysical models has been proposed to express either the steady-states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffeth and Buxton, 2011</xref>) or the dynamics of the BOLD response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buxton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mandeville et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feng et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toronov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blockley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim and Ress, 2016</xref>) in terms of more basic physiological components, such as blood flow, blood volume, oxygen saturation, and oxygen extraction fraction in different vascular compartments. These biophysical models are foundational in our understanding of the BOLD signal, yet they do not provide any explicit and quantitative linkage between the neural response and the physiological components that are the inputs to these models. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friston et al. (2000)</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stephan et al., 2007</xref>), proposed a linkage between the evoked neural response and the blood-flow parameter of the Balloon model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buxton et al. (1998)</xref>. While the resulting model is a powerful tool for inferring effective connectivity between brain regions from the BOLD signal, direct empirical support for this specific linkage is limited.</p><p>How could we empirically determine the quantitative relationship between the BOLD signal and the neural response, and do so when the constituents of the neural response are not comprehensively defined? A condition known as achiasma or non-decussating retinal-fugal fibre syndrome may provide an excellent model system for this purpose. This congenital condition prevents the normal crossing of optic nerve fibers from the nasal hemi-retina to the brain hemisphere contralateral to the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apkarian et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">1995</xref>). The result is a full representation of the entire visual field (as opposed to only half the visual field) in each cerebral hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Victor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoffmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davies-Thompson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaule et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, the representations of the two visual hemifields are superimposed in the low-level visual areas (V1-V3) ipsilateral to each eye, such that two points in the visual field located symmetrically across the vertical meridian are mapped to the same point on the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoffmann et al., 2012</xref>). In other words, there are two pRFs for every point on this person’s low-level visual cortex. The two pRFs are symmetrically located across the vertical meridian. Prior to the current study, it was not known if these pRFs were represented by one or two neural populations, or if these neural populations interacted.</p><p>In the current study, we found that the two pRFs are each represented by an independent population of neurons. The result is an in-vivo system with two independent populations of spatially intermingled neurons that share the same local control of blood vasculature. Because their population receptive fields (pRFs) do not overlap, an experimenter can independently stimulate each population by presenting a stimulus to its respective receptive field. Such a system is ideal for characterizing the relationship between neural and BOLD responses. Even though we may not know the constituents of the neural response, it will be reasonable to assume that the local neural response evoked by presenting identical stimuli to both pRFs, thereby activating both neuronal populations equally, is twice the neural response evoked by presenting the stimulus to just one of the pRFs. Measuring BOLD responses under these conditions allows us to not only directly test for linearity between the BOLD signal and neural response but also quantify the relationship between them, up to an arbitrary scaling factor. This approach does not require us to know the constituents of neural activity, and it is non-invasive.</p><p>To determine the relationship between neural response and the corresponding fMRI BOLD signal, we measured BOLD responses in the cortical areas V1-V3 of our achiasmic subject to luminance-defined stimuli. We presented stimuli of different contrasts to either one or both of the pRFs. From this data set, we used a model-free non-parametric method to infer the quantitative relationship between the BOLD signal (B) and neural response (Z). We found that the resulting B vs. Z function is well approximated by a power function with an exponent close to 0.5. The exponent stayed the same for short and long stimulus durations. We successfully cross-validated this result by comparing the inferred neural responses from this and twelve other fMRI studies to the single-unit responses obtained from non-human primates in similar contrast-response experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The achiasmic subject (S) and his retinotopy</title><p>Our primary research subject (S) was a 24-year-old achiasmic Caucasian male. S was diagnosed with isolated foveal hypoplasia. His uncorrected visual acuity was 0.7 logMAR for the left eye and 0.5 logMAR for the right eye (best-corrected 0.5 and 0.3 logMAR, respectively). He has a congenital nystagmus. His nystagmus (peak-to-peak) amplitude was less than 2.1° (95 percentile) horizontally and negligible (0.7°) vertically. The horizontal nystagmus followed a saw-tooth waveform with a right-forward fast phase and a (horizontal) frequency of between 0.6–2.3 Hz (mode at 2.3 Hz) during tasks performed for the current study. He was right-eye-preferred and suppressed his left eye (self-report). A Single Cover Test revealed left-eye esotropia. He could not achieve binocular fusion and had no measurable stereoacuity.</p><p>We confirmed his absence of an optic chiasm using MRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We obtained high-resolution monocular hemifield retinotopic maps for each of his eyes. The retinotopy was well defined and of high quality. Within the retinotopically defined visual areas V1-V3, the subject’s retinotopic representation of the ipsilateral visual field is a mirror image of its contralateral field representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The two are superimposed on the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulated eye. Two points placed in the subject’s visual field symmetrically across the vertical meridian are mapped to the same point on the cortex. This left-right mirror mapping is established at the level of individual voxels – 3x3x3 mm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Additional tests with vertically-reflected stimuli showed nearly identical BOLD signal modulation for individual voxels in V1-V3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings were consistent with previous reports on human achiasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoffmann et al., 2012</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09600.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Retinotopy of the achiasmic subject S.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The MRI image of S shows the lack of the optic chiasm.

For those experiments that aimed to measure the interactions between the stimuli presented to both of the hemifields, we designed the experiments to be insensitive to this and other deviations from perfect gaze control or homotopy. Whenever appropriate, we made one of the stimuli (mask) much larger in size than the other (probe) to ensure that the probe was always projected to a cortical region that also represented the mask. When two stimuli had to be of the same size, we analyzed only the cortical regions associated nominally with the middle regions of the stimuli where overlaps were mostly guaranteed. We also conducted supplementary analyses to validate that the fMRI voxels used in the primary analysis were jointly activated by both stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Co-locating but non-interacting neurons</title><p>Retinotopic mapping showed that each fMRI voxel in the visual cortex of S has two pRFs. We next tested if the neural populations that underlie these pRFs interact with each other. Behaviorally, S does not show any confusion between visual hemifields. Most tellingly, S is an avid reader, which strongly suggests that the co-localized neural populations do not interact functionally (otherwise, the text on the left of fixation would mask the text on the right of fixation). To quantify possible interactions between the pRFs, we measured whether the contrast threshold for S to detect a Gabor grating could be affected by placing a high-contrast flickering checkerboard symmetrically across either the vertical or horizontal meridian from the target location. Placing the checkerboard mask symmetrically across the vertical meridian causes it to be projected to the same cortical location as the target in the visual cortex of S, while placing it across the horizontal meridian does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). S performed this sensitive threshold task monocularly with his right eye in front of a calibrated CRT screen. We found that the placement of the flickering checkerboard did not affect the detection threshold, and that the threshold is within the normal range without masking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The target letter was randomly drawn from the set of 10 letters (C, D, H, K, N, O, R, V, S and Z). The stimuli appeared for 150 ms at a given location on the CRT monitor. There were three conditions: (1) the flankers and target on the same side, (2) the flankers and target on symmetrically opposite sides across the vertical meridian, and (3) target only. When the flankers and the target were on the same side (Condition 1), letter identification performance was severely impaired by the flankers -- the well-known crowding effect. When the flankers and target were on the opposite sides (Condition 2), even though the cortical representations of the flankers and target were equally close as in Condition 1, no crowding effect was found, and performance was identical to the target-only condition. These behavioral experiments show that even though the cortical representations of left and right visual fields overlap in V1-V3 in achiasma, the neuronal populations that represent these visual fields do not interact functionally.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09600.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09600.006</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09600-fig2-figsupp1-v2"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>To test if the two neural populations are physiologically independent, we measured long-duration fMRI adaptation effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2007</xref>). We first established that identical stimuli presented separately to either of the pRFs yielded nearly identical BOLD responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then measured the effect of adaptation when S was monocularly performing a highly demanding fixation task. The adapting and testing patterns were four counter-flickering Gabors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Relative to the adaptors, the test patterns could be either at the same spatial locations or at the mirrored locations across the vertical meridian. The orientation of the test stimulus could be either the same as or orthogonal to the adaptors. As expected, when the adaptors and test patterns were at the same spatial locations, we observed strong BOLD adaptation when they were of matching orientation and a large release from adaptation when they were of orthogonal orientations. The critical conditions are when the adapting and testing patterns were at different spatial locations but projected to the same points on the cortex of S. In these conditions, regardless of orientation, we found a large release from adaptation equal or greater in amplitude than in the same-location cross-orientation condition.

In separate experiments, a stimulus was presented for either 1 s or 6 s, followed by a 16 s blank. We measured the full peristimulus time course of the evoked BOLD response and its amplitude. In V1-V3 and across the contrast levels, the BOLD response to the combined stimulus A+B was significantly higher than what could be produced by doubling the contrast of stimulus A or B [paired t-test; V1: t(19) = -4.48, p=2.57x10<sup>-4</sup>; V2: t(19) = -2.96, p=0.008; V3: t(19) = -4.30, p=3.85x10<sup>-4</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) but significantly lower than the sum of the BOLD responses to stimuli A and B [paired t-test; V1: t(24) = 2.53, p=0.018; V2: t(24) = 6.20, p=2.11x10<sup>-6</sup>; V3: t(24) = 6.07, p=2.87x10<sup>-6</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This finding shows that BOLD summation, in the absence of nonlinearity associated with neuronal summation (assuming that the A+B stimulus simultaneously excited two independent populations of neurons), is itself nonlinear, with a compressive nonlinearity. The compressive nonlinearity was not due to response saturation since the 1-s stimulation duration yielded essentially the same nonlinearity as the 6-s simulation.

We arrived at this conclusion by considering 21 datasets from 12 published studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) on the contrast response function measured with fMRI BOLD in human V1. We assume the BvZ function to follow a power-law relationship, as we have found with the achiasmic subject, but allowed the exponent (<italic>γ</italic>) to be a free parameter. <italic>γ</italic> = 1 represents a linear relationship between BOLD response and spike rate. We used two single-unit contrast response functions (spike rate vs. contrast) for this meta-analysis. One of the functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) was from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albrecht (1995)</xref>, which was an average of 19 monkey V1 neurons, each tested with their respective optimal stimuli.

We reached this conclusion by measuring, in the visual cortex of an achiasmic subject, fMRI BOLD amplitudes at five levels of neural activity <italic>and</italic> also at twice those levels. Our ability to double the local neural response relies on the presence of two co-localized but independent populations of neurons in the visual cortex of the achiasmic subject. The two neuronal populations are equally excitable, and each population has a distinct and non-overlapping population receptive field. We used fMRI retinotopy and localized stimulation to demonstrate co-localization and equal excitability. We used a sensitive contrast detection task and a long-duration fMRI adaptation task to demonstrate independence. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the achiasmic human visual cortex provides a versatile in vivo model for investigating the relationship between evoked neural response and the associated fMRI BOLD signal.</p><p>Reported cases of achiasma in the scientific literature are rare, particularly with regards to fMRI studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Victor et al. (2000)</xref> performed a seminal study on the achiasmic visual system, the first one using fMRI and with a single subject. A more recent fMRI study, which provided a detailed characterization of the cortical representations of visual fields in achiasma, was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoffmann et al. (2012)</xref> with two subjects, one in Germany and the other in the US. Another recent fMRI study on the achiasmic visual pathway was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davies-Thompson et al. (2013)</xref> with a single subject. None of these studies attempted to use achiasma as a model system to study the relationship between neural response and the BOLD signal, nor had they thoroughly assessed the neural underpinning of the overlapped visual-field representations in achiasma. Nevertheless, the fMRI visual field mapping results from these prior studies are very similar to our results, suggesting that our subject is a ‘typical’ achiasmic individual. Yet, among this rare patient population, our subject was unique. Aside from being otherwise neurologically normal, he was very dedicated to this research and made himself available for nearly a year to complete a large set of converging experiments, including replications.</p><p>We are aware of the limitation of being a case study and have therefore included a meta-analysis of published data from neurologically normal participants. This meta-analysis was hypothesis-driven, based on results from our achaismic subject. The achiasma results informed us of what to look for – the exponent of the neural-BOLD function. Our meta-analysis found that the exponent is around 0.5, in agreement with our findings from the single achiasmic subject.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Relationship between the fMRI BOLD signal and neural response</title><p>The quantitative relationship between the fMRI BOLD signal and neural response depends on the interacting hemodynamic quantities that are linked to neuronal activity: cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral metabolism rate of oxygen (CMRO2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoge et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thompson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mukamel et al., 2005</xref>). It also depends on the origin of the MR signal (e.g., intra- vs. inter-vascular space, capillaries vs. pial vessels), which in turn depends on the pulse sequence and magnetic field strength used to make the measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffeth and Buxton, 2011</xref>). The BOLD signal is inherently measurement-dependent, and there is not a 'canonical' BOLD signal. For the common applications of fMRI in human neuroscience, it is arguably more important to understand and quantify at the net-effect level, rather than component-level, the relationship between the measured BOLD signal and the evoked neural response.</p><p>A common approach for quantifying the neural-BOLD relationship is to manipulate a stimulus and measure the evoked electrophysiological and hemodynamic responses either simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brinker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ngai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Devor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sheth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoffmeyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huttunen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Magri et al., 2011</xref>) or in separate experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hewson-Stoate et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nangini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). The hemodynamic signal measured can be either the fMRI BOLD signal itself or its physiological components (CBF, CBV, CMRO2). Several studies suggested that the BOLD signal or one of its components was linearly correlated with neuronal firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith et al., 2002</xref>), synchronized synaptic activity as manifested in local field potentials (LFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ngai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martindale et al., 2003</xref>), electroencephalographic (EEG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brinker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthurs et al., 2000</xref>), magnetoencephalographic (MEG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ou et al., 2009</xref>), or intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siero et al., 2013</xref>) activities. However, some of these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ngai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nangini et al., 2008</xref>) may not have had sufficient statistical power for detecting departures from linearity. Other studies had a limited stimulation range, lacking measurements near the response threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>), or limited sampling points within a range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). As a result, their findings of linearity may not be general. More importantly, a majority of the linear fits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ngai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schumacher et al., 2011</xref>) had a significant non-zero intersect, which would require a paradoxically non-zero change in the BOLD signal when the evoked neural response is zero. Absent of other factors, such a non-zero intersect implies that the underlying response function is actually nonlinear.</p><p>Other studies have suggested that the relationship between the BOLD signal and neural activity is nonlinear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Devor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sheth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hewson-Stoate et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoffmeyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Zwart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Magri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kay et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Magri et al.

This discrepancy could be due to the nonlinear relationships between the BOLD signal and its physiological components (CBF, CBV, and CMRO2) that were measured. Biophysical models relating the BOLD response to its constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buxton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoge et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffeth and Buxton, 2011</xref>), which are generally nonlinear, are needed to resolve this discrepancy.</p><p>Several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huettel and McCarthy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) used temporal summation to investigate the relationship between neural response and the BOLD signal. This is a popular non-invasive approach. The results, however, can be confounded with neural adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huettel and McCarthy, 2000</xref>). To avoid neural adaptation, the summation stimuli must be temporally separated with a sufficiently large lag time, thus precluding these methods from gauging the true (simultaneous) response nonlinearity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Our approach</title><p>Our approach is unique in that it allows a simple additive mixing of neural response across any time interval, including zero lag, to make a net-effect level quantification of the underlying relationship between the measured fMRI BOLD signal and the evoked neural response. Our method bypasses any nonlinearity between the stimulus and neural response. It also sidesteps the need to define the constituents of neural response (e.g., spiking activity, different frequency bands of LFP). These unique abilities stem from the configuration of the visual cortex in human achiasma: that there are two identical but independent populations of neurons that are co-localized on the cortex, sharing the same local control of blood supply. Each of these neuronal populations is associated with a distinct population receptive field. If stimulating one population results in some level of neural response, then for most reasonable definitions of 'neural response', stimulating both populations by placing identical stimuli in each of the two population receptive fields will double the local neural response (because two populations of neurons, instead of just one population, are responding). This notion of 'neural response' does not differentiate the specific components of neural response, such as spikes or LFP, which are themselves related in a complex manner. Rather, it is a holistic quantity (Z) that describe the totality of neural response, a notion that is perhaps more useful for most cognitive neuroscience investigations using fMRI. The fact that we succeeded in using the inferred BvZ functions to predict BOLD contrast-response functions from single-unit contrast-dependent spiking activity demonstrates the validity of our approach. While these results may suggest that Z is more related to spikes than to other neural response components nonlinearly related to spikes, more studies will be needed to quantify the link between the totality of neural response of a neural population and its individual components. The balance of the components that make up Z (e.g., spikes, LFP's) may depend on the stimulus, brain area, and task.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Origins of co-locating but non-interacting neuronal populations</title><p>We found that each voxel in the low-level visual cortex of the achiasmic subject S has two non-interacting population receptive fields (pRFs). The empirical evidence we reported here suggests that there are two independent neuronal populations co-localized in each voxel of V1-V3 that subserve these two population receptive fields. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al. (1994)</xref> found that in achiasmic Belgian sheepdogs, retinal axons originating from the nasal hemi-retina, which would normally cross the midline, instead innervated ipsilateral LGN and occupied those layers that would otherwise receive inputs from the contralateral eye. Alternating layers of the LGN in achiasma thus form mirror-image maps of the visual field. If axon guidance between LGN and V1 during development is typical in achiasma, then what would develop into the ocular dominance columns of V1 in a normal visual system will instead become visual-field dominance columns in achiasma, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Victor et al.

Preliminary measurements with 7T fMRI showed results consistent with the presence of visual-field dominance columns in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Olman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We expect the organization of visual-field dominance columns to be mostly within Layer 4 of V1, which receives direct hemifield-segregated inputs from LGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al., 1994</xref>). Downstream from Layer 4, we expect this columnar organization to dissolve into finely intermingled but non-interacting unilateral (and monocular) neurons, for the following reason. In a normally developed visual system, binocular neurons receive inputs from monocular neurons in the neighboring ocular dominance columns. However, in achiasma, such 'binocular' neurons would stay monocular and unilateral. This is because the inputs from neighboring visual-field dominance columns would not correlate, as they represent unrelated locations in the left and right visual fields. Neurons that received inputs from neighboring columns would likely suppress or eliminate the inputs from one of the visual fields, chosen at random and without preference, since the inputs from the two visual fields are of equal strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Hence, downstream from Layer 4 of V1, neurons that represented different hemifields of the visual space would be functionally independent but finely intermingled.</p><p>In other words, we speculate a coarse segregation, at the scale of the ocular dominance columns, of the unilateral neuronal populations in Layer 4 of V1. The intermixing of the unilateral neurons would become finer downstream from V1 Layer 4, starting with neurons in the superficial and deep layers of V1. This may explain why the γ value of the BvZ function observed in V1 was higher than those found in V2 and V3 – the coarsely segregated neuronal populations in V1 Layer 4, which would not fully share the local vascular system, lead to a more linear summation (higher value of γ). In V1, Layer 4 tends to have a larger contribution to the measured BOLD signal because of its dense vasculature but contributions from superficial and deep layers are also significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Polimeni et al., 2010</xref>). We postulate that neurons representing the two hemifields would be more intermingled in the superficial and deep layers than those in Layer 4. These neurons would likely be more complex and less linear in their response properties to visual stimulation than neurons in Layer 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Movshon et al., 1978a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">b</xref>). Their contribution to the BOLD signal relative to those in Layer 4 may be significantly reduced with long-duration simulation because of adaptation. The summation function thus appeared more linear in the 6-s condition than in the 1-s condition. It is important to point out that the summation function cannot be used to infer the BvZ function if the conditions of co-localization and non-interaction are not met. The condition of co-localization was not met in V1, and we could not use the summation function of V1 to infer its BvZ function. We do not think that the relationship between neural and BOLD responses depends significantly on stimulus duration. The fact that the BvZ functions inferred from V2 and V3, where the co-localization condition was met, provides an excellent fit to the V1 single-unit data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) further suggests that the inferred BvZ function is applicable in at least V1-V3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that the unique organization of the low-level visual cortex in human achiasma provides a versatile in vivo model for non-invasive quantification of the relationship between the evoked neural and fMRI BOLD responses. The presence of two independent neuronal populations with non-overlapping receptive fields at the same cortical location allows for the independent control of two separate sources of the local neural activity via stimulus presentation. By measuring the fMRI BOLD responses associated with a doubling of the local neural response, we found that the amplitude of the evoked BOLD response is proportional to the sum-total of the evoked neural response raised to a power around 0.5.</p></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s5-1"><title>Contrast detection</title><p>The achiasmic subject detected a Gabor target on a calibrated and gamma-linearized CRT display using only his right eye. The display had 10 bits of luminance resolution after gamma linearization by means of an analog video attenuator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2003</xref>) and custom software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/usc-tlab/LinearFineContrast.git">https://github.com/usc-tlab/LinearFineContrast.git</ext-link>). In separate blocks of trials, the target was presented in the upper-left or lower-right quadrant against a uniform gray field with a luminance of 30.4 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. A high contrast (Weber contrast = 1.0) task-irrelevant flickering checkerboard was displayed at a mirror-symmetric location from the target, either about the vertical meridian, such that the target and the flickering checkerboard would activate the same set of cortical regions, or about the horizontal meridian, such that the target and checkerboard would activate two different sets of cortical regions. The target was a 45<bold>°</bold> oriented Gabor with a center spatial frequency of 1 cycle/degree and a space constant (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msqrt><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) of 1.4°. The task-irrelevant flickering checkerboard was of size 10° by 10° with 0.5° by 0.5° checks and flickered at 4 Hz in a square pattern. A two-interval-alternative-forced-choice paradigm (judging which interval contained the target), controlled with the adaptive procedure QUEST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watson and Pelli, 1983</xref>), was used to measure the contrast threshold for a 75% correct detection rate. Each trial consisted of two temporal intervals (target-present and target-absent in random order) separated by a 500 ms blank. In each interval, the flickering checkerboard appeared for its entire duration of 600 ms. The Gabor target appeared for the last 150 ms of the target-present interval. During both intervals, a beep was presented 450 ms after the interval onset to reduce temporal uncertainty about target. The subject identified the target-present interval with a button press. A new trial began 500 ms after the subject had responded. Feedback was given after each response. For each target location, the subject completed 4 blocks of 50 trials.</p></sec><sec id="s5-2"><title>FMRI data acquisition and preprocessing</title><p>The fMRI data were collected using a 3-Tesla Siemens TIM Trio scanner with a 32-channel head coil using a T2*-weighted echo planar imaging sequence (TE/TR/flip angle = 25 ms/1 s/60°). 19 slices with 3x3x3 mm<sup>3</sup> isotropic voxels were prescribed to be perpendicular to the calcarine sulcus, covering the occipital pole. A high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical data set (3D MPRAGE; 1x1x1 mm<sup>3</sup> isotropic voxels, TE/TR/flip angle/TI = 2.98 ms/2300 ms/9°/900 ms) was collected in the same session before the functional runs and used to assist prescription of the functional slices. Eye movement was monitored online using an MRI compatible ASL 504 eye tracker with long-range optics. We analyzed the recording to estimate nystagmus amplitude and frequency during tasks and to determine if there were any stimulus-dependent biases in fixation. Additional offline measurements of eye movements were performed with a EyeLink 1000 Tower Mount monocular eye tracker.</p><p>Data analysis was performed using BrainVoyager QX (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands) and custom-built Matlab (MathWorks, Massachusetts, USA) code. The anatomical volume obtained in the retinotopic mapping session was segmented and inflated to generate a model of the cortical surface. Functional volumes were preprocessed, which included 3D motion correction, linear trend removal, and high-pass (&gt; 0.0118 Hz) filtering. The functional images were aligned to one another and to the anatomical volume. The first 15–22 s of each scan (retinotopy experiment: 15 s, long-duration adaptation experiment: 22 s, BOLD summation experiments: 22 s for 6-s presentation and 17 s for 1-s presentation) were discarded to ensure equilibrium in longitudinal magnetization and subject state.</p></sec><sec id="s5-3"><title>Retinotopy</title><p>Rotating wedges and expanding half-rings made up of flickering (4 Hz) radially scaled color checker-board patterns, presented to one eye at a time, were used to identify the retinotopic visual areas in subject S. For polar angle mapping, a 45° wedge with a radius of 8.5° rotated (jumped) counterclockwise by 11.25° every second, so that it swept the whole visual field in 32 s. For eccentricity mapping, the half rings were presented in the subject’s right or left visual field in alternating blocks. They expanded in equal logarithmic steps from the center of display, where the subject fixated, and took 20 s to reach the maximum radius of 8.5°. The fixation of the display changed from ‘+’ to ‘×’ or vice versa randomly between 5 and 10 s (uniform distribution); the subject pressed a button as soon as a change of the fixation mark was detected.</p></sec><sec id="s5-4"><title>Defining regions of interest (ROIs) for the fMRI data analyses</title><p>A common set of regions of interest (ROIs) in V1-V3 was used to analyze data from both the adaptation and BOLD summation experiments. The stimuli used for the adaptation experiments (Gabor patches, see next subsection), set at 100% contrast, were also used to define these ROIs during scans independent of the main experiments. The stimuli consisted of four Gabor patches arranged in configurations resembling a forward or backward slash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Each scan consisted of 13 fixation-only blocks interleaved with 12 stimulus blocks. The fixation-only blocks lasted for 16 s and the stimulus blocks lasted for 6 s. One stimulus configuration was presented in each stimulus block, and configurations alternated between blocks. During the stimulus block, the Gabor patches counter-flickered at 1 Hz and alternated their orientations (horizontal or vertical) at 0.5 Hz. The subject attended the fixation mark to perform a change-detection task at fixation.</p><p>A general linear model (GLM) assuming a stereotypical hemodynamic response function was used to identify the ROIs. The ROIs for backward- and forward-slash arrangements were defined separately, corresponding to the areas that responded more strongly to the ROI-defining stimulus than the blank interval (False Discovery Rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05) and were within areas V1-V3 at the expected eccentricity (based on retinotopy scans). Since the two sets of ROIs (one for each stimulus arrangement) were very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we defined the stimulus response areas as the overlap of the two sets at FDR &lt; 0.05. Because subject S has a nystagmus (horizontal amplitude generally less than ± 2.1°, peak-to-peak), we further restricted the ROIs to include, based on retinotopic coordinates, only the responsive voxels that responded to the central 2<bold>°</bold> of the two outer patches, which were 4° in diameter and centered at an eccentricity of 7°. The restricted stimulus response areas were further partitioned into ROIs in V1-V3 based on the subject’s retinotopy.</p></sec><sec id="s5-5"><title>Long-duration fMRI adaptation experiment</title><p>The adaptor and test stimuli consisted of four luminance-contrast defined Gabor patches in two spatial configurations, resembling either a backward (upper-left to lower-right) slash or a forward (upper-right to lower-left) slash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The two outer Gabor patches were at an eccentricity of 7°, with a carrier frequency of 1 cycle/degree and a space constant <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mfenced><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msqrt><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> of 1.4°. The two inner Gabor patches were centered at an eccentricity of 3.5°, with a carrier frequency of 2 cycles/degree and a space constant of 0.7°. The Weber contrast of the carrier was 1.0 against a gray background of 156 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. The carrier of all four Gabor patches could be oriented either horizontally or vertically.</p><p>Across different scans, the adaptor stimulus could be in one of four possible conditions: either in a forward- or backward-slash configuration, and oriented either horizontally or vertically. Relative to those of the adaptor stimulus, the four Gabor patches of the test stimulus were presented either at the same or different (mirrored) spatial location, with either the same or orthogonal orientation. There were 16 scans, with each scan consisting of one adaptor stimulus and 51 trials. A scan began with 20 s of pre-adaptation. Each trial started with a 5 s top-up adaptation period, followed by one of the five event types: four types of test stimulus (2 configurations by 2 orientations) or a blank interval. In a test trial, after 0.4 s of a blank interval following the top-up adaptation period, the test stimulus was presented for 0.3 s, followed by a 0.3-s blank. In a blank trial, no stimulus was presented for 1 s after top-up adaptation. The central fixation mark was present for all trial types (including the blank trial). At random intervals uniformly distributed between 3 and 7 s, the fixation mark randomly changed from ‘+’ to ‘×’ for about 400 ms before returning to ‘+’. The subject was instructed to attend to the fixation mark throughout a scan and press a key as soon as he detected a change of the fixation mark. The trial types were counterbalanced to ensure that the frequency of the immediately preceding trial type was equal, and the same for each of the 5 trial types.</p><p>For each experimental scan, the fMRI voxel data were % -transformed (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mfenced><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mi>%</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) and averaged within each ROI. ROI-averaged data were concatenated across scans, and the results were deconvolved against an indicator function formed by placing a Dirac delta function at the onset of the stimulus interval of the same trial type. Motion correction parameters were entered as regressors of no interest in the analysis to capture the noise introduced by head motion. The deconvolution analysis resulted in one response time course for each non-blank trial type, depicting the BOLD response evoked by the test stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s5-6"><title>BOLD summation experiment</title><p>The BOLD summation experiment had three types of stimuli. Stimulus types A and B each consisted of 4 circular patches of black-and-white checkerboard arranged in either a backward-slash (A) or a forward-slash (B) configuration. For stimulus type A+B, the stimuli of type A and B were presented simultaneously, resulting in 8 checkerboard patches on the display. All patches in a stimulus were of the same contrast. We tested five Weber contrast levels from 0.05 to 1.0 in equal logarithmic steps against a uniform gray field of 156 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. The outer patches were centered at an eccentricity of 7° and had radius 2°. The inner patches were centered at an eccentricity of 3.5° and had radius 1°. Each scan tested a specific contrast level. Within a scan, 19 stimulus blocks of 6 s each (or 1 s in a separate experiment) were interleaved with 19 16-s blank blocks. For each stimulus block, a stimulus of given type (A, B, or A+B) was presented, counter-flickering at 2 Hz. For each scan, the stimulus blocks were arranged in an otherwise random sequence with the constraint that each of the three stimulus types was preceded by every stimulus type equally often. To encourage and maintain fixation throughout a scan, the central fixation mark changed from ‘+’ to ‘×’ for about 400ms and back at random intervals, uniformly distributed between 3 s and 7 s. When the fixation was changed to ‘×’ from ‘+’, it was further tilted by ± 5°. The subject was to attend the fixation mark and report the direction of tilt as soon as the ‘ ×’ appeared by pressing one of two response keys.</p><p>The time course of the evoked BOLD response for each stimulus condition was inferred using deconvolution. For the experiment with the 6-s stimulus duration, the deconvolution procedure was essentially identical to that used for the long-duration adaptation experiment.</p><p>For the experiment with the 1-s stimulus duration, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data was low. To improve SNR, we used a GLM-based denoising method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kay et al. (2013)</xref>. The method assumes that physiological noise across measured voxels in the brain is correlated in the sense that it resides in a low-dimensional space. The method estimates this space in terms of its principle components from the voxels that are not driven by the stimulus. These components are then entered into the GLM design matrix for a given experiment as regressors of no interest in order to estimate and reduce the influence of noise from each voxel. To ensure that this method does not introduce confounds, we further tested this method using data from the 6-s experiment, which are of high SNR, and found that results were essentially the same as the ones obtained with the generic deconvolution method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5-7"><title>Model-neutral data stitching algorithm used to infer the BvZ function</title><p>Given <italic>n</italic> pairs of BOLD response amplitudes <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo/></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo/><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo/><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, corresponding to the <italic>n (n</italic>=5 contrast levels in our experiment) of single-sided and double-sided measurements, we sought to estimate <italic>n</italic>-1 parameters, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, such that the 2<italic>n</italic> points <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo/></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>are maximally consistent, in the least squares sense, with a monotonic and smooth function. The multiplier 2 represents our assumption that the double-sided condition generated twice the neural response of the corresponding single-sided condition.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors (Jody Culham) and another is Jonathan Victor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In a clever, elegant, and detailed set of experiments, this study uses a rare individual with achiasma (lack of an optic chiasm) to address how the fMRI (blood oxygenation level dependent or BOLD) signal summates. In achiasma, mirror-symmetric locations of the left and right visual fields are mapped to the same cortical location in visual areas. However, as careful psychophysics and fMRI adaptation experiments here show, stimulation at one site has negligible behavioral or neural effects on processing at the mirror-symmetric site. As such, achiasma provides a unique natural case study to investigate BOLD summation between effectively independent neural populations. The paper shows that doubling the stimulation sites in an achiasmic individual does not double the BOLD response; rather the BOLD response is approximately proportional to the square root of the neural response. These results are of general interest in neuroimaging considering the common use of BOLD fMRI to infer neural function.</p><p>Overall the referees were favorable, with all reviewers commenting favorably on the care and detail with which the project was executed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Two main issues were raised by multiple reviewers and must be addressed in a revision.</p><p>1) First, two reviewers raised concerns about the imperfect mirror symmetry of the representations in the two visual fields. This must be addressed directly in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1/Reviewing editor:</italic></p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> suggest that the representations across visual fields are largely but not perfectly homotopic (i.e., most points lie below a slope of 1 – and the data look similar across visual areas). Thus one concern is whether the choice of exactly homotopic locations may mean a slight displacement between the retinal locations stimulated, which could affect the data. If I were a stickler, I'd suggest an experiment in which stimulation was delivered to the visual location in the opposite field as determined by fMRI mapping). However, <italic>eLife</italic> policy is that if new data are essential to the conclusion, the paper will be rejected; in this case, I'm not sure the data is strictly essential. However, this concern needs to be noted and discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>The assumption of colocalisation: Large-scale co-localisation of opposing hemifields is clearly demonstrated in the data. However, the representations of the relatively small mirror-symmetrical patches used might not fully overlap due to slight shifts in the representations. This is actually suggested by the eccentricity representations of both hemifields in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, where e1 exceeds e2 for by far most voxels in all visual areas examined. This potential problem needs to be addressed directly in the manuscript, e.g. a conservative ROI definition might help here. A related issue are potential partial voluming effects for the comparatively large voxel size used (3 mm isotropic), which might include cortical areas that are not driven by the stimulus, e.g. potentially negative BOLD effects.</p><p>2) Two reviewers raised concerns about discrepancies between visual areas. This must be addressed in the revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>My main substantive concern is the way that the authors present and interpret the discrepancy between V1 and the other areas, V2 and V3. Specifically, for V2 and V3, the confidence limits for the power law exponent include 0.5, and are similar for 6-sec and 1-sec presentations. But for V1, the 6-sec presentation yields a power law of about 0.75, with confidence limits that don't overlap with those for V2 and V3. The 1-sec V1 measurement is like V2 and V3, with confidence limits centered on 0.5. The authors interpret the finding that the 6-sec V1 measurement is closer to 1 as a result of less-complete overlap of the vasculature between the columns. While this may be true, it is unclear why the 1-sec measurement doesn't also show the same effect. So if the non-overlap issue is to be suggested as a plausible explanation for the V1 vs. V2/V3 discrepancy, something needs to be said about why only the 6-sec measurement shows its effect. Whatever the authors do on this point, I think that it is important to add that the explanation is at least somewhat conjectural, and one does need to also maintain the possibility that V1 is somehow different in terms of Z-to-B coupling. The paper's core contribution remains valid and important – the Z-to-B coupling is clear sublinear, in contrast to previous claims.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>Treatment of V1 data: V1 data and V2/3 data do not fully match. Therefore, the authors decide to concentrate on the V2/V3 findings. Given the large voxel size used I am not convinced that the respective discussion on V1 hemifield dominance columns fully resolves this issue. The partial exclusion of the V1 data appears critical, especially as we are already dealing with a single case study and the authors draw fairly general conclusions from this data set.</p><p>Recommended changes or considerations:</p><p>The following points/suggestions should also be considered in the revision, though there is some flexibility for the authors to deal with these as they see fit.</p><p>1) The biggest limitation of the study is the small sample size (n=1). The authors nicely addressed potential concerns in the cover letter to the journal. I suggest briefly including some of these arguments in the Discussion of the manuscript.</p><p>2) The Reviewing editor found the hypothetical wording of the last paragraph of the Introduction peculiar. While it fulfills the authors aim – to focus the paper on the BOLD question rather that achiasma per se – it would flow better to bring up achiasma first, explain the cortical retinotopic organization, and then explain why it's an ideal model for this particular question.</p><p>3) The following comment of Reviewer 2 should be considered: “Secondarily, I would not emphasize the specifically ‘square root’ nature of the relationship; in the absence of a mechanistic basis for such a relationship, it is a phenomenological model, and the exponent just happens to be in the neighborhood of 0.5 (for V2 and V3)”.</p><p>4) The authors should consider the following suggestion from Reviewer 2: “I think it is possible to infer the value of the scaling exponent by a simpler procedure, with fewer assumptions. I hope the authors will consider doing this, as it bypasses a complex step that I think is inessential.</p><p>But I don't think it's an either-or matter – the suggested simpler approach goes directly to the power-law approximation; the authors' approach uses a spline for the contrast-response as a stepping stone to the power-law fit. One can argue that bypassing the contrast response function is an advantage (because of simplicity and reduced assumptions) or a disadvantage (since it misses an opportunity for contact with known physiology). So these approaches are complementary, and optimally, I think that the authors should retain their original analysis but also add the proposed analysis, as follows:</p><p>The suggestion for the simpler analysis is as follows. The starting point is the set of values (z_i, 2z_i) at which they have measured the BOLD responses b_i,1=b(z_i) and b_i,2=b(2z_i). If one assumes a power law b=z^g, then the ratio of a pair of B measurements directly gives the scaling exponent g: b(2z_i)/b(z_i)=2^g. So one can plot these ratios, b(2z_i)/b(z_i), as a function of the index i, and see if these ratios are independent of i – or alternatively, if a trend emerges. If there's no trend, then the power law approximation is valid, the inferred value of the exponent g is the average of these ratios (optionally weighted by their reliabilities). If a trend emerges (which I doubt, given the good fits in the paper), then a power-law relationship cannot hold”.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Using an achiasmic human visual system to quantify the relationship between the fMRI BOLD signal and neural response&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

This is consistent with the observed direction of bias in the eccentricity plot.</p><p>This apparent lack of perfect homotopy or gaze control has been factored into the experimental design and does not affect our main findings. Specifically, as long as the same voxels were stimulated equally by both versions of the single-sided stimuli in the summation experiment, the inferred BvZ functions will remain valid. To ensure that this condition was met, we defined the regions of interest (ROIs), using independent scans, to include only voxels that were activated by <italic>both</italic> versions of the one-sided ROI-mapping stimuli, at FDR&lt;0.05. We further restricted the ROIs to include just the responses to the central 2° of the two outer (and larger) patches of 4° in diameter. The smaller patches near the fixation mark in the stimulus were not used in the summation analysis. They served to help maintain a stable fixation. Most of these design decisions were stated in the manuscript. In the revision, we have added a paragraph specifically addressing these issues associated with the lack of a perfect homotopy when we describe <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (please see: &quot;The slight but systematic deviation from perfect homotopy in terms of eccentricity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> top row) is likely due to his asymmetric nystagmus waveform (with a leftward slow phase) […] fMRI voxels used in the primary analysis were jointly activated by both stimuli.&quot;</p><p>We have added supplemental information to further demonstrate that the inferred BvZ functions were not affected the lack of perfect homotopy. We do so by: (1) showing that the voxels in the ROIs were equally activated by both versions of the one-sided stimuli during the summation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and (2) when we reduced the ROIs to include only voxels that were highly activated by both versions of the one-sided stimuli during the summation experiment (not the independent ROI-defining scans), the resulting BvZ functions and gamma values were essentially the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Two reviewers raised concerns about discrepancies between visual areas.

Given the large voxel size used I am not convinced that the respective discussion on V1 hemifield dominance columns fully resolves this issue. The partial exclusion of the V1 data appears critical, especially as we are already dealing with a single case study and the authors draw fairly general conclusions from this data set.</italic></p><p>The estimated gamma value from V1 is statistically different from those estimated from V2 and V3. It may not be very clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> that the 95% CI of the 1-s condition of V1 does not include 0.5 or the estimated mean values from V2 and V3. Furthermore, the 95% CIs for V2 and V3 do not include the estimated value of V1. (Note that we are dealing with 95% CIs, not standard errors. In a pairwise comparison with alpha=0.05, the requirement is for the CI of one estimated value not to include the estimated mean of the other value, and vice versa. It does not require the two CIs be non-overlapping.) We added a dashed line at gamma = 0.5 to make clear these conditions for a significant difference were met.</p><p>As the reviewers pointed out, it is clear that stimulus duration had an impact on the gamma value estimated from V1 (but not other areas). A likely cause of this is that the hemifield dominance columns in V1 are concentrated in Layer 4, because the thalamic inputs from the hemifields are segregated (Williams et al., 1994). The hemifield representations in the superficial and deep layers are likely intermingled for the same reason they intermingled in V2 and V3. Moreover, the effect of adaptation is probably less in Layer 4 than in the superficial and deep layers. This means that the observed BOLD signal in the 6-s condition (stronger adaptation) was probably dominated by signal from Layer 4, thus showing greater linearity than the 1-s condition. We have added text in the Discussion to describe this hypothesis (paragraph three, subsection “Origins of co-locating but non-interacting neuronal populations”).</p><p>Our recent 7T work showed a hemifield dominance organization in V1, and signal was likely attributable to the middle layer of the cortex – the putative Layer 4 (Olman et al., 2014). However, we do not wish to include this preliminary result in the current manuscript, as the work is still ongoing.</p><p><italic>Recommended changes or considerations: The following points/suggestions should also be considered in the revision, though there is some flexibility for the authors to deal with these as they see fit. 1) The biggest limitation of the study is the small sample size (n=1).

The alternative analysis is self-contained. We plotted B(2z_i)/B(z_i) as suggested in a supplemental figure to show the lack of trend (backed up by stats).
