A ubiquitous motif for maintaining this balance is the somatostatin interneuron (SOM-IN) feedback microcircuit. Here, we investigated the modulation of this microcircuit by presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs) in the rodent hippocampus. Whole-cell recordings from SOM-INs revealed that both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs are strongly inhibited by GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs, while optogenetic activation of the interneurons shows that their inhibitory output is also strongly suppressed. Electron microscopic analysis of immunogold-labelled freeze-fracture replicas confirms that GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs are highly expressed presynaptically at both input and output synapses of SOM-INs. Activation of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs selectively suppresses the recruitment of SOM-INs during gamma oscillations induced in vitro. Thus, axonal GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs are positioned to efficiently control the input and output synapses of SOM-INs and can functionally uncouple them from local network with implications for rhythmogenesis and the balance of entorhinal versus intrahippocampal afferents.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>feedback inhibition</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>GABAergic interneurons</kwd><kwd>network activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR 2134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartos</surname><given-names>Marlene</given-names></name><name><surname>Kulik</surname><given-names>Akos</given-names></name><name><surname>Vida</surname><given-names>Imre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIOSS-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kulik</surname><given-names>Akos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000723</institution-id><institution>Tenovus</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PROJECT S07/6</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vida</surname><given-names>Imre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000853</institution-id><institution>University of Glasgow</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>McNaught Bequest</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Booker</surname><given-names>Sam A</given-names></name><name><surname>Vida</surname><given-names>Imre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002839</institution-id><institution>Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open Access Publication Funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vida</surname><given-names>Imre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Presynaptic GABAB receptors are highly expressed and strongly suppress synaptic transmission at the input and output of hippocampal somatostatin interneurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability of cortical networks to process information requires a fine spatiotemporal balance of glutamatergic excitation and GABAergic inhibition. Inhibition in these circuits arises from GABAergic interneurons (INs), which target either the perisomatic or dendritic regions of principal cells (PCs) and are embedded in the local network in feedback or feedforward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Booker and Vida, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>). A subpopulation of IN expresses the neuropeptide somatostatin (SOM) and innervates the distal apical dendritic tufts of PCs and INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katona et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McBain et al., 1994</xref>). SOM-INs act as a ubiquitous inhibitory feedback element in hippocampal and neocortical circuits, due to their preferential excitatory input from local PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ali and Thomson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blasco-Ibáñez and Freund, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lacaille et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Müller and Remy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shigemoto et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Urban-Ciecko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). Besides controlling dendritic excitability and synaptic plasticity at the single-cell level, hippocampal SOM-INs contribute to the co-ordination of population activity, particularly in the theta frequency range (4–12 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gloveli et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klausberger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maccaferri and McBain, 1996</xref>), but also at higher frequencies in the beta and lower gamma band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hakim et al., 2018</xref>).

Indeed, SOM-INs in CA1 of the hippocampus have been shown to receive a strong GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated synaptic input from local INs, dominantly those expressing calretinin (CR) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tyan et al., 2014</xref>). GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated inhibition onto INs more generally has been linked to disinhibitory network mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acsády et al., 1996</xref>) and the emergence of coherent oscillatory network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Traub et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">White et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, the contribution of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs to network functions is less well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Booker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brown et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohl and Paulsen, 2010</xref>), despite the ubiquitous expression and abundant distribution of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs at both pre- and postsynaptic locations on PCs and INs alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kulik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kulik et al., 2003</xref>). We have recently shown that SOM-INs in CA1 express high levels of postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs and their activation does not activate Kir3 channels, but inhibit dendritic L-type (Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2) calcium channels to suppress synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Booker et al., 2018</xref>). This result raises the question: do presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs contribute to short-term, direct inhibition of synaptic transmission at the input and output synapses of SOM-INs, leading to circuit level disinhibition? In fact, presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated inhibition would be able to efficiently control IN recruitment and to functionally uncouple them from the local network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Urban-Ciecko et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we first characterized the surface expression, localization and function of presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs at input and output synapses of SOM-INs in CA1 of the rodent hippocampus by combining in vitro electrophysiology with optogenetics and quantitative immunoelectron microscopy.

This division of cell identity is comparable to that we have observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Booker and Vida, 2018</xref>). In an additional set of recordings from mouse slices (see below), we identified 15 SOM-INs, of which 7 were OLM cell (46.7%), 2 were bistratified cell (13.3%), the remainder had a cut axon (1 cell) or not filled sufficiently (5 cells) to be identifed morphologically.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Synaptic inputs onto SOM-INs are strongly inhibited by presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A reconstruction of a SOM-IN showing soma and dendrites (black) and axon (red) with respect to the layers of the CA1 area. <bold>I</bold>nset (top left), intrinsic physiological response to current injections (500 ms duration; −250 pA to 250 pA).

These oscillations had a peak power of 52.6 ± 14.3 μV<sup>2</sup> at 61.1 ± 4.4 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). During the kainate-induced gamma oscillations SOM-INs fired at 7.7 ± 2.0 Hz (6 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), comparable to that observed during theta oscillations (U<sub>(d.f. 9)</sub>=7, p=0.16, Mann-Whitney test). Individual APs in SOM-INs preferentially occurred at the ascending phase of gamma oscillation, on average −15 ± 10° before the peak of the oscillatory cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,I</xref>) indicating a high correlation and tight phase relationship to local network activity, despite their low discharge frequency. Bath application of 2 μM baclofen reduced the peak power of gamma oscillations by ~45% to 28.7 ± 12.0 μV<sup>2</sup> (F<sub>(d.f. 2,10)</sub>=5.13, p=0.029, 1-way ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) with minimal effect on the frequency (65.5 ± 3.8 Hz, t<sub>(d.f.10)</sub>=1.1, p=0.51, Holm-Sidak test).

When SOM-INs were held near their rheobase current (106 ± 31 pA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, middle) in the presence of 2 µM baclofen, they fired at low frequency (2.9 ± 0.6 Hz).

Simultaneous intracellular recording from SOM-INs during the kainate-puff-induced gamma oscillation revealed a discharge in the theta range with a mean frequency of 7.9 ± 0.9 Hz under control conditions. Similar to the observations in rat slices, application of baclofen also strongly attenuated discharge to 1.6 ± 0.7 Hz in mouse SOM-INs (t<sub>(d.f. 7)</sub>=6.0, p=0.0.001, Holm-Sidak test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Previous studies have demonstrated that PC synapses onto SOM-INs produce small depolarization, with high failure rates, and strong frequency dependent facilitation, indicative of a low initial release probability synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pala and Petersen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Urban-Ciecko et al., 2018</xref>). This low basal synaptic transmission onto SOM-INs has been suggested to arise from multiple presynaptic modulatory pathways, including group II and III mGluRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shigemoto et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Losonczy et al., 2003</xref>) and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Böhm et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have been recently shown to boost neurotransmission at the input synapses of SOM-INs in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Urban-Ciecko et al., 2018</xref>). Our results reveal that GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs are also abundant at presynaptic terminals onto SOM-INs, at both synaptic and extrasynaptic membranes. While we did not observe evidence for tonic presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation under our experimental conditions, agonist activation consistently produced inhibition of the glutamatergic input onto SOM-INs, sufficient to strongly inhibit monosynaptic and unitary EPSCs with concomitant changes in failure rate and PPR, indicative of a presynaptic locus of action. Plausibly, during periods of high network activity, as observed in vivo, GABA spill-over from local inhibitory synapses may readily activate GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scanziani, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>) in a dynamic, state-dependent manner. However, higher ambient levels of GABA could also produce a tonic level of GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation, contributing to the weak glutamatergic transmission from PCs to SOM-IN, through heterosynaptic receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Urban-Ciecko et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Similar to glutamatergic synapses, we found a consistent, high level of surface expression of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs and a strong presynaptic inhibition at GABAergic synapses onto SOM-INs.

As such, we infer that the output of VIP/CR INs is strongly controlled by GABA<sub>B</sub> autoreceptors. While the precise temporal pattern of this inhibitory synaptic input to SOM-INs is not known, the strong suppression of transmission during GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation is likely to contribute to the reduced phase relationship and uncoupling of these INs from the local network.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>GABA<sub>B</sub>R Expression and Function at the Inhibitory Synaptic Output of SOM-IN</title><p>The major SOM-IN output is onto the distal apical dendrites of PCs, and also other INs in hippocampal CA areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katona et al., 1999</xref>).

Indeed, SOM-INs can produce strong GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated heterosynaptic inhibition at excitatory synapses onto cortical PCs in line with a role in volume transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Urban-Ciecko et al., 2015</xref>). The observed high density of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs in SOM-IN axon terminals and the strong depression of their inhibitory output during receptor activation in our optogenetic experiments demonstrate that GABA<sub>B</sub> autoreceptors dynamically regulate GABA release from these synapses. However, about half (57%) of SOM-IN boutons possessed GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs localized within or in direct apposition to the presynaptic active zone, whereas essentially all terminals contained extrasynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>R - a subcellular distribution pattern observed at other cortical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kulik et al., 2003</xref>). This suggests that a functional dichotomy may exist where most SOM-IN synapses are regulated by ambient GABA levels, with approximately half of synapses also inhibited by GABA<sub>B</sub> autoreceptors. The cellular sources of GABA involved in heterosynaptic inhibition at the output of SOM-INs is likely to be distinct from those at the input synapses, however their effects could converge to uncouple the INs from the network under specific conditions. Alternatively, this distribution pattern may demonstrate a high degree of surface dynamics of presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs reflecting the activity level of the INs. This observed heterogeneity of GABA<sub>B</sub>R compartmentalization and its functional impact in SOM-IN outputs should be the subject of further studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of SOM-INs and GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs in Network Activity</title><p>SOM-INs are well known to participate in oscillatory activity intrinsic to cortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gloveli et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hájos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klausberger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maccaferri and McBain, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Müller and Remy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pangalos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tort et al., 2007</xref>).

These two oscillatory patterns in vitro were sensitive to low, presynaptic-selective concentrations of baclofen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dugladze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vigot et al., 2006</xref>). This result is complementary to previous findings that GABA<sub>B</sub>R antagonists increase the oscillatory power in these two frequency bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leung and Shen, 2007</xref>) and plausibly reflects circuit-wide disinhibition of neuronal excitability and transmission, enhancing phasic modulation of the network by fast inhibition. However, the sensitivity of the two oscillatory patterns to GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation was differential in our experiments: while theta rhythm was almost completely abolished, gamma activity persisted albeit with a reduced power. The high sensitivity of theta activity to baclofen may reflect an inherent lability of in vitro theta oscillations. Indeed, only a few publications have reported reliable theta oscillations in ex vivo preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fellous and Sejnowski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gloveli et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goutagny et al., 2009</xref>) which might be due to the strong reliance of an intact connection from the entorhinal cortex or the septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>). However, given the proposed central role of SOM-INs in the generation of theta activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Forro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gloveli et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hájos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klausberger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sekulić and Skinner, 2017</xref>), synaptic uncoupling of the INs by presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs may also be causally related to the abolished theta activity. In this context the persistence of gamma oscillations could be explained by their microcircuit mechanisms involving other IN types, in particular fast-spiking basket cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gulyás et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Pharmacological models of gamma do not fully reflect the nuances of in vivo activity, and as such rarely does gamma exist as a prolonged 5–10 s barrage, but rather occurs co-generated with theta as nested short bursts both in the hippocampus and in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bragin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strüber et al., 2017</xref>). As SOM-INs are recruited to these oscillations they rhythmically discharge and provide inhibition to the apical dendrites of PCs. In the CA1, this inhibition gates the entorhinal inputs to PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leão et al., 2012</xref>) and has an essential role in learning and memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lovett-Barron et al., 2014</xref>). Our results show that presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs are strategically positioned at both input and output synapses of SOM-INs in this generic cortical microcircuit motif, and can exert strong suppression on transmission. As SOM-IN recruitment and their precisely-timed discharge are primarily defined by their excitatory input from PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Urban-Ciecko et al., 2018</xref>) the strong suppression by GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs alone at this synapse, may be sufficient to uncouple and silence SOM-INs. However, the parallel suppression of GABAergic input synapses will leave the SOM-INs with minimal phasic synaptic control from the active network. Silencing of SOM-IN firing allows for a breakthrough of multi-sensory inputs from the temporoammonic pathway onto hippocampal PCs, leading to strengthened inhibition and suppressed plasticity at intrahippocampal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leão et al., 2012</xref>). The differential sensitivity of gamma and theta oscillations further suggests that the uncoupling of SOM-INs from the network by GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation may also modify the balance of these activity patterns. GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated suppression of SOM-IN output provides a convergent mechanism for the modulation of this feedback microcircuit. However, in view of the wide spatial separation of input and output synapses in <italic>str. oriens</italic> and str. <italic>lacunosum-moleculare</italic>, ambient GABA levels, and thus GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation, likely displays both temporal and pathway specific separation.</p><p>Taken together, the data we present suggest that the activity of SOM-INs, a major feedback element in cortical circuits, is strongly regulated by presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs at their input and output synapses. The suppression of synaptic transmission serves to functionally silence and uncouple SOM-INs from ongoing coordinated network activity. These actions of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs can fine tune inhibition/excitation balance in a compartment specific-manner and thereby tightly control the routing of information between intra- and extrahippocampal pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (R. norvegicus)</td><td valign="top">Wild-type rat</td><td valign="top">Charles River</td><td valign="top">Crl:WI</td><td valign="top">Rats used for immunoelectron microscopy</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (R. norvegicus)</td><td valign="top">vGAT-YFP rat</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17517679">17517679</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Rats used for acute slice experiments</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Wild-type mouse</td><td valign="top">Charles River</td><td valign="top">C57/Bl6J CRL</td><td valign="top">Mice used for acute slice experiments</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Som-Cre mouse</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory; 013044</td><td valign="top">Ssttm2.1(cre)Zjh/J</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Ai32 mouse</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory; 024109</td><td valign="top">RCL-ChR2(H134R)/EYFP</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-GFP</td><td valign="top">Aves labs, USA</td><td valign="top">Aves labs:GFP-1010</td><td valign="top">chicken polyclonal <break/>(1:25000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- Cav2.1</td><td valign="top">Frontier Institute, JAPAN</td><td valign="top">Frontier Institute:VDCCa1A-GP-Af810; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2571851">AB_2571851</ext-link></td><td valign="top">guinea pig polyclonal <break/>(1:50)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- VGAT</td><td valign="top">Frontier Institute, JAPAN</td><td valign="top">Frontier Institute.

The frozen samples were fractured at −140°C and the fractured facets were coated with carbon (5 nm), platinum-carbon (2 nm) and an additional layer of carbon (18 nm) in a freeze-fracture replica machines (ACE 900, Leica or BAF 060, BAL-TEC, Lichtenstein). Replicas were digested at 60°C in a solution containing 2.5% SDS and 20% sucrose diluted in 15 mM Tris buffer (TB, pH 8.3) for 48 hr followed by 37°C for 18 hr, washed in washing buffer comprising 0.05% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Roth, Germany) and 0.1% Tween 20 in 50 mM Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and then blocked in a solution containing 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS for 1 hr at RT. Afterwards, replicas were incubated at 15°C for 2 days in the following mixtures of primary antibodies in a solution containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 made up in TBS: (i) GABA<sub>B1</sub> (B17, rabbit, 10 µg/ml; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kulik et al., 2002</xref>) or A25, rabbit, 5 µg/ml; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engle et al., 2006</xref>), green fluorescence protein (GFP-1010, chicken, 0.4 µg/ml, Aves Labs, Oregon) and Ca<sub>v</sub>2.1 (Guinea pig, 4 µg/ml, Frontier Institute, Hokkaido, Japan; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Althof et al., 2015</xref>) or (ii) GABA<sub>B1</sub>, GFP and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1, goat, 0.5 µg/ml, Frontier Institute, Hokkaido; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kusch et al., 2018</xref>) or (iii) GABA<sub>B1</sub>, GFP and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT, Guinea pig, 4.5 µg/ml, Frontier Institute, Hokkaido; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Althof et al., 2015</xref>) or (iv) GABA<sub>B1</sub>, GFP, VGluT1 and metabotropic glutamate receptor 1α-subunit (mGluR1α, Guinea pig, 0.4 µg/ml, Frontier Institute, Hokkaido; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Booker et al., 2018</xref>). Replicas were washed in washing buffer then reacted with 6 nm, 12 nm and 18 nm gold particle-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:30, Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe, Cambridgeshire) or with the aforementioned antibodies together with 3 nm gold particle-conjugated secondary antibody (1:800, Nanopartz, Colorado) O/N at 15°C. Finally, replicas were washed in TBS then distilled water and mounted on Formvar-coated 100-mesh grids.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Replicas were analyzed with an electron microscope (Zeiss Leo 912 omega, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). All antibodies target intracellular epitopes of proteins, therefore, immunoreactivity can be observed on the protoplasmic face (P-face) of the plasma membrane. Boutons contacting YFP-positive dendritic shafts of INs in <italic>str. oriens-alveus</italic> and YFP-positive axon terminals of INs in <italic>str. lacunosum-moleculare</italic> were sampled. Densely spiny CA1 PC dendrites in <italic>str. radiatum</italic>, YFP-positive dendritic shafts of SOM-INs in <italic>str. oriens-alveus</italic>, and YFP-negative boutons of putative PCs in <italic>str. oriens</italic> were used as a control for GABA<sub>B1</sub> labeling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Chemicals and pharmacology</title><p>All chemicals were obtained from either Sigma Aldrich (Munich, Germany) or Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Biocytin was obtained from Life Technologies (Dunfermline, UK). Pharmacological agents were obtained from Abcam Biochemicals (Cambridge, UK) or Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). Drugs were stored as 1000-fold concentrated stocks at −80°C until used. Working solutions were prepared fresh on the day in normal ACSF at final concentrations given in the text.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with Graphpad Prism (GraphPad Software, CAUSA). Analysis of unpaired data was performed with Mann-Whitney U tests. Group data were compared with one-way ANOVA tests, combined with Holm-Sidak post-tests. Paired group data were analyzed with one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Data are shown as mean ± SEM throughout. Statistical significance was assumed if p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Natalie Wernet and Ina Wolter for excellent technical support.

Using pharmacological tools the authors unequivocally demonstrated that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are in a position to critically influence the transmitter release at both the input and output synapses of SOM+ interneurons. The findings of this study are of high scientific interest as they significantly advance our understanding of the modulation of synaptic activity by GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors at the SOM interneuron feedback hippocampal microcircuit. Most of the experiments described in this paper are very well performed. Both the anatomical localization of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors using the freeze-fracture replica immunolabelling approach, a technique mastered by the Kulik's lab, and the functional characterization of the influence of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors on the SOM interneuron feedback microcircuit by means of whole-cell recordings and in vitro optogenetics are of very high quality. In the last part of the paper, the authors provide indirect evidence for a network effect that is dependent on GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors influence on SOM+ cells: they propose that specific activation of presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors could have an impact on the coupling of SOM+ interneuron spiking during network oscillations induced in slice preparations. However, result show that with “global” GABA<sub>B</sub> activation SOM+ IN spiking was substantially reduced in a way that was correlated with the decrease in oscillation power. This last finding regarding specific network effects needs stronger experimental support.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Bath application of 2 µM baclofen caused a marked reduction in the peak amplitude of network oscillations as well as in the firing rate of OLM+ neurons. Based on the present findings, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors can reduce the ESPCs onto SOM+ interneurons, leading to de-coupling of their firing from the ongoing oscillations, as proposed by the Authors. However, based on these results it is hard to conclude that presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are mainly responsible for de-coupling of SOM+ IN activity from the oscillations. Many in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the IN firing is primarily driven by phasic EPSCs (i.e. synchronous discharge of pyramidal cells) during oscillatory activities. Therefore, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation, impacting both the fast spiking interneuron and the pyramidal cell operation (Booker et al., 2013, 2017), can first cause a reduction in the oscillation power by altering the oscillogenesis, which leads to the de-synchronization of EPSCs, and therefore to the suppression of phase-coupled spiking in any interneuron types. Using the applied methods, comparing the features of spiking and oscillation in three discrete time points, it is hard to distinguish between these two scenarios, which may actually work in parallel. This tentative result requires additional experimental evidence. One experimental approach that might provide more direct evidence for the decoupling hypothesis (we are sure the authors will have many other ideas) is the following: Local application of baclofen into the surrounding of the SOM IN while spiking is monitored. This approach can minimize the effect of the baclofen at the postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors on the pyramidal cells, i.e. the oscillogenesis will not be impaired. Yet, synchronous EPSCs from the PCs could be reduced by locally applied baclofen via presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, leading to a reduction in EPSC magnitude. If this effect is large enough, then activation of presynpatic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors could suppress the phasic excitation received by SOM INs without affecting the gamma oscillation globally. Under these circumstances, SOM IN spiking should be uncoupled from the on-going oscillation, supporting the original claim.</p><p>Overall, the authors conclusions on this point do not adequately consider that in their experimental paradigm the activation of presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors on glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals innervating SOM interneurons and on terminals from these interneurons onto pyramidal cells occurred simultaneously, a situation highly unlikely in vivo.</p><p>Further, activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors at presynaptic GABAergic terminals (presumably originating from VIP/CR interneurons) onto SOM interneurons should: i) reduce quite effectively the release of GABA (also in view of their high density at these terminals) from VIP/CR interneurons and consequently also the spillover onto glutamatergic synapses, hence, lifting, at least in part, the heterosynaptic inhibition onto feedback inputs from pyramidal cells; ii) lead to disinhibition of SOM interneurons; iii) increase their gating of entorhinal inputs. This would be quite different from a functional uncoupling.</p><p>2) SOM+ interneurons in the CA1 hippocampus are diverse as they belong to at least two categories: OLM cells and GABAergic projecting neurons, often innervating the medial septum. Would it be possible to split at least a portion of the recorded interneurons into the two groups and compare whether the inputs of these two interneuron types are controlled similarly or distinctly by presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors? The categorization can be based on the morphological features, including the axon arborization, the morphology of the dendrites, the location of the axon initial segments (axon initiates usually from the dendrites in case of OLM cells, whereas the axon initial segment of projecting neurons originates from the soma), and/or the single cell properties such as the 'sag' characteristics (Zemankovics et al., 2010). Comparison performed even on a subset of interneurons may provide some valuable insights how the inputs onto these functionally distinct inhibitory cells are controlled via GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors.</p><p>3) The authors claim a different sensitivity (EC50) between presynaptic (1.1 µM) and postsynaptic (4.3 µM) GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors to baclofen. However, based on the confidence intervals deduced from the dose response curves shown in Figure 1D, I would conclude that there is no difference in the EC50 between pre- and post-synaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. The claim that a pharmacological difference exists between these two GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor pools must be removed, and, likewise, any statement that a certain concentration of baclofen (e.g. 2 µM) would preferentially activates one of the pools.</p><p>4) In subsection “GABA<sub>B</sub>R Subunits are Expressed at Presynaptic Boutons Forming Synapses Onto SOM-INs”, it is mentioned that the density of GABA<sub>B1</sub> labelling is higher in VGluT1-negative boutons in comparison with VGluT1-positive boutons. Was it quantified? If so, how did it compare with the data shown in Figure 4D?</p><p>5) The manuscript needs additional editing in order to fully understand the text. There are many sentences that are difficult to understand, and there are some apparent grammatical/syntactic errors.</p><p>a) Supplementary Figure 1. Related to Figure 1 has a wrong legend.</p><p>There are two figures called: &quot;Supplementary Figure 1&quot; and &quot;Supplementary Figure 1. Related to Figure 1&quot;. They have the same legend but they have different images.</p><p>For his reason it is very difficult to read the section about EM.</p><p>– Paragraph two of subsection “GABA<sub>B</sub>R Subunits are Expressed at Presynaptic Boutons Forming Synapses Onto SOM-INs”: (data not shown), please show this data.</p><p>b) Statistical analysis: In the methods, Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon tests were used. This contrasts with the results, in which it never seems to be mentioned Wilcoxon test was used. This is especially important for the data in Figure 1F for PPR and later for experiments with SCH. It is incorrect to say that &quot;… lower than the control IPSCs in the group without SCH application, albeit not significantly different….&quot;. Mann-Whitney test was used to check statistics. However, this is a paired recording and you should use e.g. Wilcoxon test.</p><p>c) Does the application of Kir3 channel blocker influence IPSC amplitude, input resistance, and/or whole-cell currents in PC and SOM? If Kir3 blocker affects these parameters maybe you should consider reverse experiments (SCH after baclofen)? Would you see the same effect as during experiments with baclofen after SCH? Do you mean by your experiments that baclofen does not activate postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors onto PC cells?</p><p>d) What is the effect of baclofen on the whole-cell current in SOM neurons and PC cells?</p><p>6) Major concerns for methods:</p><p>– The rationale for two different approaches to incorporate ChR2-YFP proteins into SOM INs is not clear.</p><p>What was the reason for virus injections vs. Ai32 mice? Were there any differences?</p><p>Subsection “Acute slice preparation”: &quot;…slices (300 or 500)…&quot;, but in the legend of Figure 7 indicates 400.</p><p>– Subsection “Characterization of presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated inhibition”: The response was about 100 pA (range of intensities: 19-366 pA). It is unclear what &quot;intensities&quot; is related to (the amplitude or the stimulus intensity?). How is the amplitude related to the maximal response? PPR is strongly dependent on the stimulus strength; the effect of baclofen might be also dependent on the stimulation intensity. Could you comment this?</p><p>– Subsection “Paired recordings from synaptically coupled CA1 PC-IN pairs”: Could you explain why you use two different concentration of EGTA: 10 and then 0.5 mM?</p><p>7) Discussion:</p><p>Several sentences are unclear. Please revise for lucidity: Paragraph one and two: What is &quot;them&quot; related to? SOM-Ins or PCs or both?</p><p>– Figure 5: E: it is unclear how many cells are there in fact.

To address these concerns, we followed the suggestion of the reviewers and performed dedicated experiments in which we focally applied baclofen in the proximity of a recorded SOM-IN in <italic>str. oriens</italic> (&lt;100 µm from the IN somata) during kainate-induced gamma oscillations (Results and new Figure 7—figure supplement 2). These data show that there is no change to the gamma power induced by kainate application to <italic>str. radiatum</italic> when baclofen is focally applied. Nevertheless, focal baclofen application produces a strong reduction in SOM-IN AP discharge, supporting our hypothesis of an uncoupling of the INs from the network by presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation.</p><p>We performed the new experiments in mouse slices, whereby we could also show that the strong presynaptic inhibition of EPSCs onto SOM-INs is not species specific (Results and new Figure 1—figure supplement 1), and that gamma power, as well as, the discharge of the INs are strongly attenuated by bath application of baclofen in mice, too (Results and new Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Together these new data show that local activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors at axon terminals onto SOM-INs during ongoing gamma oscillations is sufficient to uncouple and silence this IN population and that this property is shared between the two rodent species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the authors conclusions on this point do not adequately consider that in their experimental paradigm the activation of presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors on glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals innervating SOM interneurons and on terminals from these interneurons onto pyramidal cells occurred simultaneously, a situation highly unlikely in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that GABA activating of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs in the <italic>str oriens</italic>, where SOM-INs soma and dendrites and their input synapses are localized, <italic>versus</italic> the str. l-m., where their axons terminate, is likely to originate from distinct sources and therefore occur independently. Nevertheless, network mechanisms may coordinate these sources and extracellular GABA levels can surge simultaneously in the two layers under certain conditions.</p><p>We have added a sentence to the Discussion to raise this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors at presynaptic GABAergic terminals (presumably originating from VIP/CR interneurons) onto SOM interneurons should: i) reduce quite effectively the release of GABA (also in view of their high density at these terminals) from VIP/CR interneurons and consequently also the spillover onto glutamatergic synapses, hence, lifting, at least in part, the heterosynaptic inhibition onto feedback inputs from pyramidal cells; ii) lead to disinhibition of SOM interneurons; iii) increase their gating of entorhinal inputs. This would be quite different from a functional uncoupling.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a very interesting point; however, we don’t see a way to selectively activate presynaptic receptors at GABAergic input synapses onto SOM-INs. One pertinent point is that it is unclear what are the main sources of GABA for the activation of presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>R at these synapses. One possibility is that GABA is released from VIP/CR INs, as the reviewer suggests. Alternatively, other IN types, most notably Ivy cells, but also Bistratified cells or even SOM-INs themselves, could be the source of GABA in this layer. In our experimental paradigm (including the newly performed experiments suggested by the reviewer), we assumed that the increase in extracellular GABA concentration occurs due to spillover (mimicked by baclofen application) and thereby produces heterosynaptic inhibition. Under these conditions reduced GABAergic transmission onto SOM-INs matches the reduction of glutamatergic transmission in line with a network uncoupling, rather than leading to disinhibition of the INs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) SOM+ interneurons in the CA1 hippocampus are diverse as they belong to at least two categories: OLM cells and GABAergic projecting neurons, often innervating the medial septum. Would it be possible to split at least a portion of the recorded interneurons into the two groups and compare whether the inputs of these two interneuron types are controlled similarly or distinctly by presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors? The categorization can be based on the morphological features, including the axon arborization, the morphology of the dendrites, the location of the axon initial segments (axon initiates usually from the dendrites in case of OLM cells, whereas the axon initial segment of projecting neurons originates from the soma), and/or the single cell properties such as the 'sag' characteristics (Zemankovics et al., 2010). Comparison performed even on a subset of interneurons may provide some valuable insights how the inputs onto these functionally distinct inhibitory cells are controlled via GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>We have examined the morphology of the recorded and immunocytochemically-identified SOM-INs. Of a total of 63 rat SOM-INs, 25 cells possessed an axon projecting to the <italic>str. lacunosum-moleculare,</italic> 2 INs had bistratified axons in <italic>str. radiatum</italic> and <italic>oriens</italic>, and 4 had axons confined to <italic>str. oriens</italic> only. The remaining INs either had axons cut close to the soma (8 cells) or were not sufficiently filled to allow morphological identification (24 cells). Of the 8 cells with cut axon, 7 had the axon clearly emerging from a primary dendrite, and only 1 had an axon originating from the soma. As such, we believe that our data reflect an enriched population of OLM cells. We have now included the above morphological data in the Results text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors claim a different sensitivity (EC50) between presynaptic (1.1 µM) and postsynaptic (4.3 µM) GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors to baclofen. However, based on the confidence intervals deduced from the dose response curves shown in Figure 1D, I would conclude that there is no difference in the EC50 between pre- and post-synaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. The claim that a pharmacological difference exists between these two GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor pools must be removed, and, likewise, any statement that a certain concentration of baclofen (e.g. 2 µM) would preferentially activates one of the pools.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers concerns and have removed the data concerning pharmacological differences from Figure 1 and from the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In subsection “GABA<sub>B</sub>R Subunits are Expressed at Presynaptic Boutons Forming Synapses Onto SOM-INs”, it is mentioned that the density of GABA<sub>B1</sub> labelling is higher in VGluT1-negative boutons in comparison with VGluT1-positive boutons. Was it quantified? If so, how did it compare with the data shown in Figure 4D?</p></disp-quote><p>The immunoparticle density for GABA<sub>B1</sub> was initially quantified in VGluT1+/VGAT- excitatory and VGluT1-/VGAT+ inhibitory terminals obtained from mouse brains, because dendrites of SOM-INs selectively expressed ChR2-YFP fusion protein, which enabled us to analyze boutons making synapses on identified dendritic shafts of neurons of interest. The surface density of the receptor subunit in rat samples has also been determined, but using another GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit-specific antibody (A25), due to the limited availability of B17 antibody. Because the intensity of immunolabelling was generally weaker with A25 than with B17, the absolute values cannot be directly compared. However, the relative density of GABA<sub>B1</sub> in the two groups of terminals was the very similar: mouse inhibitory terminals possess 2.5-fold higher mean density of GABA<sub>B1</sub> than excitatory boutons (43.00 particles/µm<sup>2</sup><italic>vs</italic>. 17.37 particles/µm<sup>2</sup>, p=0.0001, Mann-Whitney test; see also Results), whereas rat inhibitory boutons show 2.7-fold higher mean density for the subunit than excitatory terminals (30.03 particles/µm<sup>2</sup><italic>vs</italic>. 11.00 particles/µm<sup>2</sup>, p=0.0002, Mann-Whitney U test).

This contrasts with the results, in which it never seems to be mentioned Wilcoxon test was used. This is especially important for the data in Figure 1F for PPR and later for experiments with SCH. It is incorrect to say that &quot;… lower than the control IPSCs in the group without SCH application, albeit not significantly different….&quot;. Mann-Whitney test was used to check statistics. However, this is a paired recording and you should use e.g. Wilcoxon test.</p></disp-quote><p>We have thoroughly checked and revised the Materials and methods and the Results to reflect the tests employed. We, in fact, did not use the Wilcoxon test, as the final data was better reflected by a 1-way repeated-measures ANOVA to account for within cell effects – as in Figure 1D-G. For post-hoc tests, we uniformly used the Holm-Sidak test, adjusted for multiple comparisons.</p><p>With regard to the specific example the comparison made here is between the IPSC recorded under control conditions in one group of cells and the IPSC elicited in the presence of SCH in another group of cells. As such this is not a paired analysis, and for this non-normally distributed data we believe the Mann-Whitney test is more appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Does the application of Kir3 channel blocker influence IPSC amplitude, input resistance, and/or whole-cell currents in PC and SOM? If Kir3 blocker affects these parameters maybe you should consider reverse experiments (SCH after baclofen)? Would you see the same effect as during experiments with baclofen after SCH? Do you mean by your experiments that baclofen does not activate postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors onto PC cells?</p></disp-quote><p>The aim of applying of SCH was to eliminate potential shunting effects due to postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation mediated by Kir3 channels. As we had stated in the Results before, SCH application blocks a large portion of the baclofen-induced postsynaptic Kir3 current in CA1 PCs. Nevertheless, the reduction in the amplitude of the IPSCs in response to baclofen application in the presence and absence of SCH was comparable, indicating that the reduced transmission was primarily reflecting a presynaptic inhibitory effect.</p><p>To address the issue raised by the reviewer, we have included an additional figure (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1) summarizing the effects of baclofen, CGP and SCH on whole-cell currents in CA1 PCs. Consistent with the lack of tonic postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediatedcurrents in PCs (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1B; see also Degro et al., 2015), we haven’t noticed any effect of SCH on whole-cell current or input resistance in PCs. Finally, IPSCs amplitudes, even if they tended to be smaller in our sample of cells recorded in the presence of SCH, were not significantly different from the control sample (see Figure 5C and D, and the relevant section in the Results).</p><p>Regarding the effects in SOM-INs, as we have shown previously, GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs on SOM-IN dendrites only minimally activate Kir3 channels (Booker et al., 2018); therefore we would not expect any large impact of SCH application in these cells in the absence or presence of baclofen. A thorough characterization of the postsynaptic interactions of baclofen and SCH in PCs and SON-INs, in our view, would be beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) What is the effect of baclofen on the whole-cell current in SOM neurons and PC cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this question in our previous study (Booker et al., 2018), in which we showed that pharmacological activation of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs in the absence of GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic inputs (DL-AP5, CNQX, and Bicuculline) leads to minimal post-synaptic currents. A comment to this effect is included now at the beginning of the Results.
