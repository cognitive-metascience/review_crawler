Current models in flies propose that germinal piRNA clusters are functionally defined by the maternal inheritance of piRNAs produced during the previous generation. Taking advantage of an inactive, but ready to go, cluster of <italic>P</italic>-element derived transgene insertions in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we show here that raising flies at high temperature (29°C) instead of 25°C triggers the stable conversion of this locus from inactive into actively producing functional piRNAs. The increase of antisense transcripts from the cluster at 29°C combined with the requirement of transcription of euchromatic homologous sequences, suggests a role of double stranded RNA in the production of <italic>de novo</italic> piRNAs. This report describes the first case of the establishment of an active piRNA cluster by environmental changes in the absence of maternal inheritance of homologous piRNAs.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

In humans, growing evidence has implicated TE in several disorders such as cancers defining a new field of diseases called transposopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wylie et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wylie et al., 2016b</xref>). In the animal germline, TE activity is controlled at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by small RNAs called piRNAs associated with the PIWI clade of germline Argonaute proteins (Piwi, Aub and Ago3 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gunawardane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le Thomas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sienski et al., 2012</xref>). piRNAs are processed from transcripts produced from specific heterochromatic loci enriched in TE fragments, called piRNA clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gunawardane et al., 2007</xref>). These loci undergo non-canonical transcription, ignoring splicing and transcription termination signals, licensed by specific protein complexes such as Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) and Moonshiner-TRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, when a new TE inserts into a naive genome, it will freely transpose until one copy gets inserted into a piRNA cluster leading to the production of homologous new TE piRNAs that will then repress transposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brennecke et al., 2008</xref>). In support of this idea, exogenous sequences inserted into preexisting piRNA clusters lead to the production of matching piRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Vanssay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermant et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muerdter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pöyhönen et al., 2012</xref>). The specificity of the efficient repression mediated by piRNAs appears to be determined solely by the piRNA cluster sequences. Thus, it raises the question of how piRNA cluster loci are themselves specified. Histone H3 lysine nine tri-methylation (H3K9me3) that is recognized by Rhino, a paralog of heterochromatin protein HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klattenhoff et al., 2009</xref>), is a shared feature of piRNA clusters. Enrichment of H3K9me3, however, is not specific to piRNA clusters and tethering Rhino onto a transgene leads to the production of piRNAs only when both sense and antisense transcripts are produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that neither H3K9me3 marks nor having Rhino-bound is sufficient to induce piRNA production. One current model proposes that piRNAs clusters are defined and activated at each generation by the deposition in the egg of their corresponding piRNAs from the mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). In support of this model, we previously described the first case of a stable transgenerational epigenetic conversion known as paramutation in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Vanssay et al., 2012</xref>). This phenomenon was first described in plants and defined as <italic>&quot;an epigenetic interaction between two alleles of a locus, through which one allele induces a heritable modification of the other allele without modifying the DNA sequence&quot;</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brink, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandler, 2007</xref>). In our previous study, we showed that an inactive non-producing piRNA cluster of <italic>P</italic> transgene insertions inherited from the father can be converted into a piRNA-producing cluster by piRNAs inherited from the mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Vanssay et al., 2012</xref>). This attractive model, however, does not answer the question of how the first piRNAs were produced.</p><p>To address this paradox, we used the same <italic>BX2</italic> cluster of seven <italic>P(lacW)</italic> transgenes, which resulted from multiple and successive <italic>P(lacW)</italic> transposition events, thus resembling the structure of natural piRNA clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorer and Henikoff, 1994</xref>). The key advantage of the <italic>BX2</italic> locus is that it can exist in two epigenetic states for the production of germline piRNAs: 1) the inactive state (<italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic>) does not produce any piRNAs and thus is unable to repress the expression of homologous sequences, and 2) the active state (<italic>BX2<sup>ON</sup></italic>) produces abundant piRNAs that functionally repress a homologous reporter transgene in the female germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Vanssay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermant et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore used <italic>BX2</italic> in an inactive state to search for conditions that would convert it into an active piRNA-producing locus, without pre-existing maternal piRNAs. In this report, we describe how culturing flies at high temperature, 29°C instead of 25°C, induces the conversion of an inactive <italic>BX2</italic> locus (<italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic>) into a stable piRNA cluster exhibiting repression properties (<italic>BX2<sup>ON</sup></italic>). It should be noted that flies in their natural habitat exhibit this range of temperature, especially in the context of global warming. These data provide the first report of a <italic>de novo</italic> piRNA cluster establishment independent of maternal inheritance of homologous piRNAs and highlight how environmental changes can stably induce transgenerational modification of the epigenome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Germline silencing induced at high temperature</title><p>Earlier studies of hybrid dysgenesis reported that high temperature enhances <italic>P</italic>-element repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ronsseray et al., 1984</xref>) and that thermic modification of <italic>P</italic> repression can persist over several generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ronsseray, 1986</xref>). Moreover, <italic>P</italic>-element repression in a strain carrying two <italic>P</italic>-elements inserted into a subtelomeric piRNA cluster can be stimulated by heat treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ronsseray et al., 1991</xref>). Very recently, the tracking of natural invasion of <italic>P</italic> elements in <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic> confirmed the key role of high temperature in the establishment of repression through generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kofler et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggested that temperature may influence the activity of some piRNA clusters. To investigate whether high temperature (29°C) could affect the stability of <italic>BX2</italic> epialleles (<italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic> and <italic>BX2<sup>ON</sup></italic>) across generations, we generated flies carrying, on the same chromosome, each of the <italic>BX2</italic> epialleles and an euchromatic reporter transgene sharing <italic>P</italic> and <italic>lacZ</italic> sequences with <italic>BX2</italic> (made of seven <italic>P(lacW)</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This transgene promotes the expression of ß-Galactosidase both in the germline and in the somatic cells of the ovary and thus will hereinafter be referred to as '<italic>P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup>'</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Vanssay et al., 2012</xref>), at 25°C <italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic> does not synthesize functional piRNAs complementary to <italic>P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> resulting in ß-Galactosidase expression in whole ovaries of <italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup>, P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Whereas in <italic>BX2<sup>ON</sup></italic>, <italic>P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> lines, functional <italic>lacZ</italic> piRNAs are synthesized in the germline where they specifically repress the <italic>P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> ß-Galactosidase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Both <italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup>, P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> and <italic>BX2<sup>ON</sup>, P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> lines incubated at 25°C for 23 generations maintained their epigenetic state, showing that both epialleles are stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). At 29°C, the repression capacity of <italic>BX2<sup>ON</sup>, P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> lines remained stable through 25 generations. Among the <italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup>, P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> lines, 24.7% of females analyzed during 25 generations showed a complete and specific germline ß-Galactosidase repression (n = 3812, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), suggesting a conversion of the <italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic> epiallele into <italic>BX2<sup>ON</sup></italic>. Interestingly, the appearance of females showing ß-Galactosidase repression was gradual and stochastic, resulting in a global frequency that increased with the number of generations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To test whether the temperature-induced conversion was stable, a set of five lines showing full repression capacity after 23 generations at 29°C, obtained from an independent experiment, were transferred to 25°C and tested for their silencing capacities for several generations. In all cases, the silencing capacities of the <italic>BX2<sup>ON</sup></italic> epiallele induced at 29°C remained stable during 50 additional generations at 25°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These stable <italic>BX2<sup>ON</sup></italic> lines converted by high temperature were named hereafter <italic>BX2<sup>Θ</sup></italic> (Greek theta for temperature) to distinguish them from the <italic>BX2*</italic> lines converted by maternally inherited piRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Vanssay et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, our data show that <italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic> can be functionally converted by high temperature (29°C), strongly suggesting that <italic>de novo</italic> piRNA production can occur in the absence of maternal inheritance of homologous piRNAs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39842.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Functional assay of the <italic>BX2</italic> epigenetic state.</title><p>Females carrying either one of the <italic>BX2</italic> epialleles and <italic>P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> were analyzed.

To assess the <italic>BX2</italic> epigenetic state of the G1 raised at 29°C, 157 G1 females were individually crossed at 25°C with males harboring the <italic>P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> transgene. Among the 1137 G2 females analyzed, only one female presented partial repression of the ß-Galactosidase expression and none presented complete repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). If we compare these results with those obtained with the <italic>BX2</italic>, <italic>P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the difference was highly significant (p=8.5×10<sup>−6</sup>, homogeneity χ<sup>2</sup> = 23.35 with 2 degrees of freedom, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). To further validate the requirement of the euchromatic homologous transgene <italic>P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> in establishing the temperature-dependent <italic>BX2</italic> conversion, we generated eight independent lines in which <italic>BX2</italic> was recombined into the same <italic>P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> genetic background but without the <italic>P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> transgene. After 30 generations at 29°C, no female showing ß-Galactosidase repression was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>).

Additionally, we reproduced the experiment with an euchromatic <italic>P(TARGET)</italic> expressed only in the germline and referred to hereinafter as '<italic>P(TARGET)<sup>G</sup></italic>' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

These data show that <italic>BX2</italic> conversion by temperature cannot be attributed to any specificity linked to the <italic>P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> insertion. To know if the transcription of the <italic>P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> (or of the <italic>P(TARGET)<sup>G</sup></italic>) is required, we reproduced the same experiment with another euchromatic transgene that is not expressed in the germline but in the somatic cells surrounding the germ cells and therefore referred to hereinafter as '<italic>P(TARGET)<sup>S</sup></italic>' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

Although much of the mechanistic aspects of <italic>BX2</italic> conversion remain unknown, these findings lead us to propose that, at 29°C, double strand RNA (dsRNA) made of the excess of <italic>BX2</italic> antisense transcripts and the sense <italic>P(TARGET)</italic> transcripts could be a prerequisite for the production of <italic>de novo</italic> piRNAs and the conversion of <italic>BX2</italic> into an active piRNA cluster (see recapitulative model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39842.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model of <italic>BX2</italic> activation at 29°C.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) At 25°C, a low bidirectional transcription of the <italic>BX2</italic> cluster leads to a small production of 21 nt RNAs. <italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic> is stable at 25°C, no conversion event is observed and the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene from <italic>P(TARGET)<sup>GS</sup></italic> remains active throughout generations.

The epigenetic response to heat exposure has been studied in several model species: in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> for instance, increasing temperature induces transcriptional activation of repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pecinka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tittel-Elmer et al., 2010</xref>). Whether these changes involve chromatin modifications is not clear but none of these modifications have been found to be heritable through generations except in mutants for siRNA biogenesis where high frequency of new TE insertions was observed in the progeny of stressed plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ito et al., 2011</xref>). In animals, response to heat can result in modification of DNA methylation at specific loci in reef building coral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimond and Roberts, 2016</xref>), chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yossifoff et al., 2008</xref>) and wild guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weyrich et al., 2016</xref>). In the latter, modifications affecting ≈50 genes are inherited in G1 progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weyrich et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanisms of this heritability, however, are not yet understood. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, heat-shock treatment of 0–2 hr embryos for one hour at 37°C or subjecting flies to osmotic stress induce phosphorylation of dATF-2 and its release from heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seong et al., 2011</xref>). This defective chromatin state is maintained for several generations before returning to the original state. We have tested if such stresses were able to convert <italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic> into <italic>BX2<sup>ON</sup></italic> in one generation but neither heat-shock nor osmotic stress induces <italic>BX2</italic> conversion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>), suggesting that <italic>BX2</italic> activation does not depend on <italic>dATF-2</italic>. In a more recent paper, Fast <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fast et al., 2017</xref>) found less piRNAs at 29°C than at 18°C. However, RNAseq analyses of differentially expressed genes involved in the piRNA pathway were not conclusive, as some piRNA genes (<italic>ago3</italic>, <italic>aub</italic>, <italic>zuc, armi</italic>) were more expressed at 29°C while others (<italic>shu</italic>, <italic>hsp83, Yb</italic>) were less expressed as compared to the levels at 18°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fast et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, the enhancement of the piRNA ping-pong amplification loop observed at 29°C was attributed to RNA secondary structures, because of a lack of specificity for any particular class of TE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fast et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast to our RT-qPCR results obtained at 25°C and 29°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), <italic>AGO1</italic> was not differentially expressed between 18°C and 29°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fast et al., 2017</xref>). This difference can be explained, because, in our experiments, we checked for specific spliced transcripts of <italic>AGO1</italic> (RA, RC and RD) that originate upstream the <italic>BX2</italic> insertion point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In agreement with Fast <italic>et al.</italic>, no statistical difference in the global amount of <italic>AGO1</italic> transcripts between 25°C and 29°C is observed using primers located downstream the <italic>BX2</italic> insertion point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This suggests that the <italic>AGO1</italic> promoter located downstream the <italic>BX2</italic> insertion point, and responsible for the production of the RB isoform (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), is not sensitive to temperature. Taken together, these observations show that temperature modification might induce epigenetic changes in several species but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unsolved.</p><p>Whole genome comparison of small RNA sequencing between <italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic> and newly <italic>BX2<sup>ON</sup></italic> heat-converted flies (<italic>BX2<sup>Θ</sup></italic>) did not reveal additional regions stably converted for piRNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This suggests that no other loci are metastable for piRNA production, that is all potential piRNA clusters are already active at 25°C. This observation raises the question of what makes <italic>BX2</italic> locus competent for piRNA activation at high temperature. The <italic>BX2</italic> locus is the result of successive induced transpositions of <italic>P(lacW)</italic> used to screen for <italic>white</italic>-variegating phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorer and Henikoff, 1994</xref>). Thus, <italic>BX2</italic> resembles natural TE clusters where TEs have the capacity to transpose into each other assembling structures named <italic>nested TE</italic>, as described in numerous genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zanni et al., 2013</xref>). Some <italic>nested TE</italic> loci might have the capacity to be activated and respond to a new TE invasion. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>BX2</italic>-like tandemly inserted transgenes were shown to be new sites of HP1 enrichment in larval salivary glands, emphasizing a heterochromatic structure at the <italic>BX2</italic> locus in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fanti et al., 1998</xref>), and to cause pairing-dependent silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorer and Henikoff, 1997</xref>). When tested for repressing capacities, however, this strain is inactive for <italic>BX2</italic> piRNA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Vanssay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Josse et al., 2008</xref>). We have shown that maternally inherited <italic>P(lacW)</italic> piRNAs are able to paramutate with complete and stable penetrance from an inactive <italic>BX2</italic> locus into an active locus for piRNA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Vanssay et al., 2012</xref>). The paramutated <italic>BX2</italic> locus appeared to be a genuine piRNA cluster since it is sensitive to a number of factors known to be involved in piRNA biogenesis such as <italic>aub</italic>, <italic>rhi</italic>, <italic>cuff</italic>, <italic>zuc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermant et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>moonshiner</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The number of transgene copies appears to be crucial in the process since smaller number of transgenes results in less somatic heterochromatinization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorer and Henikoff, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fanti et al., 1998</xref>), less pairing-dependent silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorer and Henikoff, 1997</xref>) and unstable paramutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Vanssay et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the heterochromatic structure of a cluster precedes piRNA production. This is supported by our ChIP experiments showing that H3K9me3 levels on <italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic> are slightly below the H3K9me3 level of piRNA producing states (<italic>BX2<sup>ON</sup></italic> and <italic>BX2<sup>Θ</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The same observation can be made for Rhino (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that Rhino may be already present on the <italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic> locus but below the threshold required for piRNA production as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akulenko et al. (2018)</xref>. Thus, a locus made of repeated sequences and being likely heterochromatic (H3K9me3, Rhino) is a necessary but not sufficient condition to specify an active piRNA cluster.</p><p>In the germline, piRNA clusters produce piRNAs from both strands and it was recently shown that, in most cases, transcription initiates within clusters on both strands through the interaction of Rhino and Moonshiner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2017</xref>). In few cases, however, piRNA cluster transcription may take advantage of the read-through from a flanking promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2017</xref>). Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) have shown that tethering Rhino onto a transgene leads to its repression but the production of piRNA depends on the presence of another transgene producing antisense RNA. Moreover, in the context of the <italic>Pld</italic> promoter deletion, a gene flanking the <italic>42AB</italic> piRNA cluster, flies can produce <italic>Pld</italic> piRNAs only if a <italic>Pld</italic> cDNA is expressed in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2017</xref>). From all of these observations, a model emerges predicting that simultaneous production of sense and antisense RNA is a shared requirement for piRNA production. However, even if <italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic> is transcribed on both strands, without additional signals, it still remains inactive for piRNA production.</p><p>In addition to having a number of heterochromatic repeats and a double stranded transcription, the production of <italic>de novo</italic> piRNAs from <italic>BX2</italic> requires a triggering signal. From our experiments, <italic>BX2</italic> conversion relies on the simultaneous increase of both sense and antisense RNAs. An active role of euchromatic copies in the establishment of new piRNA clusters by high temperature appears to be consistent with what would naturally happen during the invasion of a naive genome by new TEs or when chromosomal breakages occur leading to the loss of piRNA cluster loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asif-Laidin et al., 2017</xref>). At first, uncontrolled euchromatic TE transposition takes place before the establishment of repression. Such repression would occur after a copy integrates into a preexisting piRNA cluster or by the generation of a new cluster made by successive insertion of nested copies. Consequently, clusters of elements cannot exist without transcriptionally active euchromatic copies. The increase of germline antisense transcripts upon stress or environmental factors, depending on the neighboring genomic environment, and the concomitant presence of numerous sense transcripts from euchromatic active copies, appear to be the starting signals for new piRNA production. These piRNAs can then be inherited at the next generation where they will stably paramutate the corresponding DNA locus with repetitive nature. At that time, the triggering signal is no longer necessary since <italic>BX2</italic> remains activated once flies get back at 25°C. Future generations thus remember what was once considered a threat only through the legacy of maternal piRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Adults were then discarded or tested for ovarian ß-Galactosidase expression. Vials containing progeny were transferred at 29°C for the rest of the development until complete emergence of G1 adults. Young adults were then transferred into a new vial where they were allowed to lay eggs for three days at 25°C.

Cross-linking was performed for 10 min at room temperature in 1X PBS 1% formaldehyde (Sigma). The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 mM in PBS 0.1% Triton and incubating 5 min on ice. The cross-linked ovaries were washed with 1 ml of PBS 0.1% Triton and crushed in a dounce A potter 20 times. Then a centrifugation at 400 g for 1 min was performed.

Centrifugation at 2000 g for 5 min was performed and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 mL nucleus buffer (HEPES 0.05 M, EDTA 0.01 M, N lauryl Sarcosyl 0.5%, Na butyrate 0.01 M EDTA free protease inhibitor cocktail Roche) and incubated 15 min in a cold room on a rotator. Sonication was performed with Bioruptor (Diagenode) set to high power for 10 cycles (15 s on and 15 s off). A centrifugation was performed 15 min at 16000 g at 4°C. Five µg of chromatin was used for each immunoprecipitation. A preclear of 4 hr was performed with 25 µL of dynabead Protein A. The immunoprecipitation reaction was performed with 50 µL of dynabead Protein A coated with 5 µg of antibodies (H3K9me3 polyclonal antibody C1540030 diagenode or Normal Mouse IgG polyclonal antibody 12–371 Millipore), or 20 µL of serum for the Rhino antibody (kindly provided by Dr W.

Three washes of 10 min in a high salt buffer (Tris HCl pH 7.5 0.05 M, NaCl 0.5 M, Triton 0.25%, IGEPAL 0.5%, BSA 0.5%, EDTA 5 mM) were performed and the elution of chromatin was performed 30 min with 500 µL of elution buffer (Tris pH 7.5 0.05 M, NaCl 0.05 M, EDTA 5 mM, SDS 1%); RNase treatment was omitted; H3K9me3 and Rhino ChIP were respectively done on 5 and 4 independent biological samples followed by qPCR (Roche light Cycler) on each sample. Values were normalized to respective inputs and to two genomic regions known to be enriched in H3K9me3 and Rhino (<italic>42AB</italic>): region 1 (chr2R: 6449409–6449518) and region 2 (chr2R: 6288809–6288940). An unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to calculate significance of the differences (p&lt;0.05). Error bars represent the standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RT-qPCR experiments</title><p>For each sample, 10 µg of total RNA was treated with DNase (Fermentas). For classical RT-qPCR experiments, 1 µg of DNase-treated RNA was used for reverse transcription using random hexamer primers (Fermentas). Real-time qPCR was performed on triplicates of each sample. <italic>RpL32</italic> was used as reference. The same series of dilution of a mix of different RT preparations was used to normalize the quantity of transcripts in all RT preparations leading to standard quantity (Sq) values. Variations between technical triplicates was very low when compared to variations between biological replicates. The mean of the three technical replicates was then systematically used (meanSq). For each biological sample, we calculated the ratio meanSq(gene)/meanSq(<italic>RpL32</italic>) to normalize the transcript quantity. Then, the mean of each sample ratio was used to compare the two conditions. For sense-specific RT-qPCR experiments, three reverse transcription were performed using 1 μg of DNase-treated RNA (Fermentas): first without primer (control RT), second with a <italic>lacZ</italic> sense primer (antisense transcript specific RT) and third with a <italic>lacZ</italic> antisense primer (sense transcript specific RT). qPCR was then performed on technical triplicates of each RT using a primer pair specific for <italic>lacZ</italic> sequence. A series of dilutions - ranging from 50 × 10<sup>−15</sup> g.µl<sup>−1</sup> to 0.08 × 10<sup>−15</sup> g.µl<sup>−1</sup> - of a plasmid containing the <italic>P(lacW)</italic> transgene was used as reference to normalize the quantity of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcripts (Sq values). The number of molecules was estimated by considering that <italic>P(lacW)</italic> is 11191 bp long and that the average weight of a base pair is 650 g/mol. Using Avogadro's number, the number of copies was estimated as equal to the dsDNA amount (in g) times 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> divided by the dsDNA length times 650. For example, 50 × 10<sup>−15</sup> g corresponds to approximately 4139 molecules. Variations between technical triplicates were very low when compared to variations between biological replicates. The mean of the three technical replicates was then systematically used (meanSq). The measure of the quantity of transcripts (sense or antisense) for a biological sample was then calculated as the (meanSq(sense or antisense specific) - meanSq(control)). This allowed us to eliminate background noise due to unspecific RT amplification for both sense or antisense without specific primer. The mean of each sample ratio was used to compare the two conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Primer sequences</title><p>For classical RT-qPCR experiments, primers used were for <italic>w</italic> (ChIP experiment): 5'-GTCAATGTCCGCCTTCAGTT-3' and 5'-GGAGTTTTGGCACAGCACTT-3', these primers are specific of the <italic>P(lacW)</italic> transgene in a <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> background; for <italic>42AB</italic> regions, 5'-TGGAGTTTGGTGCAGAAGC-3' and 5'-AGCCGTGCTTTATGCTTTACT-3' (region 1) and 5'-AAGACCCAATTTTTGCGTCGC-3' and 5'-CAAGGATAGGGATTTGGTCC-3' (region 2); for <italic>RpL32</italic>: 5’-CCGCTTCAAGGGACAGTATCTG-3’ and 5’-ATCTCGCCGCAGTAAACGC-3’; for <italic>lacZ</italic>: 5’-GAGAATCCGACGGGTTGTTA-3’ and 5’-AAATTCAGACGGCAAACGAC-3’; for <italic>eEF5</italic>: 5’-TAACATGGATGTGCCCAATG-3’ and 5’-AACGCAATTGTTCACCCAAT-3’; for <italic>AGO1</italic>, primers have been chosen in order to detect spliced forms of transcripts coming upstream of the insertion point of <italic>BX2</italic> and encoding AGO1-RA, -RD and -RC isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>): 5’-GGATCTCCAGATGACCTCCA-3’ and 5’-GGACACTTGTCCGGCTGTAT-3’.

to the issues raised during peer review. The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Environmentally-induced epigenetic conversion of a piRNA cluster&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. We would recommend that you first respond to outline your replies to the reviewers and what revisions you intend to make, so that we can offer further guidance. We note that all the reviewers felt that more mechanistic insight would be desirable. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors report how high temperature (environment) can induce a DNA stretch to become a piRNA-producing locus in female flies.</p><p>Findings</p><p>1) Some (25% of the females studied) flies within a population are randomly induced to turn an inactive piece of DNA into an active locus that generates piRNAs, when grown at higher temperature (29<sup>o</sup>C instead of normal 25<sup>o</sup>C). This is monitored by the clever use of a b-gal reporter assay. This induction increases with generation time.</p><p>2) Such temperature-activated clusters are identical to those activated by maternally-inherited piRNAs. They present similar piRNAs produced and are decorated with the expected chromatin and piRNA-factor marks.</p><p>3) The higher temperature increased antisense RNA production from the previously-silent locus and this was channelled into the siRNA pathway and did not lead to increased piRNA production.</p><p>4) The presence of the complementary target RNA (expressed from a euchromatic locus) was essential for the high temperature-triggered piRNA generation.</p><p>Concerns</p><p>1) Abstract, Second sentence: There is no data to show that piRNA clusters are maternally defined except in flies. In mice germ cells are induced from the somatic lineage at embryonic day 7.5 and there is no possibility of maternal inheritance playing a role. If the authors want to keep this sentence, specify it is for flies.</p><p>2) Abstract, third sentence: The sentence sounds very dramatic as it means that higher temperature alone was sufficient to convert the P-transgene locus into a piRNA cluster. Perhaps the features of the genomic region (having P-transgenes), location, chromatin status etc are responsible. I would rephrase it. It is misleading as although temperature might be the trigger, this locus might already be primed and ready to go.</p><p>3) The authors make a very striking finding regarding high temperature-induced piRNA production from a locus, and link it to presence of both sense and antisense transcripts are necessary for this. This still leaves open the question how the locus was made into piRNAs. There is no explanation for this.</p><p>4) It would be good to have the actual sequence information for the different transgenes and the b-gal reporter, and the actual transcripts present in these flies. One is left in the dark as to the level of complementarity that exists between them when they are referred to as sense and antisense transcripts.</p><p>In conclusion, the observations made are striking and extremely interesting, but perhaps a bit more of molecular insights might be useful to appreciate the observations made.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) produced from piRNA clusters repress transposable elements in animal gonads. It has been shown that use of piRNA clusters is determined by maternally-deposited piRNAs. In this study, Casier et al. however showed that raising flies at high temperature (29<sup>o</sup>C) resulted in ectopic expression of piRNAs from the <italic>BX2</italic> transgene locus in flies that had no maternally-deposited, <italic>BX2</italic>-derived piRNAs. The <italic>BX2</italic> transgene consists of P5’, lacZ, white, a part of pBR322 (pBR) and P3’, and does not express piRNAs at normal temperature (25<sup>o</sup>C). The authors claimed that this was the first case showing that heat treatment can activate de novo piRNA production from the <italic>BX2</italic> locus (i.e., non-piRNA cluster) in a manner independent of maternally-deposited piRNAs.</p><p>The authors' findings also include:</p><p>1) Activation of de novo piRNA production by heat treatment was restricted to the <italic>BX2</italic> locus.</p><p>2) <italic>BX2</italic>-derived piRNAs produced upon heat treatment showed molecular properties similar to those of <italic>BX2</italic>-derived piRNAs expressed in a manner dependent of maternally-deposited piRNAs.</p><p>3) Ectopically expressed lacZ-piRNAs from the <italic>BX2</italic> locus were capable of silencing βGal over generations.</p><p>4) The βGal silencing effect was low at the first generation but gradually increased over generations.</p><p>5) Rhino and H3K9me3 accumulated at the <italic>BX2</italic> locus upon heat treatment. However, this may not be the cause to ectopic expression of <italic>BX2</italic>-derived piRNAs, as the authors claimed that <italic>BX2</italic><sup>OFF</sup> and <italic>BX2</italic><sup>ON</sup> produced anyway similar amounts of sense and antisense transcripts (subsection “Epigenetic conversion at 29°C occurs at a low rate from the first generation”).</p><p>6) An increase of transcription from the AGO1 promoter at 29<sup>o</sup>C could lead to an increase of <italic>BX2</italic> antisense RNA transcription. The <italic>BX2</italic> transgene was inserted in the AGO1 gene in a convergent transcription manner.</p><p>7) Activation of <italic>BX2</italic>-derived piRNA production by heat treatment required a homologous sequence.</p><p>I found the authors' finding that heat treatment induces de novo piRNA production from non-piRNA clusters potentially interesting. However, the mechanistic insights remain vague. The authors claimed that homologous sequence was required for the induction. However, to claim this, much more supportive data should be provided. The authors also found that H3K9me3 and Rhino started to accumulate at the <italic>BX2</italic> locus upon heat treatment. However, the meaning of the accumulation remains unclear. My other concerns were indicated below. I hope that this reviewer's concerns might be helpful for the authors to revise the manuscript.</p><p>Concerns and suggestions from this reviewer:</p><p>1) The authors proposed that the interaction between the excess of <italic>BX2</italic> antisense transcripts and the sense <italic>P(TARGET)</italic> transcripts is a prerequisite for the production of de novo piRNAs (subsection “Heat conversion requires a homologous sequence <italic>in trans</italic>”). To confirm this, I recommend the authors conducting experiments using heat treated <italic>BX2</italic><sup>OFF</sup> that do not have lacZ at the <italic>BX2</italic> loci but contains <italic>P(TARGET)</italic>.</p><p>2) The level of AGO1 RNA transcripts should be examined in <italic>BX2</italic><sup>OFF</sup> line containing <italic>P(TARGET)</italic>. I do not understand why the authors used the line without <italic>P(TARGET)</italic> in this particular experiment.</p><p>3) Figure 4B: Upon heat treatment, the expression level of <italic>BX2</italic> antisense transcripts was raised. Was this phenomenon related to Rhino and H3K9me3 accumulation observed in Figure 2DE? Experiments in Figure 2 and Figure 4 should be performed using the same fly lines.</p><p>4) Is the <italic>BX2</italic> transgene in the <italic>BX2</italic><sup>OFF</sup> line containing <italic>P(TARGET)</italic> also inserted in the AGO1 gene? This should be examined. If this were the case, the authors better examine whether piRNAs were derived from the AGO1 gene.</p><p>5) The authors should test experimentally whether <italic>BX2</italic>-derived piRNAs are loaded into PIWI proteins. This is very important.</p><p>6) Figure 2B: Explain why <italic>BX2</italic>-derived piRNAs did not show 10A bias. The data shown in Figure 2C supported the idea that <italic>BX2</italic>-derived piRNAs were products of the ping-pong pathway. Then, they should have shown 10A bias, but in reality they did not.</p><p>7) Figure 2DE: The authors should examine genome-widely where in the genome H3K9me3 and Rhino accumulated upon heat treatment. It is hard to imagine that H3K9me3 and Rhino accumulation only occurred at the <italic>BX2</italic> locus upon heat treatment.</p><p>8) The authors should examine whether H3K9me3 and Rhino accumulated at the <italic>BX2</italic> locus in <italic>BX2</italic><sup>OFF</sup> line without <italic>P(TARGET)</italic> upon heat treatment.</p><p>9) This manuscript should be edited thoroughly by a native English speaker.</p><p>10) Table 1 should be removed from the main text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This work takes advantage of a clever system using suppression of a lacZ reporter gene as a read out indicating the production of piRNAs from the <italic>BX2</italic> locus. Use of this system has resulted in several novel and interesting results, most notably the paramutation phenomenon. In this work, Casier et al. show that the <italic>BX2</italic> locus is silent at 25<sup>o</sup>C, but produces piRNAs at 29 <sup>o</sup>C in the presence of homologous sequence in the background.</p><p>While I have no problem with the experiments, but did wish for more insight into the mechanism, and more caution in the interpretation. In particular, entirely environmental specification of piRNA clusters implied in the Abstract is a strong claim, and as the authors show themselves, is an oversimplification. The induction they find is quite specific to their system. Specifically, there are higher levels of homologous sense and anti-sense transcript at 29 than at 25, and temperature alone doesn't change other piRNA production. Similarly, it would be useful to know if the expression of the sense transcript from P-Target is also higher at 29 that at 25. (I think this construct has a heat-shock promoter, as well as that of the P-element, which shows temperature sensitive effects.)</p><p>I wasn't entirely convinced by the suggestion that expression of natural piRNA clusters is higher at 29 <sup>o</sup>C. Many piRNAs are generated as a secondary byproduct of transposable element message, and many transposable elements seem to have temperature sensitive expression (possibly as a byproduct of changes in chromatin.) The piRNA dependent splicing suppression of the P-element is also, apparently, not temperature sensitive (Teixiera et al., 2017).</p><p>Minor points. It does seem important (and quick) to eliminate the possibility that there's any active P-elements in these lines. While <italic>w1118</italic> is a classic M-type background, there are some cases of sublines of other M-types harboring P-elements via contamination (Rahman et al. Nucleic Acids Research, Volume 43, Issue 22, 15 December 2015, Pages 10655-10672). If there is active P-element, I think it is possible that transgenes (which has the TIRs necessary for P-element insertion) has been picked up and put in another piRNA cluster. It's a simple matter of a few PCRs to exclude this possibility. The Cy and CyRoi backgrounds should be tested as well, to show that they are devoid of any plus-strand transcript that could be an ongoing trigger for piRNA production.</p><p>Subsection “Epigenetic conversion at 29°C occurs at a low rate from the first generation” paragraph two. The model is entirely sensible, but the data are quite noisy, and seem like they would be consistent with any model predicting an increase over generations. Can they compare this model to, for example, a model without the “c” parameter using Akaike Information Criteria or a log-likelihood test? This would make the analysis more informative.</p><p>Subsection “Heat conversion requires a homologous sequence <italic>in trans</italic>”: The chi-square statistic and degrees of freedom should be reported as well as the p-value. (And this is very minor, but the Greek letter is usually used in place of “chi”.)</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Environmentally-induced epigenetic conversion of a piRNA cluster&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but the referees still have significant concerns. If you decide to proceed with publication of the present version, our editorial rating, which will be displayed immediately below the Abstract, would be that &quot;major issues remain unresolved.&quot;</p><p>The reviewer comments (on the original version and revised version) would also be published, along with your responses.</p><p>Alternatively, you might decide to undertake significant extra work to try to address the concerns.

You also have the option to withdraw the present paper from consideration.</p><p>The reviews follow below, and we will look forward to hearing how you propose to proceed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript the authors find an involvement of sense-antisense transcripts and Dicer-2 in piRNA biogenesis. The authors may remember that one of the early findings celebrated as a major discovery was the lack of a role for double-stranded RNAs and the double-stranded RNA cleaving enzyme Dicer, in piRNA biogenesis. If now, the authors find a role for these in piRNA biogenesis, it has to be backed with strong data.</p><p>1) Can the authors demonstrate loading of the 21 nt RNAs into Piwi proteins?</p><p>2) If its role is epigenetic conversion, then ideally it has be loaded into the nuclear Piwi.</p><p>3) Are there experiments linking Dicer-2 to loading into a Piwi protein? Are they ever found in the same complexes?</p><p>I agree that there is a strong functional/genetic data that is mysterious, but very interesting. The heat-activated piRNAs are functional as they can silence a LacZ transgene. Since this manuscript will be published in some form, I am happy to support description of this part in a revised manuscript, but without wild speculation of Dicer-2 in piRNA biogenesis (even if they examine a Dicer mutant). These attempts at explaining the molecular mechanism may be toned down. I am worried that any prominent mention of Dicer-2 in this context may only serve to foster suspicion of the interesting genetic observation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>I still find this study clever and interesting, and think the manuscript shows some specific improvements:</p><p>The “primed” nature of the <italic>BX2</italic> locus is clearer, and the claim in the paper is more measured and reasonably justified.</p><p>The experiment showing the Dcr2 dependence of the conversion of the <italic>BX2</italic> from off to on goes a little way toward understanding the mechanism of piRNA cluster formation, implying that it is dependent on siRNAs.</p><p>The addition of the figure showing the model for the mechanism. The weak point of the proposed mechanism, as I see it, is the lack of evidence that the siRNAs are loaded onto PIWI, any evidence the authors can provide for this mechanism would greatly improve the paper. I can't make any suggestions that seem technically feasible, however, in light of the low conversion rate in this system.</p><p>Further clarification would also be helpful for these aspects:</p><p>Regarding the model in Figure 1—figure supplement 3: I previously suggested a statistical analysis of this model. Rather than the more detailed analysis I suggested previously, I think a reasonable compromise would be to show that there is a significant increase over generations. That is the important point here (and, in fact, it's hard to imagine a scenario where the “memory” of conversion does not play a role in the increase over generations). But, while there appears to be a trend, the data are sufficiently noisy that it would be useful just to see that the increase is significant (perhaps a linear regression on transformed data?).</p><p>Discussion opening paragraph: Please explain what you mean by the “specific spliced transcript” comment; it wasn't clear.</p><p>e.g., supplementary file 11: It would be nice to more cautious in the interpretation where there are large differences in the number of flies examined. In Figure 3, for example, I think the numbers show that 41 of 1447 females show partial or complete repression; the comparable (?) numbers is Supplementary file 11 show 0 of 32 (?) females show any repression. This is not a significant difference via Fisher's exact test.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>Please see major comments for suggestions regarding statistical analyses, particularly in cases where conclusions are drawn about the absence of repression in small sample sizes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39842.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Concerns</p><p>1) Abstract, Second sentence: There is no data to show that piRNA clusters are maternally defined except in flies.

It was possible to identify and quantify it through generations because of the use of the high reliability of the ßGalactosidase staining allowing us to (i) visualize the status of each eggs chambers individually at each generation, (2) study a large number of flies (Figure 1 and 3, for instance), (3) do statistics. However, observing 2% difference during the process of activation by molecular analysis appeared impossible (for example, the observation of 2% increase of piRNAs or chromatin modification through ChIP analyses is not statistically possible). Therefore, molecular analyses were performed on stable epigenetic states (<italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic> or <italic>BX2<sup>ON</sup></italic> converted by maternally inherited piRNAs or by high temperature) and after being transferred at 25°C.</p><p>In order to answer to this major point, we performed additional experiments to test if double stranded RNAs should be formed prior piRNA biogenesis to activate <italic>BX2</italic>. So, we tested whether <italic>Dcr-2</italic> might affect the activation of <italic>BX2</italic> by temperature. We generated flies containing <italic>BX2, Dcr-2</italic> mutant allele and a <italic>P(TARGET)</italic> tested the <italic>BX2</italic> activation at each generation by ßGalactosidase staining. We present results showing that <italic>Dcr-2</italic> mutation impairs the activation of <italic>BX2</italic> by high temperature (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). This result is consistent with the requirement of double strand RNA intermediates for <italic>BX2</italic> conversion into a piRNA cluster. We have added these experiments at the end of the result section as well as an additional figure (Figure 5) containing a cartoon putting together all of the results in a model. We hope that these new data will satisfy the reviewer concerns on the mechanism of activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be good to have the actual sequence information for the different transgenes and the b-gal reporter, and the actual transcripts present in these flies.

We have added these results in the main text and in a supplementary table (Supplementary file 10).Moreover, the potential effect of the background has been now tested over 30 generations and no conversion event has been observed, reinforcing the specific role of the germline expressed target in the activation of <italic>BX2</italic>. The Supplementary file 9 has been completed. We also performed a new experiment using a <italic>P(A92)</italic> transgene that is expressed in the somatic follicle cells but not in the germline nurse cells. With this transgene, no conversion was observed, showing that the euchromatic homologous transgene need to be transcribed (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). This reinforces the role of the &quot;sense&quot; transcripts brought by the euchromatic transgene in the conversion process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also found that H3K9me3 and Rhino started to accumulate at the BX2 locus upon heat treatment.

However, we have reproduced the measurement of <italic>AGO1</italic> steady-state RNA level by qRT-PCR experiment in a <italic>BX2</italic> context, with and without <italic>P(TARGET)</italic> and confirmed that the amount of <italic>AGO1</italic> transcripts is higher at 29°C compared to 25°C.

Was this phenomenon related to Rhino and H3K9me3 accumulation observed in Figure 2DE?</p></disp-quote><p>The two studies were addressing different questions:</p><p>The Figure 2D-E was studying the molecular changes of a stable epigenetic conversion: that is to say the <italic>BX2</italic> locus was activated by heat treatment after several generations at 29°C and this activation is stable because it is maintained even when flies are incubated at 25°C (the classical temperature). In this context, we compared a stable OFF line and stable ON lines (converted by maternally inherited piRNAs or by temperature) for differences of chromatin marks. Statistical but weak differences were identified (Figure 2).</p><p>In the Figure 4, we were addressing the mechanism of the triggering, that is to say what is happening after one generation at 29°C.

In Figure 4, measurement of antisense <italic>lacZ</italic> transcripts from <italic>BX2</italic> implies that all <italic>lacZ</italic> RNA should come from <italic>BX2</italic> locus. The presence of <italic>P(TARGET)</italic> which shares <italic>lacZ</italic> sequence would impair the specific measurement of <italic>lacZ</italic> antisense coming from <italic>BX2</italic> locus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Is the BX2 transgene in the BX2<sup>OFF</sup> line containing P(TARGET) also inserted in the AGO1 gene?

We have analyzed the small RNA produced from <italic>AGO1</italic> gene region in the <italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic> and <italic>BX2<sup>ON</sup></italic> strains: no significant piRNA amount was produced in all epigenetic contexts. This shows that <italic>AGO1</italic> is not a natural piRNA producing locus. Later, looking for piRNAs from <italic>AGO1</italic> gene region at 25°C and 29°C in <italic>BX2<sup>OFF</sup></italic> strains confirm that the <italic>AGO1</italic> gene is not a piRNA cluster and that 29°C does not induce de novo production of small RNAs from the <italic>AGO1</italic> gene region. These data have been added in a new Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and in Figure 4J and are discussed in the text. Figure legends have been modified as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should test experimentally whether BX2-derived piRNAs are loaded into PIWI proteins. This is very important.</p></disp-quote><p>From the first description of piRNAs and piRNA clusters by Brennecke et al., 2007, it is known that piRNAs are loaded by the PIWI proteins allowing their biogenesis. Through these loadings, piRNAs have four main signatures that defined piRNAs: 23-29 nt, a 1U bias, a 10A bias and a 10 nt overlap between pairs of 23-29 nt small RNAs (ping-pong signature). Since this first description, several other studies used these properties in numerous organisms (<italic>Nematostella, Bombyx mori, D. simulans</italic>, marmoset, ….) and identified piRNAs. The data of Figure 2 shows these characteristics that convince us that <italic>bona fide</italic> piRNAs were produced by the new activated <italic>BX2</italic> locus. On top of that, the strength of the transgene system used in this study allows also to provide the ultimate proof: the converted <italic>BX2<sup>theta</sup></italic> locus is producing small RNA that are functionally active for germline <italic>lacZ</italic> repression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2B: Explain why BX2-derived piRNAs did not show 10A bias. The data shown in Figure 2C supported the idea that BX2-derived piRNAs were products of the ping-pong pathway. Then, they should have shown 10A bias, but in reality they did not.</p></disp-quote><p>The 10A bias is only observed in the fraction of AGO3-loaded piRNA (Brennecke et al., 2007) or can be detected in the fraction of piRNA that paired each other (De Vanssay et al., 2012). We have performed this last analysis and the results are now shown on Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1C. The figure legends and the Materials and methods section have been completed as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 2DE: The authors should examine genome-widely where in the genome H3K9me3 and Rhino accumulated upon heat treatment. It is hard to imagine that H3K9me3 and Rhino accumulation only occurred at the BX2 locus upon heat treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that studying whole genome effects of heat treatment could be an interesting question. However, we did not detect production of new piRNA from other loci (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). Therefore, even if modification of chromatin marks were detected elsewhere in the genome, they are not followed by a stable new piRNA production, that is the question addressed in this study. Once again, molecular analyses were performed on flies that have been activated at 29°C and then put back at 25°C. Only stable modifications can be observed. Our results showed that only <italic>BX2</italic> is metastable for piRNA production, all other potential piRNA producing loci were already activated before heat treatment, and even if others loci are stably modified in their chromatin marks (H3K9me3 or Rhino), they did not become piRNA producing loci.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors should examine whether H3K9me3 and Rhino accumulated at the BX2 locus in BX2<sup>OFF</sup> line without P(TARGET) upon heat treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>The low occurrence of epigenetic conversion (2%) does not allow enough dynamics to analyze chromatin modification.

Actually, the analysis of the major <italic>42AB</italic> piRNA cluster shows a slight decrease of piRNA at 29°C compare to 25°C (Figure 4E). We totally agree that variations in piRNA production from natural piRNA clusters may result from several parameters including ping-pong amplification and variation in the expression of piRNA genes (as suggested by Fast et al., 2017). We have rephrased this part to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The piRNA dependent splicing suppression of the P-element is also, apparently, not temperature sensitive (Teixiera et al., 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We note that the intron 2-3 of the <italic>P</italic> element, whose splicing is dependent of piRNA, is absent from all transgenes that have been used in this study: the <italic>P(lacW)</italic> transgene that constitutes the <italic>BX2</italic> locus, <italic>P(TARGET)</italic> and <italic>P(A92)</italic>, the two <italic>P-lacZ-rosy</italic> used as reporter transgenes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points. It does seem important (and quick) to eliminate the possibility that there's any active P-elements in these lines. While w1118 is a classic M-type background, there are some cases of sublines of other M-types harboring P-elements via contamination (Rahman et al. Nucleic Acids Research, Volume 43, Issue 22, 15 December 2015, Pages 10655-10672). If there is active P-element, I think it is possible that transgenes (which has the TIRs necessary for P-element insertion) has been picked up and put in another piRNA cluster. It's a simple matter of a few PCRs to exclude this possibility. The Cy and CyRoi backgrounds should be tested as well, to show that they are devoid of any plus-strand transcript that could be an ongoing trigger for piRNA production.</p></disp-quote><p>Several years ago we tested by PCR the absence of <italic>P</italic> element in the strains we used for our studies, especially in the balanced stocks commonly used. We checked again by PCR (using the primer 5'-TGATGAAATAACATAAGGTGGTCCCGTCG-3' known as P3-31 that recognized the <italic>P</italic> inverted repeated sequences) all of the stocks that we used in this study and all of the strains are devoid of natural <italic>P</italic> sequences. We propose to not add this result in the paper since it is a very specialized point but our results are available if needed. Another point to this remark is that we have established recombined lines from <italic>BX2, P(TARGET)</italic> and, in the absence of <italic>P(TARGET)</italic>, they did not show activation of the <italic>BX2</italic> locus at 29°C. If uncontrolled, natural <italic>P</italic> elements were present in our strain and responsible of the conversion, they should not all be eliminated by recombination and control lines could still show <italic>BX2</italic> activation. Additionally, we have published that piRNA produced by <italic>P</italic> sequences only are not able to activate <italic>BX2</italic> by paramutation (Hermant et al., 2015) demonstrating that the homology length conferred by <italic>P</italic> sequences is not sufficient to trigger <italic>BX2</italic> conversion, even by piRNA maternal inheritance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Epigenetic conversion at 29°C occurs at a low rate from the first generation” paragraph two. The model is entirely sensible, but the data are quite noisy, and seem like they would be consistent with any model predicting an increase over generations. Can they compare this model to, for example, a model without the “c” parameter using Akaike Information Criteria or a log-likelihood test? This would make the analysis more informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the data are noisy. This is due to the high variation of occurrence of the epigenetic conversion and its sampling through generations and among replicates. The first rough observations of the phenomenon reported complete repression in ovaries after several generations. We tried to understand this effect by analyzing thousands of flies in one generation rather that dozens of flies through multiple generations and observed a small conversion frequency (≈2%, Figure 3). Then, we searched for a simple model based on the conversion frequency we observed in one generation and the fact that the ON state is transmitted to the next generation (De Vanssay et al., 2012 and Figure 3). The major problem we encountered is related to the sampling that occurred at each generation: among all egg chambers that are produced, only dozens of flies were analyzed. We think that the sampling size generates the variation we observed among replicates with a 2% conversion phenomenon. We agree with the reviewer that our data would fit with a number of models describing an increase over generations.
