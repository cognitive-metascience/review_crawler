We used specific monoclonal antibodies in mice to show that TRAAK is localized exclusively to nodes of Ranvier, the action potential propagating elements of myelinated nerve fibers. Approximately 80 percent of myelinated nerve fibers throughout the central and peripheral nervous system contain TRAAK in what is likely an all-nodes or no-nodes per axon fashion. TRAAK is not observed at the axon initial segment where action potentials are first generated. We used polyclonal antibodies, the TRAAK inhibitor RU2 and node clamp amplifiers to demonstrate the presence and functional properties of TRAAK in rat nerve fibers. TRAAK contributes to the ‘leak’ K<sup>+</sup> current in mammalian nerve fiber conduction by hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential, thereby increasing Na<sup>+</sup> channel availability for action potential propagation. We speculate on why nodes of Ranvier contain a mechanosensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>node of Ranvier</kwd><kwd>mechanosensation</kwd><kwd>node-clamp</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mechanosensitive potassium channel TRAAK is localized to nodes of Ranvier is mammalian axons where it hyperpolarizes the resting potential and may contribute to mechanical repolarization of neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanosensation encompasses the processes by which cells sense physical forces and transduce them into biological responses. Force-gated or mechanosensitive ion channels are cells’ fastest force sensors and are gated open by mechanical force to transduce physical stimuli into cellular electrical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ranade et al., 2015</xref>). First implicated in auditory transduction three decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corey and Hudspeth, 1979</xref>), mechanosensitive channels are best known for their roles in the classic senses of touch and hearing. However, mechanosensitive ion channels also underlie less conspicuous force sensations such as proprioception, blood pressure regulation and osmolarity control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Teng et al., 2015</xref>). The prevalence of mechanically-activated currents in cells has become increasingly clear; nearly all cell types express mechanosensitive channels including stem cells, cancer cells and neurons of the central nervous system, suggesting, perhaps, that force sensation by ion channels may be involved in more aspects of physiology than previously appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ranade et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Teng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anishkin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>TRAAK (TWIK-related arachidonic acid activated K<sup>+</sup> channel) is a mechanosensitive ion channel from the two-pore domain K<sup>+</sup>-selective (K2P) channel family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fink et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maingret et al., 1999</xref>). K2P channels give rise to what have traditionally been called ‘leak currents’ because they approximate the voltage- and time-independent properties of a simple K<sup>+</sup>-selective hole in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Enyedi and Czirják, 2010</xref>). However, it is now appreciated that the activity of K2Ps can be diversely regulated to control cellular excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Renigunta et al., 2015</xref>). Still, the precise physiological roles of many K2Ps remain poorly understood. TRAAK is gated open by force directly through the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brohawn et al., 2014a</xref>). In the absence of tension, TRAAK displays low activity with an open probability estimated to be less than 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brohawn et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang et al., 2005</xref>). The channel is rapidly and increasingly activated from very small applied forces up to the lytic tension of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brohawn et al., 2014b</xref>). Structural work has led to a model for gating and mechanosensitivity of TRAAK to account for these properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brohawn et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brohawn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brohawn, 2015</xref>). Activation of TRAAK involves protein conformational changes that prevent membrane lipids from entering the conduction pathway and blocking K<sup>+</sup> passage. TRAAK changes shape upon opening, expanding and becoming less conical and more cylindrical in the plane of the membrane. These shape changes are energetically favored when lateral tension is applied. The consequence is a membrane tension-dependent energy difference between closed and open conformations that favors opening.</p><p>These biophysical insights into TRAAK channel function led us to ask how its unique properties are related to its physiological roles. TRAAK is reported to be broadly expressed in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system, but the resolution of these studies is limited as they investigate the presence of TRAAK transcripts and they differ in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fink et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Talley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lein et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>TRAAK<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice display mechanical and temperature allodynia and enhanced mechanical hyperalgesia during inflammation, consistent with a role for TRAAK in thermal and mechanical nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noël et al., 2009</xref>). However, whether these phenotypes are due to loss of TRAAK channels within sensory endings, elsewhere in the periphery, or centrally is unknown. Gain-of-function mutations in TRAAK identified in three human families are thought to underlie a complex developmental and neurological disorder FHEIG, an acronym for its characteristic phenotypes of facial dysmorphism, hypertrichosis, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and gingival outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests a broader role for TRAAK activity in development and central nervous system function. The current lack of understanding of the precise localization of TRAAK channels precludes a deeper understanding of the biological roles for which the channel has evolved.</p><p>Axons of jawed vertebrates contain alternating non-excitable insulated regions where the axonal membrane is wrapped in myelin to increase membrane resistance and decrease capacitance, and excitable regions where the axonal membrane is exposed to enable firing and regeneration of action potentials. Nodes of Ranvier are the periodic ~1 μm gaps in myelination where the action potential is regenerated. Nodes and the immediately surrounding regions under the myelin sheath constitute sharply delineated functional domains with well-defined molecular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rasband and Shrager, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arroyo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rasband and Peles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vogel and Schwarz, 1995</xref>). Nodal membranes contain a high density of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels (Na<sub>v</sub>1.6), adhesion molecules, and scaffolding components including ankyrin G (AnkG). In addition, K<sub>V</sub>7.2/K<sub>V</sub>7.3 (KCNQ2/3) channels are incorporated into the nodal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwarz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Devaux et al., 2004</xref>). Flanking the node are paranodes, tight cell-cell junctions between axonal and glial membranes made in part by Contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1). Flanking the paranodes are juxtaparanodes, which contain voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>v</sub>1.1 and K<sub>v</sub>1.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwarz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hille, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stämpfli and Hille, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiu et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Röper and Schwarz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiu and Ritchie, 1981</xref>).</p><p>In this study we show that the mechanosensitive TRAAK channel is localized to nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons throughout the mammalian nervous system. While it has been known for about forty years that the K<sup>+</sup> conductance in mammalian nodes is predominantly composed of leak-type rather than voltage-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiu et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Röper and Schwarz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiu and Ritchie, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brismar and Schwarz, 1985</xref>), TRAAK is, to our knowledge, the first molecularly identified component of this conductance. We demonstrate that the basal activity of TRAAK is involved in maintaining a negative nodal resting potential to increase nodal Na<sub>V</sub> channel availability. We further speculate on possible roles for mechanical activation of TRAAK in the nodal membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Localization of TRAAK in the nervous system</title><p>Our previous X-ray crystallographic studies of <italic>H. sapiens</italic> TRAAK utilized antigen binding fragments (Fabs) of a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the channel to facilitate crystal packing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brohawn et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brohawn et al., 2013</xref>).

The functional integrity of purified TRAAK was verified in planar lipid bilayer recordings of reconstituted channels that show K<sup>+</sup>-selective currents with properties that recapitulate those of TRAAK channels expressed in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The structure was solved by molecular replacement using Fab and channel search models and refined to a final R<sub>work</sub> = 0.25 and R<sub>free</sub> = 0.29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The structure consists of one channel with two bound Fabs on opposite sides of the channel extracellular helical cap in the asymmetric unit. Consistent with a strong interaction, the Fabs bind to large epitopes (1003 Å<sup>2</sup> average buried surface area) with high shape complementarity. The antibody binding site spans both subunits of the dimeric channel, with cap helix 1 of one protomer forming ~2/3 of the surface and cap helix two from the second protomer forming the remaining ~1/3. Most of the twenty epitope-forming residues are poorly conserved among K2P channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), offering a molecular explanation for the high specificity of the antibody for TRAAK among all mouse K2Ps. Some K2Ps can heterodimerize to form functional channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levitz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lengyel et al., 2016</xref>).

However, we found no evidence for channel localization in sensory structures including lanceolate endings surrounding hair follicles and Merkel cells within touch domes of glabrous skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Instead, TRAAK-labeling was restricted to ~1 um<sup>3</sup> puncta throughout the nervous system (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These sites are not synapses as TRAAK staining is spatially distinct from PSD95-labeled terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with previous reports of neuronally restricted TRAAK expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fink et al., 1998</xref>), antibody staining was distinct from astrocytic (GFAP-positive) and microglial (IBA1-positive) processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).</p><p>We found TRAAK immunolabeling exclusively at nodes of Ranvier throughout the nervous system. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows a representative section of hindbrain white matter enriched in myelinated axons from a <italic>Thy1<sup>EGFP</sup></italic> animal that expresses EGFP within a sparse subset of neurons.

We took advantage of the spatial segregation of different neuronal types in the PNS to determine whether TRAAK is specifically expressed in motor or sensory neurons. Motor neuron enriched ventral horns, sensory neuron enriched dorsal horns, and regions of the projected nerve containing a mixed population of motor and sensory fibers contain comparably high proportions of TRAAK-positive nodes (82 ± 4%, 86 ± 0.5% and 82 ± 0.2% respectively (mean ± standard deviation, n = 3)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–H</xref>). Other regions containing mixed populations of neuronal types gave similar results. 81 ± 2% of nodes in the spinal cord contained TRAAK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and no apparent difference was observed between motor and sensory tracts.

We conclude that TRAAK is not specifically localized to either sensory or motor fibers and is present in a majority of nodes in the PNS.</p><p>It is impossible from sectioned tissue to determine whether TRAAK-positive and TRAAK-negative nodes can both occur within a single nerve fiber. To query this point, we isolated five axons from sciatic nerve; four of these contained three nodes and one contained two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). We observe that all nodes within a fiber are either positive (axons 1–3) or negative (axons 4–5). If we assume that positive and negative nodes can exist in a single fiber with random occurrence then, given that 80% of nodes in the sciatic nerve are positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), the probability of not observing a ‘mixed’ fiber among the five dissected nerves is ((0.8)<sup>3</sup> + (0.2)<sup>3</sup>)<sup>4</sup>((0.8)<sup>2</sup> + (0.2)<sup>2</sup>), which is slightly less than 0.05. The occurrence of TRAAK in nodes is therefore unlikely to be random.

Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> currents were elicited with depolarizing potential steps of increasing amplitude preceded by a 50 ms potential step to −120 mV to remove steady-state Na<sub>V</sub> channel inactivation. In nodes of both species, early transient Na<sup>+</sup> currents and delayed outward K<sup>+</sup> currents were recorded. Notably, application of the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker TEA (10 mM) revealed clear differences between the K<sup>+</sup> currents in frog and rat nodes. In frog nodes,~75% of the outward K<sup>+</sup> current was blocked by TEA, whereas the remaining TEA-insensitive current is predominantly mediated by leak-type current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hille, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stämpfli and Hille, 1976</xref>). In contrast, in rat nodes, the majority of the K<sup>+</sup> current is TEA-insensitive and is largely composed of leak-type current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiu et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiu and Ritchie, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brismar, 1980</xref>). These differences in outward K<sup>+</sup> current likely reflect the difference in K<sub>V</sub> channel distribution in rat and frog nodes of Ranvier. In the frog, TEA-sensitive K<sub>V</sub> channels are co-localized with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels at the node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hille, 1967</xref>), while in the rat, K<sub>V</sub>1 channels are restricted to the juxtaparanodal membrane and are absent in nodal axolemma uncovered by Schwann cell loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiu et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Röper and Schwarz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brismar, 1980</xref>). Therefore, K<sub>V</sub>1 channels likely do not contribute to the nodal outward current in rat and any TEA-sensitive outward current in the rat node is likely mediated by K<sub>V</sub>7.2/7.3 channels that co-localize with nodal Na<sub>V</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwarz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Devaux et al., 2004</xref>). As expected, Na<sup>+</sup> currents are unaffected by TEA and are outwardly directed at potential steps larger than the Na<sup>+</sup> equilibrium potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref> demonstrate the effect of TEA on the resting potential and action potential from a frog and a rat node of Ranvier, respectively. Frog action potentials had an amplitude of ~115 mV and sometimes exhibit a noticeable afterhyperpolarization. Application of TEA depolarized the resting potential by ~4 mV, reduced the action potential amplitude by ~4 mV, prolonged the duration of the action potential by a factor of almost two, and typically abolished the afterhyperpolarization. In contrast, action potentials recorded from rat nodes showed no afterhyperpolarization. Application of TEA depolarized the rat node resting potential by ~4 mV and reduced the amplitude of the action potential by ~5 mV, but the duration of the action potentials remained almost unchanged. Taken together, these data show that repolarization of the frog action potential is brought about by a combination of Na<sub>V</sub> channel inactivation and delayed activation of TEA-sensitive K<sub>V</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frankenhaeuser and Huxley, 1964</xref>), very similar to the ionic mechanism underlying action potential repolarization in the squid giant axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>). In contrast, TEA-sensitive Kv channels do not play a significant role in repolarization of the action potential of the rat node of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiu et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiu and Ritchie, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brismar, 1980</xref>). In the mammalian node, K<sup>+</sup>-selective leak currents provide the K<sup>+</sup> conductance necessary for node repolarization and the time course of action potential repolarization is determined by that of Na<sup>+</sup> channel inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwarz et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Does TRAAK contribute to the leak-type currents in rat nodes? We first asked whether localization of TRAAK in rat is similar to mouse. We generated a polyclonal antibody against mouse TRAAK that cross-reacts with the rat channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) and using this antibody, found that rat TRAAK is similarly localized to nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>). We next took a pharmacological approach to assess whether TRAAK contributes to nodal currents in rat axons. The small molecule RU2 was identified in a high-throughput K<sup>+</sup> channel drug screen as a mouse TRAAK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Su et al., 2016</xref>). We verified that RU2 also blocks rat TRAAK heterologously expressed in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The RU2-sensitive current appears as a K<sup>+</sup> leak current with rectification. In nodes of Ranvier recorded at 32-37<sup>o</sup> C, 10 or 20 µM RU2 blocked about 20% of the outward K<sup>+</sup> current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>, n = 16 RU2-sensitive nodes). We note that the RU2-sensitive currents in rat nodes have different voltage- and time-dependent opening rates compared to the TRAAK currents in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This difference in gating is consistent with the previously demonstrated behavior of TRAAK channels at different levels of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schewe et al., 2016</xref>). The currents in CHO cells are consistent with high levels of TRAAK activation and those in nodes of Ranvier are consistent with sub-maximally activated TRAAK. RU2 application did not affect the Na<sup>+</sup> current amplitude, only an outward K<sup>+</sup> current in the absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel inhibitor tetrodotoxin (TTX). Upon removal, the effect of RU2 on the outward K<sup>+</sup> current was reversible (n = 8). RU2-sensitive current was observed in 89% of rat nodes recorded at 32-37<sup>o</sup> C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, n = 18) or 86% of rat nodes recorded at either 32–37 <sup>o</sup> C or room temperature (n = 64 nodes).

Application of RU2 depolarized the nodal membrane by ~4 mV and resulted in a significant reduction in action potential amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This reduction was completely reversible upon washout. Repetitive 100 Hz stimulation exaggerates this effect: in the presence of RU2 the amplitudes of the repetitively elicited action potentials decrease until they reach a steady state level of diminished amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The RU2-induced reduction of the action potential amplitude is likely due to a depolarization-induced decrease in the number of Na<sub>V</sub> channels available for activation upon a depolarizing stimulus. This effect is illustrated by the Na<sub>V</sub> inactivation curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). Here, the resting potential is defined as V = 0 mV (see Materials and methods). Since the inactivation curve is steep near the resting potential, even a small depolarization of 4 mV produces a relatively large increase in the number of inactivated Na<sub>V</sub> channels. This results in a reduction of the action potential amplitude similar to that caused by the RU2-induced depolarization. These experiments demonstrate that TRAAK-mediated leakage current is important for the stabilization of a negative resting potential and maximum spike amplitude. The same function has been ascribed to the resting conductance of the nodal M-current mediated by Kv7 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battefeld et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50403.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>TRAAK stabilizes the resting potential of the rat node of Ranvier.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative action potential recorded from a rat node of Ranvier before drug application (left), during application of 10 uM RU2 (red, center), and after drug wash out (right).

Our imaging data are consistent with TRAAK being exclusively localized to nodes of Ranvier as we did not detect TRAAK elsewhere in the nervous system, including within initial segments of myelinated axons that otherwise share a common set of ion channels and scaffolding components. This finding implies that unlike other nodal channels (including Na<sub>v</sub>s and K<sub>v</sub>3.1, 7.2, and 7.3 channels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rasband and Peles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arancibia-Carcamo and Attwell, 2014</xref>), TRAAK localization to nodes is not mediated through a direct interaction with AnkG. TRAAK is found in most (~80%), but not all, nodes we imaged and from experiments with teased fibers we conclude that neurons likely either have TRAAK in all nodes or no nodes within their axons. It may be that the presence or absence of TRAAK in nodes gives rise to functional differences between neurons, perhaps in action potential shape or firing properties. We were not able to further distinguish TRAAK-positive and –negative neurons, so evaluating potential differences between neurons with and without TRAAK will require additional genetic, anatomical and electrophysiological characterization of neuronal classes.</p><p>Our data do not exclude the possibility that other K2P channels are also present in the node of Ranvier. RU2 is not entirely specific for TRAAK among K2P channels and therefore some of the RU2-sensitive component could be due to TRESK or TASK3, which are also RU2-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Su et al., 2016</xref>). However, that the fraction of TRAAK-positive nodes by immunohistochemistry is about equal to the RU2-sensitive fraction by electrophysiology is an observation best explained (although not ‘proved’) if TRAAK is the only RU2-sensitive K2P channel in the node. Since TRAAK accounts for only about 20% of the total leak current under our recording conditions, we think it is likely that other RU2-insensitive K2P channels are present in nodes. Their identification is not the focus of this study.</p><p>TRAAK channels are only present in organisms that have myelinated axons and nodes of Ranvier – the gnathostomes or jawed vertebrates for which evolution of axonal myelination with myelin basic protein is a defining characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nawaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nave and Werner, 2014</xref>). It is clear from the comparison of recordings from single rat and frog nodes presented here that the contribution of TRAAK to nodal currents is not strictly conserved between species with TRAAK. In frog nodes, K<sub>V</sub> currents play the dominant role in repolarizing the action potential. In rat nodes, however, K<sub>V</sub> channels make a small contribution and TRAAK is a component of the leak-type outward current. The basal activity of TRAAK plays a role in maintaining a negative resting potential, thereby increasing Na<sub>v</sub> channel availability and maximizing the action potential amplitude in rats. The presence of TRAAK in mammalian nodes raises additional questions. Are the unique functional properties of TRAAK tuned to specific physiological aspects of node of Ranvier? What might other roles of TRAAK in nodes be? We speculate on three possibilities below.</p><p>First, the basal activity of TRAAK contributes to repolarizing the nodal membrane during a spike. Indeed, mammalian myelinated axons generally lack K<sub>V</sub> channel activity that could repolarize the membrane. In mammals, among axonal K<sub>V</sub> channels, K<sub>V</sub>1 channels are juxtaparanodally restricted and do not normally influence action potential repolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arroyo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwarz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Röper and Schwarz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiu and Ritchie, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwarz et al., 1995</xref>), K<sub>V</sub>3 channels present in central nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Devaux et al., 2003</xref>) play minor roles after development of mature nodes, and slowly opening K<sub>V</sub>7 channels are thought to contribute mostly to the resting membrane potential and thus Na<sub>v</sub> channel availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwarz et al., 2006</xref>). As our recordings presented here show, repolarization of the mammalian node depends on a K<sup>+</sup> ‘leak’ conductance: a K<sup>+</sup>-selective, approximately voltage-independent, TEA-insensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel. These properties are hallmarks of K2P channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Enyedi and Czirják, 2010</xref>). We demonstrate that TRAAK contributes to this leak K<sup>+</sup> conductance. The low open probability of TRAAK in resting membranes in the absence of mechanical force (&lt;1% open) may be sufficient to support nodal repolarization. K2Ps are capable (in simulations and culture cells) of supporting repolarization and repetitive spiking in the absence of K<sub>v</sub> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacKenzie et al., 2015</xref>). It may be that utilization of basally open TRAAK channels to repolarize nodes enables higher frequency axonal firing compared to utilization of slower-opening K<sub>v</sub> channels.</p><p>Second, TRAAK could serve a mechanoprotective role in nodes of Ranvier. Mechanical insult can stretch and injure nerves and elaborate anatomical features exist to protect nerves and their enclosed axons from such injury at the expense of increased axonal length and action potential transmission time. Nerves in rorqual whale tongues offer an extreme example by allowing extension more than twice their unstretched length without damage; this property accommodates the tremendous volume of water engulfed during feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vogl et al., 2015</xref>). In fact, most nerves contain bundles of axons that are pleated like an accordion along the long axis of a nerve such that they can unfold during stretch to prevent mechanical damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Topp and Boyd, 2006</xref>). Within nerves, nodes appear to be particularly mechanically vulnerable sites. Nerve stretch could generate sufficient membrane tension to open depolarizing channels, perhaps weakly mechanosensitive Na<sub>v</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tabarean et al., 1999</xref>). Unchecked depolarization could initiate ectopic action potentials mid-axon and destroy the fidelity of action potential transmission. Indeed, this is presumably the origin of perceived light flashes – known as phosphenes - in response to mechanical stimulation of the visual system, including nerve fiber tracts that connect the eye to the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Newton, 1669</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grüsser and Hagner, 1990</xref>), or of the perception of sensory input along the forearm and small and ring fingers when the ulnar nerve is mechanically compressed as it courses superficially across the medial aspect of the elbow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clarke et al., 2007</xref>). The mechanosensitive properties of TRAAK might function to counteract mechanical-induced depolarization in nodes by opening and hyperpolarizing the nodal membrane to reduce the probability of aberrant action potential initiation. Thus, mechanosensitivity of TRAAK channels could function as a molecular scale mechanism to protect against mechanically-induced action potentials that would function in concert with macroscopic scale protective mechanisms such as fiber pleating inside sheathed bundles.</p><p>Third, TRAAK gating could possibly respond to a mechanical component of the action potential. While this idea might seem far-fetched, mechanical displacements in nerves associated with action potentials have been documented experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iwasa et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Optical and piezoelectric measurements showed swelling of crab nerve fibers during the action potential associated with an outward displacement of the nerve membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iwasa et al., 1980</xref>). And high bandwidth atomic force microscopy showed that nerve terminals in the mammalian neurohypophysis undergo transient swelling associated with Na<sup>+</sup> influx during the action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). While the physical origins of these mechanical transients remain uncertain, several theories have been considered, including swelling secondary to water and Na<sup>+</sup> entry through Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2007</xref>), mechanical forces associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rvachev, 2010</xref>), and mechanical forces that are thermodynamically coupled to charging the capacitance of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hady El and Machta, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mosgaard et al., 2015</xref>). Further work is needed to test the idea that mammals could make use of mechano-electric phenomena to activate TRAAK K<sup>+</sup> channels in the node of Ranvier.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification of mouse TRAAK</title><p>A gene encoding <italic>Mus musculus</italic> TRAAK (UniProt O88454) was codon-optimized for yeast expression, synthesized (Genewiz, Inc) and cloned into a modified pPICZ-B vector (Life Technologies Inc) to create a human rhinovirus 3C protease-cleavable C-terminal EGFP-10x histidine fusion protein construct.

After removal of the epineurium and perineurium, fibers were teased apart using Dumont 5 fine tweezers in HEPES rat Ringer’s solution (5 mM HEPES-Na pH7.2, 135 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>).

Primary antibodies were diluted in solution A and incubated with fibers overnight at 4°C. CF-488A conjugated goat anti-mouse (Biotium 20018) and CF-555 conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Biotium 20232) antibodies were subsequently used for fluorescent labeling. Full-length <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> TRAAK was cloned between the EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites on a modified PCEH vector, resulting in a C-terminal GFP fusion. HEK293T cells were transfected with rat TRAAK using Lipofectamine 3000 Reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocols. 24 hr after transfection, the cells were fixed and stained as described for rat sciatic nerve, except that only Rabbit anti-TRAAK polyclonal antibody 2134 and the CF-555 conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were applied. Epi-fluorescence and bright field images of stained fibers were taken on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope using a Plan Apo 20 × 0.75 NA dry objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Whole-cell recording of rat TRAAK heterologously expressed in CHO cells</title><p>CHO-K1 cells (ATCC, cultured as described above) were transfected with rat TRAAK-GFP with FugeneHD (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Room-temperature whole-cell recordings were performed ~24 hr after transfection. Bath solution was rat Ringer’s solution and pipette solution was rat axoplasmic solution and contained (in mM): 10 Tris-Cl pH 7.4, 160 KCl. To test the effect of RU2, 20 µM RU2 was supplemented to the bath solution and locally perfused at the cell. Borosilicate glass pipettes with resistance between 2 and 5 MΩ were used for room temperature whole-cell recordings. An Axopatch 200B amplifier connected to a Digidata 1440A digitizer (Molecular Devices) was used for data acquisition. Analog signals were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz. A voltage protocol of holding at −80 mV, stepping to −100 mV to 60 mV for 200 milliseconds in 10 mV steps, then stepping back to −40 mV was used to record TRAAK current.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Voltage clamp recordings from isolated rat nodes of Ranvier</title><p>The dissection of single myelinated nerve fibers followed the procedure as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stämpfli and Hille, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nonner, 1969</xref>). Adult Wistar rats (500-700 g) were decapitated during deep anesthesia induced by exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> and sciatic nerves were isolated. Following removal of the perineural sheaths from the sciatic nerve, a single myelinated nerve fiber was isolated over a distance of two internodes using a pair of fine forceps (Dumont no. 5) and angled spring scissors (FST, No.15010).</p><p>A schematic drawing of voltage clamping the node of Ranvier is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nonner, 1969</xref>). The isolated nerve fiber was placed on top of the separating walls of the recording chamber filled with Ringer’s solution (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) and fixed to the ridges with thin Vaseline seals. In addition to the electrical resistance provided by the Vaseline seals, the external resistance between pool B (connected to ground potential) and pool C was further increased by introducing an air gap (pool F in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The side pools C and E of the experimental chamber were filled with axoplasmic solution and both internodes were cut, creating a direct electrical connection between the axoplasm of the fiber and electrodes in C and E. The following solutions were used: Ringer’s solution; isotonic KCl: 160 KCl, 2.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>; axoplasmic solution: 160 KCl. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with Tris-HCl for all buffers. Chemicals except RU2 were purchased from Sigma. Measurements were performed at room temperature (20–23°C) or near physiological temperature (32–37°C).</p><p>The operating principle of the Nonner-clamp is as follows. The feedback amplifier keeps the potential at point C at ground potential by adjusting the potential at E. Any internodal current between C and D would also flow across the seal resistance between C and B and would produce a potential drop. The feedback amplifier prevented such a potential drop and thus eliminated flow of current between D and C. These two points were kept at ground potential. The potential at A with respect to ground corresponded to the absolute membrane potential of the node under investigation. It could be changed by means of the pulse generator. By passing current through the resistance between E and D, the external potential in A was forced to follow the command waveform generated by the pulse generator. The current flowing between E and D was identical to the membrane current of the node under investigation and was recorded as the voltage drop across the resistance of the internode ED assuming an internodal resistance of 15 MΩ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stämpfli and Hille, 1976</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Röper and Schwarz, 1989</xref>). Membrane currents were low-pass filtered at 3 kHz. Capacity currents and leakage currents were not subtracted. Since the Nonner-clamp does not allow one to measure the absolute membrane potential, we used the following procedure to measure the membrane potential. Following successful mounting of a single nerve fiber in the recording chamber, we thus adjusted the holding potential to a value at which 30% of the Na channels were inactivated (<italic>h</italic><sub>∞</sub>=0.7). This degree of Na inactivation was assumed to approximate the physiological holding potential. Previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwarz et al., 2006</xref>), the absolute membrane potential (E<sub>H</sub>) was determined by the following procedure: the node under investigation was superfused with isotonic KCl, and the amplitude of the potential step was determined to reach the reversal potential for K<sup>+</sup> (E<sub>K</sub>) assuming E<sub>K</sub> = 0 mV. The value of E<sub>H</sub> measured in this way was −75 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwarz et al., 2006</xref>). A similar value for the resting potential was previously reported for rat nerve fibers: −80 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brismar, 1980</xref>), −78 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neumcke and Stämpfli, 1982</xref>) and −77 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Röper and Schwarz, 1989</xref>). A value of −70 mV in the frog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stämpfli and Hille, 1976</xref>) and −75 mV in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwarz et al., 2006</xref>) were chosen in the present experiments.</p><p>Node recordings were made in Hamburg, Germany and in New York, USA. The dissection procedure and positioning of the single nerve fiber into the nerve chamber were identical in all recordings. Recordings in Hamburg used the amplifier as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nonner (1969)</xref>. For recordings in New York, a new custom-made amplifier was used as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Node-clamp using integrated operational amplifiers</title><p>The node-clamp for electrophysiological measurements of isolated nodes of Ranvier was originally reported in 1969 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nonner, 1969</xref>). Since low impedance electrical access to the inside of the node is not possible, this method was designed, as described above, to keep the electrical potential of the inside of the node (point D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) at the signal ground potential, 0 mV. This was achieved using a high bandwidth and very high input impedance amplifier built using discrete components. The original Nonner-clamp is not commercially available and very few are still in working order. For this reason, and since integrated operational amplifiers (opamps) have improved significantly over the past five decades, we re-built the Nonner’s node-clamp using integrated opamps for experiments in New York.</p><p>The new node-clamp was based on an AD8033 operational amplifier (Analog Devices) which provides stable 80 MHz −3 dB gain-bandwidth product and over 10<sup>12</sup> Ω input impedance (Figure S7). During construction, care was taken to minimize the stray capacitance between the output (point E) and the input (point C) of the main amplifier. Batteries were used as the power supply to avoid the 60 Hz sinusoidal contamination from the mains. Command voltages were generated using the Digidata 1440A digitizer (Molecular devices) controlled by the pClamp software. The output of the digitizer was combined with an offset voltage tunable with a potentiometer, scaled and buffered before application to point A. The output of the node-clamp was buffered, amplified and combined with an offset before conversion into digital signal using the digitizer. The current across the nodal membrane was calculated based on the estimated resistance between the node and one open end of the fiber (R9,~15 MΩ) <italic>I<sub>node</sub></italic> = <italic>V<sub>E</sub></italic>/R9. In the current clamp configuration, the injection current was calculated in the same way from the command voltage applied at point E, <italic>I<sub>inj</sub></italic> = <italic>V<sub>E</sub></italic>/R9. Scaling factors were set in the ‘lab bench’ options in pClamp software to account for these conversions and the scaling factors in the circuit. This amplifier design enabled good recordings in the majority of isolated frog and rat nodes. Instabilities (ringing) were rare but occasionally observed at the apex of sodium current especially when the sodium current was very large and the fibers were thin. This circuit is versatile and could be easily improved in the future using more suitably developed opamps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at The Rockefeller University, University of California, Berkeley or the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (Org 798/2016).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data availability</title><p>The X-ray crystallographic coordinates and structure factors for mouse TRAAK in complex with the 1B10 Fab are available at the Protein Data Bank under accession 6PIS.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>JRS wants to thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for financial support (Schw 292/17–1), Yvonne Pechmann for unfailing technical assistance, and Dr. Matthias Kneussel for continuous support.

The study is an important advance because, at long last, it identifies one of the channels that carry the &quot;leak&quot; current that maintains the resting potential and terminates action potentials in myelinated neurons.</p><p>At the end of the Discussion the hypothesis is raised that the mechanosensitivity of TRAAK could result in its activation due to mechanical correlates of action potentials. This is a bold but maybe far-fetched hypothesis based on very little evidence. My own take is that it is good to raise the hypothesis, but only in a tentative manner, unless there is additional experimental or quantitative theoretical evidence that can be marshaled in support. Even a crude estimate of the size of mechanical disturbances in the nodal membrane, for example deduced from the optical results or the known water transport by Na channels, would be helpful in convincing a skeptical reader. Or, if water diffusion within the axon is slow enough to allow it, might one expect to see a brief &quot;overshoot&quot; of TRAAK current resulting from residual mechanical stress following the termination of Na<sup>+</sup> current?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Brohawn et al., focuses on expression and function of the TRAAK leak potassium channel in myelinated axons. Ion channels that control action potential propagation in myelinated axons are crucial to normal nervous system function, and their dysfunction contributes to disease. The identification of a novel ion channel present at the node of Ranvier is an important contribution to our understanding of this important neuronal compartment. The authors use newly developed and well characterized antibodies to effectively define TRAAK as a nodal ion channel in mouse CNS and PNS. They employ direct nodal recordings to look at single action potentials and how they are impacted by blockers of Kv channels and of TRAAK. The paper is in general clearly written and the figures clear and effective at conveying the results, with the minor exceptions noted below. There is a lot of information in the Results section in addition to the concise reporting of the experimental results, and as detailed this also generally holds for the Discussion. Both should be shortened and revised to make it more about this study. In particular, readers would be better served by a Discussion that focused on the validity of the authors' experimental observations, and by the authors discussing their findings in light of other published work dealing with the same or closely related subjects.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study by Brohawn et al. describes the novel finding that the tandem-pore potassium channel, TRAAK, is present at nodes of Ranvier both in peripheral and central neurons. To show this, the authors generate and extensively validate a TRAAK antibody using immunolabeling in TRAAK KO mice. In addition, they generate a crystal structure of the TRAAK protein bound to the antibody FAB fragment, they present immunostaining results showing a lack of binding to similar K2P channels, and they show in expression systems that the antibody does not interfere with the function of the channel. These thorough controls are a necessary foundation for the results shown throughout the rest of the study. Using the validated antibody, the authors then test the distribution of TRAAK within cells and conclude that it is expressed at nodes on an all-or-none basis.</p><p>The second half the paper tests the function of TRAAK in repolarization of axonal spikes using &quot;node clamp&quot; in rat or frog myelinated fibers. As part of this set of experiments, the authors designed and constructed an updated version of the classic node clamp amplifier and a description of the circuit is provided. Using this technique, the authors argue that while frog nodes that depend on high-voltage activated Kv1 channels for spike repolarization in nodes, rat nodes depend primarily on TEA-insensitive potassium leak channels for nodal repolarization. To demonstrate this, they use a novel compound, RU2, developed using a high-throughput screen and shown to block TRAAK in expression systems. In rat sciatic nerve, RU2 inhibited ~20% of the leak current in the node of Ranvier. Examination of spiking showed that RU2 depolarized the resting membrane potential which was accompanied by a reduction in spike height. They show that this is likely due to inactivation of Na channels.</p><p>This study describes in interesting and novel finding that TRAAK channels are present at nodes and contributes to their function. The authors should be commended for the substantial effort dedicated here to validating the antibody and for including the updated node clamp design. While the authors were rigorous in their validation of the antibody, a weakness of the study is that physiology component of the study depends almost completely on a novel drug, RU2, the specificity of which is unclear.</p><p>• The specificity of RU2 for TRAAK channels in native neurons is unclear. Specifically, I-V plots for the RU2-blocked current in CHO cells show roughly linear increases in current with voltage (Figure 6—figure supplement 1E). On the other hand, the RU2-blocked current in rat node (Figure 6) is small at hyperpolarized voltages and increases more prominently at voltages above -40 mV. Given the authors' published work showing that RU2 is not specific for TRAAK and blocks other K2P channels, this raises the question of whether multiple channels contribute to the RU2-blocked current at the node. The authors should provide more a definitive/complementary proof that TRAAK channels make a significant contribution to step-evoked currents and action potential firing in nodes. For example, they could test whether the RU2-blocked component is also sensitive to lipids.</p><p>Relatedly, it is important to know whether the example IV plots in Figure 6 represent typical RU2-blocked currents in node clamp recordings. Additional IV plot examples or an average quantification would help in comparing RU2-blocked currents in node clamp recordings to RU2-blocked currents recorded in expression systems.</p><p>• In Figure 4, the authors conclude that TRAAK is expressed in an all-or-none fashion based only on a limited sample size. This conclusion is based on evidence from only five (5) axons. In fact, only three TRAAK positive axons were analyzed, each of which had at most three nodes of Ranvier. To make a convincing point here, the authors would need to add more data.</p><p>To more robustly evaluate whether subpopulations of TRAAK positive and negative cells exist, however, the authors may consider fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments (FISH) quantifying TRAAK RNA in cell bodies would be much more convincing if they have access to this technique.</p><p>• Regarding Figure 7, the authors mention that RU2-induced depolarization was not always observed potentially due to the methodological issues. How often was this true and what was the threshold for considering a response RU2-insensitive? Please quantify. Even though depolarization was not always observed, it is still possible that RU2-block of TRAAK may lead to an increase in the input resistance of the node. What was the effect of RU2 on the input resistance?</p><p>• Supplementary Figure 4 is confusing and impossible to interpret. Specifically, it is unclear where (or if) labeling for the TRAAK positive puncta are present. The authors provide little in the way of specific descriptions of brain region or labeling of landmarks. Please improve this image and its presentation or consider removing.</p><p>• The images shown Figure 2 and 3 would benefit by adding higher magnification images of nodes, similar to those provided in Figures 2A and 3C. For the reader, these high-resolution images are necessary as the colocalization of proteins is difficult to determine in the low magnification figures. For example, the images showing validation of antibody in TRAAK KO mice are also difficult to see and compare with individual nodes in control mice.</p><p>As a general remark, the small size of the images in this study make evaluation of the data difficult. For example, the arrows in Figures 2D and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B are barely visible.</p><p>• Figure 6 describes the block of RU2 but does not mention what approximate voltage is being discussed. Along those lines, the authors mentioned that 10 out of 64 nodes were insensitive to RU2. Where these cells included in the values mentioned in the figure legends?</p><p>• The authors speculate extensively throughout the paper (Abstract, Introduction and Discussion) on potential function of TRAAK as a mechanosensitive channel in the node. However, there are no experiments/data in this study that directly test mechanosensation. The authors may want to add an experiment testing this idea or consider rebalancing their discussion of this topic.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50403.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The most significant concern raised by the reviewers is about the specificity of RU2 and the conclusion that TRAAK is responsible for a significant portion of the repolarizing current in rat axons.

Many small edits were made and one major addition addresses the all-or-none presence of TRAAK in the last paragraph of the section ‘Localization of TRAAK in the nervous system’:</p><p>“It is impossible from sectioned tissue to determine whether TRAAK-positive and TRAAK-negative nodes can both occur within a single nerve fiber. To query this point, we isolated five axons from sciatic nerve; four of these contained three nodes and one contained two (Figure 4A,B). We observe that all nodes within a fiber are either positive (axons 1-3) or negative (axons 4-5). If we assume that positive and negative nodes can exist in a single fiber with random occurrence then, given that 80% of nodes in the sciatic nerve are positive (Figure S4), the probability of not observing a ‘mixed’ fiber among the five dissected nerves is ((0.8)<sup>3</sup> + (0.2) <sup>3)4</sup>((0.8)<sup>2</sup> + (0.2) <sup>2</sup>), which is slightly less than 0.05. The occurrence of TRAAK in nodes is therefore unlikely to be random. The data are more consistent with there being two kinds of fibers, those with and those without TRAAK.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
