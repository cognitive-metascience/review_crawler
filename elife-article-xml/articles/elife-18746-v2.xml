and external cues. In response to certain stress conditions, many mRNA decay factors are enriched in processing bodies (PBs), cellular structures involved in degradation and/or storage of mRNAs. Yet, how cells regulate assembly and disassembly of PBs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in budding yeast, mutations in the DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1 that prevent ATP hydrolysis, or that affect the interaction between Dhh1 and Not1, the central scaffold of the CCR4-NOT complex and an activator of the Dhh1 ATPase, prevent PB disassembly <italic>in vivo</italic>. Intriguingly, this process can be recapitulated <italic>in vitro</italic>, since recombinant Dhh1 and RNA, in the presence of ATP, phase-separate into liquid droplets that rapidly dissolve upon addition of Not1. Our results identify the ATPase activity of Dhh1 as a critical regulator of PB formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18746.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18746.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18746.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most cells and organisms live in changeable environments. Adapting to environmental changes means that organisms must quickly alter which of their genes they express. Varying which genes are switched on or off is not enough; cells must also degrade existing messenger RNAs (or mRNAs for short), which contain the genetic instructions of the previously active genes. Therefore, cells must tightly regulate the machinery needed to degrade mRNAs.</p><p>When Baker’s yeast (also known as budding yeast) cells experience certain stressful conditions, the proteins that break down mRNAs localize into specific structures inside the cell known as ‘processing bodies’. These structures are found in many other organisms across evolution, from yeast to human. Processing bodies also form in a variety of biological contexts, such as in nerve cells and developing embryos. Still, why cells form processing bodies, and how their assembly is regulated, is not well understood.</p><p>One essential component of processing bodies is an enzyme called Dhh1. This enzyme has been conserved throughout evolution and is known to promote the decay of mRNAs as well as to repress their translation into proteins. Now, Mugler, Hondele et al. show that Dhh1’s must break down molecules of the energy carrier ATP (referred to as its “ATPase activity”) in order to regulate the dynamic nature of processing bodies. Mutant Dhh1 proteins that lack ATPase activity form permanent processing bodies in non-stressed yeast cells. This shows that that the breakdown of ATP by Dhh1 is required for the disassembly of processing bodies. Similar results were seen for mutant Dhh1 proteins that cannot interact with Not1, a protein which enhances the ATPase activity of Dhh1.</p><p>Next Mugler, Hondele et al. mixed purified Dhh1 with ATP and RNA molecules and saw that the mixture underwent a “liquid-liquid phase separation” and formed observable granules, similar to oil droplets in water. These granules dissolved when Not1 was added to stimulate the Dhh1 enzyme to turnover ATP. This showed that several important biochemical and biophysical aspects of processing bodies seen within living cells could be recreated outside of a cell.</p><p>Armed with a greater understanding of the rules that govern the formation of processing bodies, future work can now address how important processing bodies are for regulating gene expression. Another challenge for the future will be to examine the specific roles that processing bodies play in yeast and other cells, like human egg cells or nerve cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18746.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18746.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DEAD box ATPases</kwd><kwd>RNA turnover</kwd><kwd>processing bodies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000914/2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hondele</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 870-2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hondele</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 290-2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heinrich</surname><given-names>Stephanie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Leon Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM058065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weis</surname><given-names>Karsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SNF-159731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weis</surname><given-names>Karsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM101257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weis</surname><given-names>Karsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ATPase Dhh1 controls processing body formation and disassembly in yeast cells, and processing body dynamics can be recapitulated in vitro with recombinant Dhh1, ATP and RNA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rapid modulation of gene expression is critical for cells to respond to environmental challenges and to initiate developmental programs. Eukaryotic cells have developed a variety of mechanisms to achieve tight regulation of gene expression. This includes post-transcriptional control of messenger RNA (mRNA) levels by the regulation of translation or by varying the rates of mRNA degradation. Many of these post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, including the transition from mRNA translation to storage or decay, are not well characterized.</p><p>Cytoplasmic mRNAs are marked by a 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5’ end and by a polyA tail at the 3’ end. These modifications enable interaction with translation factors, including the cap-binding complex (eIF4F) and the polyA binding protein (Pab1) and protect the mRNA against degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coller and Parker, 2004</xref>). Given their impact on both translation and mRNA decay, the status of the 5’ and 3’ ends of the mRNA, as well as the complement of proteins that bind the mRNA termini, are tightly controlled. In budding yeast, a key event for the entry of mRNAs into the degradation pathway is the removal of the polyA tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Muhlrad and Parker, 1992</xref>), which is predominantly accomplished by the CCR4-NOT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wiederhold and Passmore, 2010</xref>). While deadenylated mRNAs can also be degraded from the 3’ end by the 10-subunit exosome complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chlebowski et al., 2013</xref>), mRNA decay in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> occurs predominantly via removal of the 5’ cap by the Dcp1-Dcp2 decapping enzyme, followed by degradation by the 5’-3’ exonuclease, Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garneau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sun et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Under certain stress conditions, such as glucose starvation or osmotic shock, protein factors involved in mRNA turnover can assemble into larger mRNP foci, known as processing bodies (PBs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>). PBs are dynamic, membrane-less structures that appear to form from multivalent interactions between proteins and RNA in a liquid-liquid phase separation phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Decker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fromm et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo and Shorter, 2015</xref>). Remarkably, PBs and several other related types of mRNP granules, including stress granules, germ granules, and neuronal transport granules, form in a number of different species and cell types, and in a variety of different biological contexts, suggesting these structures are important for cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erickson and Lykke-Andersen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kiebler and Bassell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Voronina, 2013</xref>). There is increasing evidence that the ability to form PBs is critical for survival under various stress conditions. For example, cells unable to form PBs show a severe loss in viability in stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shah et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, ectopic expression of highly expressed mRNAs in cells that cannot form PBs is toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lavut and Raveh, 2012</xref>). Because of their composition, PBs are postulated to be sites of mRNA storage and/or mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aizer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Kedersha, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Decker and Parker, 2012</xref>). Yet, how the cell regulates PB assembly and disassembly, and how PBs modulate gene expression, has remained elusive.</p><p>It is likely that PB formation requires factors that can either remodel the translating mRNP complex or stimulate the formation of a decay-competent or repressed mRNP. The DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1 stimulates mRNA decay and translation repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>) and is thought to function at an early step in PB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</xref>), making it a good candidate to facilitate mRNA inactivation. Similar to other DEAD-box proteins, Dhh1 possesses N- and C-terminal RecA-like domains connected by a short linker, and can bind RNA with high affinity in a sequence-independent manner through the phosphate backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Russell et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, Dhh1 has a significantly lower ATPase activity than other well characterized DEAD-box proteins such as eIF4A or Ded1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cordin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dutta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pause and Sonenberg, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tritschler et al., 2009</xref>). This is likely due to intramolecular interactions between its N- and C-terminal RecA lobes that hold Dhh1 in a conformation that is not competent for ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>) suggesting the ATPase activity of Dhh1 is stimulated by factors that can alter the conformation of its two RecA domains.</p><p>Several recent studies have revealed that DEAD-box proteins can be stimulated or inhibited by <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. These interacting partners appear to share a common 3D architecture, namely, the presence of a MIF4G fold – a highly alpha helical HEAT repeat-like structure found in a number of different DEAD-box-interacting proteins, including eIF4G (with eIF4A), Gle1 (with Dbp5) and CWC22 (with eIF4AIII in higher eukaryotes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchwald et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Montpetit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ozgur et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schütz et al., 2008</xref>). Intriguingly, DDX6, the mammalian homolog of Dhh1, binds directly to CNOT1 (Not1 in <italic>S.c</italic>.), the central scaffold subunit of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, through its MIF4G domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>) and CNOT1 binding activates the ATPase of DDX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>). The binding surface between these two proteins is conserved between yeast and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rouya et al., 2014</xref>) suggesting that the interaction between Not1 and Dhh1 is also important for modulating the activity of Dhh1 in budding yeast.</p><p>In this study, we examine the ATPase activity of Dhh1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and demonstrate that the ATPase cycle of Dhh1 is a critical regulator of PB nucleation and disassembly. Cells expressing a Dhh1 variant carrying a mutation in the DEAD motif (E195Q, or Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>) that disrupts ATP hydrolysis form constitutive granules with both the behavior and composition of PBs induced during glucose starvation. Using recombinant proteins, we show that Not1 stimulates the ATPase activity of yeast Dhh1, similar to its function in mammals. Disruption of the interaction between Dhh1 and Not1 <italic>in vivo</italic> leads to the formation of PBs in the absence of stress, similar to the catalytically dead Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> allele. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Dhh1, ATP, and RNA, are sufficient to form liquid droplets <italic>in vitro</italic> with the dynamic behavior of PBs, and that these droplets can be dissolved by addition of purified Not1. Overall, these results reveal that the ATPase activity of Dhh1 is a critical regulator of PB dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Disruption of the ATPase activity of Dhh1 triggers formation of <italic>bona fide</italic> processing bodies</title><p>Previously, our lab demonstrated that abrogation of the ATPase activity of Dhh1 through mutation of the conserved DEAD motif (Dhh1<sup>E195Q</sup>, henceforth Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2C</xref> for a list of all Dhh1 mutants in this study) mislocalizes Dhh1 to large Dcp2-positive foci in the absence of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>).

In order to directly interrogate whether loss of the ATPase activity of Dhh1 disrupted mRNA turnover, we tested the functionality of Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> in mRNA decay using a previously established tether-based functional assay. We and others have observed that tethering Dhh1 to a reporter mRNA using the bacteriophage PP7 or MS2 systems is sufficient to stimulate the decay of a tethered mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>). We expressed wild-type Dhh1, Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>, or GFP as a PP7 coat protein (PP7CP) fusion protein in <italic>dhh1∆</italic> cells containing a single stem loop (PP7L) engineered into the 3’UTR of the <italic>FBA1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and assessed steady state mRNA levels by qPCR.

Given that ATP-bound Dhh1 binds mRNA in a sequence-independent manner with nanomolar affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dutta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ernoult-Lange et al., 2012</xref>), one plausible model is that Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> binds to mRNA, but is unable to dissociate from it in the absence of ATP hydrolysis, ultimately leading to constitutive PB formation. To test this possibility, we generated an RNA binding mutant of Dhh1, Dhh1<sup>3X-RNA</sup>, with alanine substitutions at three residues in the C-terminal RecA domain that are important for RNA binding (R322A, S340A, R370A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dutta et al., 2011</xref>). Wild-type Dhh1, Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>, Dhh1<sup>3X-RNA</sup>, and a Dhh1<sup>DQAD/3X-RNA</sup>-GFP double mutant were co-expressed with Dcp2-mCherry in glucose-rich conditions and PB formation was monitored. While Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> cells formed PBs as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left panel), combining ATPase-dead and RNA-binding mutations in <italic>cis</italic> in the Dhh1<sup>DQAD/3X-RNA</sup> mutant abolished constitutive PB formation. In addition, both Dhh1<sup>3X-RNA</sup> and Dhh1<sup>DQAD/3X-RNA</sup> mutants showed a strong reduction of PB formation in glucose starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panel). In addition, several other PB components showed strong defects in PB localization in cells expressing <italic>dhh1<sup>3X-RNA</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Notably, all Dhh1 mutant proteins were expressed to similar levels in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Next, we examined whether disruptions in RNA binding by Dhh1 also affected Dhh1 function in mRNA decay using our tethering assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Dhh1<sup>3X-RNA</sup> caused only a ~30% reduction in tethered <italic>FBA1</italic> mRNA levels, demonstrating that disruption of the mRNA decay activity of Dhh1 per se is not sufficient to trigger PB formation. Overall, we conclude that Dhh1 in its ATP-bound state promotes PB formation and that PB assembly requires RNA binding by Dhh1.</p><p>The requirements of ATP and RNA binding by Dhh1 for robust PB formation would predict that deletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> should also cause a reduction in PB formation. However, previous reports suggested that <italic>dhh1∆</italic> cells did not show strong defects in PB assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</xref>). To carefully assess the effects of the deletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> on PB formation, we utilized the Diatrack particle tracking software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vallotton and Olivier, 2013</xref>) which allows for an unbiased, automated, and accurate quantitation of foci formation (see Materials and methods). Analysis of greater than 1000 cells per experiment revealed a nearly 80% reduction of the Dcp2-mCherry foci number per cell in <italic>dhh1∆</italic> compared to wild-type cells during glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Together, our results demonstrate that Dhh1 is required for robust PB formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Dynamics of other processing body components are not affected by loss of Dhh1 ATPase activity</title><p>Given that loss of Dhh1 ATPase activity drives constitutive PB assembly and abolishes Dhh1 recycling from PBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>), we asked if Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> also affects the dynamic localization of other mRNA decay factors to PBs. To address this question, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Cells expressing either wild-type Dhh1 or Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> were shifted to glucose-free media to allow PBs to form, and the recovery of GFP-tagged mRNA decay factors within photobleached PBs was measured over time. Consistent with our previous work, Dhh1-GFP PB fluorescence recovered to roughly 80% within 1 min, while the Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>-GFP signal did not, suggesting that Dhh1 ATP hydrolysis is required for Dhh1 to shuttle in and out of PBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the dynamics of several mRNA decay factors, namely Dcp1, Dcp2, Edc3, and Xrn1, remained unchanged in cells expressing Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> compared with Dhh1.

Interestingly, Dhh1 alone is a very poor ATPase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dutta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tritschler et al., 2009</xref>). However, DDX6, the mammalian homolog of Dhh1, can be stimulated by CNOT1, the central scaffold subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>). Based on our data, we would therefore predict that Not1 should promote the disassembly of PBs by stimulating the ATPase cycle of Dhh1. To test this prediction, we first examined whether <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Not1, like its mammalian homolog, stimulated the ATPase activity of Dhh1 <italic>in vitro</italic>. We recombinantly expressed and purified full-length Dhh1 and Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> and performed <italic>in vitro</italic> ATPase assays to assess the enzymatic activity of Dhh1 in the presence or absence of polyU RNA and recombinant Not1<sup>MIF4G</sup> (amino acids 754–1000). Similar to previous observations, we could not detect an intrinsic ATPase activity for Dhh1 alone. Dhh1 was weakly stimulated by polyU RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dutta et al., 2011</xref>), whereas addition of Not1<sup>MIF4G</sup> alone had little effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, addition of polyU RNA and increasing concentrations of Not1<sup>MIF4G</sup> robustly stimulated the ATPase activity of Dhh1, but not Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, Gle1, another MIF4G-fold protein that stimulates the activity of Dbp5, a related DEAD-box ATPase that functions in mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Montpetit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Snay-Hodge et al., 1998</xref>), had no effect on Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

To interfere with the Dhh1-Not1 interaction, we generated a mutant with amino acid substitutions in conserved residues on three distinct surfaces of Dhh1 (Dhh1<sup>R55E, F62E, Q282E, N284E, R355E</sup>, henceforth Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup>) that are predicted to affect binding to Not1, based on previous structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> showed a marked reduction in Not1 binding in immunoprecipitation experiments compared with wild-type Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that these amino acid residues are important for the interaction between Dhh1 and Not1. Given that ATP binding by Dhh1 is likely a prerequisite for PB formation, we also examined whether ATP binding by Dhh1 was needed for the interaction with Not1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, Dhh1<sup>Q-motif</sup> was defective in Not1 binding, suggesting that ATP-bound Dhh1 is needed for robust interaction with Not1.</p><p>To examine the importance of the Dhh1-Not1 interaction in PB formation, we co-expressed GFP-tagged Dhh1, Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>, or Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> along with Dcp2-mCherry, grew cells into mid-log phase and examined Dhh1 localization. Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> triggered Dhh1 and Dcp2 colocalization in cytoplasmic granules in glucose-rich conditions, similar to catalytically dead Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). All Dhh1 mutant proteins were expressed to similar levels in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Two lines of evidence suggest that these granules are indeed <italic>bona fide</italic> PBs. First, Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> granules contained several other known PB proteins – including Xrn1, Dcp1, and Edc3 – in both glucose-rich and glucose starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Second, Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> granule assembly required robust RNA binding activity, as a Dhh1<sup>5X-Not/3X-RNA</sup> mutant showed a dramatic defect in PB formation in both glucose-rich and glucose starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Of note, the Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> mutant did not show a defect in mRNA decay using our tethering assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that PB formation in cells expressing Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> is not due to a block in mRNA degradation.</p><p>Several other decay factors have been shown to interact with the C-terminal RecA domain of Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tritschler et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it was conceivable that the Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> mutant not only disrupted the interaction between Dhh1 and Not1, but also with additional factors, which may contribute to PB formation. We therefore generated a <italic>NOT1</italic> allele, <italic>not1</italic><sup>9X-Dhh1</sup> – with substitutions at conserved amino acid residues that were previously shown to mediate interaction between CNOT1 and DDX6 (F791A, N795A, K804A, E832R, N834A, Y835A, K962A, F967A, and E970A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rouya et al., 2014</xref>). We co-expressed Not1 or Not1<sup>9X-Dhh1</sup> along with Dhh1-GFP and Dcp2-mCherry and shifted cells into media with and without glucose to evaluate PB formation. While cells expressing wild-type Not1 showed diffuse Dhh1 and Dcp2 localization, the Not1<sup>9X-Dhh1</sup> mutant triggered colocalization of Dhh1 and Dcp2 into distinct foci in both glucose-rich and glucose starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). While granule induction in these cells was less pronounced than in Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>or Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) in glucose-rich conditions, these foci contained other known PB components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), suggesting they are <italic>bona fide</italic> PBs. Additionally, Not1<sup>9X-Dhh1</sup> was expressed at wild-type Not1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In summary, we conclude that the ATPase cycle of Dhh1 is a critical regulator of PB formation, and that Not1 regulates the ATPase activity of Dhh1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, preventing PB formation in glucose-rich conditions.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18746.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mutations in Dhh1-binding surface of Not1 trigger constitutive PB assembly.</title><p>Not1 or Not1<sup>9X-Dhh1</sup> was co-expressed with Dhh1-GFP and Dcp2-mCherry and grown to exponential growth phase, then shifted to either glucose-rich or glucose starvation conditions for 20 min and observed by confocal microscopy.

In the absence of Not1<sup>MIF4G</sup> and RNA, we could not detect ATPase activity of Dhh1. Both Dhh1 and DDX6 alone adopt an unusual closed conformation, characterized by extensive intramolecular contacts that are not present in other members of the DEAD-box protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>).

However, even the Not1-stimulated activity of Dhh1 remains low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Although the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle of DEAD-box ATPases often appears to be the release of substrate RNA and ADP/Pi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Henn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hilbert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), it is conceivable that the large conformational change that Dhh1 must undergo in order to bind both Not1 and substrate significantly contributes to the slow ATPase cycle of Dhh1.</p><p>While mutations in conserved residues that mediate the interaction between Dhh1 and Not1 triggered constitutive PB formation, these mutants did not completely recapitulate the degree of PB formation seen in cells expressing catalytically dead Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>.

Neither Dhh1<sup>Q-motif</sup> nor Dhh1<sup>3X-RNA</sup> mutant cells robustly form PBs following glucose starvation. In addition, mutations that disrupt RNA binding also prevent constitutive PB formation of catalytically dead Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Remarkably, Dhh1 forms liquid droplets <italic>in vitro</italic> that require both ATP and RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that multimeric assembly of Dhh1 in its ATP-bound state with RNA may drive PB formation. Since DDX6 can oligomerize in both an RNA-dependent and RNA-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ernoult-Lange et al., 2012</xref>), and given that both Dhh1 and DDX6 exist in molar excess over cytoplasmic mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagaraj et al., 2011</xref>), it is conceivable that an ATP-bound conformation of Dhh1 multimerizes on RNA <italic>in vivo</italic>, thereby delivering mRNAs to PBs and seeding PB assembly. Upon ATP hydrolysis, Dhh1 could then return to the cytoplasmic pool to bind and deliver the next mRNA target. However, when ATP hydrolysis is inhibited, such as in Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> or Dhh1<sup>5X-Not</sup>-expressing cells, Dhh1 remains associated with its mRNA client, triggering the formation of constitutive PBs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Functional role of PBs</title><p>Despite an increasing understanding of PB composition, the precise functional role of PBs remains unclear. Given the large number of mRNA decay factors present in PB assemblies, as well as the accumulation of Xrn1-protected polyG-tract-containing mRNAs, PBs were initially proposed to be sites of mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</xref>). However, several studies have shown that mRNAs can also stably localize within PBs, raising the question of whether these granules are sites of active mRNA decay or rather of mRNA storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hocine et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lavut and Raveh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zid and O’Shea, 2014</xref>). It should be noted, however, that in many cases mRNAs were localized to PBs using either the MS2 or PP7 coat protein system, whereby multiple stem loops are engineered into the 3’UTR of transcripts and then visualized using fluorescently tagged coat-protein fusions that recognize these stem loops. Yet, recent data indicate that these stem loop systems may inhibit mRNA decay in budding yeast, and that primarily these stem loop structures – but not the body of transcripts – persist in PBs, and cannot be degraded by Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia and Parker, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haimovich et al., 2016</xref>; Heinrich and Weis, unpublished). Our smFISH data are consistent with the hypothesis that active decay occurs within PBs, since none of the four tested mRNAs were enriched in wild-type and Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> PBs in contrast to PBs in <italic>xrn1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Thus, selective delivery of mRNAs to PBs could enhance their degradation because of the high local concentration of the mRNA decay machinery in PBs. Alternatively, the sequestration of mRNA decay factors and selected mRNAs into PBs could also allow for spatial separation of translation factors from mRNA, preventing translation of messages that would be unproductive during periods of stress.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Increasing relevance of liquid droplets in cell biology, and the role of ATPases in granule formation</title><p>The formation of mRNPs – including PBs – into membrane-less organelles that behave like dynamic liquid droplets has recently emerged as a common mechanism by which cells may further compartmentalize their biochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo and Shorter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, a variety of different ATP-driven protein machines have also emerged as important regulators of mRNP granule assembly. For example, stress granule (SG) assembly and dynamics are disrupted by loss-of-function alleles in the MCM and RVB helicase complexes, while hypomorphic alleles in the chaperonin-containing T (CCT) complex form more SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jain et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, the AAA+ ATPase Cdc48 was also previously shown to facilitate clearance of SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchan et al., 2013</xref>). Our data demonstrate that the DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1 is a critical regulator of PB disassembly <italic>in vivo</italic> and that liquid droplets containing Dhh1 multimers form in the presence of RNA and ATP, which can be dissolved upon induction of ATP hydrolysis <italic>in vitro</italic>. Two biochemical functions are critical for the role of Dhh1 in PB formation both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>: (1) Dhh1’s affinity for RNA, which may facilitate delivery of mRNA substrates into PBs, and (2) ATP binding, and the tuning of Dhh1’s ATPase activity by factors such as Not1.

Still, there are several elements of the PB and Dhh1 ATPase cycle that remain unclear. For example, what leads to PB formation under specific cellular stress conditions? Is this driven by a stress-induced attenuation of translation or increase in mRNA turnover, which leads to an increased number of client mRNAs targeted to PBs? Alternatively, cellular stress may dampen the ATPase activity of Dhh1, for example by regulating the interaction between Dhh1 and Not1, thereby shifting the equilibrium towards the ATP-bound, RNA-bound Dhh1 state.

<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.diatrack.org">www.diatrack.org</ext-link>). A Matlab script transformed our foci images into a single long sequence that could be fed to Diatrack. This allowed the same image analysis parameters to be applied across all images and experiments. PBs display significant variations in appearance (size and brightness). They were identified in Diatrack based on their intensity and contrast measure. Optimal parameters were selected interactively such that false negative and false positive rates were below 3%. Occasionally, yeast vacuoles pinch the cytoplasm against the cell wall. This tends to create narrow intensity ridges in some of our fluorescence images and can trigger the default Diatrack particle detector. Thus, we used an alternative contrast measure (‘blurred 360’). This only retained particles around which the intensity decreases significantly in all directions (rather than decreasing on average only). A sample movie showing detected PB for a variety of images is provided as supplementary information (movieDetection.avi). For each image, a list of intensities corresponding to each PB in each image was exported from the software and further processed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). The sum of particle intensities represents a suitable measure of overall PB abundance. Alternately, the number of PBs per image may also be used. This value was divided by the number of cells in each image to deliver per-cell PB abundances. Automated counting of cells was performed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hadjidemetriou et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Protein purification</title><p>Dhh1 (wild-type, Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>, Dhh1<sup>F66R</sup>) and Dbp5 were cloned into a pETMCN-based expression vector with a N-terminal 6xHis and V5 tag plus a C-terminal mCherry tag.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Alan G Hinnebusch (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor, Alan Hinnebusch, has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary of work:</p><p>This paper shows that the ATPase activity of Dhh1, and its regulator Not1, modulate P body formation in yeast, as a Dhh1 mutation impairing ATP hydrolysis by Dhh1 evokes constitutive P body formation in a manner dependent on mRNA binding by the mutant Dhh1. This leads to the proposal that trapping the mutant Dhh1-ATP on mRNA is the condition that evokes P body accumulation. In the course of this work, it is shown that Not1 binds to Dhh1 and activates its ATPase activity, extending previous findings on the mammalian orthologs CNOT and Ddx6, and then shown that deleting Not1 partially mimics the Dhh1 ATPase mutant in stimulating P body formation, consistent with their model. Evidence is also provided that aggregation of Dhh1-ATP/RNA complexes can be observed <italic>in vitro</italic> by the formation of liquid droplets that require ATP and RNA and can be dissolved by Not1. These results are potentially interesting in providing a first step in the reconstitution of P body formation <italic>in vitro</italic> by Dhh1-ATP-mRNA complexes.</p><p>Essential revisions required:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Additional controls are required for the liquid droplet assay, including showing that the ATPase Dhh1 mutant would be active, while the ATP-binding Dhh1 mutant would be inactive in this assay, and that adding the Not1 fragment would have no effect on droplet formation if the ATPase Dhh1 mutant was employed, or with non-hydrolyzable ATP and WT Dhh1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>1) A demonstration that P-body formation is impaired by the deletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> is required. Alternatively, authors should explain why <italic>DHH1</italic> deletion does not impact P-body formation in their model.</p><p>2) If useful, the authors could extend their analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> of the Q-motif or RNA-binding mutants of Dhh1 to show that Dcp1-GFP and Edc3-GFP foci, as well as Dhh1-GFP foci, are reduced in these mutants on glucose starvation.</p><p>3) Quantification of data for all 3 time points and adding a 10 min time point for the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> is required.</p><p>4) For the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, an untagged Dhh1 strain needs to be examined in parallel to determine the background level of non-specific Not1 coimmunoprecipitation.</p><p>5) For the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, determine whether the ATP-regenerating system is required for liquid droplet formation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>1) Provide additional data to substantiate the claim that the dhh1-<sup>DQAD</sup> mutation increases mRNA abundance, or mRNA co-localization with P-bodies only marginally compared what occurs in an xrn1 mutant; or dampen the interpretations of the existing experiments and provide additional arguments that mRNA accumulation is unlikely to play a major role in the elevated P body assembly of the dhh1-<sup>DQAD</sup> mutant.</p><p>2) Better substantiate the effects of the Dhh1 and Not1 mutations that impair complex formation between the two proteins in the induction of P bodies in non-starvation conditions as follows: Provide more convincing data showing accumulation of Dhh1-GFP foci in +glucose conditions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> for the dhh1-5X-Not and not1-5x-Dhh1 mutants.

They also provide evidence that aggregation of Dhh1-ATP/RNA complexes can be observed <italic>in vitro</italic> by the formation of liquid droplets that require ATP and RNA and can be dissolved by Not1. Additional controls are likely required for this assay, but the results are potentially interesting as a first step in the reconstitution of P body formation by Dhh1-ATP-mRNA complexes.</p><p>They begin first by extending their previous findings and show that the cytoplasmic granules formed in yeast cells on expressing the ATPase deficient Dhh1 are <italic>bona fide</italic> processing (P) bodies, whose formation requires RNA binding by the ATPase mutant Dhh1; whereas P body formation is not induced by a Dhh1 mutant that fails to bind ATP, and P bodies do not form in this mutant nor with the RNA-binding defective version of Dhh1 under glucose starvation conditions. Thus, it appears that constitutive mRNA binding by Dhh1-ATP appears to evoke P bodies. They showed previously by FRAP that the ATPase mutant doesn't shuttle in and out of P-bodies and they show that the P bodies formed by this mutant also disassemble more slowly on cycloheximide treatment, although the interpretation of this result isn't stated. (Does it result from prolonged retention in P bodies of mRNAs bound to Dhh1-ATP?). Biochemical experiments show that, analogous to previous findings that mammalian CNOT stimulates the ATPase activity of mammalian Dhh1 (Ddx6), yeast Not1 stimulates the ATPase activity of yeast Dhh1 <italic>in vitro</italic> using recombinant proteins for the experiments. They identified a Dhh1 mutant that binds Not1 poorly compared to WT Dhh1, and showed that it mimics the ATPase mutant of Dhh1 in provoking P body formation that requires the RNA-binding activity of the mutant Dhh1, as expected if Not1 is required for ATP hydrolysis by Dhh1 and Dhh1-ATP is the trigger for P body formation. They attempted to prove that the Dhh1 mutant that impairs Not1 association evokes PBs only because of its reduced Not1 interaction by examining a Not1 variant lacking residues thought to be required for Dhh1 binding. It too induces PBs but to a much smaller extent than do the Dhh1 mutants; so they can't completely eliminate the possibility that the Dhh1 variant induces P bodies strictly owing to defective binding to Not1 and attendant reduction in ATPase activity. Note however that they would have to verify that these Not1 mutations actually do impair its binding to Dhh1. Finally, they show that <italic>in vitro</italic> Dhh1 can form liquid droplets that form in a concentration dependent fashion in a manner absolutely dependent on RNA (poly(U)) and ATP, and reversed by addition of the presumed Dhh1 interacting-domain of Not1. They propose that this represents an <italic>in vitro</italic> analogue of PB assembly, wherein Dhh1-ATP would multimerize on mRNA to nucleate P body formation. Additional controls seem to be required, such as showing that the ATPase Dhh1 mutant would be active, while the ATP-binding Dhh1 mutant would be inactive in this assay, and that Not1 would have no effect on droplet formation if the ATPase Dhh1 mutant was employed, or with non-hydrolyzable ATP and WT Dhh1.</p><p>1) It is important to verify that the Not1 mutations presumed to impair its binding to Dhh1 actually do so.</p><p>2) Additional controls are required for the liquid droplet assay, including a demonstration that the ATPase Dhh1 mutant is active, while the ATP-binding Dhh1 mutant is inactive in this assay, and that Not1 has no effect on droplet formation if the ATPase Dhh1 mutant is employed, or when using non-hydrolyzable ATP and WT Dhh1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the group of Karsten Weis proposes that the <italic>DHH1</italic> protein is, through its ATPase activity, a major regulator of P-body formation. The manuscript addresses an interesting question. Several points are, however, questionable:</p><p>1) Most importantly, the authors fail to mention that previous work as demonstrated normal (or nearly normal) P-body formation in a yeast strain lacking <italic>DHH1</italic> (Teixeira and Parker, 2007). It is difficult to reconcile this observation with the model presented in the current manuscript. The authors should minimally quote the literature, test whether the original observation is reproducible and, if so, whether the kinetics of P-body formation and/or disappearance are altered in the absence of <italic>DHH1</italic>. This issue should also be discussed.</p><p>2) The assay for the kinetic of disappearance of P-body in strains expression with-type or ATPase-deficient <italic>DHH1</italic> is not particularly convincing: Is a 4 dots versus 0 dot distribution significantly different from 2 dots versus 2 dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, 20 min)? Is the situation identical in both cases at time 0? Can one conclude at a significant kinetic difference with two time points? This assay would be improved with additional time points and a more quantitative analysis of the data.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, there is no control for the specificity and background signal in immunoprecipitation. This is not satisfactory given the state of the art for such experiments. This is unlikely to meet the standard for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>4) The analysis of the formation of liquid droplets is incomplete with respect to the other parts of the manuscript. Indeed, the authors argue that they recapitulate P-body dynamics <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Our conclusion from the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is that mRNAs can be degraded in ‘normal’ PBs as well as in Dhh1<sub>DQAD</sub>–induced PBs, and that PB formation in Dhh1<sub>DQAD</sub> cells is not solely due to a block in mRNA decay within the PB. We have altered our text to more accurately reflect this point.

This observation is also supported by the slower recycling of Dhh1<sub>DQAD</sub> from PBs in FRAP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and the slower dissolution of Dhh1<sub>DQAD</sub> PBs upon cycloheximide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Currently, there are no Dhh1 mutants that would allow the uncoupling of the effects of Dhh1 on mRNA turnover and PB formation (and it is likely that such mutants may not exist) and we have therefore altered the text to more carefully discuss the role of Dhh1 in decay and PB formation.</p><p><italic>2) Better substantiate the effects of the Dhh1 and Not1 mutations that impair complex formation between the two proteins in the induction of P bodies in non-starvation conditions as follows: Provide more convincing data showing accumulation of Dhh1-GFP foci in +glucose conditions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> for the dhh1-5X-Not and not1-5x-Dhh1 mutants.

This allows them to propose that trapping the mutant Dhh1-ATP on mRNA is the condition that evokes P body accumulation. In the course of this work, they show that Not1 binds to Dhh1 and activates its ATPase activity, extending previous findings on the mammalian orthologs CNOT and Ddx6, and then show that deleting Not1 partially mimics the Dhh1 ATPase mutant in stimulating P body formation, consistent with their model. They also provide evidence that aggregation of Dhh1-ATP/RNA complexes can be observed in vitro by the formation of liquid droplets that require ATP and RNA and can be dissolved by Not1. Additional controls are likely required for this assay, but the results are potentially interesting as a first step in the reconstitution of P body formation by Dhh1-ATP-mRNA complexes.</italic> </p><p>We thank this reviewer for this positive assessment and as discussed above we have added the requested controls.</p><p><italic>They begin first by extending their previous findings and show that the cytoplasmic granules formed in yeast cells on expressing the ATPase deficient Dhh1 are bona fide processing (P) bodies, whose formation requires RNA binding by the ATPase mutant Dhh1; whereas P body formation is not induced by a Dhh1 mutant that fails to bind ATP, and P bodies do not form in this mutant nor with the RNA-binding defective version of Dhh1 under glucose starvation conditions. Thus, it appears that constitutive mRNA binding by Dhh1-ATP appears to evoke P bodies. They showed previously by FRAP that the ATPase mutant doesn't shuttle in and out of P-bodies and they show that the P bodies formed by this mutant also disassemble more slowly on cycloheximide treatment, although the interpretation of this result isn't stated. (Does it result from prolonged retention in P bodies of mRNAs bound to Dhh1-ATP?). Biochemical experiments show that, analogous to previous findings that mammalian CNOT stimulates the ATPase activity of mammalian Dhh1 (Ddx6), yeast Not1 stimulates the ATPase activity of yeast Dhh1 in vitro using recombinant proteins for the experiments. They identified a Dhh1 mutant that binds Not1 poorly compared to WT Dhh1, and showed that it mimics the ATPase mutant of Dhh1 in provoking P body formation that requires the RNA-binding activity of the mutant Dhh1, as expected if Not1 is required for ATP hydrolysis by Dhh1 and Dhh1-ATP is the trigger for P body formation. They attempted to prove that the Dhh1 mutant that impairs Not1 association evokes PBs only because of its reduced Not1 interaction by examining a Not1 variant lacking residues thought to be required for Dhh1 binding. It too induces PBs but to a much smaller extent than do the Dhh1 mutants; so they can't completely eliminate the possibility that the Dhh1 variant induces P bodies strictly owing to defective binding to Not1 and attendant reduction in ATPase activity. Note however that they would have to verify that these Not1 mutations actually do impair its binding to Dhh1. Finally, they show that in vitro Dhh1 can form liquid droplets that form in a concentration dependent fashion in a manner absolutely dependent on RNA (poly(U)) and ATP, and reversed by addition of the presumed Dhh1 interacting-domain of Not1. They propose that this represents an in vitro analogue of PB assembly, wherein Dhh1-ATP would multimerize on mRNA to nucleate P body formation. Additional controls seem to be required, such as showing that the ATPase Dhh1 mutant would be active, while the ATP-binding Dhh1 mutant would be inactive in this assay, and that Not1 would have no effect on droplet formation if the ATPase Dhh1 mutant was employed, or with non-hydrolyzable ATP and WT Dhh1.</italic> </p><p>As discussed above, the requested experiments are now included in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p><italic>1) It is important to verify that the Not1 mutations presumed to impair its binding to Dhh1 actually do so.</italic> </p><p>We performed immunoprecipitation experiments of TAP-tagged Not1 and Not1<sub>9X- Dhh1</sub> in order to assess whether mutation of conserved residues in Not1 showed defects in Dhh1 binding.
