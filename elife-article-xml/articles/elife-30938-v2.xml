However, how persistent antigenic stimulation affects T cell metabolism is unknown. Here, we report that long-term in vivo antigenic exposure induced a specific deficit in numerous metabolic enzymes. Accordingly, T cells exhibited low basal glycolytic flux and limited respiratory capacity. Strikingly, blockade of inhibitory receptor PD-1 stimulated the production of IFNγ in chronic T cells, but failed to shift their metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis, as observed in effector T cells. Instead, chronic T cells appeared to rely on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to produce ATP for IFNγ synthesis. Check-point blockade, however, increased mitochondrial production of superoxide and reduced viability and effector function. Thus, in the absence of a glycolytic switch, PD-1-mediated inhibition appears essential for limiting oxidative metabolism linked to effector function in chronic T cells, thereby promoting survival and functional fitness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>T lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>PD-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Televie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bettonville</surname><given-names>Marie</given-names></name><name><surname>d'Aria</surname><given-names>Stefania</given-names></name><name><surname>Weatherly</surname><given-names>Kathleen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Interuniversity Attraction Poles</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sonveaux</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name><name><surname>Braun</surname><given-names>Michel Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sonveaux</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ARC from Communaute Francaise de Belgique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sonveaux</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sonveaux</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name><name><surname>Braun</surname><given-names>Michel Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Belge contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braun</surname><given-names>Michel Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Long-term exposure to recipient's alloantigens promotes major metabolic defects in T cells that are independent of PD-1-mediated regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Quiescent T cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plas et al., 2002</xref>). However, once activated by foreign antigens, they shift from an energetically efficient oxidative metabolism to a highly glycolytic and glutamine-dependent metabolic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakaya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gubser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van der Windt et al., 2013</xref>). This metabolic switch endows T cells with the capacity to direct rapidly metabolic intermediates toward the synthesis of macromolecules required for proliferation and effector function. Interestingly, when aerobic glycolysis is impaired, T cells can also rely on OXPHOS alone to become activated and proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sena et al., 2013</xref>). In this case, T cell effector function is compromised, with impaired cytokine production caused by posttranscriptional regulation of glycolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, in addition to providing precursors for biomass production in activated T cells, aerobic glycolysis allows for the acquisition of full effector functions. The capacity of T cells to limit glycolysis has been linked to the expression of the cell surface inhibitory receptor PD-1 (2), which is increased following T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agata et al., 1996</xref>). The function of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 is to attenuate signaling downstream of the TcR, leading to suppression of T-cell proliferation, cytokine production and cytolytic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yokosuka et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, PD-1 signaling was shown to regulate T cell function by inhibiting glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patsoukis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bengsch et al., 2016</xref>), and to promote T cell survival through lipolysis and OXPHOS fueled by fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patsoukis et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) causes patients to have severe defects in the function of their lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>). Most cases of SCID are due to mutations in the gene encoding common gamma chain (γc), a protein shared by several receptors for interleukins IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malek et al., 1999</xref>). Because these cytokines are needed for T cell development, mutations resulting in expression defects cause complete absence of adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>). Currently, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is the only available treatment for SCID. However, recipient-specific donor T cells present in the graft can cause significant inflammatory events in allogeneic HSC-transplanted SCID patients, including persistent chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neven et al., 2009</xref>). In experimental animals transplanted with HSC after myeloablative treatment, PD-1 was shown to contribute to the suppression of T cell-mediated GVHD, and PD-1 blockade was associated with an increased glycolytic metabolism in GVHD T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujiwara et al., 2014</xref>). Whether PD-1-mediated regulation of T cell metabolism can control inflammation in transplanted SCID patients is unknown. In this context, our study aimed to investigate the metabolic requirements needed for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine gamma interferon (IFNγ) in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells under persistent exposure to recipient's alloantigens. We show here that, unlike alloreactive early effector T cells in which the production of IFNγ requires a metabolic switch towards glycolysis, long-term chronically stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (chronic T cells) can mount a rapid effector response despite their apparent failure to undergo a glycolytic switch. Instead, chronic T cells appeared to rely mostly on OXPHOS to support their function. More strikingly, although chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells do express PD-1 and PD-1 activation repressed their function, we report here that the inability of these cells to increase their glycolytic rate after activation is independent of PD-1 signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Persistent exposure to alloantigens modifies the metabolic requirements for effector function in alloreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</title><p>To address the molecular mechanisms regulating the metabolism of alloreactive T cells in SCID recipients, BALB/c (H-2<sup>d</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were transferred into allogeneic <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> Il2rγ<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B6 (H-2<sup>b</sup>). Though the relative number of donor T cells present in the recipient's spleen increased with time, their absolute numbers were similar at 6 to 21 days post-transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After transfer, most T cells were activated, as indicated by their expression pattern of CD44 and CD62L, and expressed PD-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In vitro stimulation with irradiated allogeneic cells stimulated the production of IFNγ in both T cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction significantly increased the amount of cytokine produced, confirming that T cell-mediated GVHD is regulated by PD-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We noticed, however, that T cells produced higher amounts of IFNγ at day seven than after day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Considering that glycolysis has been largely accounted for the effector function of activated T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gubser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van der Windt et al., 2013</xref>), whether a lower metabolism could limit IFNγ production in day 21 T cells was investigated. Inhibiting glycolysis with glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) is known to inhibit T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Woodward and Hudson, 1954</xref>). Day 6 T cells were highly sensitive to glycolysis inhibition, whereas day 21 T cells were not inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, these observations led to the hypothesis that chronic antigenic stimulation could have modified the metabolic requirements for effector function and that reduced IFNγ production would be a direct consequence of limited metabolism in chronic alloreactive T cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30938.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Prolonged chronic alloantigen stimulation alters functional metabolic requirements in alloreactive CD4 +T cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Frequencies and numbers of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen of non-irradiated B6 (H-2b) <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> Il2rg<sup>-/-</sup></italic> recipients 6 and 21 days after reconstitution with purified BALB/c (H-2d) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

After transfer, most T cells were activated, as indicated by their expression pattern of CD44 and CD62L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Long-term antigen exposure (21 days) up-regulated PD-1 expression on male-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Spleen cells isolated from adoptively transferred recipients, which contained male-specific T cells and male APCs, produced IFNγ after PD-1/PD-L1 blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Cytokine production was the result of T cell activity since IFNγ was not detected after blocking T cell antigen recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The capacity of PD-1 to inhibit T cell activity was further documented by the observation that engagement of PD-1 by immobilized PD-L1-Ig prevented IFNγ production in anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated purified chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in an antigen-specific assay decreased by one log the amount of male peptides required for T cell activation and IFNγ production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrated that PD-1 is responsible for limiting the functional responsiveness of chronic anti-male CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and that this regulation is carried out by raising their TcR activation threshold. Moreover, injecting anti-PD-L1 antibodies to male recipients increased sharply the number of T cells infiltrating several organs, such as liver, gut, skin and kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and data not shown), demonstrating that PD-1 also controlled in vivo the activity of chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

Two major enzymes involved in the non-oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway, transaldolase (TALDO1) and transketolase (TKT), were also found down-regulated after chronic antigen exposure. The citric acid cycle and the lipid oxidation pathway were also affected, since aconitate hydratase (ACO2), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 2 (GOT2), malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH) and long-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD1) expression decreased significantly in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. These findings suggested that chronic antigenic stimulation resulted in a general metabolic deficit in male-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. To further explore this possibility, chronic anti-male CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were purified and compared for their metabolic activity with naive T cells or effector T cells, obtained by immunization with irradiated T cell-deficient <italic>Cd3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> male spleen cells. Basal glycolytic flux, assessed by measuring ECAR, was high in control effector T cells, but similarly low in naive and chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In the same line, basal respiration was significantly higher in effector T cells compared to naive and chronic T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A significant spare respiratory capacity (SRC) was nevertheless detected in chronic T cells after mitochondrial uncoupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, compared with naive or effector T cells, it was modest and was correlated with a lower mitochondrial mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and a reduced capacity to synthesize ATP after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrated that chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have a low energy metabolism and a reduced capacity to produce cellular energy.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30938.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Long-term chronic anti-male CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells exhibit a low metabolism and are unable to shift their metabolism to produce IFNγ after activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Basal ECAR (left) and basal and maximal OCR (right) of naive, effector or chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

Chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were sorted and compared with purified naive T cells or effector T cells. As expected, following activation, naive T cells secreted large amount of IL-2 but, in the absence of the polarizing cytokine IL-12, they failed to produce IFNγ. After activation, effector T cells produced large quantities of both IL-2 and IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In vitro activation stimulated glycolysis in naive and effector T cells, as evidenced by the time-dependent production of lactate in the culture medium, which inversely correlated with glucose consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). On the contrary, very low levels of lactate and no evidence of glucose consumption were detected for chronic T cells after activation, suggesting that glycolysis was turned down in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Remarkably, lack of glucose consumption did not prevent chronic T cells to produce IFNγ following activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, chronic exposure of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to recipient's antigen untied IFNγ production from the need to undergo a glycolytic switch. Accordingly, unlike in effector T cells where glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG strongly repressed IFNγ production, 2-DG only weakly inhibited IFNγ production by chronic T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Taken together, these results revealed that glycolysis is deficient in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and does not support effector function. For glucose uptake, lymphocytes primarily rely on glucose transporter GLUT1, and T cell activation stimulates GLUT1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rathmell et al., 2000</xref>). GLUT1 up-regulation that followed anti-CD3/CD28 activation in effector T cells was not observed in chronic T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Accordingly, the uptake of fluorescent glucose analog 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)−2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshioka et al., 1996</xref>) was lower in chronic T cells after anti-CD3/CD28-mediated stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

To investigate this possibility, we analyzed chronic T cells during the first week of persisting male antigen stimulation, before severe dysfunction develops. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, day seven chronic T cells exhibited a substantial glycolytic capacity whereas, as expected, day 21 chronic T cells did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Contrary to what was observed in day 21 T cells, the capacity to produce IFNγ in vitro after anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation was very sensitive to glucose metabolism inhibition by 2-DG in day 7 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Moreover, day 7 T cells also expressed lower levels of PD-1, LAG3 and 2B4 than day 21 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). These observations led to the conclusion that H-Y-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells submitted to chronic antigen exposure became increasingly dysfunctional with time, expressing higher levels of inhibitory receptors and failing to engage glycolysis to support effector function.</p><p>In cancer cells, glutamine can compensate for glucose depletion in terms of energy generation and synthesis of precursors for anabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dang, 2010</xref>). In T cells, activation is coupled with rapid glutamine uptake, and failure to transport glutamine throughout the plasma membrane impairs the induction of Th1 and Th17 cells and attenuates inflammatory T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakaya et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, in glycolysis-deficient chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, glutaminolysis could represent an alternative pathway on which to base the metabolic requirements for IFNγ synthesis. 6-diazo-5-oxo-<italic>L</italic>-norleucine (DON), which antagonizes glutamine and is used as a specific inhibitor of glutamine-utilizing enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahluwalia et al., 1990</xref>), was a very efficient inhibitor of IFNγ synthesis in effector T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), confirming the essential role played by glutaminolysis in T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakaya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). DON was, however, much less efficient at limiting IFNγ production by chronic T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells rely much less on glutamine catabolism than effector T cells to carry out their function.</p><p>ATP is required for protein synthesis. Therefore, the possible involvement of oxidative metabolism, the main source of cellular ATP, in restoring the function of chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was investigated. T cells were stimulated in the presence of oligomycin, a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jastroch et al., 2010</xref>). As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, oligomycin equally inhibited IFNγ production in effector or chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, indicating that IFNγ synthesis in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was supported by OXPHOS. This was further investigated by replacing glucose by galactose in the culture medium. Galactose is known to force cells to rely exclusively on OXPHOS for ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le Goffe et al., 1999</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, oligomycin fully abolished IFNγ secretion by effector or chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in glucose-free, galactose-containing medium, demonstrating that both cell types can use OXPHOS alone to support IFNγ synthesis. It is known that, when unable to operate OXPHOS, T cells use glycolysis to produce ATP for effector function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). This was indeed observed for effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that produced lactate and consumed glucose after stimulation in glucose-rich medium in the presence of oligomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Conversely, lactate production and glucose consumption were not detected after stimulation of chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the presence of oligomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Taken together, these last results further supported the conclusion that chronic T cells are unable to engage glycolysis for the production of IFNγ.</p><p>A recent report indicated that alloreactive T cells responsible for GVHD in irradiated recipients require fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to support their activation and effector function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byersdorfer et al., 2013</xref>). We thus investigated whether chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells also relied on FAO for IFNγ production. Etomoxir, an irreversible O-carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2003</xref>), had a significant inhibitory effect on IFNγ production by chronic T cells that was not observed in effector T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, effector function stimulated by anti-CD3-mediated activation would at least partly depend on FAO in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Cells that use FAO for energy supply must have the capacity to transport fatty acids to the mitochondria. The long-chain fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4) exhibits acyl-CoA synthetase activity and has been proposed, in addition to its function as a transporter, to facilitate uptake of external fatty acids indirectly by mediating their esterification to CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall et al., 2005</xref>). FATP4 was identified in a previous RNA microarray analysis among the strongest genes expressed in anti-male chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (three fold; p&lt;0,0004) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, FATP4 strong expression was confirmed in chronic T cells when compared to expression in effector T cells, suggesting that import of free fatty acids from their external environment was an important process for chronic T cells. This hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that chronic T cells had the capacity to acquire substantially more fatty acids, such as palmitate, than effector T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We also analyzed the expression of CPT1A, responsible for transferring long chain fatty acid acyl-CoA from cytosol into the intermembrane space of mitochondria (an essential step in FAO). Though expressed by both T cell types, CPT1A was significantly higher in effector T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together these observations supported the conclusion that FAO was an important metabolic pathway used by chronic T cells for producing IFNγ. This was also supported by the previous observation that the gene coding for acyl-CoA synthetase, bubblegum family, member 1 (ACSBG1), a protein known for its acyl-CoA synthetase activity in the oxidation of long-chain fatty acid, was one of the highest differentially expressed genes in chronic T cells (11.6 fold; p&lt;0.0001) compared to naive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). FAO is known to impair the glycolytic pathway mostly through inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and/or glucose uptake and 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hue and Taegtmeyer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowker-Kinley et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, we evaluated the effect of FAO inhibition by Etomoxir on glucose metabolism in chronic T cells. As expected, adding Etomoxir in cultures of anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated chronic T cells increased substantially their consumption of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Importantly, however, increased glucose uptake did not restore their capacity to produce IFNγ nor was this accompanied by lactate production, demonstrating once more that cytokine synthesis in chronic T cells was carried out independently from glucose metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Genetic absence of PD-1 does not promote a functional metabolic switch towards glycolysis in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</title><p>Since PD-1 function has been recently linked to metabolism regulation in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patsoukis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gubin et al., 2014</xref>), whether PD-1 engagement was required for modulating the functional metabolic profile of chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was investigated. IFNγ was detected in the supernatant of cultures containing whole spleen cells isolated from male recipients that received anti-male <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). IFNγ production was abrogated by adding antibodies blocking the interaction between anti-male TcR and MHC class II/male peptide complexes present at the surface of male splenic APCs, demonstrating that IFNγ was indeed produced following male antigen recognition by T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Thus, as expected, the genetic absence of PD-1 prevented functional regulation in anti-male-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in lymphopenic recipients and promoted IFNγ secretion. Both chronic <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells had lower basal ECAR, consistent with a missing capacity to mobilize glycolysis for IFNγ production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

However, <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells displayed high CPT1A expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Taken together, these results support the notion that, though displaying the same capacity to import fatty acid from their direct environment, <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells would differ in the way they import fatty acids in the intermembrane mitochondrial space where FAO takes place. Thus, fatty acid entry into mitochondria could represent the limiting factor for IFNγ production in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PD-1 protects against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cell death and impaired functional fitness in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</title><p>Our proteomic comparison before and after chronic exposure to antigen revealed a significant deficit in the expression of proteins important for oxidant detoxification in chronic T cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanschmann et al., 2013</xref>). These results suggested that chronic antigen stimulation might render T cells more sensitive to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is mediated, in part, by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by multiple cellular processes and controlled by cellular antioxidant mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanschmann et al., 2013</xref>). Mitochondrial production of ROS was detected ex vivo in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Though ROS production by <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> T cells was modest, it was very significant in chronic <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As expected, higher ROS production in chronic <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells was correlated with higher mitochondrial depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, ROS production appeared to be controlled by PD-1 in chronic T cells. It is well established that, upon antigenic stimulation, T cells produce mitochondrial ROS that regulate secondary signaling molecules to bring about optimal TcR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devadas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaminski et al., 2010</xref>). However, excessive mitochondrial ROS production can also lead to T cell death, and antioxidant chemicals can improve the survival of activated T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dumont et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cossarizza et al., 1997</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,N</xref>-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) significantly increased the viability of stimulated chronic T cells. Consistent with their higher levels of mitochondrial ROS, chronic <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells were less sensitive to NAC-mediated inhibition of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, chronic antigen stimulation in the absence of PD-1-mediated inhibition promoted enhanced production and accumulation of ROS in mitochondria and rendered T cells more prone to cell death. It should be noted that this last conclusion is in agreement with several observations that deletion/blockade of PD-1 is associated with decreased survival of virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during chronic viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Odorizzi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Staron et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, we also observed that, after transfer into lymphopenic male recipients, splenic male-specific <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, though exhibiting an early expansion identical to that of <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, were less present at a later time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Remarkably, ROS inhibition by NAC also improved the capacity of chronic T cells to produce IFNγ upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). Adding NAC to PMA/ionomycin-stimulated T cells increased indeed the frequency of IFNγ-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), as well as the amount of IFNγ produced per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Thus, taken collectively, these data support the conclusion that one of the main roles played by PD-1 in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is to limit the production of mitochondrial ROS, thereby promoting cell viability and functional fitness.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30938.008</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>By limiting T cell metabolism, PD-1 prevents activation-dependent mitochondrial ROS production and cell death.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometry analysis of chronic <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells for intra-mitochondrial ROS production.

One mechanistic explanation would be that elevated ROS could inactivate mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2010</xref>), leading to reduced protein translation. In order to investigate this possibility, we tested mTORC1 signaling by Western blots in ex vivo isolated chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, phosphorylation of mTORC1 targets, translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and ribosomal protein S6, was more important in high ROS producer T cells, namely <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Moreover, anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation induced similar levels of phosphorylation of both 4EBP1 and S6 in <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and mTOR inhibition by PP242 reduced to the same extent 4EBP1 and S6 phosphorylation in both T cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These results demonstrate that mTORC1 signaling worked equally well in <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and are not consistent with the hypothesis that IFNγ production in chronic T cells is limited by ROS inhibitory activity on mTOR signaling and protein synthesis. Another possibility is that IFNγ production would be regulated by ROS at RNA level. Surprisingly, after stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies, IFNγ mRNA was consistently more abundant in high ROS producer <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This was not expected since, most of the time after stimulation, IFNγ production was reduced among <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A and B</xref>). RNA damage has been reported to increase under oxidative stress and ROS are a major source of damage to cellular components including RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiala et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hofer et al., 2005</xref>). Since ROS production was more important in <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we postulated that RNA oxidation by ROS should be more intense in these cells than in <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. High levels of RNA oxidation are normally not tolerated by cells, and oxidized RNA is actively removed from total RNA by specific mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we measured IFNγ mRNA half/life in chronic T cells by blocking cellular transcription with actinomycin D. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, RNA decay was more pronounced in <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This observation is consistent with the idea that increased RNA oxidation limited IFNγ production in these cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we identified the metabolic profile that characterizes CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells submitted to persisting antigen signaling. Overall, chronic T cells exhibited a general deficit in metabolism characterized by a reduced OXPHOS and the incapacity to engage glycolysis. The observation that effector function does not rely on glycolysis in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is in sharp contrast with the highly glycolytic metabolic profile generally observed in effector T cells which fail to produce IFNγ in the absence of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gubser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cham and Gajewski, 2005</xref>). Moreover, recent reports clearly demonstrated glycolysis as the predominant metabolic pathway used by donor T cells to promote GVHD in allogeneic HSC transplanted recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>). These diverging results might be explained by the different time laps during which T cells were submitted to chronic stimulation. Indeed, the present study and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bengsch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>) identified the function of T cells responsible in early chronic stimulation (day 6–10 after adoptive transfer) as highly sensitive to glycolysis inhibition. On the contrary, late chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (day 21 after adoptive transfer), that were characterized in our study, failed to up-regulate glycolysis and relied mostly on OXPHOS to support their function after activation. Interestingly, several recent studies have reported a similar metabolic defect in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from patients affected by chronic autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wahl et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, failing to engage glycolysis for effector function could represent a general feature of long-term chronically-stimulated CD4 T cells.</p><p>Our results contrast with those obtained by others in the exhaustion of LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells where PD-1 altered both glycolytic and mitochondrial bioenergetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bengsch et al., 2016</xref>). In that model, reviving T cell function by neutralization of PD-L1 resulted in reduced mitochondrial mass, increased glucose uptake and glycolysis in virus-specific T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bengsch et al., 2016</xref>). This is sharp contrast with our results where blocking PD-1 restored function but not glycolysis and was supported by increased OXPHOS activity. One of the major differences between T cells in our system and in the chronic LCMV infection model is that, in LCMV-specific exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, PD-1 restores both function and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2006</xref>). We have previously shown that PD-1 blockade in our model does not restore proliferation but revives partly function (IFNγ production, not IL-2). Thus, male-specific chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in our study appear to have reach a deeper state of unresponsiveness, as indicated by higher expression of PD-1 and other inhibitory receptors, where glycolysis would not be anymore available to sustain T cell function after PD-1 blockade. This conclusion is also supported by our observation that PD-1-mediated control on glycolytic metabolism is also present in the early stage of exhaustion in male-specific chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Finally, as discussed below, chronic antigen stimulation in our adoptive transfer experiments is presumably achieved without inflammatory signals, contrary to what is seen in chronic viral infection. Thus, chronic antigen recognition in the absence of costimulatory signals might induce a different metabolic program involving the complete suppression of T cell glycolytic capacity. Interestingly, rendering T cells anergic through TcR stimulation alone not only prevents upregulation of glycolytic metabolism, but also prevents it from being upregulated in future stimulations, even those delivered with costimulation, suggesting that these cells are metabolically anergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, PD-1-mediated inhibition of TcR-signaling did not appear to be required for the induction and maintenance of the non-glycolytic profile displayed by late chronic male-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This was not expected since PD-1 engagement by its ligand PD-L1 has been shown to block in vitro effector cell differentiation in human T cells by inhibiting glycolysis and promoting FAO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patsoukis et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, recent data indicated that PD-1 was critical for the regulation of glycolytic metabolism in T cells responsible for acute GVHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saha et al., 2013</xref>). It should be pointed out that chronic T cells in our model express multiple inhibitory receptors at their surface, thereby providing potential compensatory regulatory mechanisms for metabolic control. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that engagement of the inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 at the surface of human T cells has also been shown to inhibit glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patsoukis et al., 2015</xref>). Because CTLA-4 is expressed at the surface of chronic T cells in our model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Noval Rivas et al., 2009</xref>), it could be responsible for maintaining low levels of glycolysis in the absence of PD-1. At this stage, it is interesting to note that Schietinger and coworkers have shown tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion to be solely driven by antigenic stimulation, mostly independently from the activity of inhibitory receptors like PD-1 (52). To explain their observation, the authors put forward the fact that, contrary to virus-specific T cells, unresponsiveness in tumor-specific T cells is initiated and maintained in the absence of inflammation. In that context, T cells see their antigen presented by non-activated APC that do not express the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 and cannot deliver signals, via CD28 engagement, required for full T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schietinger et al., 2016</xref>). This type of unresponsiveness might develop independently of the activity of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 (52). Like tumor-specific T cells, male-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in our system encounter antigen in a non-inflammatory context. Our results would indicate that T cell dysfunction induced by chronic antigen encounter in a non-inflammatory environment would involve the establishment of a specific non-glycolytic metabolic program. Interestingly, it was very recently observed that sustained glycolytic function in T cells required CD28 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Menk et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It has been previously shown that PD-1 repressed the expression of PGC-1a, a key transcriptional regulator of genes controlling energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis, and enhancing PGC-1a expression reversed mitochondria-associated metabolic perturbations in early stage of T cell exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bengsch et al., 2016</xref>). In a previous analysis of gene expression by microarray, PGC-1a was not found differently expressed by chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells or naive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). However, PPARγ, with which PGC-1a interacts to coordinate the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schreiber et al., 2004</xref>), was down-regulated (five fold; p&lt;0;0001) in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to naive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). This is consistent with the exhausted phenotype and the decreased respiratory activity displayed by chronic T cells. However, our observation that <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> chronic T cells did not differ in their maximal respiratory capacity would not support the idea that, in late chronic T cells, PD-1 mediates its inhibitory effect on T cell function through the direct regulation of genes involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><p>The last important and somehow surprising result of our study is the observation that, in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, PD-1 maintains T cell functional fitness and viability by limiting the intensity of oxidative metabolism and ROS production. This is in sharp contrast with previous observations made by several groups where PD-1-mediated regulation of T cell function was shown to repress mitochondrial metabolism thereby promoting the production of ROS and potentially cell death in some but not all T cells activated by antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bengsch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tkachev et al., 2015</xref>). However, our data indicate that chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells mostly rely on OXPHOS for effector function after stimulation. In the absence of glycolysis, excessive OXPHOS activity could lead to overload the electron transport chain and, consequently, to increase mitochondrial ROS levels that may result in significant damage to cell structures and viability. This conclusion is supported by the observation that, in our study, PD-1 regulatory activity inhibits both mitochondrial activity and ROS production in chronic T cells. Thus, PD-1 would appear to fulfill two different functions in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells depending on the duration of chronic antigenic exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). On the one hand, during early chronic antigen stimulation, PD-1-mediated inhibition of TcR signaling creates bioenergetics deficiencies to control T cell function. By contrast, our data show that, over prolonged antigen stimulation, PD-1 limits T cell oxidative metabolism in order to maintain functional fitness and cell survival. Moreover, we also show that in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells IFNγ production is impaired by fast mRNA decay. ROS are a major source of damage to cellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2006</xref>). RNA damage has been reported to increase during oxidative stress. Under similar conditions, the levels of oxidative damage in RNA are usually higher than those in DNA, which may impair protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, accumulation of RNA damage must be prevented and cells have developed specific mechanisms to remove oxidized RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Our data support the notion that, in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, PD-1 increases T cell activation threshold to prevent excessive RNA oxidation and decay, consequently preserving the capacity of T cells to produce inflammatory cytokines such as IFNγ.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30938.010</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Different outcome from PD-1-mediated regulation of T cell metabolism in early or late chronic antigen stimulation.</title><p>In chronic T cells responsible for early GVHD, PD-1-mediated inhibition of T cell metabolism promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death.

Naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells stimulated by antigen undergo a specific differentiation program, mostly relying on glycolysis, that leads to clonal expansion and development of effector function. Sustained antigenic stimulation, however, causes alteration in this differentiation process and forces CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to enter a program associated with functional unresponsiveness. This program involves the expression of cell surface inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, whose engagement by their ligands present at the surface of MHC class II-expressing APCs inhibits glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolic pathways required for T cell proliferation and effector function. If chronic antigenic stimulation continues after inflammation has resorbed, or if antigen is presented without co-stimulatory signals delivered by APCs that express high levels of CD80 and CD86, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells will enter a cell-intrinsic program apparently driven solely by continuous antigen exposure, independently of PD-1 engagement. In this context, it is interesting to note that engagement of cell surface CD28, the receptor responsible for delivering CD80/CD86 co-stimulation to T cells, is required for CD8 T cell rescue involving anti-PD-1 therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamphorst et al., 2017</xref>). The dysfunctional state imposed by non-inflammatory continued antigen presentation would involve the complete loss of glycolysis as a metabolic pathway available for sustaining cell proliferation and cytokine synthesis and could not be rescued by checkpoint blockade. Thus, although early metabolic dysfunction is still a characteristic of a plastic differentiation state, it ultimately becomes fixed and non-reversible. Our study could have important implications for the control of T cell activity in chronic immune diseases. Our data support the possibility that promoting PD-1-mediated regulation of T cell metabolism might represent an effective therapeutic tool for controlling the early steps of chronic immune pathologies. Paradoxically, they also enlighten the potential therapeutic limitations that blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interactions might face in attempting to restore the function of T cells submitted to long-term chronic antigen stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Normal B6 (H-2<sup>b</sup>) and BALB/c (H-2<sup>d</sup>) mice were from Charles River.

For mixed lymphocyte cultures, BALB/c CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were purified from adoptively transferred recipients and stimulated (0.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> per well) with irradiated B6 spleen cells (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> per well). After 48 hr, culture supernatants were tested by ELISA for the production of IFNγ. For anti-CD3/CD28-mediated stimulation of purified T cells, 96-flat-bottomed-well plates were coated overnight at 4°C with different concentrations of anti-CD3 (145–2 C11; BD Biosciences) in PBS. Purified T cells were plated at a concentration of 0.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per well and stimulated in the presence of soluble anti-CD28 (37.51; BD Biosciences; 2 µg/ml). For whole spleen cell culture, cells (0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> per well) from the spleen of male recipients that received anti-male CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were incubated in the presence of anti-PD-L1 (10 μg/ml) or control antibodies for 48 hr in 96-round-bottomed well plates.

For staining, cells were resuspended in PBS with 1% heat-inactivated FCS and were incubated for 10 min with Mouse BD Fc Block<sup>™</sup> (BD Biosciences) followed by 30 min in the dark at 4°C with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD4 (clone RR4-5), anti-TCRBV6 (clone RR4-7), anti-CD62L (clone MEL14), anti-CD44 (clone IM7), anti-LAG3 (clone C9B7W) and anti-2B4 (clone 2B4) from BD Biosciences, and anti-PD-1 (clone J43) from eBioscience. For the detection of cell surface GLUT1 expression, cells were fixed with formaldehyde 1.5% (VWR), stained with the anti-GLUT1 antibody (1 µg per 10<sup>6</sup> cells) (Clone EPR3915, Abcam), followed by biotin-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig (dilution 1:50; BD Biosciences) and PerCP-conjugated streptavidin (dilution 1:200; BD Biosciences). To assess cell viability, cells were stained with the fixable viability dye eFluor 780 (DyeFL; 1 µl/10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml; eBioscience). Mitochondrial mass was measured by fluorescence levels upon staining with Mitotracker Green (Invitrogen) at 50 nM for 30 min in the dark at 37°C, according to manufacturer’s instructions. Mitochondrial ROS measurements were carried out by staining with MitoSOX Red (Invitrogen) at 5 μM for 10 min at 37°C. MitoTracker Red CMXRos stains mitochondria in live cells and its accumulation is dependent upon membrane potential. Cells were incubated for 20 min as indicated in the manufacter's protocole. For intracytoplasmic immunolabeling, cells were fixed in 0.01% formaldehyde for 10 min, followed by disruption of membrane by Saponin at 0.5% v/v in PBS. Cells were then incubated for 30 min with PE-conjugated anti-mouse IFNγ antibodies (BD Biosciences). For glucose up-take analysis, purified T cells were incubated with 2-NBDG (Life Technologies) (100 μM) for 30 min. The 2-NBDG uptake reaction was stopped by removing the incubation medium and washing the cells with pre-cold PBS. For Bodipy uptake, cells were incubated with Bodipy FL C<sub>16</sub> ((4,4-Difluoro-5,7-Dimethyl-4-Bora-3a,4a-Diaza-s-Indacene-3-Hexadecanoic Acid) for 4 hr. Cells were then washed and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Proteins were precipitated from the extract supernatant with ice-cold acetone overnight at 20°C. The dried protein pellet was dissolved in the 2DE sample buffer containing 4% CHAPS, 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 1% DTT and 1% IPG buffer 3–11 NL (GE Healthcare). The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Sigma-Aldricht). For each 2DE, 90 μg of protein extract was loaded on 18 cm long immobiline strips (pH 3–11 NL) (GE Healthcare) which were first rehydrated overnight at room temperature with 450 μl of rehydration solution (CHAPS 4% (w/v), Urea 7 M, thiourea 2 M, IPG buffer (pH 3–11 NL) 1% (v/v), Destreak reagent (GE Healthcare) 12 μl/mL). Protein extracts were deposited on the strip using cup loading with sample cups for manifold (GE Healthcare), allowing a good separation without any streaking on the basic side of the 2D-gels. Isofocusing was carried out at -20°C for 70 kV-hour with an Ettan IPGphor 2 unit (GE Healthcare). After pH equilibration for 15 min in a solution of Urea 6 M, Tris-HCL 50 mM at pH 8.8, glycerol 30% (v/v) and SDS 2% (w/v) containing 1% of DTT (w/v), the proteins were alkylated for 15 min in the same solution containing 2.5% of iodoacetamide (w/v). The strips were deposited on a 12% SDS-Polyacrylamide gel. Gels were stained overnight with colloidal Coomassie brilliant blue G250.</p><p>For qualitative and quantitative image analysis, biological replicates of 2DE were performed for naive (n = 3) and chronically-stimulated (n = 5) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1S</xref>) were scanned with Typhoon (GE Healthcare) and analyzed using SameSpots software v4.1 (Nonlinear Dynamics Ltd). Images were exported for spot detection, matching, normalization and quantification. Spots were quantified on the basis of their normalized volume, that is, the spot volume divided by the total volume of the whole set of gel spots. Spots were scored as variable if they fulfilled the following stringent statistical criteria: ANOVA p≤0.05, fold difference ≥2, q &lt; 0.05 and power &gt;0.8.</p><p>For protein identification, major spots, revealed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining, were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion according to previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shevchenko et al., 1996</xref>). The tryptic peptides were separated on a nano-HPLC EASY-nLCII (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a QTOF (Waters). Peptides were loaded on a 10 cm column with 75 µm inner diameter, packed with 3 µm C18 particles. Reversed-chromatography was performed with a binary buffer system consisting of 0.1% FA (Buffer A) and 95% acetonitril in 0.1% FA (Buffer B) for one-hour gradient run with a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The QTOF was operated in the data dependent mode and the three most abundant isotope patterns with +2 and+3 charges were selected. The raw files were processed using Mascot Daemon platform. The fragmentation spectra were searched against NCBInr with the parent ion mass tolerance set to 100 ppm, and with one miscleavage. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification and methionine oxidation and pyroglutamic acid as variable modifications for database searching. Tryptic digests were analyzed on an Ultraflex ToF/ToF mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany). Spectra were processed using FlexAnalysis 2.2 and Biotools 2.2 software (Bruker). MSMS spectra were obtained on the three most abundant peaks of the PMF spectrum. The protein mass list was first searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein (nr) database using in-house Mascot software (http://​www.​matrixscience.​com). If the search did not result in identification of a protein, the mass list was searched against the Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR) wheat tentative consensus (TC) database (http://​www.​tigr.​org) or the database of ESTs other than those from human and mouse. The search criteria were monoisotopic mass accuracy &lt;50 ppm, one missed cleavage, and complete carbamidomethylation of cysteine, partial oxidation of methionine and pyroglutamic acid as allowed modifications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Western blotting</title><p>SDS polyacrylamide gel (SDS–PAGE) and immunoblotting were performed according to standard procedures. Briefly, cells were lysed by RIPA lysis buffer (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany) on ice. Cell lysates with equal amounts of proteins (15 μg) were separated in 12% SDS–PAGE. Separated proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare, Diegem, Belgium), which was subsequently blocked at 4°C for 1 hr with 5% non‐fat dry milk in TBST (20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The blots were then incubated with appropriate dilutions of primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Primary antibodies used for Western blot analysis include rat polyclonal antibodies for p4EBP1, S6, pS6, pEif2 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and mouse monoclonal antibody for GAPDH (dilution 1:2000, Meridian Life Science, Memphis, USA). After three washes with TBST, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase‐conjugated secondary antibodies either against rat (dilution 1:1000, GE Healthcare) or against mouse (dilution 1:2000, BD Biosciences) in TBST with 5% milk. After several washes with TBST, the blots were incubated at room temperature for 5 min with ECL (Lumigen, Southfield, USA). This was followed by detection with the ChemiDoc XRS (BioRad Laboratories, Temse, Belgium).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Histology</title><p>Liver from male recipients adoptively-transferred with male-specific GFP<sup>+</sup><italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected with 30% w/v sucrose in PBS, and frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT compound.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Long-term antigen exposure deeply modifies metabolic requirements for T cell function&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lydia Lynch (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help guide your efforts to bring the story to more substantial conclusions.</p><p>The manuscript by Bettonville and colleagues addresses an important question in T cell biology, namely the mechanisms that govern the functionality of T cells during chronic antigen exposure. Effector T cells (Teff) under chronic antigen exposure enter a state of non-responsiveness (commonly coined &quot;exhaustion&quot;) marked by reduced or absent production of cytokines such as IFNγ. The authors use several adoptive transfer models (i.e. BALB/c CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> B6 allogenic model, anti-male TCR Tg T cells male recipients) to study mechanisms of T cell non-responsiveness, and have focused on metabolic regulation in this paper.</p><p>The manuscript is clear and provides some new insight into the metabolic nature of &quot;late&quot; chronically activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vivo. Recent work by several groups suggest that glycolysis is a key regulator of IFNγ production in effector T cells. Work by Chang et al. (2013) demonstrated that glycolysis allows for increased translation of IFNγ mRNA. Work by the Gajewski group also established that 2-DG and other forms of glycolytic inhibition could impact IFNγ production by effector T cells. In this work, Bettonville and colleagues propose that chronically activated T cells in vivo are in a state of metabolic non-responsiveness, which may be underscored by reduced mitochondrial activity. However, overall the work is somewhat incremental over recently published results from John Wherry's group characterizing reduced mitochondrial function of exhausted T CD8<sup>+</sup> cells. The authors describe the metabolic phenotype of chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but provide no mechanistic data to identify what pathways of mitochondrial metabolism chronic CD4 cells are using (beyond glycolysis) to remain functional. In this light, the data are preliminary and additional mechanistic work is needed to make the article suitable for publication in this journal.</p><p>The authors also fail to provide insight into why their results contrast with others in the literature. For example, the Wherry Lab have shown that PD1 altered both glycolytic and mitochondrial bioenergetics, based on 8 day analysis as well as some long term measurements (35 days). Engagement of PDL1 results in reduced mitochondrial mass and increased glucose uptake on virus specific T cells. In contrast the authors study shows that blocking PD1 restores function but not glycolysis, and the mitochondrial results contrast also. Based on this, could some differences be due to measuring all PD1+ cells (rather than intermediate vs. hi) and did the authors see any difference seen between PD1 hi and intermediate T cells in this study? Likewise, chronic T cells in their system have low metabolic activity marked by low glycolysis (ECAR), basal OXPHOS (OCR), and low mitochondrial respiratory capacity (SRC), as well as reduced mitochondrial content (Figure 3A-B). This is consistent with recently published work on LCMV chronic infection (Bengsch, Immunity, 2016), although PD-1 knockout cannot restore glycolysis in their system as was suggested in the Bengsch paper, suggesting an alternative mechanism. PD-1-/- T cells in their system still have reduced ECAR/OCR/SRC levels compared to Teff cells (similar to naïve T cells), but can produce IFNγ (Figure 4). The authors claim that these data suggest that engaging glycolysis is not required for IFNγ production by chronic T cells, making their metabolic requirements distinct from Teff cells (Chang et al., 2013). The lack of increased glycolysis in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> PD-1-/- T cells is also counter to that observed with CD8<sup>+</sup> PD-1-/- T cells that have increased glucose uptake and lower mitochondrial mass (Bengsch, 2016).</p><p>There are several experimental issues that the authors need to address beyond these issues of contrast with the literature:</p><p>1) In Figure 4 the authors show that ECAR of functional <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells is similar to non-functional <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> T cells, but that <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells have substantial OXPHOS. The authors see little effect on the inhibition of IFNγ by 2-DG in these cells. However, one should really test the role of OXPHOS pathways in <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells. The authors could use DON, Oligo, and Etomoxir as in Figure 3 as reagents to test this.</p><p>2) As an extension of point #1 above, the data infer that <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells use a fuel source or metabolism distinct from <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> T cells that influences OXPHOS to maintain functionality. Identifying the metabolic pathway(s) involved in this process would distinguish this work substantially from what has been previously published.</p><p>3) Regarding the data in Figure 5, it is not clear how ROS affects cytokine production in chronic CD4 cells. Is IFNγ production regulated at the mRNA level or translation, and how does NAC affect this process (i.e. Figure 5F)? The authors can start by measuring IFNγ mRNA levels in control and <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells after 24h NAC treatment. One mechanistic explanation is that elevated mROS could inactivate mTORC1 (see Li, Cell Signal, 2010), leading to reduced translation. This could be verified using p-S6 phosflow or western blots to measure mTORC1 in their chronic cells. If mTORC1 is reduced, they could use genetic means (i.e. Tsc2 knockdown) to restore mTORC1 activity and see if this reverses the functional defect in their chronic CD4 T cells. Can the authors use NAC or MitoQ/MitoTEMPO in vivo to determine whether limiting ROS can prevent the dysfunctional phenotype? Likewise, ROS has been shown to promote NFAT activation and downstream transcription. Is this axis altered in chronic T cells +/- PD1?</p><p>4) What is the phenotype beyond simply PD1 expression in the authors models? PD1 is of course a popular and dominant coinhibitory model but the first marker in a set that defines so-called 'exhausted' T cells. Given that antigen exposure is a dominant driver of T cell exhaustion and previous work in tumor-infiltrating hyporesponsive cd8 T cells (Scharping et al., Immunity 2016, not referenced in this manuscript) suggests that metabolic suppression (glucose uptake and mitochondrial mass) correlates with the degree of exhaustion, it would be important to note what these cells look like in terms of LAG3, TIM3, 2B4, etc. expression.</p><p>5) To determine a role for PD1 in the metabolic phenotype, the authors use knockout cells in their system. I would also suggest using PD-L1 blockade in this system, as they did in Figure 1. Likewise, experimental details regarding the results of Figure 4B-C would be important. Is there a source of PD-1 ligation in this system? That may reveal a phenotype for PD-1 potentially, although previous work in tumors suggest PD-1 may be not playing a role in the mitochondrial suppression phenotype.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Long-term antigen exposure deeply modifies metabolic requirements for T cell function&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors might want to examine whether expression of some mitochondrial biogenesis genes are altered in their cells and how that might be distinct from LCMV.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30938.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The manuscript is clear and provides some new insight into the metabolic nature of &quot;late&quot; chronically activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vivo.

In our initial submission to <italic>eLife</italic>, we had shown that, contrary to limiting glycolysis, limiting OXPHOS or FAO inhibited significantly the production of IFNγ by chronic T cells (Figure 4A). This observation led to the hypothesis that fatty acids could support IFNγ production in these T cells. This assumption was also supported by the observation made by Byersdorfer and colleagues (Byersdorfer et al., 2013) that T cells responsible for graft-versus-host disease in mice used FAO to support their effector function. We investigated this possibility by analysing the capacity of chronic T cells to import fatty acids and demonstrated the specific expression of the fatty acid transporter FATP4 as well as the expression of CPT1a responsible for the mitochondrial transport of long chain fatty acids such as palmitoyl-CoA (Figure 4D). Accordingly, chronic T cells were also more sensitive to Bodipy staining, demonstrating a higher capacity to import fatty acids. Finally, we also observed that inhibiting FAO restored the capacity of chronic T cells to consume glucose. However, glucose consumption (with no lactate produced) did not appear to be sufficient for IFNγ synthesis, demonstrating again the incapacity of chronic T cells to mount a glycolytic activity to support IFNγ production. Taken together, our results demonstrate that chronic T cells in our study do use fatty acids as a source of energy for IFNγ. These new observations are presented in the new paragraph added at the end of the subsection “Effector function of chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells does not require a metabolic shift towards glycolysis”.</p><p>We also analyzed fatty acid uptake in <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> chronic T cells and showed that, though their capacity to import fatty acids from their environment appeared the same as for <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells, <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells expressed higher levels of CPT1a. Thus, the absence of PD-1-mediated regulation of TcR signaling would improve chronic T cell's capacity to oxidize fatty acids. This is presented in the aforementioned paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also fail to provide insight into why their results contrast with others in the literature.

Our data fit with the general concept that T cell unresponsiveness is a progressive state that evolves from partial to full unresponsiveness. We show that 1) chronic T cells exposed to long-term antigen stimulation express higher levels of inhibitory receptors than early chronic T cells; 2) contrary to early chronic T cells, late chronic T cells have lost some of their function (IL-2 production and proliferation) that cannot be restored. Our data add the observation that early chronic antigen exposure does not alter T cell capacity to monopolize glycolysis for effector function whereas after late chronic exposure T cells are unable to engage glycolysis. The main difference with the recent published work on LCMV chronic infection by Bengsch and co-workers, where glycolysis is engaged for early and late chronic T cell function, is that in our adoptive transfer model T cells are exposed to chronic antigen stimulation in the absence of inflammatory signals. Thus, chronic antigen recognition by T cells would be carried out without CD28 co-stimulation. Since we know that sustained glycolytic function in T cells requires CD28 signaling (Menk et al., 2018) and that rendering T cells anergic through TcR stimulation alone not only prevents upregulation of glycolytic metabolism, but also prevents it from being upregulated in future stimulations, even those delivered with costimulation (Zheng et al., 2009), one could expect that chronic antigen stimulation in the absence of costimulation would lead to the maintenance of a state where glycolysis could not be engaged for T cell function. We have added several paragraphs in the Discussion section of the manuscript presenting this new concept.</p><p>Finally, it should be pointed out that PD1-/- T cells in our system have reduced ECAR/OCR/SRC (and glycolysis) levels compared to Teff cells, but can produce IFNγ (Figure 5). However, unlike LCMV-specific exhausted T cells, their proliferation is not restored after stimulation in the absence of PD-L1-PD1 interactions (Figure 2F), leaving most of their oxidative energy supply for the synthesis of IFNγ alone. This could explain why chronic T cells are still capable to produce IFNγ despite their deficit in metabolic pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several experimental issues that the authors need to address beyond these issues of contrast with the literature:</p><p>1) In Figure 4 the authors show that ECAR of functional Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup> T cells is similar to non-functional Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup> T cells, but that Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup> T cells have substantial OXPHOS.

Is IFNγ production regulated at the mRNA level or translation, and how does NAC affect this process (i.e. Figure 5F)? The authors can start by measuring IFNγ mRNA levels in control and Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup> T cells after 24h NAC treatment. One mechanistic explanation is that elevated mROS could inactivate mTORC1 (see Li, Cell Signal, 2010), leading to reduced translation.

Likewise, ROS has been shown to promote NFAT activation and downstream transcription. Is this axis altered in chronic T cells +/- PD1?</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out new experiments to determine whether regulation of IFNγ secretion by chronic T cells is at the level of transcription or translation. First, we analyzed the phosphorylation of mTORC1 targets involved in protein translation. As seen in Figure 7, low ROSproducer <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> T cells and high ROS-producer <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells had the same capacity to phosphorylate mTORC1 targets involved in protein translation, namely 4EBP and S6, after activation. This supported the conclusion that the presence of more abundant ROS does not affect protein translation in chronic T cells. We have also analyzed, as requested by the reviewers, the production of IFNγ mRNA after short stimulation in chronic T cells. As seen in Figure 7D, Pdcd1-/- T cells had consistently more IFNγ mRNA after activation than <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> T cells. This was surprising since at the protein level, <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> chronic T cells appeared to produce more IFNγ that <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (Figure 7A and B). Taken together these results suggested that mRNA produced in High ROS producer <italic>Pdcd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> might be less stable than in <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> T cells. ROS are a major source of damage to cellular components and RNA damage has been reported to increase during oxidative stress. (Li et al. IUBMB Life 2006 58:582). Taken together, our data support the notion that, in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, PD-1 increases T cell activation threshold to prevent excessive RNA oxidation and decay, consequently preserving the capacity of T cells to produce inflammatory cytokines such as IFNγ (see Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What is the phenotype beyond simply PD1 expression in the authors models?

Given that antigen exposure is a dominant driver of T cell exhaustion and previous work in tumor-infiltrating hyporesponsive cd8 T cells (Scharping et al., Immunity 2016, not referenced in this manuscript) suggests that metabolic suppression (glucose uptake and mitochondrial mass) correlates with the degree of exhaustion, it would be important to note what these cells look like in terms of LAG3, TIM3, 2B4, etc. expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We have compared the expression of PD1, LAG3 and 2B4 in T cells exposed for 8 days or 21 days to chronic male antigen stimulation. Our results show that day 21 T cells express higher levels of PD1, LAG3 and 2B4 coinhibitory receptors than day 7 T cells. This observation supports the notion that day 21 T cells are in a deeper stage of &quot;exhaustion&quot; than day 7 T cells. The description of these data and conclusion can be found in the second paragraph of the subsection “Effector function of chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells does not require a metabolic shift towards glycolysis” and in Figure 3I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) To determine a role for PD1 in the metabolic phenotype, the authors use knockout cells in their system. I would also suggest using PD-L1 blockade in this system, as they did in Figure 1. Likewise, experimental details regarding the results of Figure 4B-C would be important. Is there a source of PD-1 ligation in this system? That may reveal a phenotype for PD-1 potentially, although previous work in tumors suggest PD-1 may be not playing a role in the mitochondrial suppression phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>Since analyses of the metabolic phenotype (with inhibitors) are carried out with purified <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> T cells, PD1 molecules present at T cell surface are not engaged by ligands expressed by APC. Thus, in our experiments, T cell metabolic profile is determine in the absence of PD1 inhibition of TcR signalling. Since it has been proposed that PD-L1 can also engaged CD80 in T-T cell contacts and that this interaction can suppress T cell activity, we also analyzed the effect of PDL1 neutralisation on the activity of purified <italic>Pdcd1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> T cells. As show in Figures 2G-H, neutralisation of PD-L1 by antibodies did not modify the capacity of chronic T cells to produce Ifnγ, demonstrating that regulation of T cell activity by PD-L1-CD80 interaction does not seem to play a role in this system.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In particular, please consider revising the title as suggested, commenting further on the two cited studies in Immunity, and if feasible, adding the mitochondrial data.

However, there is still a lack of mechanistic insight in the manuscript: how do the authors suggest these metabolic changes are occurring during chronic stimulation? A lot of this manuscript is profiling WT and KO cells without really asking what is happening when these CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are chronically stimulated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph on what we believe could be the natural history of chronically stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as suggested by the reviewer (Discussion, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have spent a lot of time and effort refuting parallel but distinct observations in LCMV clone 13 (Bengsch et al., 2016) when the companion paper in that issue, in the tumor immunology field (Scharping et al., Immunity 2016) agrees quite nicely with their findings (decreased mitochondrial mass in exhausted T cells that was not rescued with PD-1 blockade). The authors might want to examine whether expression of some mitochondrial biogenesis genes are altered in their cells and how that might be distinct from LCMV.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a discussion point (Discussion, fourth paragraph) on mitochondria biogenesis in chronic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and, based on what we observed, we think PD-1 does not control mitochondria biogenesis through PGC1a as in the early exhaustion of LCMV-specific T cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
