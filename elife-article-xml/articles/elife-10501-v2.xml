providing a powerful system to study ASC self-renewal and differentiation dynamics. It is unknown how the collective output of neoblasts transit through differentiation pathways to produce specific cell types. The planarian epidermis is a simple tissue that undergoes rapid turnover. We found that as epidermal progeny differentiate, they progress through multiple spatiotemporal transition states with distinct gene expression profiles. We also identified a conserved early growth response family transcription factor, <italic>egr-5</italic>, that is essential for epidermal differentiation. Disruption of epidermal integrity by <italic>egr-5</italic> RNAi triggers a global stress response that induces the proliferation of neoblasts and the concomitant expansion of not only epidermal, but also multiple progenitor cell populations.

This means that adult stem cells can replace the specialized cells that are continually lost from animal tissues and organs. This allows the organs to continue to work properly. It is important to understand how adult stem cells decide whether to self-renew or differentiate because if they proliferate too much they may form abnormal growths such as tumors. On the other hand, if adult stem cells do not properly differentiate into specialized cells it can lead to tissue degeneration or even premature aging.</p><p>Now Tu et al. have used planarian flatworms, which are considered masters of regeneration, as a model to study how adult stem cells differentiate into more specialized cells. In particular, the experiments explored how the flatworm’s adult stem cells (which are called neoblasts) develop into the epidermal cells that form the equivalent of the worm’s skin.</p><p>Tu et al. show that when a neoblast becomes a mature epidermal cell, it has to undergo multiple transition steps. Slightly different genes are expressed during each step, but a gene called <italic>egr-5</italic> controls the expression of all of these marker genes. The <italic>egr-5</italic> gene is highly expressed when cells start to develop into epidermal cells. Reducing this gene’s activity blocks the cells from differentiating properly, meaning that they do not form mature epidermal cells. The loss of new epidermal cells causes a disruption in the overall integrity of the worm’s outer surface and this triggers a wound response throughout the whole animal. The neoblasts in turn respond by proliferating excessively and generating other differentiated cells such as neurons and gut cells. However, without <italic>egr-5</italic>, the flatworms still cannot make new epidermal cells and they ultimately die.</p><p>The findings highlight that the development of epithelial cells in this relatively simple organism is much more complicated than suspected. In the future, it will be important to understand how the <italic>egr-5</italic> gene controls the proper differentiation and maturation of epidermal cells and whether these mechanisms are conserved in other animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10501.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10501.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic></kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>epidermis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37GM057260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Alvarado</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Alvarado</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007795</institution-id><institution>Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Alvarado</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tu</surname><given-names>Kimberly C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005366</institution-id><institution>American Foundation for Aging Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tu</surname><given-names>Kimberly C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dynamic homeostasis of the planarian epidermis serves as an experimental paradigm to study stem cell dynamics and post-mitotic specification of diverse functional cell fates.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult stem cells (ASCs) are tissue-specific cells with the capacity to self-renew and differentiate to continually replace cells lost to normal physiological turnover or injury. As a result, ASCs play an essential role in preserving the anatomical form and function of most multicellular organisms. The precise coordination of stem cell proliferation and proper fate specification is of paramount importance to tissue growth and organismal homeostasis. Excessive stem cell divisions can lead to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Visvader and Lindeman, 2012</xref>), while a loss in proliferation capacity can contribute to premature aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gopinath and Rando, 2008</xref>). Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance between stem cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death will thus provide fundamental insights into tissue maintenance and repair. It will also illuminate the molecular basis of tissue dysfunction, including disease progression and aging.</p><p>The model planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> has emerged as an experimental system that provides a unique window into major aspects of <italic>in vivo</italic> stem cell biology, including regeneration, fate determination and homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rink, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roberts-Galbraith and Newmark, 2015</xref>). Neoblasts, the planarian stem cells, are in a state of perpetual action. They are widely distributed throughout the body mesenchyme, driving constitutive renewal of tissues during homeostasis and endowing planarians with the remarkable capacity to regenerate wholly from tiny tissue fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brøndsted, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). Neoblasts, the only dividing cells in planarians, are believed to be collectively comprised of both a heterogeneous population of pluripotent cells with broad differentiation potential and also lineage-committed progenitor cells that give rise to specific tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). To ensure the integrity of adult tissues during homeostasis and regeneration, neoblasts must perpetuate themselves and generate lineage-committed progenitor cells that give rise to precise numbers of differentiated cell types in a proper spatial and temporal sequence.</p><p>A general principle used to establish planarian lineages has been to identify tissue-specific transcription factors (TF) expressed in subsets of neoblasts (<italic>smedwi-1<sup>+</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reddien et al., 2005b</xref>) that are also required for the specification of those tissues, including the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lapan and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lapan and Reddien, 2012</xref>), protonephridia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scimone et al., 2011</xref>), pharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>), and discrete neuronal sub-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Currie and Pearson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>). These TFs have typically been identified through evolutionary conservation, induced expression in neoblasts during regeneration, or through transcriptional profiling of isolated tissues. Additional methods including BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>), perdurance of the SMEDWI-1 protein in differentiating progeny cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>), and gamma irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>) have also been used to link neoblasts with their progeny. Although RNAi knockdown of lineage-committed TFs blocks the regeneration of their specified tissues, many of these TFs are expressed throughout those tissues, making it difficult to study how different cell types within the same tissue are formed. Therefore, elucidating the cellular mechanisms that bridge the pluripotent and the differentiated state remains a challenge.</p><p>The planarian epidermis is a simple, monostratified tissue that consists of clear histological organization of multiple differentiated multi-ciliated and non-ciliated cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rompolas et al., 2010</xref>). Individual epidermal cells must continuously be replaced due to damage from environmental insults and exogenous wounds. To replenish these cells, neoblasts residing deep in the mesenchyme must produce cells that mobilize, undergo multiple determination steps, cross the basement membrane, intercalate and differentiate into the epidermis. Moreover, the epidermis provides the critical first step in regeneration by covering the amputation-induced wound site through cell spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morita and Best, 1974</xref>). Recent work has identified a prominent class of neoblasts referred to as zeta-class possessing a distinct molecular signature, including the novel zinc-finger gene <italic>zfp-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Zfp-1</italic>(RNAi) animals can regenerate tissues including the gut, brain and muscle, but fail to generate cells expressing epidermal markers, indicating that zeta-class neoblasts likely give rise to an epidermal lineage.</p><p><italic>Zfp-1</italic>, along with the chromatin remodeling factor <italic>chd4</italic>, the tumor suppressor gene <italic>p53</italic>, and most recently an RNA-binding protein <italic>mex3-1</italic>, have all been shown to be required for the maintenance of two related postmitotic, sub-epidermal cell populations expressing the specific marker genes <italic>prog-1</italic> and <italic>AGAT-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pearson and Sánchez Alvarado, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scimone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). These abundant <italic>prog-1</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>AGAT-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cell populations, originally identified as early and late progeny cells based on their rapid turnover kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>), have been widely used to assess neoblast differentiation. Given that zeta-class neoblasts are required for the generation of <italic>prog-1</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>AGAT-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells and other markers of epidermal cell types, <italic>prog-1</italic> and <italic>AGAT-1</italic> likely mark two major populations of epidermal progeny cells. However, it remains unclear whether the diverse cell types in the planarian epidermis all share common or distinct lineage relationships with each other, and the mechanisms that control the progression of epidermal progenitors along distinct differentiation paths into mature cell types are completely unknown.</p><p>To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying neoblast differentiation and how they give rise to multiple cell types, we devised a strategy to identify critical factors enriched in the <italic>AGAT-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cell population required for epidermal lineage progression. We performed RNA-seq analysis of <italic>chd4</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> RNAi animals and characterized additional markers enriched in <italic>AGAT-1</italic><sup>+</sup> and related post-mitotic cells. We find that epidermal progeny cells form distinct mesenchymal populations and undergo differentiation in a spatially and temporally graded manner into the mature epidermis. We also describe a conserved transcription factor of the early growth response family, <italic>egr-5</italic>, that is expressed in post-mitotic progeny cells and is an essential regulator of post-mitotic epidermal fate specification. Taken together, our results further establish the planarian epidermis as a paradigm to study adult lineage specification <italic>in vivo</italic>, contributing to our knowledge of mechanisms required for the proper execution of stem cell fate decisions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of regulators of epidermal post-mitotic fate transitions</title><p>The <italic>prog-1<sup>+</sup> </italic> (early progeny) and <italic>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </italic>(late progeny) postmitotic cell populations constituting the first neoblast lineage described in planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>) have been widely used as an assay for neoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fraguas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pearson and Sánchez Alvarado, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scimone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>). The zeta-class neoblasts are a major subclass of planarian neoblasts identified molecularly by a specific gene signature, mainly two TFs, <italic>zfp-1</italic> and <italic>soxP-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). Zeta neoblasts are generated from the collectively pluripotent sigma-class neoblasts, and have recently been shown to generate <italic>prog-1<sup>+</sup> </italic> and <italic>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </italic> cells as well as other populations spanning the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that they are part of an epidermal lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This lineage is a useful model to dissect the choreography of neoblast progeny differentiation because it is an abundant cell population undergoing rapid turnover, and both <italic>prog-1<sup>+</sup> </italic> and <italic>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </italic> cells are molecularly and spatially distinct. <italic>Prog-1</italic><sup>+</sup> (early progeny) cells likely represent a very transient cell population because they are lost about two days after a lethal dose of irradiation, whereas <italic>AGAT-1</italic><sup>+</sup> (late progeny) cells are not completely lost until about seven days post-irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the precise molecular relationships between these cell populations and the mechanisms that control the progression and maturation of the zeta-class epidermal lineage still must be resolved.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10501.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of a common transcriptional down-regulated gene set in <italic>chd4</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> RNAi animals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Current model of planarian epidermal lineage specification.

The smoothness of the ventral epidermis also contributed to difficulty in delineating individual epidermal cells. Our data suggest that the reduced epidermal density in <italic>egr-5</italic>(RNAi) animals could be caused by the failure of new epidermal progeny cells to properly differentiate and incorporate into the epidermis, resulting in stretching and apparent morphological defects. Consistent with this hypothesis, we also found that there was a significant reduction in the number of <italic>laminB</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in the anterior region of <italic>egr-5</italic>(RNAi) animals compared to control animals after 21 days of RNAi treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Misexpression of epidermal progeny markers in <italic>egr-5</italic>(RNAi) animals</title><p>Given that <italic>egr-5</italic> knockdown causes a marked reduction in <italic>zpuf-6</italic> expression in the epidermis, we looked at our panel of epidermal lineage markers to determine which particular transition may be affected in the course of differentiation. In RNAi conditions such as <italic>chd4, p53</italic> and <italic>zfp-1</italic> knockdown where <italic>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </italic> cell populations are lost, there is a distinct progressive disappearance in the spatial distribution of cells, but the signal intensity of the gene marker expressed in the remaining cells is not significantly diminished (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This suggests that these factors are required for the generation or maintenance of <italic>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </italic> cells, but not necessarily required for the expression of <italic>AGAT-1</italic> or other markers in these cells. However, a TF can be responsible for the expression of <italic>AGAT-1</italic> or some other marker, and not be required for the maintenance of that cell type, or both. To distinguish between the loss of cell type versus the loss of specific gene expression, we made RNA probe mixes consisting of multiple <italic>zpuf</italic> genes from our screen expressed in either <italic>AGAT-1</italic> or <italic>zpuf-6</italic> cells to increase overall signal intensity and detection.</p><p>We first investigated the spatial distribution of <italic>prog-1</italic> and <italic>AGAT-1</italic> progeny markers and found that the stereotypical sub-epidermal expression domains of both markers had expanded deeper into the mesenchyme in <italic>egr-5</italic>(RNAi) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting potential temporal defects in the earlier steps of epidermal lineage progression. We then simultaneously analyzed <italic>prog-1, AGAT-1</italic> and <italic>zpuf-6</italic> markers by whole-mount FISH and established that in <italic>egr-5</italic>(RNAi) animals, epidermal progeny cells in the mesenchyme are not specifically lost, but that <italic>AGAT-1</italic> and <italic>zpuf-6</italic> expression levels were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>).

Based on general morphology and the observation that <italic>egr-5</italic> RNAi animals did not exhibit defects in osmoregulation by bloating, we conclude that the protonephridia are functional.

We propose that <italic>zpuf-6<sup>+</sup> </italic> epidermal cells may represent a stable transition state with the potential to give rise to an unknown number of differentiated cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Z<italic>puf-6</italic><sup>+</sup> epidermal cells are interspersed throughout the epidermis but do not express high levels of a cilia gene, <italic>rootletin</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which is a marker for differentiated ciliated epidermal cells. However, <italic>zpuf-6</italic><sup>+</sup> epidermal cells overlap extensively with a predicted intermediate filament (IF) gene, <italic>vim-3</italic>, which is expressed more broadly in the dorsal epidermis. <italic>Zpuf-6<sup>neg</sup></italic> epidermal cells express lower levels of <italic>vim-3</italic> than <italic>zpuf-6<sup>+</sup> </italic>cells, but these cells begin in turn to express <italic>rootletin</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). IF proteins are a diverse class of cytoskeletal elements that provide cells with mechanical support, contribute to the structural integrity of cells, and act as markers of morphogenesis and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim and Coulombe, 2007</xref>). In addition, <italic>zpuf-6</italic><sup>+</sup> cells overlap with two specific subset of cells: one expressing the marker <italic>NB.22.1E</italic> surrounding the ventral mouth opening and the other expressing the <italic>laminB</italic> IF gene that marks adhesive cells along the animal body margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Lastly, <italic>zpuf-6<sup>+</sup> </italic> cells are present at higher cell density in the regenerating blastema than under normal homeostasis conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that they have not completed differentiation.</p><p>The decisions influencing a particular cell fate path for <italic>zpuf-6<sup>+</sup> </italic> epidermal cells could be determined by the immediate, surrounding environment. Given that dorsal and ventral epidermal cells are morphologically distinct, positional cues and signals are likely to contribute to the cell fate specification process. For example, transplantation experiments involving a plug of tissue from a donor transplanted in the reverse dorsal-ventral (DV) orientation with regard to the host can trigger tissue outgrowths on both sides where the grafted tissue maintains its original DV identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kato et al., 1999</xref>). The sub-epidermal layer of body wall muscle cells express most of the polarity cues that organize the planarian body axes, including receptors, ligands and inhibitors of the BMP and Wnt signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>), and could potentially impact epidermal fates as well. The role of Notch signaling has not been well characterized in planarians but has been implicated in the regulation of cell fate determination in epithelial cells of the mouse intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">VanDussen et al., 2012</xref>) and the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rock and Hogan, 2011</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that <italic>zpuf-6<sup>+</sup> </italic> epidermal cells simply reflect an abundant, differentiated cell population that undergoes rapid turnover. Additionally, there could be other progenitors (zeta-class dependent or independent) that give rise to specific epidermal cell types that have not been defined molecularly. To build upon our understanding of epidermal cell fate specification, it will be necessary to define all the types and numbers of cells that ultimately compose both the ventral and dorsal planarian epidermis, as well as the factors that contribute to their identity and maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>Egr-5</italic> is required for post-mitotic epidermal lineage progression</title><p>In planarians, TFs play prominent roles in specifying neoblasts to a committed fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reddien, 2013</xref>). Key TFs that are important for specifying neoblasts during homeostasis and regeneration often remain expressed in mature cell types, suggesting that these TFs are also required for the maintenance of cellular identity. Studies of planarian eye regeneration currently provide the most detailed characterization of planarian lineage specification. During regeneration, eye progenitors express conserved TFs <italic>ovo, six-1/2</italic> and <italic>eya</italic> at a distance from the eye primordium, forming a trail of cells and undergoing changes in gene expression as they migrate toward the primordium, where differentiation markers begin to be expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lapan and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lapan and Reddien, 2012</xref>). However, <italic>ovo, six-1/2</italic> and <italic>eya</italic> are also expressed in mature eyes and are likely involved in the maintenance of the optic cup cells and photo-sensing neurons of this sensory organ.</p><p>Our findings also suggest that distinct molecular changes occur both spatially and temporally, and are necessary for the proper differentiation of epidermal progenitors into mature cell types. However, <italic>egr-5,</italic> which is required for the stable maturation of epidermal progenitors and their progeny, does not appear to be required for the maintenance of the differentiated state. In fact, the lack of <italic>egr-5</italic> expression in the epidermis suggests that shutting off its expression may be an important step in promoting differentiation. Whether this regulation is intrinsic or extrinsic awaits further investigation. Moreover, because loss of <italic>egr-5</italic> leads to the misexpression of <italic>AGAT-1</italic> and <italic>zpuf-6</italic> markers in <italic>prog-1<sup>+</sup> </italic> cells, it could be directly or indirectly involved in turning off <italic>prog-1</italic> expression and activating the expression of genes required for the <italic>AGAT-1</italic><sup>+</sup> transition stage. A key remaining question is how individual epidermal progeny cells undergo distinct differentiation transition stages, including responses to external signals or potential changes in chromatin structure.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A physiological role for <italic>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </italic> progeny cells</title><p>Genes involved in small molecule metabolic processes (specifically organonitrogen processes) were enriched in our common <italic>chd4</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> RNAi down-regulated gene list.

These enzymes catalyze the first step in creatine biosynthesis by transferring the amidino group of arginine to glycine to yield ornithine and guanidinoacetic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wyss, 2000</xref>). Creatine plays an important role in muscle energy homeostasis. In vertebrates, de novo synthesis of creatine mainly takes place in the kidney, pancreas and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nabuurs et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is assumed that <italic>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </italic> cells synthesize creatine, which is then released and taken up by neighboring muscle cells and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>), though this has not been formally demonstrated.</p><p>Polyamines are ubiquitous polycations that are essential for eukaryotic cell growth, and polyamine metabolism is frequently dysregulated in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pegg, 2009</xref>). Some of the elucidated roles for polyamines in cell growth include maintenance of chromatin conformation, gene regulation, ion channel regulation, and free radical scavenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casero and Marton, 2007</xref>). Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis by converting ornithine to putrescine, which then is converted to spermidine and spermine. In planarians, ODC activity has been reported to be induced early in regeneration near the wound site, and inhibition of ODC activity appears to cause a reduction in cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saló and Baguna, 1989</xref>). However, mechanisms of action by <italic>odc-1</italic> and the regulation of neoblasts require further characterization.</p><p>The cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are enzymes that use molecular oxygen and complex reaction chemistry to modify their substrates. They are involved in a large number of physiological processes, including steroid hormone synthesis and detoxification of xenobiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anzenbacher and Anzenbacherova, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang and Yang, 2009</xref>). CYPs make up one of the most diverse eukaryotic gene families, and are classified into clans, families and sub-families based on phylogenetics and sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>). We identified a number of <italic>cyp</italic> genes that were expressed in <italic>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </italic> progeny cells as well as in the gut. Steroid metabolism and detoxification are two processes generally performed by the liver, raising the questions of what physiological roles these various planarian <italic>cyp</italic> genes play and whether <italic>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </italic> cells may have an additional endocrine-like function.</p><p>Although p53 is best known for its central role as a tumor suppressor, it also regulates several aspects of cellular metabolism, including autophagy, central carbon metabolism, and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkers et al., 2013</xref>). Fatty acids (FA) have essential roles in the cell as sources of energy, membrane components, and signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lopes-Marques et al., 2013</xref>). Long-chain fatty-acid coA-ligases (ACSL) are key enzymes involved in the initial steps of FA metabolism. We identified three enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism, <italic>acsl-1, acsl-2</italic> and <italic>pla2,</italic> that are expressed in the gut as well as in epidermal progeny cells and the mature epidermis. Taken together, the presence of multiple metabolic genes co-expressed in <italic>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </italic> cells and their progeny suggests that despite these cells being in a temporal stage transitioning to mature epidermal cells, they may also play a dual functional/physiological role in planarian homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Epidermal integrity and feedback regulation</title><p>Epithelia are a hallmark of multicellular organisms, forming the interface between the organism and the external environment and lining the cavities and surfaces of organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donati and Watt, 2015</xref>). The planarian epidermis provides the first response to amputation-induced injury by covering up the wound site within 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004</xref>). It has been postulated that rhabdites are released at wound sites, where their contents produce a protective mucosal covering, possibly providing immunological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reisinger and Kelbetz, 1964</xref>). Therefore, a breach in epidermal integrity could be the stimulus for initiating regeneration, though how this signal could be transduced to neoblasts is unknown.</p><p>The <italic>egr-5</italic>(RNAi) phenotype resulting in the expansion of neoblasts and multiple progenitor populations reveals that complex dynamics are at play between differentiating progeny and how neoblasts respond to loss of tissue integrity. It will be interesting to investigate the neoblast response in other RNAi or pharmacological contexts that directly affect epidermal integrity to determine how these perturbations affect neoblast function. However, it still remains possible that neoblast expansion could be a response to the global increase in apoptosis, although we still do not understand how the processes of cell proliferation and cell death are integrated. Alternatively, <italic>egr-5</italic> may be responsible for the expression of a signaling molecule to which neoblasts respond in a feedback control process. Feedback signaling from differentiating progeny to neoblasts may be an important and robust strategy to control stem cell activity during homeostasis and regeneration. Therefore, unveiling the downstream targets of <italic>egr-5</italic> will help discern these possibilities, as well as provide more mechanistic insight on the role of <italic>egr-5</italic> and the progression of epidermal fate maturation.</p><p>Several key questions emerge from our findings. Why does epidermal lineage progression require multiple transition states? Do neoblast progeny contribute to the dynamics of the microenvironment, thereby playing a niche-like role? How are cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms coupled for the maintenance of cellular equilibrium at the organismal level? How is the overall physiological status of the animal sensed, integrated and converted to the appropriate neoblast output? With a more nuanced understanding of their adaptive behavior, planarian neoblasts and the epidermal lineage have emerged as an important model system in which to study the dynamics between stem cell self-renewal and the orchestration of progeny differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Planarian maintenance and irradiation exposure</title><p><italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> CIW4 asexual strain was maintained in 1X Montjuic salts supplemented with 50 μg/ml Gentamicin and fed homogenized calf liver paste as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gurley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reddien et al., 2005a</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Yukiko Yamashita, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study addresses an important topic of the molecular mechanisms controlling fate transitions among post-mitotic cells. This paper makes a significant contribution to our understanding of epidermal differentiation in planarians. It identifies many useful new markers for characterizing this process, in particular <italic>egr-5</italic> as a gene required for maturation of post-mitotic progenitors forming epidermis. The paper is well written, and the data are presented beautifully.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As the authors point out, other prior work made significant contributions to understanding epidermal differentiation in planarians, and so it is an overstatement to claim (in the Abstract, title, and other locations in the text) that this study establishes the planarian epidermis as a model for studying differentiation. The title in particular should be changed to reflect the precise major contributions this study makes well (implication of <italic>egr-5</italic> in control of post-mitotic cell maturation in epidermal differentiation).</p><p>2) Need of additional evidence in support of the model that epidermal defects trigger a wound response. At the moment, this great idea is based on the expression of a single marker, <italic>delta-1</italic> a known wound-responsive gene. Because the role of <italic>delta-1</italic> in the planarian epidermis has not been reported, it is possible that <italic>delta</italic> could also be activated based on a role it plays in epidermal differentiation. The authors should strengthen this hypothesis by qPCR experiments (or other means) to measure whether other wound-response genes are also upregulated after <italic>egr-5</italic> RNAi. Are wound-response genes upregulated in their <italic>chd4</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> (RNAi) datasets? As there is no functional evidence showing that a loss of epidermal integrity in <italic>egr5</italic> RNAi leads to global proliferation/apoptosis, in parallel to conducting some of the critical and feasible experiments. We also recommend toning down the language, if necessary, depending on how much the claim can be strengthened with additional experiments that are feasible and within the scope of revision.</p><p>3) Lineage hierarchy described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is not entirely supported by the experimental data. There are a few straightforward experiments that can be done to strengthen this model. Also, the authors could soften the conclusion where the straightforward experiments are not possible. Several examples of possible experiments: Does <italic>zfp-1</italic> RNAi reduce <italic>zpuf-6</italic> and <italic>vim-3</italic> expression? How does the <italic>zfp-1</italic> RNAi RNA-seq dataset compare with the <italic>p53</italic> RNAi and <italic>chd4</italic> RNAi datasets (were <italic>egr-5</italic> and <italic>zpuf-6</italic> previously identified in that dataset)?

Accordingly, we have changed the title of the manuscript to reflect the specific findings reported in the manuscript. It now reads: “<italic>Egr-5</italic> is a post-mitotic regulator of planarian epidermal differentiation.” We have also modified the wording in the Abstract and other locations in the text to indicate that our results further support, the utility of the planarian epidermis as a model for the molecular study of post-mitotic differentiation.</p><p><italic>2) Need of additional evidence in support of the model that epidermal defects trigger a wound response. At the moment, this great idea is based on the expression of a single marker,</italic> delta-1 <italic>a known wound-responsive gene.

As suggested, we performed WISH to look at the expression of 3 additional wound-induced genes that have been previously reported, including <italic>egr-3, fos-1</italic> and <italic>jun-1</italic>, which are homologs of the “immediate early genes.” All of these genes exhibit increased expression in <italic>egr-5</italic>(RNAi) animals at day 21 of RNAi treatment compared to controls. However, <italic>follistatin</italic>, a gene that is specifically induced in response to the loss of tissue, does not show an increase in expression in <italic>egr-5</italic>(RNAi) animals, which is expected since no tissue has been removed. Accordingly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and the accompanying texts have been modified to include these additional wound-induced genes (showing day 21 only).</p><p>We also examined the same 5 wound-induced genes in our <italic>chd4</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> RNAi data sets and found that <italic>egr-3, fos-1</italic> and <italic>jun-1</italic> were all significantly up-regulated through multiple time points of RNAi treatment. We added a plot of log2 ratios of these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>. We argue that the activation of multiple wound-induced genes in <italic>egr-5, chd4</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> RNAi conditions support our hypothesis that defects in epidermal differentiation and/or loss of epidermal progeny lead to a loss of epidermal integrity, which may trigger a global wound response. However, because we do not have functional data to support that defects in epidermal integrity specifically induce proliferation/apoptosis (we believe this is beyond the scope of this paper), we have also toned down the language of our conclusion (the last sentence of the Results).</p><p><italic>3) Lineage hierarchy described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is not entirely supported by the experimental data. There are a few straightforward experiments that can be done to strengthen this model. Also, the authors could soften the conclusion where the straightforward experiments are not possible.

What is the phenotype of</italic> zpuf-6 <italic>RNAi animals? Do</italic> egr-5 <italic>RNAi animals lose or fail to form</italic> nb22.12e/laminB<italic>-expressing cells?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting these experiments in order to strengthen our lineage hierarchy model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Using whole-mount ISH, both <italic>zpuf-6</italic> and <italic>vim-3</italic> expression are reduced in <italic>zfp-1</italic>(RNAi) animals, and this is already shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A</xref> (bottom row). Both <italic>zpuf-6</italic> and <italic>egr-5</italic> were identified in the <italic>zfp-1</italic>(RNAi) RNA-seq datasets, which substantiates our whole-worm RNA-seq approach in identifying genes enriched in post-mitotic epidermal progeny.</p><p>There is no discernible phenotype for <italic>zpuf-6</italic>, but that may be due to functional redundancy because we identified multiple novel secreted proteins similar to <italic>zpuf-6</italic> that are also co-expressed in similar cell populations. We have yet to simultaneously knock down all of these novel genes to identify their putative functions, as it is something we are interested in pursuing but will also require the development of additional assays. Momentarily, <italic>zpuf-6</italic> acts a useful marker that highlights an abundant epidermal post-mitotic cell population spanning both the mesenchyme and the epidermis.</p><p>We agree that evidence demonstrating the failure to form <italic>NB.22.1E/lamin</italic>B cells in <italic>egr-5</italic>(RNAi) animals would strengthen our lineage hierarchy model. Therefore, we quantified the number of <italic>laminB+</italic> cells in the anterior region because we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> (submitted version) that these anterior cells turnover more rapidly than cells in the posterior. We found that there is a significant reduction of <italic>laminB</italic>+ cells in <italic>egr-5</italic>(RNAi) animals compared to controls at 21d of RNAi treatment. These data are presented as an additional figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4</xref>) and the corresponding text has been added to the subsection “<italic>egr-5</italic> is a regulator of post-mitotic epidermal lineage fate specification”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
