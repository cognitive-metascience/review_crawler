Existing anti-tuberculous therapies require long treatments and are complicated by multi-drug-resistant strains. Host-directed therapies have been proposed as an orthogonal approach, but few have moved into clinical trials. Here, we use the zebrafish-<italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> infection model as a whole-animal screening platform to identify FDA-approved, host-directed compounds. We identify multiple compounds that modulate host immunity to limit mycobacterial disease, including the inexpensive, safe, and widely used drug clemastine. We find that clemastine alters macrophage calcium transients through potentiation of the purinergic receptor P2RX7. Host-directed drug activity in zebrafish larvae depends on both P2RX7 and inflammasome signaling. Thus, targeted activation of a P2RX7 axis provides a novel strategy for enhanced control of mycobacterial infections. Using a novel explant model, we find that clemastine is also effective within the complex granulomas that are the hallmark of mycobacterial infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group

2017, with around 10 million new active cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">World Health Organization, 2018</xref>). The continued difficulty in treatment arises, in large part, from long and relatively complex treatment regimens, currently requiring at least 6 months of treatment with multiple antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">World Health Organization, 2018</xref>). Failures in treatment and poor patient adherence have driven the emergence of drug-resistant strains that present further therapeutic and public health challenges. Host-directed therapies (HDTs) are a new conceptual approach designed to enhance host-mediated clearance of bacteria or limit immunopathology rather than targeting bacterial processes directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clatworthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hawn et al., 2013</xref>). By targeting host processes, HDTs present an orthogonal approach to existing antibiotics. Notably, they avoid the danger of commonly arising bacterial mutations that eliminate binding of the drug to a bacterial target. Although a number of potential HDTs for tuberculosis (TB) have been identified in cell-culture-based models and directed animal studies, few have advanced to clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clatworthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hawn et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The complex lifestyle of <italic>Mtb</italic> renders it particularly amenable to host-directed therapies at multiple points in its lifecycle, providing a number of druggable host targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stanley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sundaramurthy et al., 2013</xref>). Once inside host macrophages, <italic>Mtb</italic> evades and exploits macrophage-specific defense mechanisms, induces formation of characteristic aggregates called granulomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagán and Ramakrishnan, 2018</xref>), and can persist in the face of an active immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Philips and Ernst, 2012</xref>). Virulent mycobacteria actively evade a number of cell-autonomous defense pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Philips and Ernst, 2012</xref>); mycobacteria have been reported to inhibit phagolysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tan and Russell, 2015</xref>), manipulate cell death pathways for their own survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Srinivasan et al., 2014</xref>), mediate resistance to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nambi et al., 2015</xref>), as well as survive at low pH in fully acidified phagolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levitte et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, pathogenic mycobacteria reside within specialized host structures called granulomas, a unique niche in which bacterial populations are recalcitrant to killing due to changes in bacterial physiology as well as reduced immune cell and antibiotic access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dartois, 2014</xref>). Most broad screens for host-directed therapies have been limited to cell culture. While providing insight into cell-autonomous activities of potential host-directed drugs, cell culture platforms lack the multicellular interactions and complex environment present during mycobacterial disease in vivo.</p><p>Zebrafish are natural hosts of <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic>, one of the closest relatives of the <italic>Mtb</italic> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tobin and Ramakrishnan, 2008</xref>). <italic>M. marinum</italic> and <italic>Mtb</italic> share conserved virulence loci and induce similar host immune responses and pathology, including the formation of granulomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis et al., 2002</xref>). Genes identified in zebrafish as determinants of mycobacterial disease progression have also been associated with disease severity and outcome in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thuong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tobin et al., 2012</xref>). Because zebrafish larvae are optically transparent, both pathogen and host processes can be imaged in vivo in a natural host. <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection of larval zebrafish recapitulates key aspects of tuberculosis pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, the zebrafish larva’s small size and relative permeability to small molecules allow for chemical genetic screening in the context of whole animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacRae and Peterson, 2015</xref>). Here, we used the zebrafish-<italic>M. marinum</italic> model to perform a chemical screen in whole animals for host-directed therapies during mycobacterial infection.</p><p>We identify a number of host-directed therapies with in vivo efficacy against mycobacterial infection. Among these is clemastine, a well-tolerated, broadly available, FDA-approved drug. We report that, in zebrafish, clemastine acts in vivo to enhance mycobacterial control via potentiation of the purinergic receptor P2rx7. Using light-sheet microscopy, we find that clemastine-induced potentiation of P2rx7 drives increased calcium transients within infected macrophages in vivo. P2rx7 potentiation enhances inflammasome activation, resulting in restriction of mycobacterial growth in zebrafish larvae. Finally, using a novel granuloma explant model, we show that clemastine is an effective host-directed therapy in the context of granulomas from established mycobacterial infections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An in vivo chemical screen uncovers six novel HDTs for mycobacterial infection</title><p>To identify novel host-directed therapies that reduce mycobacterial burden in vivo, we screened the 1200 FDA-approved drugs of the Prestwick Chemical Library using zebrafish larvae infected with fluorescent <italic>M. marinum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In a secondary screen of these potential hits, we found that 23 of the 51 compounds identified resulted in reduced bacterial burdens in a second set of in vivo infections, and these 23 compounds were selected for further analysis. To distinguish between drugs that directly target bacteria and those that have host-dependent effects, we treated <italic>M. marinum</italic> cultures with each compound and monitored bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Three compounds, each previously reported to have antimicrobial activity, exhibited direct anti-mycobacterial activity at the concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>), validating our ability to recapitulate the effect of known anti-tubercular drugs in an in vivo model. A known antibiotic, sulfamethazine, was not effective at 5 µM in broth culture, but was effective in vivo, suggesting that in vivo distribution kinetics and/or metabolism may enhance potency. Thus, the whole animal drug screening approach was able to identify antibiotics that are effective in vivo but might be missed in screens of axenic cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Due to the known antimicrobial function of sulfamethazine, we did not consider it further as a potential host-directed therapy. The Prestwick Chemical Library contains additional antimycobacterial agents that did not emerge as hits; however, a number of these compounds are ineffective in zebrafish larvae at the 5 µM concentration used during our screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takaki et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Because host-directed therapies may provide new approaches to TB treatment, we focused on the subset of drugs with host-dependent activity. The 19 compounds that reduced bacterial burden in vivo but not in culture were obtained from independent sources and tested in larger cohorts. Of these 19 potential host-directed compounds, 9 resulted in consistently reduced bacterial burdens in three independent in vivo experiments but had no effect on bacterial growth in liquid broth culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, these nine drugs met all criteria for host-dependent therapies effective in reducing burden in whole animals over 5 days of infection. One of the nine, prothionamide, appeared to be host-dependent at the concentration tested but is likely not host-directed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>); prothionamide is a pro-drug that can be metabolized into active anti-mycobacterial forms by both bacteria and host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishida and Ortiz de Montellano, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Of the remaining eight compounds we identified as likely to be host-directed therapies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–J</xref>), one drug, desipramine, had been described previously as a potential HDT; it is proposed to act through inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase, which has been implicated in necroptosis and the response to mycobacterial infection in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roca and Ramakrishnan, 2013</xref>). Chlorpromazine is known to inhibit acid sphingomyelinase, although it also has reported anti-mycobacterial activity in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amaral et al., 2007</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, none of the six remaining compounds had previously been considered as a potential host-directed therapy for mycobacterial infection. We chose to focus on the most potent of these, clemastine, an inexpensive, widely available, over-the-counter antihistamine.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Clemastine is a host-directed compound that requires host macrophages to reduce bacterial growth</title><p>We found that clemastine consistently reduced mycobacterial growth in vivo over the course of a 5-day infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>).

We therefore wanted to rule out the explanation that clemastine’s effect was merely dependent on burden. In order to test whether clemastine is effective on infections with lower bacterial load, we infected larval zebrafish with a second attenuated mycobacterial strain. We found that <italic>M. marinum</italic> transposon mutants in the gene <italic>cmaA2</italic>, which encodes a trans-cyclopropane synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glickman et al., 2001</xref>), were attenuated in the zebrafish model. Despite a burden comparable to the ∆RD1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), clemastine still was able to reduce bacterial load, suggesting that the RD1-dependent effect was not merely due to differences in burden.</p><p>Reciprocally, when we increased the inoculum of ∆RD1 mutant bacteria above wildtype levels, clemastine is still ineffective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This was true using independent measures of bacterial burden at five dpi including fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and 16S rRNA-based measures of burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Additionally, we examined early control of bacterial growth in ∆RD1 infections. During the first 24 hr of infection, clemastine reduced the number of WT bacteria per macrophage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>) but failed to reduce the number of bacteria per macrophage in the ∆RD1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data are consistent with a model in which clemastine efficacy requires a host defense pathway dependent on cytosolic engagement, regardless of bacterial load.</p><p>Given the ∆RD1 result, <italic>p2rx7</italic> dependence, and the links to calcium signaling and inflammasome activation, we next directly tested whether inflammasome activation might be required downstream of P2rx7 activation to promote mycobacterial restriction. We focused on the common adaptor ASC, which is required for inflammasome assembly in humans, mice, and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</xref>). We generated <italic>asc</italic> mutant zebrafish (zebrafish gene name <italic>pycard</italic>) using TALEN technology and generated a 14 base pair deletion allele, <italic>pycard<sup>w216</sup></italic>, in the first exon of the zebrafish <italic>asc</italic> orthologue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), resulting in a premature stop codon. As in mice, ASC-deficient animals do not exhibit dramatically increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Animals had similar burdens at five dpi, similar numbers of infection foci, and displayed no gross differences during mycobacterial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, while clemastine reduced burden in wildtype and heterozygous sibling control animals, it was completely ineffective in zebrafish <italic>asc</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). These results are consistent with a model in which inflammasome activation may be limited during infection with pathogenic mycobacteria, but enhancement can lead to increased bacterial killing.</p><p>To rule out the possibility that the clemastine effect was mediated via a previously reported connection between P2RX7 and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mawatwal et al., 2017</xref>), we tested the effect of clemastine on autophagy in vivo during mycobacterial infection. We made use of the zebrafish reporter line <italic>Tg(hCMV-GFP:Lc3)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2009</xref>). In this line, GFP-positive puncta are indicative of autophagosomes and can be enumerated during infection and treatment with DMSO or clemastine. Using spinning disk confocal microscopy, we observed that clemastine treatment does not enhance the number or frequency of LC3-decorated mycobacteria over the course of three days of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These findings are in agreement with the observed lack of change in acidification of mycobacteria, suggesting that autophagy is not the host-directed mechanism through which clemastine reduces bacterial burden in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Clemastine is effective in established infections</title><p>We next examined whether clemastine was an effective host-directed therapy in established infections and whether it could function therapeutically in more complex, established granulomas.

Clemastine-treated granulomas had a nearly 10-fold reduction in luminescence relative to control granulomas after 6 days of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>), suggesting that the effect size may be greater than that observed by fluorescence-based readouts. To ensure that clemastine did not quench bioluminescent signals, we treated <italic>M. marinum:Lux</italic> with clemastine in broth culture and saw no effect on luminescence compared to DMSO carrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Thus, clemastine has substantial efficacy as a host-directed therapy both in larvae and in more complex, established granulomas.</p><p>To further validate the readout of luminescence and fluorescence in the Myco-GEM model, we plated individual granulomas for colony forming units (CFU). We found that clemastine treatment significantly reduced CFU by ~ 1.4 log<sub>10</sub> (~ 27 fold) compared to vehicle-exposed granulomas after a week of Myco-GEM culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>Host-directed therapies will likely be used as adjunctive therapies in the context of antibiotic treatment.

Humans require multi-drug regimens and prolonged duration of treatment for active disease, increasing the risk for inadequate or discontinued treatments and the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Multi-drug resistant strains (which require 9–24 months of treatment, including use of an injectable agent) were responsible for an estimated 480,000 new TB cases in 2014, with an estimated treatment failure rate of 46% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">World Health Organization, 2018</xref>). Thus, new treatment strategies are urgently needed.</p><p>We performed a 1200 compound chemical genetic screen of FDA-approved drugs for host-directed therapies against mycobacterial infection using a whole animal platform. Large drug screens in whole animals would be extremely challenging in other vertebrates, but the small size, relative permeability, and fecundity of zebrafish enable high-throughput chemical screens.</p><p>Using the zebrafish model, we were able to identify in vivo activity of the drug clemastine on the purinergic receptor P2rx7 during mycobacterial infection in zebrafish. We established transgenic lines to monitor calcium dynamics within macrophages during mycobacterial infection in vivo and found complex patterns of calcium transients. Interestingly, the frequency of calcium transients in zebrafish macrophages is similar to what has been reported for infected <italic>Drosophila</italic> macrophages in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weavers et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We identified an important moonlighting activity for clemastine in mycobacterial infection: potentiation of the purinergic receptor, P2RX7. That target, P2RX7, has been implicated in a variety of inflammatory and immune processes; its activation can result in bacterial killing in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coutinho-Silva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fairbairn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Santos et al., 2013</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Virgilio et al., 2017</xref>).

However, we did not see enhancement of autophagy in clemastine-treated animals, suggesting that this is not clemastine’s mode of action. Intriguingly, polymorphisms in the P2RX7 receptor have been associated with TB susceptibility in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu et al., 2014</xref>) and functional changes contribute to TB pathogenesis in some cell culture models but have given divergent results in different mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amaral et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Myers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Santos et al., 2013</xref>). In cell culture, P2RX7 activation enhances mycobacterial killing in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Placido et al., 2006</xref>), and these findings are consistent with our in vivo data with clemastine and P2RX7 activation.</p><p>Here, however, the in vivo drug screen uncovered a novel approach to modulating P2RX7 during mycobacterial infection. While previous studies have focused on the effects of loss of function of P2RX7, we show that direct potentiation of the channel enhances host control of infection. In addition, rather than constitutive activation, this mechanism avoids potential off-site detrimental effects. Potentiation of an ATP-responsive channel rather than constitutive activation thus represents a more nuanced approach to enhancing the host immune response and may avoid problems associated with excessive or inappropriate macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2016</xref>). Supporting the notion of a localized and infection-specific effect of the drug, only infected cells exhibited increased calcium transients during clemastine treatment.</p><p>P2RX7 activation has been strongly linked to inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Virgilio, 2007</xref>), but there is divergent evidence for the precise roles of inflammasome signaling during mycobacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briken et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayer-Barber et al., 2010</xref>). In mycobacterial mutants lacking ESX-1, there is a drastic reduction in IL-1B production in vitro, with effects on the AIM2 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wassermann et al., 2015</xref>). Others have shown that non-virulent mycobacteria increase inflammasome activation compared to virulent strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shah et al., 2013</xref>). We showed that clemastine is ineffective against mycobacteria lacking the ESX-1 locus, leading us to initially explore the hypothesis that inflammasome signaling might be required for clemastine’s effect in vivo.</p><p>To test this directly, we developed and assessed a zebrafish mutant that lacks the critical adaptor protein Asc. Consistent with findings in mice, the zebrafish <italic>asc</italic> larvae had no significant differences in mycobacterial burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayer-Barber et al., 2010</xref>). However, mutations in other key inflammasome genes enhance susceptibility to mycobacterial infections in animal models, indicating that inflammasomes can be involved in host protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fremond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Juffermans et al., 2000</xref>). Notably, we show that clemastine is completely ineffective in inflammasome-deficient animals, supporting a model in which inflammasome signaling can be host-beneficial. Thus, inflammasome activation through P2rx7 potentiation may enhance mycobacterial killing, potentially by overcoming bacterially mediated inhibition. While excess stimulation of inflammasome signaling has also been shown to be host-detrimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mishra et al., 2013</xref>), there may be differences between a more nuanced and localized potentiation of the P2RX7 response to ATP and more general enhancement of inflammasome activation.</p><p>As FDA-approved compounds, drugs identified using this approach have the potential to move quickly into the clinic. Indeed, the most promising compound identified in our screen, clemastine, is inexpensive, widely available, and has few known safety risks. Clemastine recently showed promise in a clinical trial for patients with multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Green et al., 2017</xref>), and – due to its safety profile – would be a prime candidate for low-risk/high-reward studies in humans.</p><p>Clemastine is effective both in early infections in zebrafish larvae and in longer term, established infections. Using a granuloma explant model, we found improved control of mycobacterial infection, suggesting therapeutic efficacy in established infections and within complex granulomas, the key host-pathogen interface in mycobacterial infections across natural host species. Taken together, these data suggest a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) in which clemastine reduces intracellular bacterial burden through potentiation of the purinergic receptor P2rx7 to induce inflammasome activation in both nascent and established mycobacterial infections. Thus, modulation of a P2RX7 inflammasome axis is a promising avenue for host-directed therapies against mycobacterial infection in established disease. Further understanding of the mechanistic basis for P2RX7-mediated mycobacterial control, as well as ways in which inflammasome activation can be modulated at discrete points in infection, may lead to new approaches to host-directed therapies.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39123.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model describing clemastine as a host-directed drug against mycobacterial infection in both nascent and established infections.</title><p>Clemastine potentiates the purinergic channel, P2rx7, to increase calcium transients within infected macrophages.

One track, emission selection: 488/498 (GFP) and 560/571 (tdTomato). Light-sheet thickness was 4.32 microns with a continuous drive, 1x zoom, dual side illumination. For these experiments, two dpf zebrafish larvae <italic>Tg(mfap4:GCaMP6F)<sup>xt25</sup></italic> and <italic>p2rx7<sup>xt26</sup>;Tg(mfap4:GCaMP6F)<sup>xt25</sup></italic> were infected as described and treated with DMSO or clemastine at four hpi. One to 2 hr post-treatment, larvae were placed in 1.5% low-melting point agarose, supplemented with 80 μg/ml tricaine and either 0.5% DMSO or 5 µM clemastine fumarate (Sigma-Aldrich SML0445) in a 3 mm OD glass capillary. A dual-colored z-stack was acquired every 8.8 s, collecting 80 z-steps, using a z-step size of 1 μm for 30 min.</p><p>Light-sheet videos were projected as maximum intensities and analyzed using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rueden et al., 2017</xref>). Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined as single macrophages that expressed baseline levels of green fluorescence by GCaMP6 and flashed at least once over the course of the video. Macrophages outside of the caudal hematopoietic tissue were excluded. Only individual flashes were counted, not coordinated flashes during which every macrophage, infected and uninfected, underwent a calcium flash simultaneously. If the macrophage was not in frame for the entire 30 min, it was not included in the analysis. Quantitative analyses of macrophage calcium flashes were performed blind to the treatment type and genetic identity of the specimens under observation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Adult infections and granuloma explants</title><p>Adult zebrafish (&gt;2 months old) were infected as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oehlers et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, adult fish (&gt;2 months old) were anesthetized by immersion in 100 μg/mL tricaine and injected intraperitoneally with 300 CFU of <italic>Mm:mCerulean</italic> or <italic>Mm:tdTomato</italic> using insulin needles (BD 08290-3284-38). Adult fish were kept in 1L tanks in a dedicated infection incubator with light/dark cycles at 28°C, with water changes and feeding every day. Between two and four weeks post-infection, granulomas were harvested using a Myco-GEM method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cronan et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, after adult fish are euthanized with a lethal dose of tricaine, the body cavity is exposed in sterile L15 medium (Gibco 21083–027). Granulomas can be dissected out with forceps or gently removed by a glass pipette. Granulomas are serially washed in sterile L15 and size-matched for treatment groups. The bottom of an optical-bottom 96-well plate (GBO 55090) is covered with 40 μL of 5 μg/mL Matrigel Matrix (Corning 354262), in L15. Granulomas are embedded in 2.5-dimensional top media with a final concentration of 5% FBS (Sigma 2442), and 1 μg/mL Matrigel matrix (Corning 354262) in L15 (Gibco 21083–027) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cronan et al., 2018</xref>). The top and bottom media are supplemented with either DMSO (0.5%) or clemastine (5 μM in 0.5% DMSO). Granulomas are imaged via microscopy at d0 and 5 days post-treatment (dpt) using epifluorescence microscopy on an inverted Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope and on a spinning disk confocal (Andor). <italic>M. marinum:Lux</italic> granulomas were imaged daily as described below. Image acquisition and analyses were performed blind to the genotype of the granulomas.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Bioluminescence assay</title><p>For this assay, we used a bioluminescent reporter strain of <italic>M. marinum</italic> (<italic>Mm</italic>-Lux) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cronan et al.

Adult zebrafish were infected as described above and granuloma explants cultured in the same methods as described above but were kept in white 96-well cell culture microplates (GBO 675098) and luminescence was determined using an EnSpire 2300 Multilabel Plate Reader obtained from Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA). Drug treatments were applied in the same fashion as fluorescence assays, with drug added to both bottom media and top media.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Flow cytometry and FLICA staining of granuloma explants</title><p>For all flow cytometry experiments, we cultured granuloma explants as described above for 48 hr in the presence of 0.5% DMSO or 5 µM clemastine. Granulomas were rinsed in sterile L15 and PBS. Following manufacturer’s directions, 660-FLICA Caspase Assay (Immunochemistry Technologies ICT097) was reconstituted with 50 µL 100% DMSO to make 150X stock. This stock was aliquoted into single use tubes and kept at −20°C and not freeze-thawed more than once. Just prior to use, the 150X stock was diluted 1:5 in PBS to make 30X stock. Grouped granulomas (~10 per group) were placed in 1.5 mL tubes with 97 µL PBS and 3 µL of 30 × 660 FLICA stock. Granulomas were kept at 28°C for 1 hr. Granulomas were washed in 1X apoptosis buffer and spun at 1200xg for 1 min three times. Granulomas were resuspended in 1 mL 0.05% trypsin in 1X EDTA (ThermoFisher Scientific, 25300) and kept on a nutator for 40 min at 30°C. Granulomas were centrifuged for 5 min at 300xg and rinsed with 1 mL 5% FBS in PBS three times, gently pipetting off supernatant each time, resuspended in 300 µL 5%FBS in PBS and pipetted over a 30 µm cell strainer (MACS Miltenyi 130-098-458). Single cell suspensions were analyzed on a FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences) using an Apc-Cy7 laser (633 nm) excitation. Data was collected using FACSDiva Software (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo v10 (Treestar).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Colony-forming unit (CFU) assay on granuloma explants</title><p>Granulomas were cultured as described above for up to a week.

Wildtype zebrafish larvae carrying a TNF reporter transgene (<italic>Tg(BAC(tnfa:GFP)<sup>pd1028</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marjoram et al., 2015</xref>) were arrayed in 96-well optical plates (GBO 655090) with three infected and one uninfected fish per well, in 200 µL of E3 + PTU and 5 µM of each chemical. First and last rows of each plate were maintained as 0.5% DMSO controls. Each plate contained 80 drugs, with 15 plates in all. Burden was assayed by fluorescence area and mean intensity of fluorescent mycobacteria at five dpi. In the secondary screen, hits were screened again in the same format (three infected fish, one uninfected fish) and drugs that continued to reduce bacterial fluorescence area and mean intensity were tested again in a tertiary screen with 20 fish per group, with DMSO-treated fish as control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Determination of relative <italic>M. marinum</italic> burden by 16S rRNA qRT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from each group of larvae using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific 15596026).

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Amy Barczak (Reviewer #4).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Reviewers generally expressed enthusiasm for the elegant study design and clear and logical presentation. They noted the novel and interesting in vivo imaging methods, applied in a creative way to assess host directed effects. There was also enthusiasm for attempts made to determine the mode of action for clemastine. However, there were several notable shortfalls that preclude publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. These include the relatively marginal effect of clemastine, lack of clarity regards statistical evaluation and significance, no attempts to correlate florescent readouts with CFUs, and notable weaknesses in the inflammasome activation component of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their submission, the authors describe a study that uses zebra fish, at the transparent larval stage, to search for new host directed therapies (HDTs) for tuberculosis. They start by screening 1200 FDA approved drugs in a survival assay, with Mycobacterium marinum-infected in zebra fish, with a reduction in bacterial load as the measured outcome, and identify 23 promising candidates for further study. They focus on a subset of compounds that have host-directed activity rather than direct bactericidal activity per se and settle on further characterising clemastine, as it is inexpensive and widely available. The authors demonstrate that during infection with <italic>M. marinum</italic> in zebra fish, clemastine was able to reduce bacterial burdens in infect larvae in a dose-dependent manner. Given that this compound had no demonstrable antibacterial activity, this clearance was attributed the host-directed effects of clemastine. To further probe what aspect of host metabolism this drug disturbed, the authors treated infected larvae that lack macrophages, using an <italic>irf8</italic> mutant that is unable to generate macrophages. In this case, bacterial burdens were higher and clemastine had no effect, suggesting that clemastine targeted macrophage function. To dissect these effects in vivo, the authors conducted imaging of infected zebrafish where macrophages and bacteria were labelled with differentiating colours and demonstrate that clemastine reduced the intra-macrophage bacterial load. Next, the authors probe whether clemastine affects phagosome acidification and report no significant difference in acidification upon clemastine treatment. To further study the effects of clemastine on host cells, the authors assess its effect on the P2RX7 receptor. They generate mutant larvae defective for domains of this receptor and combine this with a calcium reporter, followed by the use of light sheet microscopy to study real-time calcium dynamics in vivo. Using this approach, the authors demonstrate that clemastine treatment results in an increase of calcium flashes, an effect that was abrogated in P2RX7 mutants. Consistent with this, clemastine had negligible activity in P2RX7 mutants, an observation further augmented with experiment using a P2RX7 inhibitor. Following these observations, the authors then assess the effect of clemastine on inflammasome activation by using an RD1 mutant of <italic>M. marinum</italic>, that lacks the specialized secretion apparatus required for mycobacterial interaction with host inflammation pathways. Clemastine had no effect in this case. To further probe inflammasome activation, the authors use a mutant defective in Asc, the adaptor required for inflammasome activation, and clemastine was ineffective in this background. Finally, the authors demonstrate that clemastine is effective in mature granuloma explants from adult zebrafish. This is a well-executed, clearly presented study. Some points detract; these are given below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Videos require some detailed annotation and processing to outline the larvae and point out the bacteria, sometimes it's hard to figure out what is happening. More detailed legends would be useful. The stills in the Supplementary information do help, but without these the videos are not really useful and perhaps should be replaced by a series of more closely spliced still images. This is especially applicable with the calcium flashes, where it is harder to compare the rates of flashing to the control. Some thought should be given to this. Perhaps creating a composite movie of the control and clemastine treated fish side-by-side would be useful?</p><p>2) Confirmation of the various mutants generated in zebrafish seems to be missing; either Southern blot or Western blots indicating that protein domains were removed.

After counter-screening pathogen-targeting molecules, they select and confirm Clemastine as the most potent host-directed candidate, and go on to decipher its mechanism of action, showing that macrophages are required, and that clemastine acts as an agonist of the P2RX7 receptor leading to increased intracellular calcium flashes which in turn activate the inflammasome known to control bacterial growth. The manuscript is very clearly written, the research strategy follows a logical flow and the experiments are thoroughly executed; the concern mostly lies in the size of the clemastine effect.

This is best illustrated by Figure 2B and 2F where the visual impression doesn't clearly convey the message. While the burden is higher in macrophage-free zebrafish, the clemastine effect or lack thereof can't be assessed from these images.</p><p>In the Discussion section, could the authors mention and comment on the recent paper by Mawatwal et al., (2017): &quot;Calcimycin mediates mycobacterial killing by inducing intracellular calcium-regulated autophagy in a P2RX7 dependent manner&quot;. What are the implications of their findings in the context of this study?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors describe an in vivo whole animal screen of 1200 FDA-approved drugs to identify novel host-directed therapeutics with activity against mycobacteria. They identify clemastine as a drug that restricts replication of the zebrafish pathogen Mycobacterium marinum in vivo (but not in broth). Although clemastine is better known as an anti-histamine, the efficacy of the drug in vivo is proposed to be due to 'off-target' agonism of the fish P2RX7 ion channel that results in a protective response involving activation of a host immune 'inflammasome' pathway.</p><p>There are several nice aspects to the work. The manuscript is well written, and the data are logically and clearly presented. To my knowledge, this is the first in vivo screen for anti-mycobacterial drugs. This is significant because compounds with in vitro efficacy often fail in vivo. In addition, the authors also take advantage of the optical transparency of zebrafish embryos to perform some nice imaging analyses of infected animals, particularly the calcium flux experiments in Figure 3.</p><p>Despite these positive aspects, I have two major reservations about the potential impact of the work: (1) the effects observed are small and some of the statistical interpretations are problematic (see below); and (2) although the authors propose their observations are relevant to human tuberculosis, I do not find this sufficiently convincing in the absence of experiments with the actual human pathogen (<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>) in mammals with lungs and adaptive immunity (which is absent in the embryos used here). In addition, mammalian/<italic>Mtb</italic> models often use survival or at least animal health as an endpoint 'gold standard', whereas only bacterial burdens are shown in the present manuscript. Because I suspect there will be some sensitivity with respect to this point, I should be clear that I am not saying the zebrafish is a poor model for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lung infections; it may or may not be, and whether it is or not likely differs in different scenarios. I am merely saying that the relevance has not been established in this specific case, and this is a problem because such relevance is one of the authors' major claims for the significance of their work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The magnitude of the effects of clemastine are very modest and appears to vary from experiment to experiment. The effect in Figure 2 is said to be approximately ~60% reduction (i.e., ~2-fold), but in other experiments (e.g., Figure 5A,B, Figure 6B, etc.), the effect appears to be even less. Obviously, there is no objective threshold that determines when the magnitude of a biological effect is sufficiently large for a journal such as <italic>eLife</italic>. It is a judgment call; and this reviewer's judgment is the magnitude of the effects will affect the impact of this work.</p><p>2) I am having trouble with the way statistics are used to support some of the main claims of the paper. My trouble relates to the difference between showing an observed difference is not significant versus showing that there is no difference. For example, in Figure 4, the authors seek to establish one of the main claims of the paper, namely that the effect of clemastine on bacterial burden is p2rx7 dependent. In fact, I believe what is shown is that there is no evidence that the drug has an effect in p2rx7 knockouts, which is quite a different thing (and could in fact be claimed even if no experiment had been done at all). Indeed, it appears to me that there may be an effect of the drug in p2rx7-deficient animals, even if the difference didn't reach a similar degree of statistical significance as in WT (perhaps due to the lower n?). Instead of reporting that there is no statistically significant effect of the drug in p2rx7 knockouts, I think it would be preferable to arrange the statistical testing in such a way that it is possible to conclude that the effect of the drug (fold restriction of bacterial burdens?) is statistically different in WT vs p2rx7 knockouts. In addition, is the Clemastine+P2RX7+ group significantly different than the Clemastine+P2RX7- group?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>In this work, Matty et al. use a zebrafish model of <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection to screen a bioactive library of small molecules to identify novel host-directed anti-mycobacterial agents. This work is novel in that it represents the first whole organism screening approach to identifying novel anti-TB therapies, and successfully identifies a drug in clinical use for other indications that has not previously been identified as restricting mycobacterial growth. Although antimycobacterial activity is not likely through its primary annotated target, the authors then identify a probable target and perform genetic studies to validate the target. The interpretation of the RD1 experiment results and presumed link between RD1 and the inflammasome is less convincing, with concerns as detailed below. The inclusion of the ex vivo granuloma model to evaluate longer term drug efficacy is both interesting and novel. Overall the study is well executed and in my opinion merits publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) RD1 data and link to the inflammasome: The authors show that clemastine does not further restrict the growth of an RD1 mutant, which lacks ESX-1 and thus fails to permeabilize the phagosome. This is interpreted as demonstrating that the drug only has efficacy if the bacterium has access to cytosolic contents, which is then used to justify thinking about how the inflammasome might be involved. I think this is problematic on two fronts: (1) An attenuated mutant (the RD1 mutant) might not be further growth-restricted by a host-directed drug for many reasons other than cytosolic access. I think (at minimum) testing the effect of clemastine against an attenuated mutant still able to access the cytosol would be necessary to begin to make that interpretation (2) The logical bridge between the requirement for cytosolic access and inflammasome activation is a weak one. The literature is divided on whether ESX-1 (i.e. cytosolic access of the bacterium) is required for activation of the two inflammasomes shown to be relevant in TB- AIM2 and NLRP3. While older literature suggested that activation of NLRP3 required ESX-1, the paper (PMID: 26048138) that best dissected out the relative contributions of NLRP3 and AIM2 to the overall inflammasome response to TB found that while ESX-1 was required for AIM2 activation, it was not required for NLRP3 activation. Further, permeabilizing the phagosome is known to be required for triggering other pathways, among other effects- to me, even though the ASC mutant data shows clemastine has no effect, there are logical gaps in getting to that experiment. I think the paper would be logically stronger if the RD1 and inflammasome data were removed.</p><p>2) Lack of testing in combination with an established anti-mycobacterial drug: Host acting agents have relatively weak activity against <italic>Mtb</italic> when compared with standard antibiotics and will likely have to be used as adjuncts to other therapeutics. In some cases, drugs with activity against <italic>Mtb</italic> in host cells when used alone have been shown to compromise the activity of standard antibacterial agents when used in combination. An argument can be made that the standard for testing potential novel host-directed agents should include testing together with more standard antibiotics. If this type of model were not already established in the lab, these experiments would potentially go beyond 60 days - in which case I would still support publication of the manuscript without those experiments but would suggest that the potential for different effects in combination/need to test in combinations be addressed in the Discussion section.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Potentiation of P2RX7 as a Host-Directed Strategy for Control of Mycobacterial Infection&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your letter of appeal has been considered by a Senior Editor and a Reviewing editor, and we are prepared to consider a revised submission with no guarantees of acceptance.</p><p>In preparing your revision, we would like to draw your attention to some important points for consideration.</p><p>1) In the absence of rigorous statistical analysis, or the lack of a clear explanation as to how statistics were conducted, small (or even large) changes in a biological system are difficult to contextualize. We encourage you to consider this carefully in your data analysis. Regards statistics, pay particular attention to the correct choice of test to use, usually determined by the nature of the data, parametric versus non-parametric etc. Report these consistently in all figures, provide p-values for all comparisons (include the choice of test each time) and if necessary, include an expanded data analysis section in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>2) Consider more carefully how you would incorporate inflammasome activation as the mechanism into your revision. Reviewers raised several concerns regards the RD1 mutant. However, simply removing it from the study may weaken the mechanism. We encourage you to think further as to how you can address this concern.</p><p>3) We would like to affirm your sentiment that <italic>eLife</italic> values model systems as central to the scholastic pursuit of holistically understanding biological systems. The zebrafish model is no different in this case. However, it falls upon the authors to ensure that data presented in any manuscript are interpreted within the context of said model and not over-extended to humans or any other system without substantiating experiments. Please consider this carefully when preparing your revision and limit the interpretation to the model system that you are using, unless you have supporting/validation data from other systems.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39123.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their submission, the authors describe a study that uses zebra fish, at the transparent larval stage, to search for new host directed therapies (HDTs) for tuberculosis.

To address this concern, we have provided each control and clemastine treatment video set as a split screen movie. We hope that the additional clarification in Video 1 (previously Video 1 and Video 2) shows more clearly that clemastine-treated macrophages display microbicidal activity, and we have added tracking of individual bacteria, marked at the end of the movie with solid or outlined arrowheads, to represent still-present or disappearing bacteria within individual macrophages.</p><p>For the calcium transients and this analysis, which appeared most difficult to discern, we have revamped the presentation in the videos. Video 3 and Video 4 (now Video 2) have been recreated as a split screen video to show that the wildtype and p2rx7 mutant calcium signaling is similar in uninfected animals at baseline, with frame-by-frame annotations for each flash counted. For the calcium video of infected animals (Video 3 and Video 4, previously Videos 5-8), we have also circled or boxed the regions of interest (ROIs) for the infected cells, which were counted for the number of calcium flashes in that cell during the course of the video. The boxes appear when the cell flashes and they are color coded: if a cell flashes only once, its box will be yellow and if a cell flashes more than once, the box will be the same color throughout the video.

Could the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a sentence to comment on this point within the manuscript (Introduction). Briefly, the concentration at which the screen was performed (5 µM) is much lower than the concentration at which these drugs have been shown to have effects in zebrafish, perhaps due to permeability issues (Adams et al., 2011). Indeed, we note as part of the new antibiotic plus clemastine experiments in Figure 6 that the in vivo MIC of a drug like moxifloxacin is substantially higher in the zebrafish model than its in vitro MIC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why use INH at a very high concentration (200 ug/mL) as a positive control since it as little to no activity against non-TB mycobacteria given that it's a prodrug requiring intrabacterial activation?

Therefore, we have included an additional bacterial growth curve to address this, in which we use moxifloxacin at a concentration of 10 µg/mL as a positive control (Figure 6—figure supplement 3B). We also use moxifloxacin in additional new experiments with the granuloma model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The size of the clemastine-mediated effect is rather small (two-fold effect at most across assays, conditions and experiments), triggering a few questions as to the read-outs and statistical analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We point out above that within our model – a slow growing mycobacterium over the five-day infection possible in the zebrafish larva – this represents a fairly large and robust effect size. It is on a par with effect sizes described for host perturbations in a number of other zebrafish-mycobacterium papers over the past 15 years. However, we appreciate this point and, in the course of performing additional experiments, found even larger effects in the adult granuloma explant experiments, as documented in the revised Figure 6.</p><p>We examined burden in the adult granuloma explant model using a variety of assays: fluorescence readout; bioluminescent readout using a <italic>M. marinum lux</italic> strain that we constructed, and CFU plating.</p><p>Overall, in larvae and granuloma explants, the effect size of clemastine treatment was generally between 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> and 1.4 log<sub>10</sub>, or between 3-fold and 27-fold in most experiments. We have also added 16S rRNA-based analysis to complement the fluorescence quantification. In larvae and adult granulomas, we found good concordance with fluorescence values. And CFU assays in the adult granuloma model showed consistent and robust effects of clemastine on mycobacterial burden.</p><p>Finally, to show that clemastine can be combined productively with antibiotics, we have included experiments in ex vivo granulomas in which co-treatment with clemastine makes an antibiotic more effective (Figure 6F). We have also tried to clarify statistical analyses by providing more detailed descriptions of the analyses performed and the p-values presented therein.</p><p><italic>- How do fluorescence units relate to bacterial burden in zebrafish? Has this been calibrated?

To further confirm these findings in our specific studies, we have also provided 16s rRNA qPCR analysis of key experiments, which directly corroborate the findings in fluorescence readouts in larvae (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and Figure 4—figure supplement 2C and Results section). We have further confirmed that the fluorescence readouts in granuloma explant models represent bacterial burden by luminescence (Figure 6D, F and Figure 6—figure supplement 3A, C and Discussion section) and analysis of colony forming units (CFU) (Figure 6E and Materials and methods section). Because these experiments are technically challenging and terminal endpoints, qPCR and CFU are provided for confirmation of fluorescence and luminescence readouts. Bacterial burden by fluorescence is calculated using ImageJ. Images are analyzed for the mean fluorescence and area of fluorescence above a threshold within the zebrafish (as determined by brightfield imaging). This threshold is empirically determined for each experiment (to ensure that every infect animal has a non-zero value) and kept constant between treatments. The product of the mean fluorescence and area is computed and presented as “Mm Fluorescence”. This was not clearly described the initial submission and has been added to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Were the non-transformed or log-transformed fluorescence values used in the statistical analyses? If the latter, could the author also include the p-values of the non-transformed data.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the spread of the data, most bacterial data are presented as log<sub>10</sub>(Mm fluorescence) and statistics are performed on the data presented within each figure, i.e. if a figure shows transformed data, then the p-values shown are from the statistical tests on that data. We have provided statistics performed on both transformed and untransformed values in Supplementary file 2 and Supplementary file 3. In all experiments, the only circumstances under which transforming data changes the p-values are (1) when the variation among standard deviations changes, requiring a different statistical test correction, and (2) when there are values of ‘0’ among the results, as log<sub>10</sub>(0) is undefined. However, after proper thresholding, there were no ‘0’ ‘Mm fluorescence’ values as all animals had some degree of infection (see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In some experiments, the differences between what is declared as statistically significant and what isn't are subtle.

The differences can appear subtle when showing the entire animal as an overlay of fluorescence and brightfield in a single two-dimensional image. We have now added arrowheads to mark the points of infection in each animal, so that the differences between clemastine-treated and control animals should be apparent. We have brightened the images in Figure 2F to contrast the bacteria and brightfield images. The brightening was performed equally as noted in the legend across the clemastine and DMSO-treated wildtype animals, is only for the purpose of better seeing the bacteria above the brightfield image and was not used for quantification. We think that bacterial burden and differences in the clemastine treated groups are now much more easily assessed. As noted within the figure legends, the animals that are used as example images are highlighted in the graph and are at or near the mean for the group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Discussion section, could the authors mention and comment on the recent paper by Mawatwal et al., (2017): &quot;Calcimycin mediates mycobacterial killing by inducing intracellular calcium-regulated autophagy in a P2RX7 dependent manner&quot;. What are the implications of their findings in the context of this study?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the possibility for autophagy to be a mechanism through which clemastine reduces bacterial burden in a calcium-dependent manner. We have added this reference to the Discussion section and Results section as an introduction to a new set of experiments. We have explored the role for clemastine in autophagy-induced killing of mycobacteria in multiple ways and have found that clemastine has no effect on autophagic flux, using a zebrafish line which labels LC-3 puncta with GFP (He et al., 2009). In this line, we observed the same number of GFP: LC-3 puncta decorating intracellular bacteria in DMSO and clemastine-treated animals (Figure 5—figure supplement 2D). We have also observed that clemastine is still effective in zebrafish lacking critical autophagy-related genes, including ATG5, ATG7, ATG12, and Beclin1 (data not shown because these zebrafish mutants were provided to us by collaborators to test but are not yet published). In this case, we think that clemastine’s mechanism of action is independent of autophagy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Despite these positive aspects, I have two major reservations about the potential impact of the work: (1) the effects observed are small and some of the statistical interpretations are problematic (see below); and (2) although the authors propose their observations are relevant to human tuberculosis, I do not find this sufficiently convincing in the absence of experiments with the actual human pathogen (M. tuberculosis) in mammals with lungs and adaptive immunity (which is absent in the embryos used here). In addition, mammalian/Mtb models often use survival or at least animal health as an endpoint 'gold standard', whereas only bacterial burdens are shown in the present manuscript. Because I suspect there will be some sensitivity with respect to this point, I should be clear that I am not saying the zebrafish is a poor model for M. tuberculosis lung infections; it may or may not be, and whether it is or not likely differs in different scenarios. I am merely saying that the relevance has not been established in this specific case, and this is a problem because such relevance is one of the authors' major claims for the significance of their work.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s critique and enthusiasm for the novelty of the in vivo screen for anti-mycobacterial drugs that may be host directed. We have addressed the reviewer’s two major reservations throughout.</p><p>1) Effect size and statistical interpretations.</p><p>We point out above that within our model – a slow growing mycobacterium over the five-day infection possible in the zebrafish larva – this represents a fairly large and robust effect size for a host-directed monotherapy. It is on a par with effect sizes described for host perturbations in a number of other zebrafish-mycobacterium papers over the past 15 years, as well as host perturbations in other animal models. However, we appreciate this point. We note that, in the course of performing additional experiments for this revision, we confirmed the burden differences in a number of independent ways: 16S rRNA analysis; construction of a <italic>lux</italic> bioluminescent strain to measure burden in granuloma explants; and CFU measurement in treated granulomas. We noted even larger effects in the adult granuloma explant experiments as now measured by CFU and luminescence (median effect of 1.4 log<sub>10</sub> reduction in burden over seven days relative to vehicle) as documented in the revised Figure 6.</p><p>We have also now included more robust statistical descriptions for the analyses we performed within the figure legends throughout, including, in supplementary data, adding parallel analysis of both log transformed and non-transformed data and providing two supplementary tables (Supplementary file 2 and Supplementary file 3) comprehensively documenting all p values throughout. We have also performed specific analyses requested by the reviewer, described below.</p><p>We have also added new experiments showing that clemastine can be used to enhance the effect of an antibiotic in the ex vivo granuloma model (Figure 6F and Figure 6—figure supplement 3C).</p><p>2) Concerns about the zebrafish</p><p>We recognize and appreciate that our findings are within the context of an animal model of mycobacterial infection and have emphasized the new biological insights obtained using a natural host-pathogen pairing and a whole animal in vivo drug screen. We have restructured the Introduction and Discussion section to focus on those findings within this context, and while we do believe that animal models are useful in understanding conserved fundamental features of mycobacterial infection, have been careful to emphasize that our current findings are within this system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The magnitude of the effects of clemastine are very modest and appears to vary from experiment to experiment. The effect in Figure 2 is said to be approximately ~60% reduction (i.e., ~2-fold), but in other experiments (e.g., Figure 5a, 5b, 6b, etc.), the effect appears to be even less. Obviously, there is no objective threshold that determines when the magnitude of a biological effect is sufficiently large for a journal such as eLife. It is a judgment call; and this reviewer's judgment is the magnitude of the effects will affect the impact of this work.</p></disp-quote><p>The effect is consistent and usually a 3-10 fold reduction (0.5 log<sub>10</sub> to 1 log<sub>10</sub>) over a relatively short time period, as discussed above. To further support our findings, we have added additional methods to detect changes in bacterial burden. Specifically, we have used 16S rRNA qPCR analyses to confirm that clemastine reduces bacterial burden by an independent measure in larvae but fails to do so in <italic>p2rx7</italic> mutant animals (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C) and RD1 mutant bacteria (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). Further, in new data from the granuloma explant model, clemastine’s effect appears greater (median reduction of 1.4 log<sub>10</sub> when measuring by CFU plating). In addition, we show similar results over seven days of treatment against infections using the new <italic>lux</italic> strain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I am having trouble with the way statistics are used to support some of the main claims of the paper. My trouble relates to the difference between showing an observed difference is not significant versus showing that there is no difference. For example, in figure 4, the authors seek to establish one of the main claims of the paper, namely that the effect of clemastine on bacterial burden is p2rx7 dependent. In fact, I believe what is shown is that there is no evidence that the drug has an effect in p2rx7 knockouts, which is quite a different thing (and could in fact be claimed even if no experiment had been done at all). Indeed, it appears to me that there may be an effect of the drug in p2rx7-deficient animals, even if the difference didn't reach a similar degree of statistical significance as in WT (perhaps due to the lower n?). Instead of reporting that there is no statistically significant effect of the drug in p2rx7 knockouts, I think it would be preferable to arrange the statistical testing in such a way that it is possible to conclude that the effect of the drug (fold restriction of bacterial burdens?) is statistically different in WT vs p2rx7 knockouts. In addition, is the Clemastine+P2RX7+ group significantly different than the Clemastine+P2RX7- group?</p></disp-quote><p>This point is well-taken. We have taken the reviewer’s suggestion about this analysis in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and 1C and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B. We felt it was important to show actual unprocessed data first (without the fold-change processing), so have left the analysis and comparisons in Figure 4A intact and still do note that there is no statistically significant effect of the drug in the <italic>p2rx7</italic> knockout. However, as the reviewer suggested, in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, we now show that the fold-reduction in burden with clemastine is significantly lower in WT vs. <italic>pr2rx7</italic> knockouts (p=0.001). We also performed these same analyses on granuloma explants and observe similar effects (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). In addition, in response to the reviewer’s point 3 below, we performed 16S rRNA analysis on pooled larvae (four groups: WT vehicle, WT treated, p2rx7 vehicle, p2rx7 control) as a correlate of burden independent of fluorescence (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C) and found reduced burden in the WT animals and no effect in the p2rx7 knockouts.</p><p>Additionally, we have performed similar analyses for data supporting our findings in RD1 mutant bacteria and <italic>asc</italic> mutant animals. These new figures can be found in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and Figure 5—figure supplement 2C. We show that clemastine reduces the fold change in bacterial burden compared to vehicle controls in wildtype infections more than RD1 mutant infections (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). These data are also corroborated with 16S rRNA qPCR analysis within the same figure. Finally, we use this reviewer’s suggestion for additional analysis based on fold change to confirm that clemastine reduces the fold change in bacterial burden in wildtype animals compared to <italic>asc</italic> mutants (Figure 5—figure supplement 2C). Thus, not only is there a lack of a significant clemastine effect on infections with RD1 bacterial mutants, <italic>asc</italic> mutants, or <italic>p2rx7</italic> mutants, as shown previously, but the additional analysis suggested by the reviewer also reveals a statistically significant difference in the fold restriction of bacterial burden by clemastine between WT animals and each of these three genotypes. We hope these additional analyses, new experiments, and independent approaches to quantitate burden address this major concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>[…] Essential revisions:</p><p>1) RD1 data and link to the inflammasome: The authors show that clemastine does not further restrict the growth of an RD1 mutant, which lacks ESX-1 and thus fails to permeabilize the phagosome. This is interpreted as demonstrating that the drug only has efficacy if the bacterium has access to cytosolic contents, which is then used to justify thinking about how the inflammasome might be involved. I think this is problematic on two fronts: (1) An attenuated mutant (the RD1 mutant) might not be further growth-restricted by a host-directed drug for many reasons other than cytosolic access. I think (at minimum) testing the effect of clemastine against an attenuated mutant still able to access the cytosol would be necessary to begin to make that interpretation (2) The logical bridge between the requirement for cytosolic access and inflammasome activation is a weak one. The literature is divided on whether ESX-1 (i.e. cytosolic access of the bacterium) is required for activation of the two inflammasomes shown to be relevant in TB- AIM2 and NLRP3. While older literature suggested that activation of NLRP3 required ESX-1, the paper (PMID: 26048138) that best dissected out the relative contributions of NLRP3 and AIM2 to the overall inflammasome response to TB found that while ESX-1 was required for AIM2 activation, it was not required for NLRP3 activation. Further, permeabilizing the phagosome is known to be required for triggering other pathways, among other effects- to me, even though the ASC mutant data shows clemastine has no effect, there are logical gaps in getting to that experiment. I think the paper would be logically stronger if the RD1 and inflammasome data were removed.</p></disp-quote><p>While the RD1 data and ASC data are robust, we agree that this is a complex part of the field that may be difficult to fully resolve within the time-frame and scope of a revision. To strengthen this aspect of the manuscript, we have performed new experiments that (1) address the specificity of the RD1 effect and (2) provide some evidence (beyond genetic dependence on <italic>asc</italic>) of clemastine-treated granulomas exhibiting increased inflammasome-associated activity.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s first concern, we tested the effect of clemastine against other mycobacterial mutants. Many of the attenuated mutants we tried (e.g. <italic>erp</italic>) were so attenuated that they were not useful in these assays, as they were being cleared on their own. However, we found that a bacterial mutant with a transposon insertion in <italic>cmaA2</italic> was attenuated in our model. CmaA2 encodes a mycolic acid trans-cyclopropane synthetase (Glickman et al., 2001). While we did not seek to define the mechanism for <italic>cmaA2</italic> mutant attenuation in our model, we show that these bacteria fail to expand normally in vivo. Despite their attenuation and low bacterial burden, clemastine treatment further reduces bacterial burden by ~0.5 log<sub>10</sub> in <italic>cmaA2</italic> mutants (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-C), in contrast to the RD1 results. In addition, we used a reciprocal approach in which we infected with a high dose of RD1 mutant bacteria to show that even with a higher burden of infection, clemastine remains ineffective against RD1 mutant bacteria (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-C), described in subsection “Clemastine is effective in established infections”.</p><p>We agree that the literature is complex and sometimes contradictory on how, whether, and when ESX-1 and/or cytosolic access is required for activation of inflammasomes during mycobacterial infection. The finding that clemastine was ineffective against RD1 mutant bacteria led us to investigate the inflammasome as a mechanism through which clemastine can reduce bacterial burden, as we know that ESX-1 secretion systems have been implicated in both the activation and inhibition of inflammasomes during mycobacterial infection. The manuscript does not seek to resolve the role of RD1/ESX1 in inflammasome activation. Rather, it was the impetus to examine this pathway and the <italic>asc</italic> mutants and find that clemastine was ineffective in both <italic>p2rx7</italic> and <italic>asc</italic> mutants. We also have added Figure 6C and Figure 6—figure supplement 2A-C, in which we devised a protocol for quantitating FLICA-reagent fluorescence in granuloma explants after clemastine treatment, suggesting increased inflammasome activity after clemastine treatment. Unfortunately, the administration and/or sensitivity of this reagent did not allow us to perform these experiments in larvae.</p><p>To bolster the case for specificity, we also added negative data investigating a potential role for autophagy in mediating clemastine’s effects. In new Figure 5—figure supplement 2D, we see no difference in LC3 positive puncta upon clemastine treatment using a previously published zebrafish line (He et al., 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Lack of testing in combination with an established anti-mycobacterial drug: Host acting agents have relatively weak activity against Mtb when compared with standard antibiotics and will likely have to be used as adjuncts to other therapeutics. In some cases, drugs with activity against Mtb in host cells when used alone have been shown to compromise the activity of standard antibacterial agents when used in combination. An argument can be made that the standard for testing potential novel host-directed agents should include testing together with more standard antibiotics. If this type of model is not already established in the lab, these experiments would potentially go beyond 60 days- in which case I would still support publication of the manuscript without those experiments but would suggest that the potential for different effects in combination/need to test in combinations be addressed in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We wholeheartedly agree that host-acting agents typically have weak activity against <italic>Mtb</italic> when compared to standard of care antibiotics. HDTs would be used in conjunction with the standard of care in any human trial or treatment. While the time-frame of the revision precluded a comprehensive examination of front-line antibiotics, we examined the effects of clemastine in conjunction with the antibiotic moxifloxacin, selected in part because it displayed reduced efficacy in the granuloma model (10-fold higher MIC relative to in vitro MIC – Cronan et al., 2018). In combination with moxifloxacin, clemastine co-treatment is more effective than antibiotic alone (Figure 6F and Figure 6—figure supplement 3C and subsection “Transgenic lines”).</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p>We would like the thank the reviewers for their thorough and thoughtful critique of our manuscript. We are pleased to have had the opportunity to present the information more clearly and perform new experiments to address reviewer concerns. We have added substantial new experimental data, including validating findings about bacterial burden with three additional independent approaches and find even more robust effects in the established granuloma model (now using three independent approaches to quantify burden) than we had presented previously in the larval infection model. We have addressed statistical concerns more comprehensively throughout, and strengthened the findings around RD1 and inflammasome activation using new mycobacterial mutants, additional experiments, and a flow-cytometry-based analysis of clemastine’s effect on established granulomas. In addition, as requested by the reviewers, we have shown efficacy of clemastine in combination with a traditional antibiotic. And we have reworded significant aspects of the discussion to make clear the novel biological findings and approach within the context of the zebrafish-mycobacterial infection system, a natural host-pathogen pairing. In summary, we hope we have addressed the reviewers’ concerns through a number of additional experiments, thoughtful rewording, and careful statistical analysis throughout.</p><p>As presented below in more detail, we have addressed each of these points with new experiments.</p><p>Regarding the effect size of clemastine initially reported (~0.5-1.0 log<sub>10</sub> by fluorescence), within our model – a slow growing mycobacterium over the five-day infection possible in the zebrafish larva – this represents a fairly large and robust effect size. It is on a par with effect sizes described for host perturbations in a number of other zebrafish-mycobacterium papers over the past 15 years (e.g. Clay et al., 2007; Tobin et al., 2010; Tobin et al., 2012; Roca and Ramakrishnan, 2013; Oehlers et al., 2015 among others). Many of these findings have been validated in other mycobacterial infection models and in human populations. In addition, we performed new experiments to validate the robustness of the effect.</p><p>Importantly, the development of a new granuloma explant model has allowed us to examine treatment over longer time-frames with established infections as well as enabled new approaches to quantifying burden (thereby independently validating the fluorescence-based results) that are not possible in the larvae. In new experiments, we found that clemastine’s effect on burden measured by CFU was a 27-fold (1.4 log<sub>10</sub>) median reduction over seven days of treatment in established infections. We also developed a new lux-based strain for longitudinal quantitation in established granulomas and obtained similar results.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have further clarified all statistical tests. All significant p-values are presented within the figure and all non-significant p-values are described in each figure legend. Additionally, all p-values (for both transformed and untransformed data) are presented in Supplementary file 2 and Supplementary file 3. New experiments are included to correlate fluorescent readouts with CFU, 16S bacterial rRNA, and a new mycobacterial strain that expresses Lux to provide an even more accurate and independent readout of bacterial counts within nascent and established infections. Using the granuloma explant model and flow cytometry, we have further expanded our investigation of the role for clemastine in activation of the inflammasome; clemastine treatment efficacy is not only dependent on <italic>asc</italic> but, in new data, we detect enhanced activation of caspase-1 via a FLICA reagent and flow cytometry of established granulomas treated with clemastine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In the absence of rigorous statistical analysis, or the lack of a clear explanation as to how statistics were conducted, small (or even large) changes in a biological system are difficult to contextualize. We encourage you to consider this carefully in your data analysis. Regards statistics, pay particular attention to the correct choice of test to use, usually determined by the nature of the data, parametric versus non-parametric etc. Report these consistently in all figures, provide p-values for all comparisons (include the choice of test each time) and if necessary, include an expanded data analysis section in the Materials and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have more clearly explained how we conducted our statistical analyses and included much more information about the analyses we did perform. We have reported all p values for both transformed and untransformed data as requested by one of the reviewers and this is now included comprehensively in new Supplementary file 2 and Supplementary file 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Consider more carefully how you would incorporate inflammasome activation as the mechanism into your revision. Reviewers raised several concerns regards the RD1 mutant. However, simply removing it from the study may weaken the mechanism. We encourage you to think further as to how you can address this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>To further address these concerns, and as detailed below and above, we performed additional experiments that were supportive of this model. These included generating and assessing a new mycobacterial mutant to rule out the possibility of burden-dependent efficacy of clemastine; calibrating RD1 infection levels to address this same issue; and developing a new protocol in established granulomas to quantitate caspase-1 activation via a FLICA reagent upon clemastine treatment. More details are provided in the point-by-point response to reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) We would like to affirm your sentiment that eLife values model systems as central to the scholastic pursuit of holistically understanding biological systems. The zebrafish model is no different in this case. However, it falls upon the authors to ensure that data presented in any manuscript are interpreted within the context of said model and not over-extended to humans or any other system without substantiating experiments. Please consider this carefully when preparing your revision and limit the interpretation to the model system that you are using, unless you have supporting/validation data from other systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that our findings come within the context of an animal model of mycobacterial infection and have emphasized the new biological insights obtained using a natural host-pathogen pairing and an in vivo drug screen. We have restructured the Introduction and Discussion section to focus on those findings within this context, and while we do believe that animal models of mycobacterial infection are useful in understanding conserved fundamental features of mycobacterial infection, have been careful to emphasize that our findings are within this particular system.</p></body></sub-article></article>
