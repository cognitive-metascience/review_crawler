This information is stored as a genetic code consisting of four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). The order of these bases and their different combinations serves as a blueprint for making thousands of different proteins and to assemble living cells.</p><p>Proteins are vital for almost every process that keeps cells alive. They are made up of chains of small molecules called amino acids, via a process that takes several steps. First, the code from the gene needs to be copied into so-called messenger RNA molecules (mRNA). Cells then decode these mRNAs by reading the bases in groups of three, called codons. Most codons specify an amino acid, though some mark the start and end point of the protein.</p><p>Cells need different proteins in varying amounts. In fact, a given protein may be present in only a few copies in one cell, while another may be present in millions of copies, and in both cases the amount of protein present often needs to be tightly controlled.</p><p>One way to control the number of copies of a protein that are made from a mRNA is via the specific choice of codons. Most amino acids are encoded by more than one codon and using a different codon can lead the mRNA to yield more or less protein without actually changing the protein that is made.</p><p>Researchers are particularly interested in protein production in parasites known as trypanosomes, which cause a range of diseases in humans and other animals. Although most aspects of protein production are similar in humans and in trypanosomes, the differences indicate that codon choice would be particularly important in the parasites. However, until now it was not known how codon choice contributes to the control of the copy number of proteins in these parasites.</p><p>To test this, Jeacock, Faria and Horn engineered fully synthetic genes for fast or slow protein production and inserted them into the parasite’s genome. The genes generated the proteins at the predicted levels. An analysis of several datasets of protein abundance showed that the number of proteins in related parasites could also be predicted by using only the DNA code of the gene. Jeacock et al. could even predict the number of mRNAs in a parasite cell. A separate study by Nascimento, Kelly et al. also showed that codon identity predicts mRNA levels in trypanosomes.</p><p>These findings will help researchers to predict mRNA and protein levels in these parasites using simple computer models. A better understanding of gene expression in these parasites will also improve our knowledge of the fundamental aspects of protein production in relation to evolution, biotechnology and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Leishmania</kwd><kwd>post-transcription</kwd><kwd>synonymous</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>Trypanosoma</kwd><kwd>brucei</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100320/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horn</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>203134/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horn</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Global relative mRNA and protein abundance in trypanosomatids can be effectively estimated at transcriptomic and proteomic scales based on protein-coding sequences alone.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular growth and function depend upon the efficient expression of a large number of proteins that differ in abundance over a range from only a few molecules to millions of molecules per cell. Gene expression can be controlled at many levels, including transcription, mRNA stability, translation and protein stability. <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> are parasitic protozoa that present a unique model for studies on gene expression because a relatively small number of ‘dispersed’ GT-rich RNA polymerase II (pol-II) promoters drive constitutive polycistronic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wedel et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, <italic>T. brucei</italic> have no known regulated RNA polymerase II promoters for protein-coding genes. Some stress response genes and cell cycle regulated genes are located towards the ends of the polycistonic units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>) but there is otherwise limited clustering of functionally related genes. In addition, trypanosomes have only two genes containing known introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mair et al., 2000</xref>), and every mRNA has an identical sequence <italic>trans</italic>-spliced onto the 5'-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clayton, 2016</xref>). These features are conserved in the related parasitic trypanosomatids, <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> and <italic>Leishmania spp.</italic> and in other trypanosomatids. This remarkable level of uniformity in terms of transcription and mRNA processing indicates that gene expression control primarily operates post-transcription.</p><p>Sixty-one alternative base-triplets (codons) in DNA and mRNA encode for twenty different amino acids, such that many amino acids are encoded by two or up to six distinct but 'synonymous' codons. These codons can vary in their first position for three amino acids and in their third position for eighteen. Although recognised several decades ago, our understanding of the impact of inherently redundant codon usage and codon usage bias remains incomplete. One mRNA can yield 4000 molecules of protein, as measured in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Futcher et al., 1999</xref>), while the average protein:mRNA ratio in insect-form <italic>T. brucei</italic> is estimated to be 550:1; median values of three and 1650 molecules per gene, per cell, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kolev et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, there is substantial capacity for expression control at the level of translation. Indeed, individual codons can control translation-rate in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gardin et al., 2014</xref>), codon-dependent local translation slowdown can facilitate nascent peptide processing in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mahlab and Linial, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pechmann et al., 2014</xref>) and changes in relative codon usage and cognate tRNA abundance can control differentiation-related translation programmes in metazoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gingold et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, different codons are decoded at different rates by native ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanson and Coller, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Novoa and Ribas de Pouplana, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Quax et al., 2015</xref>). Codon usage can also impact mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanson and Coller, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In trypanosomatids, highly expressed genes are amplified in tandem and are enriched in GC3 codons, those codons that have a G or a C at the third position; cognate tRNA genes for these codons also display increased copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horn, 2008</xref>). Although pol-II promoters appear to underpin much of the regulation of gene expression in metazoa and other eukaryotes, GC3 codons are also favoured in highly expressed genes in mammals and the evidence suggests that protein abundance is in fact predominantly controlled at the level of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>). In trypanosomatids, control of translation and mRNA stability are typically ascribed to 3'-untranslated sequences and their interactions with RNA-binding proteins and indeed, such regulation does operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clayton, 2013</xref>), but informatics analysis also supports a role for translational selection, the increased translation of GC3 codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chanda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Subramanian and Sarkar, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Since transcription for all but a few genes is polycistronic and constitutive, trypanosomatids present excellent model eukaryotic systems in which to investigate the impact of codon bias on gene expression control. Here, we combine experimental and bioinformatics analyses to explore the contribution that codon usage makes to differential gene expression in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and in other trypanosomatids. Our results indicate a capacity for codon bias based control of relative protein abundance over several orders of magnitude. We find that mRNA abundance is also increased by favoured codons. Remarkably, our predictions, based on trypanosomatid protein-coding sequences alone, correlate well with observed measures of steady-state mRNA and protein abundance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GC3 codon bias increases protein expression</title><p>Prior analysis of codon usage in trypanosomatids indicated a correlation between GC3-bias and protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horn, 2008</xref>).

Indeed, in the case of xxC/T wobble codons the xxC rather than xxT version of the tRNA is always present for these amino acids (Asn, Asp, Cys, His, Phe, Tyr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horn, 2008</xref>). In contrast, when there are 3–6 alternative codons, the xxT version of the wobble tRNA is typically present (Ile, Ala, Pro, Thr, Val, Leu, Arg, Ser<sup>TCT</sup>) and both alternative wobble codons are often over-represented in these cases (Ile, Ala, Leu, Arg, Ser<sup>TCT</sup>).</p><p>Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) genes in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, which are involved in immune evasion and are subject to allelic exclusion, display unusual codon usage bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chanda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cross et al., 2014</xref>). Distinct from highly expressed and indeed other gene families, A3 codons are over-represented, while G3 codons, and notably almost all U3 codons, are under-represented in the <italic>VSG</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent with this, we find that the cohort of 188 intact <italic>VSGs</italic> display low CAI values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), with an average of 0.672. The single expressed <italic>VSG</italic> produces the most abundant mRNA and protein in bloodstream form <italic>T. brucei</italic> but a high rate of translation is probably not required due to a high rate of transcription by RNA pol-I, combined with remarkably slow turnover of both the <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA (half-life ~4.5 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ehlers et al., 1987</xref>) and protein (half-life ~33 + /- 9 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seyfang et al., 1990</xref>); the mean mRNA half-life in bloodstream-form <italic>T. brucei</italic> is 16 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fadda et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, sub-optimal translation, due to low G3 and high A3-usage in <italic>VSGs</italic>, may be necessary to prevent these multi-copy genes, distributed throughout the genome, from compromising <italic>VSG</italic> allelic exclusion and the immune evasion strategy of bloodstream form <italic>T. brucei</italic>. This particular virulence strategy could fail if constitutive pol-II transcription yielded sufficient VSG at the cell surface to simultaneously present multiple variants to the host.</p><p>Since codon-pair bias is observed in other genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Quax et al., 2015</xref>), and some pair-bias combinations have the potential to be in conflict with increased codon optimality, we also examined these features of <italic>T. brucei</italic> protein-coding sequences. This revealed enrichment of duplicated codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and other examples of pair-bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Codon co-occurrence is thought to facilitate tRNA recharging, while the over-represented (examples include xxC/Axx, xxU/Gxx, xxC/xxC and xxG/xxG) and under-represented (examples include xxA/Gxx, xxU/Axx, xxC/xxG, xxG/xxC) pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>) are thought to reflect more optimal tRNA interactions at the A and P sites that impact translation fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Quax et al., 2015</xref>). We are not aware of evidence supporting a direct impact of codon pair-bias on mRNA or protein expression, so these differences were not considered further here. We do note, however, that an over-representation of xxU/Gxx pairs, and under-representation of xxC/xxG and xxG/xxC pairs, limits the accumulation of ‘optimal’ GC3 codons.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32496.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Genome scale analysis of codon pair bias in <italic>T.</italic></title><p><italic>brucei</italic>.

Codon usage contributes to gene expression control but it can be challenging to investigate the impact of codon usage bias at a genomic and proteomic scale in most eukaryotes because gene expression control operates at many levels, through transcription control in particular. Trypanosomatids display constitutive RNA pol-II transcription and, therefore, rely heavily upon post-transcriptional control, consequently presenting excellent models for the study of mRNA stability and translation control. It was previously suggested that codon usage and corresponding tRNA gene dosage plays an important role in gene expression control in trypanosomatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horn, 2008</xref>) but experimental tests of this translational selection hypothesis were lacking. We now show that codon usage has a major impact on gene expression in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and that both relative mRNA and protein expression can be predicted based on coding sequence alone.</p><p>Using two distinct reporter genes in bloodstream form <italic>T. brucei</italic>, we show that codon usage has the capacity to control relative protein abundance over several orders of magnitude. Although to a lesser extent, mRNA abundance was also dependent upon codon usage. Indeed, codon optimality increases mRNA stability in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>), by reducing Dhh1p-dependent decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). Anticipating a major impact of codon bias on gene expression in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, we predicted relative mRNA and protein expression at a global scale using coding sequences alone. We found that codon usage was indeed predictive of observed mRNA and protein expression and report correspondence between the relative abundance of thousands of native proteins and thousands of native mRNA transcripts. We find it quite remarkable that our predictions of steady-state mRNA and protein expression, based only on coding sequences, correlate with observed abundance data; even taking no account of controls mediated by untranslated sequences or differences in protein turnover.</p><p>Under-sampling is one of the major current challenges in terms of determining relative protein abundance in cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ly et al., 2014</xref>). With this in mind, we predicted protein expression for cohorts of genes that encode components of protein complexes or related functions. We found a remarkable correlation between our sequence-based predictions and observed protein levels. Notably, for proteins that form multi-component complexes, protein turnover is likely dependent upon complex assembly, with destabilisation of unassembled subunits.</p><p>In addition to codon usage, gene length also has an impact on mRNA and protein expression, and this is proposed to be due to increased turnover of longer transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fadda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jha et al., 2014</xref>). This is entirely feasible because individual lesions in mRNA will reduce abundance and lesions may be proportional to length. When we applied a gene-length adjustment, this failed to improve the correspondence between codon usage and mRNA half-life, consistent with the idea suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fadda et al., 2014</xref>) that transcript length has a greater impact on co-transcriptional degradation rather than on co-translational degradation. Perhaps the former is dominated by (length-dependent) endonuclease activity while the latter is dominated by (length-independent) exonuclease activity, following decapping and deadenylation.</p><p>Ribosome profiling, nascent chain profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chadani et al., 2016</xref>) and analysis of newly synthesised proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zur et al., 2016</xref>) are powerful methods for probing translational efficiency and translational pausing. The former approach has been applied to <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vasquez et al., 2014</xref>). Our analysis of codon usage in relation to these translation efficiency data, as well as mRNA half-life data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fadda et al., 2014</xref>), also from <italic>T. brucei</italic>, suggested that optimal codons increase ribosome occupancy and mRNA stability. Indeed, possible crosstalk between translation and mRNA decay in <italic>T. brucei</italic> was noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antwi et al., 2016</xref>). We propose that optimal-codons reduce mRNA turnover in trypanosomes by increasing the rate of translation, increasing the association with actively translating ribosomes, and thereby protecting mRNA from degradation. In this scenario, slow translation or stalling would promote mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deana and Belasco, 2005</xref>). Indeed, mRNA decay is known to be co-translational in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Mechanisms by which optimal codons impact ribosome translation rates remain a subject of intense debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanson and Coller, 2018</xref>). Our findings in <italic>T. brucei</italic> suggest a more pronounced impact on translation that also impacts mRNA stability. For reference, estimates for highly expressed genes in yeast yield initiation rates of once every two seconds and elongation rates up to twenty amino acids per second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Futcher et al., 1999</xref>). In <italic>T. brucei</italic>, it is estimated that there are 125,000 ribosomes and 19,000 non-<italic>VSG</italic> mRNA molecules per bloodstream form cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haanstra et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, a number of studies point to translation initiation as the rate-limiting step in protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>) and ribosome occupancy was found to be similar on optimised and non-optimised constructs in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>). In simple terms, a constant translation initiation rate combined with variable elongation rates would be expected to yield rapidly translated mRNAs loaded with relatively few ribosomes and slowly translated mRNAs loaded with many, potentially stalled, ribosomes. In contrast to this scenario, however, our analysis indicates correspondence between optimal codons and ribosome occupancy. This suggests a coupling between elongation and initiation in trypanosomes which could be explained by slow ribosomes affecting trailing ribosomes and decreasing the initiation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanson and Coller, 2018</xref>) or by ribosome recycling on the same mRNA [see Supplementary information S5 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>It should be possible in the future to further refine mathematical models of gene expression and also to better understand the relative impact and evolution of codon usage in trypanosomatids. Improvements in quantitative proteomics, measurements of protein synthesis and turnover rates, a better understanding of the impact of untranslated sequences on translation and mRNA turnover and an improved understanding of the relative contributions of individual codons to translation elongation and initiation will all help make this possible. We conclude that protein-coding sequence composition contributes to differences in steady-state mRNA and protein abundance in trypanosomatids. The ability to predict relative expression, based on protein-coding sequences alone, indicates that codon usage makes a major contribution to the transcriptomes and proteomes of these cells. Our results support a model whereby translation rate is increased by optimal codons, resulting in reduced mRNA turnover.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Codon usage bias controls mRNA and protein abundance in the African trypanosome&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) RNASeq correlations:a) For all plots in which mRNA levels are compared with the codon usage, include <italic>all</italic> mRNA abundances, not just the subset for which protein measurements are available. There is no rationale for excluding mRNAs that give levels of protein that are not detectable by mass spectrometry. This step excludes a substantial proportion of the transcriptome.</p><p>b) Please plot the CAI against several datasets other than your own. If the correlation is only true for your own dataset, then it is no use.</p><p>c) The authors hypothesis is that certain codons &quot;reduce mRNA turnover&quot;. To test this they must plot the CAI against the measured mRNA turnover rates (10.1111/mmi.12764). Of course there will be discrepancies, some of which will have been caused by the way the half-life information was obtained, and these can be discussed. Basically, the authors need to guide the reviewer through the published data and discuss how their data differs/ overlaps, etc. RNA preparation methods are known to have effects, and that information should be brought into the Discussion.</p><p>The interpretation must be toned down throughout and all over-statements removed. The paper shows <italic>only</italic> that codon usage &quot;contributes to&quot; mRNA and protein abundance. It does not show that it is &quot;the major factor&quot;. To support such a strong conclusion, a careful calculation needs to show that codon usage contributes to variance more than every other possible factor.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, showing different complexes, should be expanded to include other mutli-subunit complexes and additional metabolic pathways. In addition, the statement in the Abstract about 0.91 corr. Is very misleading and needs to be removed. It only shows the same relationship as was already seen, but for a small, cherry-picked subset of genes. Including a smaller number of genes will automatically improve the correlation coefficient – this is a statistical artifact.</p><p>Moreover, developmental co-regulation of mRNAs encoding different complexes was already shown using microarrays (Queiroz et al), and the distributions of mRNA half-lives for the complexes are already available (10.1111/mmi.12764), why is this not referred to?. For such complexes, protein abundance may well also be regulated by selective degradation of uncomplexed subunits.</p><p>3) Data analysis and significance:a) Relating to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, It is not clear how the cohorts were put together nor why certain cohorts were selected and others not? E.g. why was a cohort for RNA pol II shown but not for RNA pol I?</p><p>b) To strengthen the claim that the CAI can be used to predict mRNA and protein levels, the authors should determine how well it can be used to predict RNA levels in PF. There is no need to generate new RNAseq data, the analysis can be done using publicly available RNAseq datasets.</p><p>c) Methods:</p><p>The authors should follow the ENCODE guidelines on RNA-Seq reporting so that the library preparation can be reproduced:https://www.encodeproject.org/about/experiment-guidelines/</p><p>• For example, what polY-dT beads were used?</p><p>• Magnetic or cellulose? From what manufacturer?</p><p>• What kit was used for library preparation etc.?</p><p>• What percentage of reads could be aligned?</p><p>4) The Discussion and working model are not clear.a) The authors argue that if translation elongation is the rate-limiting step in protein synthesis, optimal codons leading to faster elongation will have a major impact on the rate of protein synthesis. While this argument is not incorrect, it neglects a vast amount of literature pointing to translation initiation as the rate-limiting step, not elongation (Jackson et al., 2010; Shah et al., Cell 153, 1589-1601 2013).</p><p>The authors should address the possibility that the primary mechanism by which codon usage affects protein synthesis is not via the rate of elongation but by modulating RNA stability.</p><p>b) The authors write:</p><p>&quot;We propose that GC3-codons reduce mRNA turnover by increasing the rate of translation, increasing the association with actively translating ribosomes, and thereby protecting mRNA from attack by nucleases.&quot;</p><p>This hypothesis is contradicted by a statement in paragraph two of the Discussion where the authors write that genes encoding ribosomal proteins have a particularly high CAI score (which should lead to a high elongation rate), a reduced ribosome density and high stability. The literature in the codon usage field shows that increased rate of elongation does not lead to changes in polysome profiles (see Presnyak, 2015). Although this is somewhat counter intuitive, it is the finding in other eukaryotic systems. What should be mentioned are those data and the fact that the issue of translation initiation rates are never discussed in this pare, or the literature at large.</p><p>However, the hypothesis that slow translation or stalling would promote mRNA degradation is supported by data in other organisms and seems reasonable.</p><p>The authors should check the logic of their arguments so that either all experimental data is explained by one hypothesis or, if this is not possible, conflicting observations are discussed.</p><p>Review the literature on links between translation and mRNA decay in other organisms more comprehensively – some important references have been omitted.</p><p>[Editors' note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and the authors made a formal revised submission.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32496.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) RNASeq correlations:a) For all plots in which mRNA levels are compared with the codon usage, include all mRNA abundances, not just the subset for which protein measurements are available.

Indeed, the behavior of these particular transcripts is unusual as reported previously by Antwi et al. 2016. The point relating to ribosome profiles is particularly interesting. We analyzed ribosome profiling data from Vasquez et al., 2014 and see correspondence between translation efficiency and our ‘expression level’ predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).
