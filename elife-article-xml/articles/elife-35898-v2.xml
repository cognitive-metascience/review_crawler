pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35898.001</object-id><p>The COMMD proteins are a conserved family of proteins with central roles in intracellular membrane trafficking and transcription. They form oligomeric complexes with each other and act as components of a larger assembly called the CCC complex, which is localized to endosomal compartments and mediates the transport of several transmembrane cargos. How these complexes are formed however is completely unknown. Here, we have systematically characterised the interactions between human COMMD proteins, and determined structures of COMMD proteins using X-ray crystallography and X-ray scattering to provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of homo- and heteromeric assembly. All COMMD proteins possess an α-helical N-terminal domain, and a highly conserved C-terminal domain that forms a tightly interlocked dimeric structure responsible for COMMD-COMMD interactions. The COMM domains also bind directly to components of CCC and mediate non-specific membrane association. Overall these studies show that COMMD proteins function as obligatory dimers with conserved domain architectures.</p></abstract><kwd-group

region 1) Domain) proteins are highly conserved in metazoans and unicellular protozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maine and Burstein, 2007</xref>). There are ten family members that play key roles in intracellular trafficking and in the regulation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maine and Burstein, 2007</xref>). A hallmark of the COMMD family members is a highly conserved C-terminal sequence of ~70–80 amino acids called the COMM domain, which has no known structure. The N-terminal domain of these proteins, which we refer to as the HN (helical N-terminal) domain, is more variable in sequence across the ten proteins, and is proposed to ascribe unique functions to the different family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maine and Burstein, 2007</xref>). Despite the high degree of conservation and the important roles of COMMD proteins in membrane trafficking and cell signalling, little is known about their structures or their specific molecular functions.</p><p>In humans, all ten members of the COMMD family (Commd1-Commd10) are expressed broadly in many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van De Sluis et al., 2002</xref>). Much of our current understanding of the COMMD proteins is derived from studies of the founding family member Commd1. An in-frame deletion in exon 2 of the <italic>COMMD1</italic> gene was first identified in Bedlington terrier dogs with hepatic copper toxicosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van De Sluis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tao et al., 2003</xref>). In accordance with the link of Commd1 to copper metabolism, it was reported to bind to Cu(II), implying that COMMD family members might serve as metal binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Narindrasorasak et al., 2007</xref>), although this was questioned by subsequent studies. Commd1 has also been shown to associate with both ATP7A and ATP7B and is thought to mediate their trafficking from endosomes to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Materia et al., 2012</xref>). In humans, ATP7A and ATP7B are responsible for controlling intracellular Cu(II) accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Materia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vonk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miyayama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phillips-Krawczak et al., 2015</xref>) and are involved in conditions related to copper toxicity including Wilson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting an alternative role for Commd1 in copper homeostasis. In line with a more general function in intracellular trafficking, Commd1 depletion causes a marked reduction in surface levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), with increased endosomal accumulation leading to a concomitant increase in cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartuzi et al., 2016</xref>). Although COMMD proteins are expected to be structurally similar, there may be non-redundant trafficking roles mediated by different members of the family. For example, Commd9 is deleted in patients with Wilms tumour-aniridia syndrome (WAGR) syndrome, and appears to interact specifically with Notch2 to regulate its surface abundance by shuttling the receptor away from the lysosomal degradative pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Members of the COMMD family have also been linked to nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) transcriptional regulation, hypoxia adaptation, and regulation of intracellular sodium concentration via interactions with the epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Bie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maine et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>COMMD proteins have been found to exist in an endosome-associated complex with the coiled-coil domain-containing proteins CCDC22 and CCDC93, which has been termed the CCC (COMMD, CCDC22, CCDC93) complex. In addition, functional proteomics and bioinformatics have independently shown that the CCC complex can associate with a stable heterotrimeric assembly of VPS29, C16orf62 and DSCR3, to form a larger macromolecular complex dubbed the ‘Commander’ or CCC/Retreiver complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mallam and Marcotte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNally et al., 2017</xref>). Other proteins such as SNX17, RanBP1, SH3GLB1 and FAM45a are also thought to associate with the Commander complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>). Further complexity arises from evidence that COMMD proteins can form homo- and heterodimers through their COMM domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burstein et al., 2005</xref>). Although Commd9 and Commd5 associate directly with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan et al., 2015</xref>), it remains unclear whether the COMMD proteins interact physically with each other more generally, or how this relates to their assembly with CCDC22 and CCDC93 in CCC and the larger Commander complex.</p><p>In this study we provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the structural, biophysical and biochemical properties of the COMMD family of proteins, and their recruitment to the CCC complex. These analyses show that COMMD proteins form family-wide homo- and heterodimers through their C-terminal COMM domains. The crystal structure of the COMM domain from Commd9 reveals an intimately interlocked α/β homodimeric structure, which involves formation of a large and conserved hydrophobic interface. The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Commd9 shows an all α-helical structure, and using small angle X-ray scattering we establish that homodimers of full-length Commd1, Commd7 and Commd9 adopt similar tertiary architectures. Intriguingly, the COMMD proteins show clear structural homology to a poorly characterised protein found in chlamydial species of bacteria. Further biochemical studies show that C-terminal COMM domains have pleiotropic roles in both recruitment of CCDC22 and CCDC93 via their N-terminal calponin homology-like (NN-CH) domains, and in binding non-specifically to negatively charged phospholipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>COMMD proteins form homodimers via the C-terminal COMM domain</title><p>As a first step towards assessing the self-assembly activities of COMMD proteins, we studied the biophysical properties of recombinant full-length COMMD proteins in solution. Of all COMMD proteins we tested Commd1, Commd7 and Commd9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) were readily purified and tractable for biophysical analyses. We measured their molecular weights by analytical size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS). This showed that Commd1, Commd7 and Commd9 form homodimers and are monodisperse in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). SEC-MALLS data suggests that dimerization is likely to be a general property of the COMMD family members. To determine the domains required for homodimerisation we performed SEC-MALLS analyses of isolated HN and COMM domains. While the Commd1 and Commd9 HN domains behave as monomers, Commd1 and Commd9 COMM domains exist as dimeric species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This data shows that the COMM domain is both required and sufficient to mediate COMMD protein dimerization.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35898.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>COMMD proteins dimerize through the C-terminal COMM domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation of COMMD proteins, and the MALLS profile of Commd1 (black), Commd7 (red) and Commd9 (blue) showing Commd proteins are dimers in solution (<bold>B</bold>) Comparison of the theoretical molecular weight of the COMMD proteins and the experimentally measured molecular weight.

However, although crystals of various full-length COMMD proteins grew rapidly, their diffraction quality was not sufficient for structure determination. Therefore a divide-and-conquer approach was taken to determine structures of the two individual domains of the protein, the conserved C-terminal COMM domain, and the variable N-terminal HN domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Crystal structure of the Commd9 C-terminal COMM domain</title><p>We determined the crystal structure of the Commd9 COMM domain to 2.2 Å resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD). The overall structure of the Commd9 COMM domain is composed of two cone-shaped chains that are tightly intertwined with each other to form a globular dimeric module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Each monomer is comprised of an N-terminal three-stranded β-sheet capped by an α-helix, with the overall arrangement making an open, hairpin-like structure. A simple analogy for the COMM domain dimer is that it resembles a left-handed handshake, where the sheet and helix from each monomer represent the interlocked palms and thumbs of each hand respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The overlapping C-terminal α-helices of each chain bury a large hydrophobic surface area of approximately 2100 Å<sup>2</sup> (nearly 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the monomer surface area) supporting the notion that the native state of COMMD proteins is to form dimers via the COMM domain.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35898.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of crystallographic structure determination statistics.*</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th>Commd9 HN domain (1–117)</th><th>Commd9 COMM domain (115–198)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Data collection</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Space group</td><td colspan="2">P 1</td><td>I 4</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">28.5 Å, 35.6 Å, 54.3 Å;</td><td>79.4 Å, 79.4 Å, 58.5 Å</td></tr><tr><td>Unit cell dimensions (a,b,c; α,β,γ)</td><td colspan="2">104.0°, 93.3°, 91.1°</td><td>90°, 90°, 90°</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Remote</td><td>Inflection</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Wavelength (Å)</td><td>0.9762</td><td>0.9796</td><td>0.9787</td></tr><tr><td>Total reflections</td><td>172817</td><td>146841</td><td>131332</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution range (Å)</td><td>19–84 – 1.55 (1.58)</td><td>19–84 – 1.55 (1.58)</td><td>47.13–2.17 (2.24)</td></tr><tr><td>Mean I/sigma(I)</td><td>16.9 (5.2)</td><td>25.2 (9.3)</td><td>26.7 (4.9)</td></tr><tr><td>R-merge</td><td>0.10 (0.54)</td><td>0.06 (0.18)</td><td>0.06 (0.5)</td></tr><tr><td>Unique reflections</td><td>27698</td><td>27442</td><td>9689</td></tr><tr><td>Multiplicity</td><td>6.2 (6.0)</td><td>5.4 (5.3)</td><td>13.6 (11.8)</td></tr><tr><td>Anomalous Multiplicity</td><td>3.1 (3.1)</td><td>2.6 (2.7)</td><td>6.9 (6.1)</td></tr><tr><td>Mn(I) half-set correlation CC(1/2)</td><td>0.99 (0.89)</td><td>0.99 (0.98)</td><td>0.99 (0.95)</td></tr><tr><td>Completeness (%)</td><td>91.9 (54.9)</td><td>91.0 (52.7)</td><td>99.7 (96.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Anomalous Completeness (%)</td><td>89.6 (50.3)</td><td>88.1 (48.1)</td><td>99.3 (93.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Wilson B-factor</td><td>8.4</td><td>18.6</td><td>53.1</td></tr><tr><td>Refinement</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>R-work</td><td/><td>0.13 (0.25)</td><td>0.24 (0.30)</td></tr><tr><td>R-free</td><td/><td>0.16 (0.33)</td><td>0.28 (0.35)</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution range (Å)</td><td/><td>26.28–1.55</td><td>30.36–2.17</td></tr><tr><td>Number of atoms</td><td/><td>2078</td><td>1268</td></tr><tr><td>Protein atoms</td><td/><td>1784</td><td>1259</td></tr><tr><td>RMS(bonds)</td><td/><td>0.009</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td>RMS(angles)</td><td/><td>1.158</td><td>0.549</td></tr><tr><td>Ramachandran favored (%)</td><td/><td>100</td><td>98.06</td></tr><tr><td>Ramachandran outliers (%)</td><td/><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Average B-factor</td><td/><td>13.11</td><td>85.61</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Highest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>COMMD proteins dimerise via a conserved hydrophobic interface in the COMM domain</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the interface that mediates Commd9 dimerisation is examined in closer detail.

There is a very high degree of sequence conservation seen in the hydrophobic core of the Commd9 COMM domain, particularly along the α-helical surface mediating dimerisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Multiple sequence alignment of the COMM domains of all the COMMD proteins demonstrates conservation of many hydrophobic amino acids, particularly leucine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The high degree of conservation, and high degree of hydrophobicity within the dimerization interface strongly suggests that all of the COMMD proteins will form obligatory dimeric structures through similar mechanisms. We attempted to mutate several interfacial residues, but both the full-length mutated COMMD proteins and isolated COMM domains were aggregated due to poor protein solubility (not shown).

We therefore refer to this domain as the HN (<italic>H</italic>elical <italic>N</italic>-terminal) domain.

Compared to Commd1 however, the HN domain of Commd9 has an additional α-helix at its N-terminus that packs down on top of the structure, and a large disordered loop in Commd1 is better resolved in Commd9. In Commd9 the α4 helix forms a central core element that extends the length of the HN domain. In Commd1 however, the equivalent helix is bent and oriented differently. This could be due to the absence of the α1 helix to provide stability, or might also be due to an insufficient number of restraints in this region used for NMR structure calculations. However, the topology of the five shared α-helices (α2-α6) is similar overall.

The only major difference in the C-terminal structures is the presence of two additional α-helices at the C-terminus of the bacterial proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The N-terminal domains of the chlamydial proteins also have an analogous overall topology to the HN domain, except that the bacterial proteins lack α1 and α5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Like the COMMD molecules the chlamydial proteins possess a core dimeric structure formed by the C-terminal domains, with an overall architecture that is very similar to that of Commd9 determined by SAXS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D</xref>). In addition both chlamydial proteins appear to form hexameric assemblies via trimerisation of the core dimer structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4E</xref>) (discussed further below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>COMMD proteins bind promiscuously to each other</title><p>There are now a number of high-throughput proteomics studies that point to the existence of a large multi-subunit assembly containing all of the COMMD family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mallam and Marcotte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNally et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>). This is also well supported by several more targeted studies demonstrating that COMMD proteins associate with each other in both endogenous and over-expression conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNally et al., 2017</xref>). In the majority of cases these interactions were found using co-immunoprecipitation strategies, although it has also been shown that heterodimeric complexes are formed upon bacterial co-expression of Commd1-Commd6, Commd1-Commd5 and Commd9-Commd5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan et al., 2015</xref>). To study these pairwise interactions systematically we initially attempted a GST pull down assay with purified His-tagged Commd1 and all of the GST-tagged COMMD members. However, we did not observe any significant interactions using this approach (not shown). Next, we assessed whether co-translation would lead to heterodimeric interactions. GST-baits (all COMMDs) were co-expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> with selected His-tagged preys (Commd1, 7, 9 and 10) followed by affinity purification using glutathione sepharose beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Western blotting was used to confirm interactions unambiguously as GST and His-tagged COMMD proteins are similar molecular weights. GST-Commd8 was not included in these experiments due to the tendency of this protein to degrade. This assay reveals that all of the COMMD proteins are able to co-assemble with each other in a highly promiscuous manner, while the lack of binding using separately purified proteins suggests that no exchange occurs between pre-formed homodimeric proteins. In general there is little specificity seen in the heteromeric complexes formed, although Commd10 binds most strongly to Commd2 and Commd5 and only weakly with Commd9, while Commd9 binds weakly to Commd6.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35898.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>COMMD proteins form an array of homo and heterodimers via the C-terminal COMM domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A representative Coomassie image showing the relative expression of the GST fusion COMMD proteins (top).

To test this we next performed our co-expression GST-pull down assays with His-tagged COMM domains of Commd1 and Commd9 and the HN domain of Commd1 as prey. While no interaction was observed between any COMMD proteins and the N-terminal domain of Commd1, strong interactions were seen for C-terminal COMM domains of Commd1 and Commd9 mirroring the full-length proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Overall, our data indicates that COMMD proteins form promiscuous homo- and heterodimeric complexes through their C-terminal COMM domains. The fact that COMMD-COMMD interactions could only be reconstituted after co-translation suggest that these complexes most likely involve the formation of dimeric structures analogous to that seen in the Commd9 COMM domain crystal structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Reconstitution of stable heteromeric COMMD complexes</title><p>Our GST pulldown experiment demonstrates that Commd10 preferentially binds to Commd2 and Commd5. To assess the stoichiometry of heteromeric Commd complexes, we co-expressed GST-Commd5 with Commd10-His and purified the complex by sequential affinity purification using glutathione sepharose and TALON beads. The eluted complex was subjected to size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to obtain a 1:1 stoichiometric complex. The SEC fractions under the peak clearly show reconstitution of a 1:1 Commd5-Commd10 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Since the COMM domain singularly mediates the formation of homo- and heteromeric complexes of COMMD proteins, we also attempted to make the complex using the full-length Commd5 and COMM domain of Commd10 and COMM domains of Commd5 and Commd10 respectively. Indeed,highly pure and stoichiometric species were isolated confirming the role of the COMM domain in COMMD complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Several Commd proteins form COMM domain dependent homodimers and this prompted us to investigate the biophysical properties of Commd5-Commd10 complexes. SEC-MALLS analysis of Commd5-Commd10 reveals that the complex is highly monodisperse in solution. Although the combined theoretical molecular weight of these proteins is 47.5 kDa, the experimental mass was calculated to be 85 kDa, which suggests the existence of a Commd5-Commd10 heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Along the same lines, the Commd5-Commd10 COMM domain complex appears to also form a heterotetrameric assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Altogether, these data raises two possibilities. First, COMM domains of Commd5 and Commd10 form homodimers and assemble together as a tetramer. Second, the Comm domain of Commd5 and Commd10 when expressed together form heterodimers ultimately forming the larger heterotetramer. In both of these scenarios, COMMD proteins are seemingly interacting with each other through a second binding interface on the COMM domain that is potentially distinct from the dimerization interface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>The COMM domains bind the calponin homology domains of CCDC22 and CCDC93</title><p>Central to the endosomal trafficking function of COMMD proteins is their assembly into the CCC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mallam and Marcotte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan et al., 2015</xref>).

Interestingly, CCDC22 and CCDC93 bind to COMMDs chiefly through the NN-CH domain.

Specifically, Commd1 and Commd9 bind more strongly to the N-terminal NN-CH domain of CCDC93 in comparison to CCDC22. Moreover, this assay also suggests that Commd1 has stronger affinity than Commd9 for CCDC proteins. The interaction of the CCDC22 and CCDC93 NN-CH domains with the COMM domain of Commd1 was recapitulated and quantified using biolayer interferometry (BLiTz). A dose-dependent increase in the binding of the COMM domain of Commd1 with NN-CH of CCDC22 and CCDC93 was observed, and the affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) was calculated to be 10.3 and 14.6 µM respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Commd proteins bind to CCDC22 and CCDC93 via a conserved site</title><p>To identify the molecular determinants that govern the interaction between the COMM domain of COMMDs and NN-CH domain of CCDC22 and CCD93, we used cross-linking mass spectrometry (MS) in combination with pull down experiments. Non-deuterated BS3 cross-linker was used to crosslink full-length Commd9 with the NN-CH domain of CCDC93. Due to the availability of HN and COMM domain structures, Commd9 was chosen for these experiments. The NN-CH domain of CCDC22 could not be used as it does not contain any lysine residues. Upon crosslinking, three major bands (labeled as 1, 2 and 3) in the Commd9 and NN-CH domain of CCDC93 mixture were observed, which were excised for MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

GFP-tagged Commd1 wild type and mutant were expressed in HeLa cells following lentiviral transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). As seen previously, Commd1 is localized to endosomal puncta, and colocalises with the WASH complex subunit Fam21. Surprisingly however, the mutant Commd1 is also colocalised with Fam21 on endosomes, despite being defective for membrane binding in vitro. We propose therefore that this site on Commd1 may instead be important for non-specific membrane interactions and perhaps for the orientation of the CCC complex on endosomes, but in the context of the assembled complex with other COMMD proteins it is not required for specific recruitment to PtdIns3<italic>P</italic>-enriched endosomal compartments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The COMMD proteins were recently identified as conserved and central components of the CCC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mallam and Marcotte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNally et al., 2017</xref>), a large endosome-associated assembly that regulates cell surface recycling of various transmembrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNally et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phillips-Krawczak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartuzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan et al., 2015</xref>). Despite the high degree of conservation of the COMMD proteins, and the CCC complex more generally, little is known about the structures or the stoichiometries of the component subunits, or how these proteins assemble together to control membrane recruitment and protein trafficking. In this study we provide the first insights into the architecture of the COMMD proteins, and the mechanisms that underpin the previously reported interactions between the various family members. COMMD proteins form obligatory dimers, and interact with each other in promiscuous homo- and heterodimeric arrangements via the C-terminal COMM domain. Furthermore this small domain is essential for pleiotropic interactions with both the CCC proteins CCDC93 and CCDC22, and with negatively charged phospholipid membranes. The solution structures of Commd1, Commd7 and Commd9 reveal a modular architecture with the α-helical N-terminal HN domains arranged as flexible appendages to the C-terminal COMM domain dimers. Previous studies had described the N-terminal region as a variable domain that could provide functional diversity to the COMMD proteins, due to the low level of sequence homology in this region across the family. Our biophysical, structural and bioinformatics analyses however show that the HN domain is a structurally conserved feature shared by all COMMD family members.</p><p>The architecture of the COMMD proteins revealed here bears a remarkable resemblance to the orthologous CT584 and Cpn0803, <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-specific proteins from <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> and <italic>C. pneumonia</italic> respectively. The function of these proteins is unknown, although there is evidence that Cpn0803 can interact with phospholipids as well as components of the Type III secretion system responsible for injection of bacterial effectors into the host cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stone et al., 2012</xref>). What does the homology of COMMD proteins to these chlamydial proteins imply? Chlamydial species are intracellular pathogens that reside inside a membrane vacuole called the inclusion. During their life cycle they secrete many effectors that can hijack the intracellular trafficking and signalling machinery of the host cell to promote survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pruneda et al., 2016</xref>). We speculate therefore that the CT584/Cpn0803 proteins may be secreted effectors with a potential to mimic or modify COMMD protein functions, although this remains to be confirmed. The evolutionary relationship of the COMMD proteins to the chlamydial homologues is also an interesting question. Several chlamydial proteins are believed to have evolved through horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotic hosts, such as SWIB domain-containing proteins and Swi/Snf2 helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastidas and Valdivia, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stephens et al., 1998</xref>), and it is possible that the CT584/Cpn0803 genes have been acquired in a similar fashion. Both CT584 and Cpn0803 form hexameric structures composed of a trimer of dimers, with the N-terminal domains providing the primary interface for trimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stone et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4E</xref>). While full-length recombinant Commd1, Commd7 and Commd9 proteins analysed here form homodimers, it is tempting to speculate that the N-terminal domains of COMMD proteins will contribute to formation of higher-order heteromeric assemblies that are present in the 600 kDa CCC complexes isolated from cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan et al., 2015</xref>), the stoichiometries and structures of which remain to be determined.</p><p>Although the COMMD proteins play a central role in endosomal membrane trafficking as components of the CCC complex, they have also been implicated in a number of other cellular processes. The gene encoding Commd1 (originally called Murr1) was originally identified in dogs with copper toxicosis, which has been mechanistically linked to interactions with the Wilson disease ATPase protein ATP7B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tao et al., 2003</xref>). Most prominently, Commd1 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the transcription factor NF-κB, a master regulator of inflammation, and other COMMD proteins also display similar activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maine and Burstein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Bie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganesh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartuzi et al., 2013</xref>). Commd1 acts downstream of the inhibitory IκB kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganesh et al., 2003</xref>), and is believed to associate with NF-κB subunits at chromosomal loci and promote NF-κB ubiquitination by Cullin family ubiquitin ligases for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maine et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mao et al., 2011</xref>). A similar function has been proposed for Commd1 regulation of the HIF-1α transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van de Sluis et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2009</xref>). The COMM domain fold is structurally related to the repeat domains found in the PUR (purine-rich element binding protein) family protein Pur-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graebsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weber et al., 2016</xref>). Pur-α contains three such repeat domains, the first two of which form an intramolecular ‘dimer’ while the third forms an intermolecular dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weber et al., 2016</xref>) that both resemble the dimeric COMM domain topology. Pur-α is a nucleic acid binding protein that plays important roles in the transcription of neuronal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gallia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">White et al., 2009</xref>), and is associated with GGGGCC-containing inclusions in ALS-FTD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). The similarity of the COMM domain with Pur-α suggests the intriguing possibility that COMMD proteins could also interact with DNA and/or RNA to regulate transcription, although it should be noted that the specific DNA binding site in Pur-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weber et al., 2016</xref>) is not conserved in the COMMD proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>The CCC complex and associated COMMD proteins are predominantly localised to early endosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phillips-Krawczak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartuzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNally et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burkhead et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drévillon et al., 2011</xref>). The mechanism of membrane recruitment of the complex however is unknown. Most intracellular trafficking complexes rely on binding to proteins such as the Rab GTPases and membrane lipids such as phosphoinositides for their spatio-temporal recruitment to specific compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cullen, 2011</xref>). COMMD proteins show significant but non-preferential binding to a variety of negatively charged lipids, and these interactions appear to be maintained by the COMM domain. Our data also highlights that the HN domain is dispensable for membrane association, which is in line with the work of Burkhead et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burkhead et al., 2009</xref>). The membrane-binding surface of Commd1 in vitro is composed of residues from both molecules of the homodimer, but interestingly this does not appear essential for endosomal localisation of Commd1 in cells. This suggests that the ability of COMMD proteins to associate with membranes is only one part of a more complicated array of interactions controlling specific endosomal membrane recruitment, likely involving different lipid binding properties of heterodimeric COMMD proteins and other CCC complex subunits. Supporting a role for other subunits and complexes in specific endosomal localisation of the CCC complex, the depletion of CCDC93 or the WASH complex subunit Fam21 both lead to a loss of Commd1 from endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phillips-Krawczak et al., 2015</xref>), while the depletion of CCDC22 causes a redistribution of Commd1 and Commd10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Starokadomskyy et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The ability to self-assemble and form heteromeric complexes is a core property of the COMMD proteins identified in some of the very first studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burstein et al., 2005</xref>). Our work provides a clear structural explanation for how homo- and heterodimers are formed by the different family members, and begins to suggest mechanisms for how different domains could contribute to the formation of larger assemblies, how they associate with biological membranes, and how they become incorporated into the CCC complex through interactions with the CCDC proteins. As COMMD-containing complexes emerge as key regulators of cellular trafficking, signalling and transcription, the details of these molecular interactions and the systems that regulate them remain outstanding questions to be answered.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and phospholipids</title><p>The monoclonal mouse anti-His antibody was purchased from Genscript Corporation (catalog no.

The reaction was quenched by addition of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and the cross-linked products were analysed by SDS-PAGE and subjected to MS analysis. A negative control cross-linking reaction was performed between the full-length Commd9 and lysozyme using the same condition described above. For the positive control cross-linking reaction, the purified retromer complex at 15 μM was reacted with 100 molar excess of BS3-d0 cross-linker. BS3-d0 was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (catalog no.

Its 10 members in human are implicated in cellular trafficking and the regulation of transcription. The proteins consists of an N-terminal calponin homology-like domain (HN) and a C-terminal COMM domain. To understand the molecular basis for its function, the authors of this study determined the crystal structure of the isolated COMM and HN domain of COMMD9. They found that COMM domains form homo- and heteromeric assemblies via a highly conserved interface, whereas the HN domain is monomeric. SAXS measurements with the full-length constructs of Commd1, Commd7 and Commd9 were used to extract information on the quaternary assembly. Using pull-down studies, gel filtration analysis and Blitz measurements, they further characterized heteroassembly of COMMDs within the family and with the CCC components CCDC22 and 93. Finally, they found unspecific membrane-binding of Commd 10 to liposomes of various compositions. Mutations of a basic patch in Commd10 reduced membrane binding but not its cellular localization on endosomal structures.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) COMMD homo- and heterodimers:</p><p>Homo- and heterodimerization seems to be promiscuous among Commd proteins. While Commd1, Commd7 and Commd9 behave as 1/1 homodimers (Figure 1A), the Commd5-Commd10 complex behaves as a 2/2 heterotetramer (Figure 7E). From Figure 7A, it seems that by co-expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>, Commd10 binds strongly to Commd2. Is heterotetramerization also applicable to Commd10- Commd2 complex?. Is tetramerization a property of heterodimers?.</p><p>2) COMMD-CCC interactions:</p><p>COMMD domains of Commd1, Commd7 and Commd10 interact directly with the NN-CH domain of CCD22 and CCDC93 whereas Commd9 binds specifically to CCDC93 (Figure 8). The crystal structure of COMMD9 presented in this work and the homology model of COMMD1 (Figure 9B) should facilitate the identification of a similar surface patch, distinct from the conserved dimerization core, responsible for binding to the NN-CH domain of CCDC93. Authors could exploit this structural information together with site-directed mutagenesis and bio-layer interferometry as shown in Figure 8C, D to identify and confirm the binding interface. This would add a great value to the present work.</p><p>3) Membrane association:</p><p>The basic patch (K129, R133, H134, K167) identified in COMM1 that is important for interaction with model membranes, is not conserved in Commd7 or Commd10, which also interact with membranes (Figure 9A). Furthermore, this patch is neither conserved in other Commd members (Figure 3B) suggesting a singular and partial mechanism only applicable to Comm1. How other Commd complexes, dimers or heterodimers, are recruited to the membrane remain unknown. One possibility for membrane recruitment might be through interaction with the CCC complex but exploring this possibility would require the identification of the conserved patch in COMMD proteins for binding to CCDC22 and/or CCDC93.</p><p>4) Figure 5: The graphs on top are too small to recognize anything. More importantly, the scattering curves and the resulting envelopes look very similar. Given the ambiguities in fitting such low resolution envelopes, the authors should not make any firm conclusions on the details of the assemblies, since they are most likely wrong. The firm conclusions of these measurements appear to be: Homomeric COMMDs form a dimer in SAXS. In some likelihood, the COMMD domains are in the center whereas the HN domains are at the periphery.. the authors are recommended to tone down the conclusions of different assemblies and maybe only show data and the model of Commd9 in the main manuscript.</p><p>5) Figure 7A: Commd8: There is hardly any protein of the correct size in the Commassie gel, and it appears even unclear whether the proposed band is at all related to COMM8. Strangely enough, this protein still interacts with high efficiency with all Commd proteins. That does not make much sense: Either improve or remove.</p><p>6) Figure 8A: Again, hardly any CCDC22 full length is expressed and a strong interaction with COMM1 is observed (both with the N- and C-terminal domains of CCDC22 – the authors should also comment on this in the main manuscript). Furthermore, COMM1 also appears to be partly pulled down by GST. This is worrisome, there seems to be an unspecific binding of COMM1 to almost anything and the data for CCDC22 are uninterpretable. These experiments should be improved, for example with more stringent washing conditions or finding better expression conditions.</p><p>7) The structural homology analysis of COMMD proteins to Pur-α, CT584 and Cpn0803, do not contribute much to the overall story and are distractive. In this sense, the homology only hints at a shared fold for dimerization but there is no support for functional similarities to Pur-α, or mimicking function by the chlamydial proteins. This section might be shortened and/or incorporated into supplementary material.</p><p>8) The liposome binding experiments appear to lack a negative control – i.e. liposomes that are not acidic such as those of pure PC.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structural insights into the architecture and membrane interactions of the conserved COMMD proteins&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues about the text that the reviewers agree need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) In the summary the authors make a claim on defining the core principles of Commd homo- and heteromeric assembly. This is clearly an overstated claim as the interaction between Commd proteins seems to be quite promiscuous and still there are no clear principles of how homodimer-versus-heterodimer preference is achieved.</p><p>2) Crosslinking data: The WRVD motif should be better introduced. The cross-linked results are interesting and narrow down the potential interface between Commd9 and CCDC93, yet the proposed WRVD motif seems to be part of the conserved dimerisation core (Figure 2). Based on the calponin homology domain of CCDC93, the structure of Commd9, the BS3 cross linking distance, and conserved residues on the surface, authors should be able to propose a plausible contact area in Commd9 despite the NMR unfruitful results.</p><p>3) Figure 4: I am still not happy to see three different molecular models for full length Commd1, Commd7 and Commd9. It's just misleading, the envelopes look all the same. One representative model showing that the COMMD and HN domain fit into all envelopes would be completely sufficient and less confusing.</p><p>4) Following our initial advice, Figure 5 should go to the supplement.</p><p>5) Typo: subsection “COMM domain binds to CCDC22 and CCDC93 through a conserved motif”, first paragraph – should be K133, not K131 (K131 is the residue in CCDC93).</p><p>6) Subsection “COMM domain binds to CCDC22 and CCDC93 through a conserved motif” – is missing a full stop.</p><p>7) Figure 3—figure supplement 1: aa numbers 151 to 200 are missing.</p><p>8) Figure 7 legend: Description for panel D is missing (CCDC93 interaction).</p><p>I hope that addressing these points will not be difficult for you. If you can provide a point-by-point summary of the changes you have made I should be able to make a final decision without having to consult the reviewers again.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35898.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) COMMD homo- and heterodimers:</p><p>Homo- and heterodimerization seems to be promiscuous among Commd proteins.

We have been able to reconstitute this complex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), however due to poor yield we have not been able to conduct MALS experiments to determine the precise oligomeric state. Interestingly, this heterodimer does not appear to be a 1:1 complex on gels, although we can’t yet be sure until we improve the purification protocols. We therefore believe that Commd10-Commd2 can behave in a similar manner to the Commd10-Commd5 complex, but we can't yet state if tetramerisation is a common property.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35898.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Commd2-Commd10 co-purification.</title><p>GST-Commd2 was co-expressed with Commd9-His, proteins were then purified by GST-affinity chromatography, thrombin cleavage and then His-tag affinity chromatography.

This new data together with text has been included in the revised manuscript. While this data now identifies a region on the Commd9 COMM domain that is involved in binding to the CCDC93 CC-NH, we have not been able to discover a point mutant that blocks this interaction based on this information. Until we are able to determine a high-resolution structure of the complex between the two proteins we would argue that this is likely just because XL-MS is unable to define the process side-chains required for binding.</p><p>We also attempted to use NMR to test whether it is possible to assign the backbone of the Commd9 COMM domain for titration mapping experiments with NN-CH domains of CCDC22 and CCDC93. However, the NMR spectra in the conditions tested did not give <sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra that can be used for such experiments.</p><p>These data are included in the new Figure 8, the previous Figure 8 is now Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Membrane association:</p><p>The basic patch (K129, R133, H134, K167) identified in COMM1 that is important for interaction with model membranes, is not conserved in Commd7 or Commd10, which also interact with membranes (Figure 9A).

Indeed as our data for Commd1 shows, although it can bind membranes this doesn’t appear to be essential for specific endosomal localization. We actually debated showing this negative data, but eventually felt it was important to show this for completeness. Although speculation, we think that the avidity effect provided by all of the COMMD members and perhaps through direct interaction of other CCC components with membranes and membrane-associated proteins will prove to be key determinants for endosomal recruitment. As discussed above although we now have used XL-MS to gain an insight into the interaction region of Commd9 with CCDC proteins, we are not yet able to generate specific mutants that perturb these interactions to determine the importance in membrane recruitment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5: The graphs on top are too small to recognize anything.

We have also changed the language in the text to suggest that SAXS data confirms the MALLS and crystallography data that COMMD proteins are homodimers in solution. We agree that bold interpretations cannot be made from the scattering experiments, however at the least the data clearly shows the overall shape of various COMMD proteins, and confirms their homodimeric nature. Therefore, we have for now opted to keep all of the SAXS data in this revised version.</p><p>The old Figure 5 is now replaced with Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 7A: Commd8: There is hardly any protein of the correct size in the Commassie gel, and it appears even unclear whether the proposed band is at all related to COMM8.

The protein appears to be binding other Commd proteins and fragments, as seen in the western blotting-based detection method we have employed that is quite sensitive. However, on the advice of reviewers we have removed this data for Commd8.</p><p>Figure 7 has been changed to Figure 6 due to merging of Figure 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 8A: Again, hardly any CCDC22 full length is expressed and a strong interaction with COMM1 is observed (both with the N- and C-terminal domains of CCDC22 – the authors should also comment on this in the main manuscript).

With regards to the full length CCDC22 protein band, like Commd8, CCDC22 also has a tendency to degrade in to smaller fragments. However, there is still some fraction of intact GST fused CCDC22 visible on the Coomassie stained gel as shown by the asterisk and since the detection method is very sensitive, we can still detect an interaction band.</p><p>We have also repeated the pull down again and have included the new blot in the revised manuscript. In this new round, the non-specific GST binding has been reduced and comparison with other bands on the gel clearly shows that the interaction to CCDC proteins is specific. We also note that GST is expressed heavily compared to the other bait proteins.</p><p>Please note, Figure 8 is now Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The structural homology analysis of COMMD proteins to Pur-α, CT584 and Cpn0803, do not contribute much to the overall story and are distractive.

The cross-linked results are interesting and narrow down the potential interface between Commd9 and CCDC93, yet the proposed WRVD motif seems to be part of the conserved dimerisation core (Figure 2).

We have now modified the text and also Figure 7 showing the sites of lysine cross-linking to better explain our finding. What we observe is that the two major sites of lysine cross-linking in the Commd9 COMM domain are part of a contiguous surface, and that this surface also includes the residues from the conserved sequence <sup>128</sup>WRVD<sup>131</sup>. The strictly conserved Trp128 in particular does make key contacts that appear to be required for COMM domain dimerization. But, unusually for a Trp side-chain, it is also surface exposed, suggesting it may be part of a binding surface for the CCDC93 NN-CH domain. However, we did not want to speculate too much based on our data and have therefore modified the text as follows:</p><p>“Notably, K133 and K152 are located on contiguous surfaces of the β-sheets of the COMM domains (Figure 7D), suggesting a likely binding surface for the CCDC93 NN-CH domain. This surface also includes the side-chains of the conserved residues <sup>128</sup>WRVD<sup>131</sup>, with Trp128 in particular being strictly conserved across the entire Commd family (Figure 2B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4: I am still not happy to see three different molecular models for full length Commd1, Commd7 and Commd9.
