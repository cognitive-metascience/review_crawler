We investigate here the biochemical properties of the <italic>E. coli</italic> RadA protein and several mutant forms. RadA is a DNA-dependent ATPase, a DNA-binding protein and can stimulate the branch migration phase of RecA-mediated strand transfer reactions. RadA cannot mediate synaptic pairing between homologous DNA molecules but can drive branch migration to extend the region of heteroduplex DNA, even without RecA. Unlike other branch migration factors RecG and RuvAB, RadA stimulates branch migration within the context of the RecA filament, in the direction of RecA-mediated strand exchange. We propose that RadA-mediated branch migration aids recombination by allowing the 3’ invading strand to be incorporated into heteroduplex DNA and to be extended by DNA polymerases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10807.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10807.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10807.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Damage to the DNA of a cell can cause serious harm, and so cells have several ways in which they can repair DNA. Most of these processes rely on the fact that each of the two strands that make up a DNA molecule can be used as a template to build the other strand. However, this is not possible if both strands of the DNA break in the same place. This form of damage can be repaired in a process called homologous recombination, which uses an identical copy of the broken DNA molecule to repair the broken strands. As a result, this process can only occur during cell division shortly after a cell has duplicated its DNA.</p><p>One important step of homologous recombination is called strand exchange. This involves one of the broken strands swapping places with part of the equivalent strand in the intact DNA molecule. To do so, the strands of the intact DNA molecule separate in the region that will be used for the repair, and the broken strand can then use the other non-broken DNA strand as a template to replace any missing sections of DNA. The region of the intact DNA molecule where the strands need to separate often grows during this process: this is known as branch migration. In bacteria, a protein called RecA plays a fundamental role in controlling strand exchange, but there are other, similar proteins whose roles in homologous recombination are less well known.</p><p>Cooper and Lovett have now purified one of these proteins, called RadA, from the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> species of bacteriato study how it affects homologous recombination. This revealed that RadA can bind to single-stranded DNA and stimulate branch migration to increase the rate of homologous recombination. Further investigation revealed that RadA allows branch migration to occur even when RecA is missing, but that RadA is unable to begin strand exchange if RecA is not present. The process of branch migration stabilizes the DNA molecules during homologous recombination and may also allow the repaired DNA strand to engage the machinery that copies DNA.</p><p>Cooper and Lovett also used genetic techniques to alter the structure of specific regions of RadA and found out which parts of the protein affect the ability of RadA to stimulate branch migration. Future challenges are to find out what effect RadA has on the structure of RecA and how RadA promotes branch migration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10807.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10807.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>DNA damage response</kwd><kwd>double-strand break repair</kwd><kwd>DNA mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM51753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lovett</surname><given-names>Susan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The role of the bacterial protein RadA in homologous recombination – a DNA repair pathway vital to all cells – is defined.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All organisms have complex mechanisms to accurately replicate and repair their chromosomes to maintain genetic integrity. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the RecA protein promotes repair of DNA lesions directly through its role in homologous recombination (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Persky and Lovett, 2008</xref>]). In addition, it promotes repair indirectly by the recruitment of repair polymerases to damaged replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patel et al., 2010</xref>) and by activation of the SOS response, a transcriptional response to DNA damage (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simmons et al., 2009</xref>]). Each of these processes depends on the formation of RecA filaments on single-strand DNA (ssDNA).</p><p>In vitro RecA mediates strand exchange, a key step of recombination, in three distinct phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radding et al., 1983</xref>). The first phase is the formation of the presynaptic filament on ssDNA. RecA filaments form when dimers nucleate on DNA in a slow step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2012</xref>); subsequently the filament is extended in both directions, although at a higher rate at the 3’ end of the RecA:ssDNA filament. When ssDNA is bound in the primary DNA binding site of the RecA filament, it is underwound relative to B-form dsDNA such that the RecA-DNA filament has about 18 bases per turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galletto et al., 2006</xref>). ATP binding, but not hydrolysis, is required for active RecA filament formation. The second phase involves the homology search process and strand-pairing in which duplex DNA is bound and sampled for pairing through a secondary DNA binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazin and Kowalczykowski, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">1998</xref>). After homologous DNA molecules are paired, the third phase of strand exchange involves branch migration, in which the region of heteroduplex DNA formed between the two strand exchange partners is extended. The heteroduplex is initially bound through RecA primary site interactions, with the displaced strand(s) in the secondary site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mazin and Kowalczykowski, 1998</xref>). ATP hydrolysis is required for complete heteroduplex product formation when the homologous molecules exceed several kilobases in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jain et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Several proteins modulate the RecA filament, regulating the recombination activity of RecA and its potentially mutagenic activity resulting from induction of the SOS response. These accessory proteins include those involved in RecA nucleation onto ssDNA (PsiB), in loading and unloading of RecA onto DNA coated with single-strand DNA binding protein (SSB) (RecFOR) and in regulating RecA filament stability (DinI and RecX) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox (2007)</xref>). Other proteins such as UvrD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Petrova et al., 2015</xref>), PcrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fagerburg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2010</xref>), and RuvAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eggleston et al., 1997</xref>), and DinD dismantle RecA filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uranga et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotes, there are several paralogs of the major recombination protein Rad51 that either modulate Rad51 activity or are specialized strand-exchange proteins themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adelman and Boulton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gasior et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qing et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suwaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). In bacteria, there is at least one partially characterized RecA paralog, RadA. RadA (also known as 'Sms', for 'sensitivity to methyl methane<underline>s</underline>ulfonate' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Song and Sargentini, 1996</xref>] was identified as a radiation-sensitive mutant of <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diver et al., 1982a</xref>]) and is required for DNA recombination and repair in many diverse bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beam et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burghout et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrasco et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castellanos and Romero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krüger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lovett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Slade et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, RadA is a possible candidate for a RecA accessory protein. Despite its name, RadA of eubacteria is not orthologous to RadA of archaea, the latter being a true strand-exchange protein, functionally and structurally similar to bacterial RecA and eukaryotic Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seitz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>E. coli,</italic> RadA affects recombination measured by certain in vivo assays, often in a manner partially redundant to other functions that mediate late steps of homologous recombination. Loss of <italic>radA,</italic> by itself, reduces recovery of genetic rearrangements at tandem-repeated sequences, which are promoted by defects in the replication fork helicase, DnaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lovett, 2006</xref>). In addition, loss of RadA reduces homologous recombination when in combination with loss of RuvAB or RecG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beam et al., 2002</xref>), as measured by conjugation with Hfr donors. RuvAB and RecG are DNA motor proteins that branch-migrate recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions during the late stages of homologous recombination (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Persky and Lovett, 2008</xref>). For sensitivity to genotoxins including azidothymidine (AZT), ciprofloxacin (CPX) and UV irradiation, mutations in <italic>radA</italic> are especially strongly synergistic with those in <italic>recG</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beam et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>). This genotoxin-sensitivity in <italic>radA recG</italic> strains appears to be due, in part, to the accumulation of recombination intermediates, since it can be suppressed by early blocks to recombination (by mutations in <italic>recF</italic> or <italic>recA</italic>) or by overexpression of RuvAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>). These genetic observations implicate RadA in late steps of recombination, potentially involving branch migration of recombination intermediate DNA structures such as Holliday junctions.</p><p>RadA is a 460 amino acid protein that has three well-conserved domains found in other proteins, as well as a 5-amino acid motif highly conserved among <italic>radA</italic> orthologs. The N-terminal 30 amino acids form a putative zinc-finger domain with a C4 motif, CXXC-X<sub>n</sub>-CXXC. In bacteria, proteins with this domain include the DNA repair proteins UvrA and RecR, and the ATP-dependent serine protease ClpX. <italic>The E. coli radA100</italic> mutation, a C28Y mutation in the putative Zn finger motif, negates <italic>radA</italic> function in vivo and is partially dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diver et al., 1982b</xref>). The second RadA domain (aa 59–184) is homologous to the ATPase region of RecA and contains both Walker A and Walker B boxes and regions homologous to its L1 and L2 loops involved in primary site DNA binding. A RadA-K108R mutation at the Walker A sequence is a dominant-negative RadA allele in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>). The C-terminal 150 amino acids comprise a predicted S5 domain 2-type fold, (EMBL-EBI Interpro subgroup IPR014721, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/IPR014721">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/IPR014721</ext-link>), present in ribosomal proteins S5 and S9, EF-G, Lon, RNase P, MutL, and several DNA topoisomerases. Deletion of this domain negates RadA functions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>). In BLAST alignments, this region is most closely related to the ATP-dependent serine protease Lon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung and Goldberg, 1981</xref>). Mutation of serine 372 of RadA, comparable in alignments to the active site serine of Lon, did not affect RadA genetic function and this serine is not conserved among RadAs; this and the lack of other conserved residues of the Lon protease catalytic triad indicate that RadA is unlikely to possess serine protease activity. Between the RecA and S5 domain 2 domains, there is a conserved motif specific to RadA proteins, KNRFG, a motif also found in the phage 29 structure-specific nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giri et al., 2009</xref>). The K258A mutation in this motif negates RadA function and is partially dominant in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To explore RadA function in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we purified wild type RadA as well as several site-directed mutants altered in conserved motifs of the protein. We found that the wild-type RadA protein preferentially binds single-strand DNA in the presence of ADP, exhibits ATPase activity stimulated by DNA, and increases the rate of RecA-mediated recombination in vitro by stimulation of branch migration. Branch migration can be mediated by RadA even in the absence of RecA and is highly directional in nature, with preferential extension of the heteroduplex in the 5’ to 3’ direction, relative to the initiating single-strand; this is codirectional with that of RecA-mediated strand exchange. Mutations in the Walker A, KNRFG and zinc finger motifs abolish RadA’s branch migration activity in RecA-coupled reactions and lead to the accumulation of strand exchange intermediate species. The ability of RadA to catalyze branch migration in the context of the RecA filament and its codirectionality with strand exchange distinguish it from other branch migration functions in <italic>E. coli</italic>, RecG and RuvAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whitby et al., 1993</xref>). RadA’s ability to branch migrate recombination intermediates readily explains <italic>radA</italic> mutant phenotypes in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protein purification</title><p>To elucidate RadA structure and function, we purified native wild-type RadA and several RadA domain mutants and then evaluated their biochemical activities, particularly those possessed by the RecA protein.

No binding was detected in the absence of nucleotide, with ATP or dATP or in the presence of poorly-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, ATPγS or AMP-PNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These observations suggest that ADP promotes the most stably DNA-bound RadA. This behavior contrasts to that of RecA, which requires ATP for binding to form the active, extended DNA filament and which dissociates in the presence of ADP.

Like RecA, RadA’s ATPase activity is strongly stimulated by ssDNA. However, RadA’s ATPase is also substantially stimulated by dsDNA whereas dsDNA stimulates RecA's ATPase only after a lag period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kowalczykowski et al., 1987</xref>). RadA’s ATPase activity in the presence of ssDNA was measured to have a kcat of 29.4 min<sup>-1</sup>, comparable to that of RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weinstock et al., 1981</xref>).

This latter observation suggests that, although RecA exhibits stable binding to ssDNA when challenged by SSB, less stable binding by RadA allows for SSB competition and inhibition of its ATPase activity.

In these reactions, final product is visible as early as 2.5 min after RadA addition, with the reaction complete after an additional 5 min. Therefore, RadA need not be present in the reaction during RecA presynaptic filament formation and can stimulate branch migration from RecA-promoted strand-exchange intermediates. Order-of-addition experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) measuring RecA-mediated strand exchange, with and without RadA, showed that RadA strongly stimulated branch migration when added before SSB, but not when added after. In addition, RadA did not detectably stimulate RecA-strand exchange in the absence of SSB. RadA stimulated RecA-mediated strand exchange reactions when RecA concentrations were reduced to suboptimal levels but did not when RecA became limiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). When RecA was held at saturating concentration (6.7 µM) and RadA was titrated, the stimulation of branch migration was detectable at RadA:RecA stoichiometries of as little as 1:223 and reached the maximal detectable stimulation at 1:13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the RadA-stimulated reactions, the time of appearance of final product varied with RadA concentration.</p><p>In the absence of an ATP-regeneration system, the addition of ADP to the 3-strand reaction inhibits strand exchange, primarily by destabilizing the RecA presynaptic filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kahn and Radding, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and Cox, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Piechura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 1982</xref>). As an indication of how RadA might affect the RecA filament, we assayed ADP-inhibition of the standard RecA 3-strand reaction (lacking an ATP-regenerating system), at various concentrations relative to a fixed amount of ATP, 5 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In 60 min reactions with RecA alone, ADP completely inhibited strand-exchange at 4 mM. In reactions containing both RecA and RadA, ADP inhibition of strand exchange was almost complete at 1 mM and complete at 2 mM. Furthermore, even without ADP addition, RadA inhibited RecA 3-strand transfer reactions that lack an ATP-regeneration system. We note that under these reaction conditions, which include SSB, RadA’s ATPase is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), so this result is not simply due to a higher rate of ATP depletion by the mere addition of RadA. Under the conditions used for RecA presynaptic filament formation, addition of RadA at 1:17 RadA:RecA caused a slight reduction in the measured ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which appears to be primarily due to RecA. This may indicate some removal and replacement of RecA with RadA on ssDNA, or alternatively, that RadA, at substoichiometric amounts, can inhibit RecA’s ATPase while bound to ssDNA. RadA did not promote RecA strand transfer or joint molecule formation when SSB was omitted from the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) indicating that RadA does not assist nucleation or filament extension under these conditions. Under no conditions examined did we find that RadA by itself could promote strand-pairing and exchange (for example, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To determine which properties of RecA are required for RadA-stimulation of strand exchange, we next examined strand-exchange catalyzed by RecA K72R, a mutant that can bind but not hydrolyze ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rehrauer and Kowalczykowski, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shan et al., 1996</xref>). These reactions substitute dATP for ATP, which promotes higher affinity of RecA for ssDNA, and lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. As reported previously, the RecA mutant readily catalyzes strand-pairing to form branched intermediates but is inefficient at branch migration to form the final relaxed circular dsDNA product. RadA did indeed accelerate branch migration in RecA K72R-mediated reactions, with final nicked circular product ('NP') visible at 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Therefore, RadA-acceleration of branch migration in RecA-promoted reactions does not require the ATPase of RecA.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10807.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mutational Analysis of 3-strand Recombination Reactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three-strand recombination reactions with RecA K72R and RadA. Recombination reactions with the mutant RecA K72R were performed as described except dATP replaced ATP and the Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub> concentration was decreased to 3 mM.

Interestingly, the RadA K258A mutant appeared to arrest branch migration, with the accumulation of slowly-migrating intermediate species. Final product formation was reduced, more so than reactions that lack RadA. RadA mutants C28Y and K108R also slowed the reactions and reduced the efficiency of strand exchange. In contrast, RadA S372A appeared fully wild-type in its ability to accelerate strand-exchange. These experiments show that RadA’s ATPase activity, negated in the K108R mutant, is required to stimulate branch migration. RadA K258A, a dominant-negative mutant in the 'RadA motif', not only did not accelerate branch migration but also interfered with RecA’s ability to branch migrate, suggesting it binds either to intermediate structures and/or RecA to block the reaction. RadA’s putative zinc finger, affected by the C28Y mutant, is also required to stimulate branch migration.</p><p>To test whether RadA could promote branch migration in the absence of RecA, we performed standard RecA strand-exchange reactions for 12 min and purified the DNA from such reactions after proteinase K/SDS treatment to remove RecA.

To determine if RadA could accelerate branch migration between 4 DNA strands involving true Holliday junctions, we performed RecA strand exchange reactions between linear dsDNA molecules and circular dsDNA with a 1346 nt ssDNA gap. All other conditions were identical to the 3-strand reactions above and the 3-strand reactions were performed in parallel to the 4-strand reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Although RecA by itself efficiently promoted joint molecule formation in the 4-strand reaction, formation of the final branch-migrated product (nicked dsDNA circle, 'NP') was inefficient relative to the 3-strand reaction after 30 min, and most DNA was found in various branched intermediate forms. In the RecA RadA-coupled reaction, the final product was visible at the first time point, 10 min, and accumulation of intermediates was not observed. Therefore, RadA can stimulate branch migration of 4-strand Holliday junctions, as well as 3-strand junctions.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10807.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Four-strand Recombination Reactions in the Presence of RadA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the Four-strand Recombination Reaction. Gapped circular substrate (GS) prepared as described in the procedures was mixed with double-strand φX174 DNA linearized with <italic>Pst</italic>I (DLS) in the presence of RecA, SSB, RadA, ATP and an ATP regenerating system.

Genetic studies have implicated RadA in homologous recombination, particularly in the late steps of recombination intermediate processing. This work presented here provides a biochemical rationale for this role, showing that purified RadA protein can mediate branch migration of recombination intermediates, in the context of a RecA filament and in a direction 5’ to 3’ with respect to the initiating single-strand.</p><p>In theory, branch migration can promote homologous recombination in several ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). If strand exchange is initiated at a site removed from a 3’ end, branch migration can serve to engage the 3’ strand into the heteroduplex region, providing a paired 3’ end that can be extended by DNA polymerases. RadA’s directionality is consistent with this role. Furthermore, RadA's inhibition by SSB may prevent the reverse reaction, the dissolution of this heteroduplex. Branch migration also can extend the heteroduplex region formed between donor and recipient DNA strands, which may aid its stability. Therefore, we might expect RadA to aid the process known as 'break-induced replication' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anand et al., 2013</xref>), during which a resected linear DNA fragment invades a homologous duplex region, and establishes a replication fork. Indeed, RadA is strongly required for exchange events believed to be associated with breakage of the replication fork in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lovett, 2006</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10807.021</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>How branch migration assists homologous recombination.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heteroduplex extension. In reactions between linear resected DNA and an intact chromosome, initial strand pairing and invasion may occur at a distance from the 3’ end. Branch migration of the D-loop (in direction of the arrow) allows the heteroduplex region to extend fully to the 3’ end, allowing it to be engaged by DNA polymerases. Branch migration also allows the D-loop to be extended, lengthening and stabilizing the region of heteroduplex and forming a 4-strand Holliday juntion.

After resection of a broken chromosome and strand invasion into a sister molecule, branch migration is required to dissolve the intermediate, allowing broken strands to anneal to one another and the break to be healed.

It is the average of five experiments.

This mechanism underlies a number of repair events associated with DSBs, including transposon-mediated breaks in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nassif et al., 1994</xref>), mating-type switching in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haber et al., 2004</xref>) and radiation damage-repair in the bacterium <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zahradka et al., 2006</xref>). Initial homologous strand-exchange allows DNA synthesis across the region of the break; subsequent branch migration dissolves the intermediate to allow the broken strand to anneal to itself and to be joined. In <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans, radA</italic> is required for the SDSA reactions that aid extreme radiation resistance in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Slade et al., 2009</xref>). In this case, RadA protein appears to promote the initial joints that prime DNA synthesis but could, in theory, also participate in the subsequent branch migration that resolves such joints to allow annealing. Alternatively, this dissolution might be catalyzed by RecG, whose polarity seems suited for this role (Whitby et al., 1993). Catalysis of branch migration can also allow bypass of barriers such as DNA lesions or regions of non-homology that are sufficient to block spontaneous thermal branch migration.</p><p><italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> possesses three branch migration systems that participate in recombination, RadA, RecG and RuvAB. Genetic analysis indicates that these systems are both somewhat specialized and somewhat redundant (see discussion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>]). How does branch migration catalyzed by RadA differ from that promoted by RecG and RuvAB? One difference is that RadA can function in the context of the RecA synaptic filament, with branches migrated in the direction of RecA-promoted strand transfer. In contrast, when purified RuvAB or RecG are added to ongoing RecA-strand transfer reactions, they decrease the recovery of full strand-exchange products, by accelerating the reverse reaction back to substrate forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whitby et al., 1993</xref>). On RecA-free intermediates, RecG and RuvAB migrate branches preferentially to substrate and product forms, respectively.</p><p>There are two mechanisms by which proteins mediate ATP-driven branch migration, the first exemplified by the <italic>E. coli</italic> RuvAB complex. RuvA forms a tetramer, which specifically binds Holliday junctions; RuvB acts as two hexameric complexes, flanking RuvA and encircling duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parsons et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamada et al., 2002</xref>). RuvB acts as the motor, pumping DNA through the complex and thereby moving the position of the junction. RuvAB has classical helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsaneva et al., 1993</xref>), unwinding DNA strands, and, through the RuvA complex, special affinity for branched structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parsons and West, 1993</xref>). The magnitude of RuvAB ATPase activity depends on the DNA structures to which it is bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abd Wahab et al., 2013</xref>). The RuvAB complex interacts with a nuclease component, RuvC, coupling branch migration to junction cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">West, 1997</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic> branch migration might be limited to providing the preferred sequence (A/T TT G/C) for RuvC cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shah et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shida et al., 1995</xref>). RecG, the other branch-migration protein in <italic>E. coli</italic>, is a DNA translocase with special affinity for branched structures; it is also believed to branch migrate DNA via a motor mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Whitby and Lloyd, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whitby et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, RecA protein catalyzes branch migration by a distinctly different mechanism involving strand-exchange between DNA in the primary and secondary DNA-binding-sites on the RecA filament. Site II-bound DNA has been modeled with the RecA filament as a helix with same average pitch as Site-I-bound DNA (the latter visible in the crystal structure, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2008</xref>]); this modeled Site II-bound DNA, however, has a larger radius and an even more highly extended DNA structure than Site I-bound DNA (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prentiss et al., 2015</xref>]). ATP hydrolysis is required for RecA strand transfer over extended distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jain et al., 1994</xref>); how ATP hydrolysis promotes branch migration via the RecA mechanism is not well understood. Unlike RuvAB, RecA has no special affinity for branched DNA structures nor can it act as a DNA helicase/translocase. The mechanism by which RadA branch migrates DNA is not known, although its RecA-like sequence character, lack of structure-specific binding or helicase activity might suggest a RecA-like mechanism. Further analysis should be revealing.</p><p>Although we have no direct evidence for this, the RecA-like structure of RadA suggests that it might be recruited to a RecA filamens, interacting at its natural interface. Moreover, our ADP inhibition experiments raise the possibility that RadA may destabilize the RecA filament. In vivo, RecA foci become more numerous and persistent in <italic>radA</italic> mutants of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Massoni et al., 2012</xref>), consistent with a role for RadA in RecA postsynaptic filament destabilization. This property may serve to provide a handoff of recombination intermediates from RecA to RadA, facilitating the completion of recombination.</p><p>Strand-exchange paralog proteins are universally found in archaea, eubacteria and eukaryotes. Humans have five such Rad51 proteins, in addition to true strand exchange proteins Rad51 and Dmc1 (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gasior et al., 2001</xref>]). These proteins are required for homologous recombination, albeit to a lesser extent, than their true strand exchange-protein counterparts. The few that have been studied biochemically appear to affect the presynaptic phase of strand exchange by enhancing formation or stability of the Rad51 filament. Rad55/Rad57 of yeast interact with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson and Symington, 1995</xref>) and act as Rad51-mediator proteins to allow Rad51 to overcome inhibition by single-strand DNA-binding protein, RPA, in formation of the Rad51 presynaptic filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sung, 1997</xref>). In the archaea, <italic>Sulfolobus tokodaii</italic> StRad55 protein appears to play a similar role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sheng et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, yeast Rad55/Rad57 have an additional role in stabilizing the Rad51 filament against dissociation by the Srs2 helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The effect of bacterial RadA on late stages of recombination, evident both in vivo and in vitro, presents a new paradigm for strand-exchange paralog proteins that may be shared in other organisms. RFS-1, the sole Rad51 paralog of <italic>C. elegans</italic> has properties consistent with a late recombination role and a RFS-1 peptide can disrupt Rad51 filaments in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adelman and Boulton, 2010</xref>), although recent evidence supports a presynaptic role in remodeling the Rad51 filament to a more flexible form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). The human Rad51C-XRCC3 paralog complex may also have a late recombination role: depletion of Rad51C from cell extracts reduces branch migration capacity and copurifies with HJ cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2006</xref>).</p><p>Although RecA can promote the homology search process, pair DNA and promote branch migration, RadA may be a specialized form, selected for its ability to catalyze faster branch migration and incompetent for homology-search and pairing. Because of its role in synapsis, RecA binding needs to be highly specific for ssDNA, lest it bind indiscriminately to the undamaged chromosome. RadA cannot pair DNA and has weak ability to bind ssDNA, in comparison to RecA. Its capacity to bind DNA in the presence of ADP is an intriguing property. In a study of a RecA mutant (P67G E68A, near the Walker A motif), strand-exchange between lengthy homologies (but not homologies &lt;2 kb) was highly stimulated by ADP and completely inhibited by ATP or an ATP-regenerating system. This finding suggests that the ADP-form of the RecA filament is required, in some way, for the branch migration phase of strand-exchange, as revealed by this particular mutant. RadA binding behavior may naturally reflect this propensity and the stable binding of RadA in the presence of ADP may explain its superior ability to promote branch migration, relative to that by RecA. RadA has stronger dsDNA-stimulated ATPase activity relative to RecA, which may also assist branch migration. Because the role of ATP hydrolysis in RecA strand-exchange is still unclear, further study of RadA-mediated branch migration may provide valuable insights into this mechanism.</p><p>Our study shows that RadA’s ATPase, 'RadA motif' (KNRFG) and Zn-finger motif are essential to the biochemical function of the protein, consistent with our prior genetic results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>). We hypothesize, based on the position of KNFRG element in the RadA sequence, that this motif is required to assemble the ATPase site (comparable to K248 K250 region of RecA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2008</xref>]) at an interface. The Zn-finger appears to assist ssDNA binding but it may also facilitate some protein (SSB, RecA?) or DNA interaction (branched molecules?), since it is required for RadA’s stimulation of branch migration in RecA-coupled reactions.</p><p>Our study does not address the ability of RadA to form a filament or other oligomeric structure with itself or with RecA, an area for further investigation. Threading of RadA onto the RecA presynaptic crystal structure (our unpublished results) suggests that RadA possesses subunit interfaces similar to that of RecA that assemble the ATPase site. In a bacterial one-hybrid assay, RadA was shown to interact with itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marino-Ramirez et al., 2004</xref>), indicating that it forms a multimeric complex. Our early experiments with His<sub>6</sub>-tagged RadA protein, a less active protein than the more native protein characterized here, exhibited multiple bound species in gel-shift experiments with poly(dT)(data not shown), consistent with oligomer formation. RadA’s ability to reduce ATPase activity of RecA in the presence of ssDNA and SSB, its enhancement of ADP-inhibition of RecA-mediated strand exchange and the ability of RadA K258A (and to a lesser extent C28Y and K108R) to inhibit RecA-mediated branch migration are consistent with the notion that RadA joins and destabilizes the RecA filament. Biochemical confirmation of this hypothesis is ongoing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Biochemicals were purchased from USB or Sigma unless noted.

Cultures were grown until the A<sub>590</sub> reached approximately 0.8 at which time IPTG (Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO) was added to 1 mM and arabinose was added to 0.2% (for BL21 AI strains). Growth was continued for 3–4 hr at 30 °C. For production of RadAC28Y and RadAK108A mutant protein, growth conditions were altered so that a 500 ml culture was grown from the initial 20 ml inoculum in LB supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the culture reached an A<sub>590</sub> of 1.0.

After growth of all strains, cells were collected by centrifugation, and the resulting pellet was frozen and stored at -20 °C. RadA was purified with slight modifications from the Biorad eXact protocol. Cleavage of the N-terminal eXact tag produces a RadA protein with the addition of a 2 N-terminal amino acids, threonine serine, (necessary to facilitate efficient cleavage). Typically, pellets from 200 ml of wild type RadA culture were resuspended in 20 ml eXact buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 300 mM sodium acetate.

Lysis was completed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 min followed by homogenization using a Dounce Homogenizer on ice (5 passes with B, followed by 5 passes with A). The crude lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 17000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. One third of the cleared lysate was applied to a 1 ml eXact pre-packed column equilibrated in eXact buffer at room temperature.

To cleave the eXact Tag from RadA, 2 ml cleavage buffer (eXact buffer + 100 mM NaF) was applied to the column, and the column was capped and incubated at room temperature for 45–60 min. RadA was then eluted from the column with eXact buffer + 100 mM NaF. Fractions containing RadA were pooled, diluted in small batches in Q buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol) without salt to give a conductivity of approximately 125 mS<sup>-1</sup> and applied to a 1 ml Q HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with125 mM NaCl Q buffer.

After back-extracting the organic phase with 1 volume of 10 mM Tris-EDTA, all aqueous phases were combined and extracted with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Sodium acetate, pH 5.2 was added to 0.3 M and DNA was precipitated using 2.5 volumes of ethanol. DNA pellets were then washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-EDTA.

author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Recombinational branch migration by the RadA/Sms paralog of RecA in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been evaluated by three expert reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. All of the reviewers found your work to be interesting and believe that it has the potential to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, they also found the work to be too preliminary for publication in its present form, and significant changes to the manuscript will be required before it can be considered further.</p><p>As you will see from the detailed reviews below, the reviewers ask for the following:</p><p>The DNA binding studies are incomplete and need further experimentation. In particular, the binding of RadA to branched structures needs to be carried out in order to confirm that RadA is true branch migration protein as suggested by the key data in the manuscript. The present data showing that RadA only binds poly(dT), while many other DNAs stimulate its ATPase activity, makes little sense and needs to be developed further.</p><p>From the branch migration data presented in the paper it is to be expected that RadA (like RuvAB and RecG) will demonstrate DNA helicase/translocase activity. These experiments need to be carried out. These experiments can also be used to clarify the polarity issues raised by the reviewers.</p><p>All three reviewers have extensive and specific comments that should be addressed. While further experimentation will take some time to complete, I am sure that it will be worthwhile and lead to significant improvements to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes the biochemical properties of the <italic>E. coli</italic> RadA protein. While potentially interesting, the manuscript disappoints due to the poor (or incomplete) quality of some of the datasets. The interpretation of several experiments is also questionable. Some examples:</p><p>DNA binding and ATPase assays: The work suggests that RadA binds to poly(dT) but not poly(dA), (dC) or (dG). Yet these (non-bound) polynucleotides stimulate the ATPase activity of RadA indicating that they do in fact interact with RadA. Presumably the interaction with poly(dT), observed by PAGE is a reflection of the stability of binding rather than binding per se – especially since binding is only seen in the presence of ADP. The turnover rates on the other substrates (and with ATP) may be significantly greater than that observed with poly(dT). Have attempts been made to stabilize complexes by glutaraldehyde fixation? Also, from the gel data provided it is not clear whether the observed binding band represents a defined RadA-DNA complex or an aggregate that fails to enter the gel. Binding assays would benefit from the use of quantitative assays such as fluorescence anisotropy or surface plasmon resonance, rather than gel assays. Given that RadA appears to drive junction branch migration, the assays should be carried out with single-stranded (both defined and random sequence), duplex, 3-arm and 4-arm (Holliday junction) DNA substrates. Only then will the substrate specificity become apparent. Overall, the sections on DNA binding and ATPase activity are naïve and let the manuscript down.</p><p>Branch migration assays: Some of the data showing that RadA promotes branch migration is of low quality. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> looks completely different from the other figure panels, and I find it difficult to conclude anything from the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>The 4-strand reactions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are also problematic, since there appears to be a substantial amount of contaminating single-stranded DNA (SCS) present. Or is this experiment a comparison of the 3- and 4-strand reaction (the legend of the time course does not say what the difference is between the first 4 and the second 4 lanes). As a reader I can only guess. Also, interpretation of these experiments, and the 3-strand reaction described earlier would greatly benefit from the use of 32P-labels. Incidentally, what is a 1.2 gap (as stated in legend).</p><p>Other enzymes that promote branch migration, such as RuvAB and RecG, are DNA translocases/helicases. To make the argument that RadA is a true branch migration protein this needs to be demonstrated for RadA.</p><p>Polarity: The directionality of RecG is 3'-5' relative to single stranded DNA, whereas RuvAB is 5'-3' (the same as RecA). These helicase polarities translate as directionality in the branch migration reactions they promote (at least with 3-stranded reactions). The reader is led to assume that RadA is a translocase similar to RecG or RuvAB – if so then the authors should show it and determine the polarity (rather than propose – without any evidence – that there is a polarity in the way that RadA is recruited to RecA filaments).</p><p>Summary: While the manuscript has some aspects that are potentially interesting, much of the data provided is not of the standard expected for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Also, essential experiments to convince the reader that this is a true branch migration protein are missing – the authors need to demonstrate that RadA shows specific binding to DNA substrates containing 3- or 4-way junctions, and to show that the protein is a DNA translocase (helicase). Without such data the work is simply too preliminary for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The bacterial RecA protein plays an important role in the reconstitution of collapsed replication forks, particularly those in which one arm of the fork has been detached as a double strand break. The reactions promoted by RecA can carry out the key reactions needed to reconstruct the fork. However, there has always been a problem. RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange has been too slow to account for the rates of fork reactivation observed in vivo.</p><p>In this important work, Dr. Lovett and colleagues provide the first in vitro characterization of the <italic>E. coli</italic> RadA protein, a protein that likely solves the strand exchange rate problem. The authors convincingly demonstrate that the addition of RadA to RecA reactions provides an impressive boost to the rates of many RecA reactions, complementing RecA in these endeavors. Although the work opens many new questions about how the rate enhancements are brought about, the overall effort is an extremely important step and provides a window into the (until recently) obscure bacterial RadA protein that should stimulate much additional work. A series of thoughtfully designed point mutants also reveal that the key RadA activities are dependent on the ATP hydrolysis, Zn finger, and unique KNRFG motifs of RadA. While these data provide a great addition to our knowledge of homologous recombination, the following issues need to be addressed:</p><p>The only RadA concentrations used in this study when RecA is present appear to be those needed to effect a 1:17 ratio with RecA (subsection “Strand exchange reactions”, first paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> legend). The reasons for this ratio, or results from other concentrations of RadA, are never presented. Some information should be provided as to why this ratio was chosen and what happens if other RadA concentrations are used. Are the effects of RadA saturated at these concentrations? Can lower levels of RadA suffice? Such information might provide a clue as to how processive or distributive the RadA function is.</p><p>The authors appropriately highlight the fact that RadA migrates the junction in the same direction as RecA (Abstract and end of Introduction). However, the presence of SSB, which will be ubiquitous in the cell, reverses this directionality in experiments where RecA is removed prior to RadA addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). The implications and context of this change in directionality are not discussed.</p><p>What is the difference between the DNA substrates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>? The absence of 0 timepoints in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> makes it hard to figure out what is what.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, perhaps the lower yield of nicked DNA products when RadA is used with RecA K72R is worth commenting on.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Genetic evidence supports role for RadA in <italic>E. coli</italic> in the late steps in recombination, potentially involving branch migration of DNA recombination intermediates. In this manuscript, the authors purified wild type RadA and several mutant proteins, and showed that RadA increases the rate of RecA-mediated recombination in vitro by stimulation of branch migration. Authors also showed that RadA preferentially binds single-strand DNA in the presence of ADP and that it exhibits ATPase activity stimulated by DNA. The results are interesting and novel, and given that <italic>E. coli</italic> recombination has been very extensively studied, the findings are particularly unexpected. The general finding that RadA can convert 3-stranded joint molecule intermediates into Holliday junctions is important.</p><p>That said, the manuscript is not without its flaws. The presentation of some data in some figures is not well done, and has the feeling more of a lab report, rather than manuscript written for a broad readership. Finally, putting editorial and presentation issues aside, the results presented do support the authors' conclusions. However, the choice of some of the experiments that were done is at best quirky, and in some cases, stopping just short of what could have/should have been done.</p><p>Knowing that RadA promotes migration of 3-way and 4-way junctions, the DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis experiments in this manuscript stop short of supporting the proposed the branch migration function of RadA during recombination: they fall into the category of basic characterization. Perhaps though not essential, the authors should have tested 4-way junctions or branched DNA substrates in their DNA binding and ATPase activity assays: they only tested ssDNA and dsDNA and consequently those data do not directly address the function of RadA during branch migration. Furthermore, in the competition experiments, they showed that RadA binds to ssDNA especially poly dT, but did not test any branched structures. Enigmatically, they showed that phiX174 ssDNA stimulated the ATPase of RadA, although RadA apparently does not bind to this DNA in mobility shift experiment (&quot;data not shown&quot;). These results do not help to understand the branch migration function of RadA.</p><p>The choice to present the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> as essentially raw data without any labels makes it nearly unintelligible. The authors should relegate this figure (corrected as indicated below) to the supplementary info, and instead provide panel A as a table or bar graph; B, as an x-y graph, and C as a table or bar graph.</p><p>The same comment applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: The authors should relegate this figure to the supplementary info, and instead provide panels A and B as a table or bar graph.</p><p>More specific comments:</p><p>In the Abstract, the authors say &quot;RadA (Sms)&quot; but there is no explanation for what &quot;Sms&quot; is even in the main text and its relationship to RadA.</p><p>In the Abstract it is stated: &quot;Unlike other branch migration factors RecG and RuvAB, RadA stimulates branch migration in the direction of RecA-mediated strand exchange&quot;, and in the Discussion &quot;In contrast, when purified RuvAB or RecG are added to RecA-strand transfer reactions, they decrease the recovery of full strand-exchange products, by accelerating the reverse reaction back to substrate forms (Whitby et al., 1993).&quot; However, RuvAB can branch migrate in the same direction as RecA. In the paper cited by authors, (Witby et al., 1993), RuvAB was shown to stimulate RecA-mediated 4-strand exchange to produce final nicked product. Other papers also showed that RuvAB-mediated branch migration direction can be opposite to RecG or bidirectional (Matthew and Lloyd (1995) EMBO-J 14 3302-3310; Iwasaki et al. (1992) Genes Dev. 6 2214-2220; Tsaneva et al. (1992) Cell 69 1171-1180).</p><p>In the second paragraph of the Introduction: &quot;ATP binding, but not hydrolysis, is required for RecA filament formation.&quot; This should be changed to &quot;active filament&quot; formation. RecA can make filaments in the absence of nucleotide, though it is compressed and inactive.</p><p>Introduction, sixth paragraph and onward: It will be very helpful for readers if a schematic of RadA, showing the three conserved domains, were provided.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>: There is no indication of the molecular weights of marker proteins.

Also, please indicate with an arrow which bands in the gel are the relevant bands.</p><p>RadA mutant purification: The authors purified RadA wild type and C28Y (Zn finger), K108R (Walker A box), K258A (KNRFG RadA motif), and S372A (putative Lon protease active site) mutant proteins. However, they only showed wild type protein in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.

However, the molecule concentration of p(dT)<sub>30</sub> was 11 nM, so the nucleotide concentration is 330 nM. Therefore, the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> may show that the stoichiometry between RadA and ssDNA is 1:2 (~180:330) but not that the binding affinity is 90 nM. To determine the binding affinity, one should use the less concentration of substrate than the binding affinity.</p><p>In the second paragraph of the subsection “DNA binding” and entire manuscript: &quot;substrate E2&quot; and &quot;substrate E-2&quot; are mixed in the text.</p><p>In the subsection “DNA-stimulated ATPase”: &quot;these DNA molecules are not bound by RadA detectably in gel shift experiments (data not shown)&quot;.

The experimental protocol is confusing in the manuscript. In the subsection “Strange exchange reactions”, they stated &quot;Presynaptic filaments are formed by incubation of RecA with ssDNA in the presence of ATP, SSB is then added and the reaction is initiated by the addition of the linear dsDNA&quot;. But then the Materials and methods &quot;6.7 μM RecA and RadA as indicated (most typically 400 nM) was incubated with 20.1 μM viral φX174 DNA f 436 or 8 minutes at 37o. Then, 20.1 μM linear double-strand φX174 DNA was added and incubation was continued for 5 minutes. Reactions were initiated by addition of ATP to 3 mM and SSB to 2.1 μM&quot;. However, in the figure legend, &quot;the standard procedure for the reaction is: 1) Incubation at 37 for 8 minutes of buffer, ATP regenerating system, φX174 single-strand DNA, and RecA (and RadA when included). 2) Addition of double-strand linear φX174 and continued incubation for 5 minutes. 3) Addition of ATP and SSB and incubation for the times indicated.

In particular, the binding of RadA to branched structures needs to be carried out in order to confirm that RadA is true branch migration protein as suggested by the key data in the manuscript. The present data showing that RadA only binds poly(dT), while many other DNAs stimulate its ATPase activity, makes little sense and needs to be developed further.</italic> </p><p>The branch migration experiment has been redone (multiple times) and more convincing data that RadA can branch migrate junctions is found in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. We have repeated the DNA binding experiments and can show, by gel shifts, that RadA has no more affinity to several branched substrates than to ssDNA. It binds in the 1-10 µM range, rather than the 100 nM range for polydT; these concentrations under these conditions border on the solubility of the protein. The ATPase data are more convincing and is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, for oligonucleotide substrates including ss, splay, fork, fork with 5’ gap, fork with 3’ gap and 3-strand Holliday junction, which support similar ATPase rates. The latter substrate mimics the substrate, which RadA can convincingly branch migrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). RadA obviously does not bind very stably to DNA structures that nonetheless stimulate its ATPase activity.</p><p> <italic>From the branch migration data presented in the paper it is to be expected that RadA (like RuvAB and RecG) will demonstrate DNA helicase/translocase activity. These experiments need to be carried out. These experiments can also be used to clarify the polarity issues raised by the reviewers.</italic> </p><p>Both the editor and some of the reviewers appear to expect that RadA branch-migrates by a similar mechanism to RecG and RuvAB. An alternative, not considered by them, is that RadA uses a RecA-like strand transfer mechanism to branch migrate DNA. Because of the sequence similarity of RadA to RecA, including highly conserved residues in regions that align to primary and secondary DNA binding sites in RecA, we think that a RecA-like mechanism should be seriously considered. RecA does not act as a translocase or helicase and our failure to find RadA helicase activity may be consistent with a RecA-like mechanism. This idea has been added to the discussion, where we discuss both DNA pump and strand-transfer branch migration mechanisms. We note, in addition, that RecA does not have special affinity to branched structures, which may be true for RadA as well. RadA shows no structure-specific stimulation of its ATPase; this contrasts to RuvAB and RecG, which do show structure-specific stimulation of ATPase activity. We therefore disagree that demonstration of translocase or helicase activity should be a condition for publication – RadA may simply use another mechanism.</p><p>Further experiments clearly should be done to clarify the mechanism but we feel that this is beyond the scope of this work.</p><p><italic>All three reviewers have extensive and specific comments that should be addressed. While further experimentation will take some time to complete, I am sure that it will be worthwhile and lead to significant improvements to the manuscript. Reviewer #1: This manuscript describes the biochemical properties of the E. coli RadA protein. While potentially interesting, the manuscript disappoints due to the poor (or incomplete) quality of some of the datasets. The interpretation of several experiments is also questionable. Some examples: DNA binding and ATPase assays: The work suggests that RadA binds to poly(dT) but not poly(dA), (dC) or (dG). Yet these (non-bound) polynucleotides stimulate the ATPase activity of RadA indicating that they do in fact interact with RadA. Presumably the interaction with poly(dT), observed by PAGE is a reflection of the stability of binding rather than binding per se</italic> – <italic>especially since binding is only seen in the presence of ADP. The turnover rates on the other substrates (and with ATP) may be significantly greater than that observed with poly(dT). Have attempts been made to stabilize complexes by glutaraldehyde fixation?</italic> </p><p>Yes, with no improvement.</p><p><italic>Also, from the gel data provided it is not clear whether the observed binding band represents a defined RadA-DNA complex or an aggregate that fails to enter the gel.</italic> </p><p>On other gels, it does enter (such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Our His-tagged protein, not as active as this version, produced a ladder of shifted species.</p><p><italic>Binding assays would benefit from the use of quantitative assays such as fluorescence anisotropy or surface plasmon resonance, rather than gel assays. Given that RadA appears to drive junction branch migration, the assays should be carried out with single-stranded (both defined and random sequence), duplex, 3-arm and 4-arm (Holliday junction) DNA substrates. Only then will the substrate specificity become apparent. Overall, the sections on DNA binding and ATPase activity are naïve and let the manuscript down.</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, we have no experience with fluorescence anisotropy and have no equipment for surface plasmon resonance. Moreover, we think that the outcome would almost certainly be uninteresting. We have investigated branched structure stimulation of ATPase assays, now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. As stated above, RadA does not appear to have special affinity for any branched structure – it seems to like single-stranded DNA. This would be consistent with a RecA-like mechanism.</p><p><italic>Branch migration assays: Some of the data showing that RadA promotes branch migration is of low quality. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> looks completely different from the other figure panels, and I find it difficult to conclude anything from the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</italic> </p><p>The branch migration figure has been redone and quantitated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The directionality data are quantitated and expressed with error bars. This experiment has been performed with three different intermediate preps and two different protein preps and the result is consistent and clear. The other figure (what reviewer 1 calls 3C but I think is 4C), an order of addition experiment has been redone as a time course and is now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. Reviewer 1 should find both of these to be more convincing.</p><p> <italic>The 4-strand reactions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are also problematic, since there appears to be a substantial amount of contaminating single-stranded DNA (SCS) present. Or is this experiment a comparison of the 3- and 4-strand reaction (the legend of the time course does not say what the difference is between the first 4 and the second 4 lanes). As a reader I can only guess. Also, interpretation of these experiments, and the 3-strand reaction described earlier would greatly benefit from the use of 32P-labels. Incidentally, what is a 1.2 gap (as stated in legend).</italic> </p><p>A label disappeared upon conversion of one of the files – this figure (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) indeed shows both 3-strand and 4-strand reactions performed in parallel. We apologize for this error, as we realize it must have been frustrating. The interpretation of this figure should now be very clear. The gap is 1346 nucleotides, corrected. The invading end of the linear would anneal to about 2/3 of the gap. Note the reproducibility of 3-strand reaction with RadA RecA vs. RecA.</p><p><italic>Other enzymes that promote branch migration, such as RuvAB and RecG, are DNA translocases/helicases. To make the argument that RadA is a true branch migration protein this needs to be demonstrated for RadA.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned above, we think that RadA could branch migrate DNA via a strand transfer mechanism like RecA and not be a translocase/helicase protein. We hope to have clarified this point in the manuscript for the readers as well. By the way, we note that specific features of RecA filament are believed to be used in the homology-search process and are not used in the strand exchange process. Therefore, it is conceivable that RadA could be a RecA-like molecule that is poor at homology searching and initial pairing, but very good at strand transfer and branch migration.</p><p><italic>Polarity: The directionality of RecG is 3'-5' relative to single stranded DNA, whereas RuvAB is 5'-3' (the same as RecA). These helicase polarities translate as directionality in the branch migration reactions they promote (at least with 3-stranded reactions). The reader is led to assume that RadA is a translocase similar to RecG or RuvAB</italic> – <italic>if so then the authors should show it and determine the polarity (rather than propose</italic> – <italic>without any evidence</italic> –</p><p><italic>that there is a polarity in the way that RadA is recruited to RecA filaments).</italic> </p><p>Again, RadA is not necessarily a helicase/translocase. We do not know whether this polarity reflects RadA:RadA interactions or some preference for 5’ flaps vs. 3’ flaps. We hope to clarify this in the future by EM studies of RadA structures on DNA but think this is beyond the scope of this report.</p><p><italic>Summary: While the manuscript has some aspects that are potentially interesting, much of the data provided is not of the standard expected for publication in eLife. Also, essential experiments to convince the reader that this is a true branch migration protein are missing</italic> –</p><p><italic>the authors need to demonstrate that RadA shows specific binding to DNA substrates containing 3- or 4-way junctions, and to show that the protein is a DNA translocase (helicase). Without such data the work is simply too preliminary for publication in eLife.</italic> </p><p>We think the new data and their presentation are now up to the <italic>eLife</italic> standard. We think we have convincingly demonstrated a branch migration activity for RadA, a known recombination factor with heretofore-unknown function. As such, this represents an important contribution to the field of recombination. The fact that this is a strand-exchange protein paralog is particularly intriguing. It represents a new paradigm for paralog function and a potentially interesting mechanism, with lots of biological implications, for facilitating branch migration. This reports the first biochemical analysis of a protein that is an absolutely conserved protein in bacteria and plants. There were many publications on RecG and RuvAB before their mechanism was fully elucidated and while we would like to know RadA’s mechanism, more work needs to be done to solve this problem.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2: The bacterial RecA protein plays an important role in the reconstitution of collapsed replication forks, particularly those in which one arm of the fork has been detached as a double strand break. The reactions promoted by RecA can carry out the key reactions needed to reconstruct the fork. However, there has always been a problem. RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange has been too slow to account for the rates of fork reactivation observed in vivo. In this important work, Dr. Lovett and colleagues provide the first in vitro characterization of the E. coli RadA protein, a protein that likely solves the strand exchange rate problem. The authors convincingly demonstrate that the addition of RadA to RecA reactions provides an impressive boost to the rates of many RecA reactions, complementing RecA in these endeavors. Although the work opens many new questions about how the rate enhancements are brought about, the overall effort is an extremely important step and provides a window into the (until recently) obscure bacterial RadA protein that should stimulate much additional work. A series of thoughtfully designed point mutants also reveal that the key RadA activities are dependent on the ATP hydrolysis, Zn finger, and unique KNRFG motifs of RadA. While these data provide a great addition to our knowledge of homologous recombination, the following issues need to be addressed: The only RadA concentrations used in this study when RecA is present appear to be those needed to effect a 1:17 ratio with RecA (subsection “Strand exchange reactions”, first paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> legend). The reasons for this ratio, or results from other concentrations of RadA, are never presented. Some information should be provided as to why this ratio was chosen and what happens if other RadA concentrations are used. Are the effects of RadA saturated at these concentrations? Can lower levels of RadA suffice? Such information might provide a clue as to how processive or distributive the RadA function is.</italic> </p><p>We now include a titration of RadA in RecA reactions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> and the results discussed in the text. As you can now see, we chose the ratio as one with almost maximal stimulation of RecA. (RecA is included at saturating concentration). Lower levels can indeed suffice, but produce products at a slower rate, suggesting a distributive effect. We see no evidence of a “threshold” effect.</p><p><italic>The authors appropriately highlight the fact that RadA migrates the junction in the same direction as RecA (Abstract and end of Introduction). However, the presence of SSB, which will be ubiquitous in the cell, reverses this directionality in experiments where RecA is removed prior to RadA addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). The implications and context of this change in directionality are not discussed.</italic> </p><p>We show in the new figure that the directionality is lost rather than reversed. We do not understand the basis for this – which might include how well SSB packs at 3’ vs. 5’ flaps and I can’t find any information in the literature about this. I do believe this, and the SSB inhibition of RadA, has strong biological implications and may prevent RadA from reversing recombination reactions, products in which the invading strand abuts SSB-bound ssDNA. I have briefly aluded to this in the discussion of the role of branch migration in recombination.</p><p><italic>What is the difference between the DNA substrates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>? The absence of 0 timepoints in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> makes it hard to figure out what is what.</italic> </p><p>There is no difference; this is an order-of-addition experiment. This figure has been replaced with a time course, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, which is more clearly labeled and includes a time course rather than a single point in the reaction.</p><p> <italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, perhaps the lower yield of nicked DNA products when RadA is used with RecA K72R is worth commenting on.</italic> </p><p>Because these are different reaction conditions, it is difficult to interpret. This mutant also makes intermediates more slowly and RadA appears to require intermediates to stimulate exchange.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3: Genetic evidence supports role for RadA in E. coli in the late steps in recombination, potentially involving branch migration of DNA recombination intermediates. In this manuscript, the authors purified wild type RadA and several mutant proteins, and showed that RadA increases the rate of RecA-mediated recombination in vitro by stimulation of branch migration. Authors also showed that RadA preferentially binds single-strand DNA in the presence of ADP and that it exhibits ATPase activity stimulated by DNA. The results are interesting and novel, and given that E. coli recombination has been very extensively studied, the findings are particularly unexpected. The general finding that RadA can convert 3-stranded joint molecule intermediates into Holliday junctions is important.</italic> </p><p>We think so too and think this makes it suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> publication.</p><p><italic>That said, the manuscript is not without its flaws. The presentation of some data in some figures is not well done, and has the feeling more of a lab report, rather than manuscript written for a broad readership. Finally, putting editorial and presentation issues aside, the results presented do support the authors' conclusions. However, the choice of some of the experiments that were done is at best quirky, and in some cases, stopping just short of what could have/should have been done.</italic></p><p>We think the presentation is much improved, having incorporated Reviewer 3’s suggestions, please see below.</p><p><italic>Knowing that RadA promotes migration of 3-way and 4-way junctions, the DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis experiments in this manuscript stop short of supporting the proposed the branch migration function of RadA during recombination: they fall into the category of basic characterization. Perhaps though not essential, the authors should have tested 4-way junctions or branched DNA substrates in their DNA binding and ATPase activity assays: they only tested ssDNA and dsDNA and consequently those data do not directly address the function of RadA during branch migration.</italic> </p><p>We don’t see strong binding (and we have not developed a method of visualizing weak/transient binding) but do see stimulation of ATPase activity, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, but not any more than ssDNA. I don’t think that showing branch migration of oligonucleotide substrates would add much to the paper – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> now clearly demonstrates branch migration of polynucleotide substrates. So RadA IS a branch-migration protein. Again, we don’t see any differential response to branched DNA – this may just be the way it is (as for RecA) or we may be missing something (conditions, cofactor or protein) that enhances binding to such structures. We can show a gel shift for a ssDNA oligonucleotide, natural composition, at higher RadA concentrations if that would help, but again that is not going to add much to how we understand RadA. We are not going to be able to demonstrate tighter binding to junctions – it just isn’t there – and this property is not necessarily required for catalysis of branch migration.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, in the competition experiments, they showed that RadA binds to ssDNA especially poly dT, but did not test any branched structures. Enigmatically, they showed that phiX174 ssDNA stimulated the ATPase of RadA, although RadA apparently does not bind to this DNA in mobility shift experiment (&quot;data not shown&quot;). These results do not help to understand the branch migration function of RadA.</italic> </p><p>RadA doesn’t bind oligonucleotide structures well but they do stimulate its ATPase (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since we can clearly demonstrate DNA-stimulated ATPase, we infer DNA binding, of a transient or unstable nature under the same conditions.</p><p><italic>The choice to present the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> as essentially raw data without any labels makes it nearly unintelligible. The authors should relegate this figure (corrected as indicated below) to the supplementary info, and instead provide panel A as a table or bar graph; B, as an x-y graph, and C as a table or bar graph. The same comment applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: The authors should relegate this figure to the supplementary info, and instead provide panels A and B as a table or bar graph.</italic> </p><p>We thank Reviewer 3 for these suggestions, and now present the data both in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and bar graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

We tend to use the RadA/Sms designation to distinguish it from archaeal RadA, an unfortunate nomenclature that we are stuck with.</p><p><italic>In the Abstract it is stated: &quot;Unlike other branch migration factors RecG and RuvAB, RadA stimulates branch migration in the direction of RecA-mediated strand exchange&quot;, and in the Discussion &quot;In contrast, when purified RuvAB or RecG are added to RecA-strand transfer reactions, they decrease the recovery of full strand-exchange products, by accelerating the reverse reaction back to substrate forms (Whitby et al., 1993).&quot; However, RuvAB can branch migrate in the same direction as RecA. In the paper cited by authors, (Witby et al., 1993), RuvAB was shown to stimulate RecA-mediated 4-strand exchange to produce final nicked product. Other papers also showed that RuvAB-mediated branch migration direction can be opposite to RecG or bidirectional (Matthew and Lloyd (1995) EMBO-J 14 3302-3310; Iwasaki et al. (1992) Genes Dev. 6 2214-2220; Tsaneva et al. (1992) Cell 69 1171-1180).</italic> </p><p>Indeed, but neither protein can branch migrate in a RecA-coupled reaction towards products.
