To test whether this influences tumour formation, we chemically induced tumours in EPI−/− mice, which lack three barrier proteins—Envoplakin, Periplakin, and Involucrin. EPI−/− mice were highly resistant to developing benign tumours when treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The DMBA response was normal, but EPI−/− skin exhibited an exaggerated atopic response to TPA, characterised by abnormal epidermal differentiation, a complex immune infiltrate and elevated serum thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). The exacerbated TPA response could be normalised by blocking TSLP or the immunoreceptor NKG2D but not CD4+ T cells. We conclude that atopy is protective against skin cancer in our experimental model and that the mechanism involves keratinocytes communicating with cells of the immune system via signalling elements that normally protect against environmental assaults.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01888.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01888.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01888.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Skin cancer is a common and growing problem—according to the World Health Organization, skin cancers account for one in every three cancers diagnosed world wide. There is some evidence from epidemiological studies that patients with certain allergies might be protected against cancer and, in particular, that the allergic skin condition atopic dermatitis is associated with reduced levels of various skin cancers. However, it is difficult to know if this reduction is due to the atopic dermatitis itself or to the drugs used to treat this allergy.</p><p>Genetically engineered mice that are lacking three proteins that are involved in the formation of the cornified envelope—the protective layer that replaces the normal plasma membrane in the cells of the outermost skin layers—can be used to study atopic dermatitis. These ‘triple knockout mice’ have a defective epidermal barrier and altered levels of immune T-cells in the skin.</p><p>Now Cipolat et al. have investigated whether defects in the epidermal barrier protect against skin cancer. Knockout mice and wild-type mice were treated with two chemicals: DMBA, which causes mutations in a gene called <italic>HRas</italic>, and TPA, which promotes the formation of tumours from cells that contain <italic>HRas</italic> mutations. After about 16 weeks almost all of the wild-type mice had at least one benign tumour, whereas half of the knockout mice had no tumours. Overall, the average number of benign tumours per mouse was six times higher in the wild-type mice. This shows that the mutations that cause the epidermal barrier defects in knockout mice also protect them against the tumours caused by the combined effects of DMBA and TPA.</p><p>Cipolat et al. then compared how the mice responded to DMBA or TPA alone. The knockout mice and the wild-type mice responded to DMBA in the same way; however, the knockout mice showed an exaggerated response to TPA, including a strong inflammatory reaction. This response comprised the production of higher levels of various proteins that are involved in communications between skin cells and the immune system. Cipolat et al. propose that the immune reaction caused by this exaggerated response could help to prevent tumour formation by eliminating tumour-forming cells in the skin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01888.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01888.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd>eczema</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cipolat</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoste</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name><name><surname>Natsuga</surname><given-names>Ken</given-names></name><name><surname>Quist</surname><given-names>Sven R</given-names></name><name><surname>Watt</surname><given-names>Fiona M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cipolat</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoste</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name><name><surname>Natsuga</surname><given-names>Ken</given-names></name><name><surname>Quist</surname><given-names>Sven R</given-names></name><name><surname>Watt</surname><given-names>Fiona M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cipolat</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoste</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name><name><surname>Natsuga</surname><given-names>Ken</given-names></name><name><surname>Quist</surname><given-names>Sven R</given-names></name><name><surname>Watt</surname><given-names>Fiona M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cipolat</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoste</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name><name><surname>Natsuga</surname><given-names>Ken</given-names></name><name><surname>Quist</surname><given-names>Sven R</given-names></name><name><surname>Watt</surname><given-names>Fiona M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mouse model of atopic dermatitis provides mechanistic evidence for an association between allergic disease and skin cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is an ongoing debate as to whether allergic disease is a risk factor for cancer or whether it is protective, with recent studies indicating that the relationship is complex and site specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arana et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wedgeworth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2012</xref>). Several epidemiological studies have suggested that atopic dermatitis (AD; eczema), hives, allergies to animal fur, and certain food ingredients are inversely associated with cancers of tissues that provide an interface with the external environment, such as the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jensen-Jarolim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sherman et al., 2008</xref>).

Therefore, we sought to examine the link between AD and cancer susceptibility using a mouse model of AD in which the primary defect is in the epidermal barrier that is normally protective against pathogens. The skin barrier is formed by terminally differentiated keratinocytes in the outermost layers of the epidermis, known as the cornified layers or stratum corneum. In cornified keratinocytes, the plasma membrane is replaced with a layer of highly insoluble, transglutaminase cross-linked proteins with covalently attached lipids, known as the cornified envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Candi et al., 2005</xref>). Involucrin, envoplakin, and periplakin are the first proteins to be cross-linked by transglutaminase-1 and create the protein scaffold for the attachment of lipids on which the cornified envelope assembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rice and Green, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simon and Green, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruhrberg et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">1997</xref>).</p><p>Mice triply deficient in <italic>envoplakin</italic>, <italic>periplakin,</italic> and <italic>involucrin</italic> (EPI−/− mice) have a defective epidermal barrier and exhibit a reduction in epidermal γδTCR<sup>+</sup> CD3<sup>+</sup> cells (dendritic epidermal T cells; DETCs) and infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sevilla et al., 2007</xref>).

A single exposure to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induces oncogenic mutations in HRas (initiation). Repeated applications of the promoting agent 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (promotion) allow initiated, mutagenized cells to clonally expand and form benign tumours called papillomas, some of which progress to malignant squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2009</xref>). While most human skin SCCs are associated with UV, rather than chemical, carcinogenesis, 10% do have Ras gene mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lopez-Pajares et al., 2013</xref>), and DMBA/TPA carcinogenesis has contributed substantially to our understanding of the steps of tumour development in human skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirst and Balmain, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EPI −/− mice are resistant to chemical carcinogenesis</title><p>To determine whether lack of <italic>Evpl, Ppl</italic> and <italic>Ivl</italic> influences sensitivity to tumour formation, we compared DMBA/TPA skin carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2009</xref>) in mice lacking all three genes (EPI−/−) and wild-type (WT) mice on the same genetic background.

The incidence of papilloma formation was also lower in EPI−/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Over 95% of WT mice had at least one papilloma 14 weeks after the start of promotion, whereas 50% of EPI−/− mice were tumour-free at the end of the experiment (p=0.0063).

We observed a downregulation of envoplakin, periplakin, and involucrin in WT papillomas and SCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), leading us to speculate that the increased risk of SCC conversion in EPI−/− papillomas may be linked to the lack of two desmosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thiery and Chopin, 1999</xref>).

Upon TPA treatment EPI−/− defective keratinocytes released high levels of chemokines and type 2-type 17 cytokines, including TSLP. This correlated with recruitment of innate immune cells, including mast cells, granulocytes (both neutrophils and eosinophils) and adaptive immune cells, such as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which could potentially play a role in immuno-editing of nascent papillomas.</p><p>Defective epidermal differentiation in concert with activation of innate and adaptive immune responses is known to create the first line of defence against physical, chemical, and toxic assaults in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34a">Milstone, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sherman et al., 2008</xref>). Key players in the crosstalk between keratinocytes and leukocytes are DETCs, since they orchestrate the inflammatory response to pathogen-derived and environmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">King et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moore et al., 2000</xref>). DETCs are already in an activated state in untreated EPI−/− epidermis, as demonstrated by their round shape and reduced number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sevilla et al., 2007</xref>). This is most likely a consequence of increased expression of keratinocyte stress signals (Rae-1 and H60), which would be responsible for establishing the observed Th2 immune-surveillance response. We propose that this pre-activated, ‘alarmed’ condition enables EPI−/− skin to react more promptly and strongly to TPA treatment than WT skin. In contrast to EPI−/− mice, in mice that overexpress activin βA in the epidermis downregulation of DETCs only occurs after DMBA/TPA treatment and is linked to increased skin carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antsiferova et al., 2011</xref>). The exaggerated TPA response in EPI−/− mice resulted in increased numbers of CD4+ T cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and eosinophils, and many of these leukocyte populations have been shown to be able to exert tumour protective effects, which could potentially bypass the function of γδ T cells.</p><p>Targeting the Rae-1/NKG2D/TSLP axis, by blocking TSLP or NKG2D, suppressed the crosstalk between keratinocytes and immune cells and abrogated the atopic phenotype of TPA-treated EPI−/− skin, as seen by normalisation of epidermal differentiation and inflammation. In mice, epidermal overexpression of TSLP results in an atopic dermatitis phenotype characterized by epidermal hyperproliferation, acanthosis, spongiosis, and hyperkeratosis, as well as mast cell infiltration in the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoo et al., 2005</xref>). In humans, TSLP is implicated in the pathogenesis of both atopic dermatitis and asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leonard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al-Shami et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huston and Liu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu, 2006</xref>). TSLP has potent anti-tumour activity in skin carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demehri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Piazza et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this, TPA-treated EPI−/− skin produced higher levels of TSLP than WT skin, and was protected from chemically induced papilloma formation.</p><p>NKG2D ligands have been shown to be upregulated in many inflammatory lesions and can act as an axis of immunoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strid et al., 2008</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that the proposed role for Rae-1 and NKG2D in establishment of the lymphoid stress-surveillance response and consequent atopic phenotype also applies to the situation in which there is a defective epidermal barrier.</p><p>Although two-stage chemical skin carcinogenesis has been used extensively to elucidate the role of individual components of the immune system (specific cell types, cytokines and signalling molecules), ours is the first mouse model to link the lack of structural proteins and consequent defective epidermal barrier to cancer susceptibility. Epidemiological studies of the association between allergic disease and cancer risk have given conflicting results, in part because of the difficulty of factoring in immune suppressive treatments for the disease and in part because the association can be positive or negative according to cancer type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arana et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van Hemelrijck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wiemels et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaae et al., 2013</xref>). Our study provides a mechanistic framework for further analysis of the link between atopic dermatitis and cancer incidence.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>EPI−/− and control mice</title><p>Mice deficient for <italic>envoplakin, periplakin,</italic> and <italic>involucrin</italic> (EPI−/−) were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sevilla et al., 2007</xref>) by interbreeding single knockout mice for <italic>envoplakin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maatta et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>involucrin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Djian et al., 2000</xref>), and <italic>periplakin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aho et al., 2004</xref>). Single knockout mice were generated and maintained on a variety of genetic backgrounds and as a result there was a potential contribution of Sv129, C57BL/6, BALB/c and nu/nu to EPI−/− animals. Since DMBA/TPA sensitivity is affected by genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hennings et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Woodworth et al., 2004</xref>), DNA of 4 EPI−/− mice (each from a different breeding pair) was subjected to genome scanning by the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to determine the relative contributions of different genetic backgrounds. EPI−/− mice were primarily Sv129 (40.98%, ±1.52) and C57Bl/6 (51.39%, ±1.62), with a small contribution of BALB/c (4.7%, ±1.24). The nu/nu mutation was not detected. Based on these results, the F2 generation of crosses between Sv129 and C57Bl/6J mice was used as the WT control (51.82%, ±3.35 Sv129; 49.92%, ±1.98 C57Bl/6) for all experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Two stage carcinogenesis</title><p>Chemical carcinogenesis experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2009</xref>). All experiments were carried out under the terms of a UK Government Home Office project licence, with local ethical approval. The back skin of 7-week-old female mice was shaved with electric clippers. 3 days later animals that did not show signs of hair regrowth received a topical application of 100 nmol (25 μg) DMBA (Sigma–Aldrich) in 200 μl acetone, followed by three times weekly applications of 6 nmol (3.7 μg) of TPA (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) in 200 μl acetone for 15 weeks. As controls, mice (5–10 animals/group) were subjected to the same protocol, but substituting DMBA or TPA with acetone. Papillomas and SCCs were recorded once a week for up to 57 weeks after the start of promotion. Recordings were made by an observer who was ‘blinded’ to the experimental groups. 1 hr before culling, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg/kg bodyweight 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Valerie Horsley, has agreed to reveal her identity.</p><p>As you can see, the reviewers' comments are favorable on the whole although there are some issues that will need to be addressed satisfactorily before proceeding with publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers contrasted your manuscript and its findings with that of the Kopan Cancer Cell paper (2012), both of which explore the relationship of skin barrier and tumor initiation and invoke TSLP. There was general agreement that the Kopan paper was more novel at the time and the reviewers were somewhat split regarding whether the current paper sufficiently extends mechanistic aspects regarding the link between skin barrier and tumorigenesis to a level appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers did agree that the link between barrier and tumorigenesis is more clearly established in the Watt paper, since the Notch loss of function model in the Kopan paper could alter non-barrier mechanisms to control tumor formation. They also concur that most of the data presented are convincing. However, they also feel that in addition to the provided blocking antibodies experiment, more mechanistic insights are needed to make this into a clear case for <italic>eLife</italic>. Specifically, the most important question becomes how TSLP is acting, since Kopan's lab has implicated TSLP in the tumor formation following barrier issues. Kopan has suggested that TSLP acts on T cells (Dehmehri et al 2012) and a recent paper by Diana Baustista shows nicely that TSLP signals in neurons in the skin (Wilson et al Cell 2013). If the authors can establish whether TSLP acts directly on inflammatory or other cell populations to control tumor formation, this would represent the kind of mechanistic advance requisite for <italic>eLife</italic>. The other comments listed, while extensive, will be relatively straightforward, but this is the only major experimental issue that the authors should address.</p><p>The reviewers felt that the link clinically between atopic dermatitis and skin cancer is weak, and here, some of this can be handled textually, by making the paper crisper in its focus and making fewer sweeping statements. In addition, there are some specific comments, which will strengthen the paper, including substantiating the mechanism, and which are lengthy but seem relatively straightforward to address.</p><p><italic>Experimental issues/interpretations</italic> <italic>of the data:</italic></p><p>1) While EPI-/- mice have defects in skin tumor initiation, it is possible that these genes also play a role in tumor progression. Are Envoplakin, Periplakin or Involucrin expressed in WT skin papillomas or SCCs? If so, they may play additional roles once the skin tumor is already formed.</p><p>2) The authors nicely show that the mutagenic effect of DMBA is unaffected by the EPI mutations. The pro-inflammatory effect of TPA, however, is strongly exaggerated in EPI-/- mice. This is likely because barrier defect in these mice makes them more susceptible to the toxic effect of TPA. The authors note that there is increased expression of some inflammatory genes, genes involved in lymphoid stress immune-surveillance (e.g., RAE1) and barrier defense (e.g., TSLP). Blocking TSLP and NKG2D (receptor for RAE1) significantly reduce the inflammatory response. However, another group found that a reduction in DETC number resulted in increased skin tumorigenesis (Antisferova, Nature Communications, 2011). Although EPI-/- mice also have fewer DETCs, they develop fewer tumors. Could the overall increase in immune activation in EPI-/- mice render DETC function dispensable? Some comments on this difference would be helpful.</p><p>3) Are there any differences in the presence of alpha/beta T cells in EPI-/- epidermis?</p><p>4) The authors use antibodies against cytokines to suppress cytokine signaling during TPA treatment which many of these cytokines (in particular TSLP) have been implicated before. An extension of this mechanistic angle should implicate which cell types are responsible for the suppression of tumorigenesis. How these signals act in the immune cells etc.</p><p>5) A model might help this manuscript to better depict mechanistic findings of this manuscript. As presented the paper appears to be a set of fairly standard experiments with histology and RT-PCR.</p><p>6) The study reports two sets of findings: first, that EPI mice are protected from DMBA/TPA induced skin papillomas; second, that EPI mice have exaggerated inflammatory response to TPA. It is not clear whether the two are related and whether (and how) the latter explains the former. Normally, this would be tested using either mice deficient in the suspected components (TSLP, NKG2D), or by blocking these proteins with antibodies. The reviewers agreed that neither approach can be reasonably used here because the mice are already triple knockouts and because the treatment with antibodies for several months is not practical.</p><p>The results overall fit with the emerging idea (and epidemiological data) that allergic defenses may confer protection against environmental carcinogenes. One possible interpretation of the results is that structural barrier defect caused y EPI mutations results in compensatory immune-mediated barrier defense that confers protection. The mouse model can be very useful to examine the mechanisms of protective effects of immune stress surveillance response.</p><p><italic>Textual issues/interpretations</italic> <italic>of the data:</italic></p><p>1) The authors may want to consult with an immunologist regarding their terminology and the choice of genes used as indicators of different types of immune responses. For example, IL-12p40 is not a Th17 marker and IL-6 is not a Th2 marker. These cytokines are made by myeloid cells and affect multiple responses; they are not produced by T cells.</p><p>2) In addition, the article could benefit from some heavy editing. For example, the authors present as a fact that there is a causal relationship between barrier impairment, structural proteins, and atopic dermatitis. But the authors should use greater precision. In humans, mutations in FLG (a structural protein) are linked to ichthyosis vulgaris and associated with atopic dermatitis and atopic disorders, such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. But the authors state causality, when genetically correlation has been defined. Mouse models of FLG-/- display some features of AD, but not allergic airway inflammation (asthma model). Moreover these findings are more in question now that the animal model (flaky tail) has been shown to be a compound mutation of FLG and Tmem79.</p><p>There is true controversy that cancer is associated with atopy. Some references to support this model are Hwang CY (2012) Int J Cancer and Wedgeworth E (2011) Br JDerm but many dermatologists feel that the connection is more tenuous and may be driven by severe atopics being treated with heavy immunosuppressants, which have been associated with increased risk of malignancies. UV light therapy is also a potential treatment that would underlie an increase risk of skin cancer. These are confounding issues for patient data.</p><p>3) The extent to which DMBA/TPA treatment is a model for human skin cancer needs to be better addressed in the manuscript as most human SCC do not have H-ras mutations. These issues are mentioned, but typically toward the end of arguments, and need to be addressed before a more simplistic interpretation is depicted as the truth.</p><p>4) Authors should read through and edit the entire manuscript. There are lots of circuitous arguments, typographical errors, and information provided in the wrong sections.</p><p><italic>Methods/statistics/clarifications</italic>:</p><p>1) How was the function of the antibody blockade of TSLP or NKG2D measured? What percent neutralization was achieved?</p><p>2) How was RNA normalized for the acanthosis observed in EPI-/- skin? Basically, if RNA levels are higher, does this reflect an upregulation of the gene or simply that there are more suprabasal cells in the skin? Was RT-PCR deltaCt normalized to B2u or some other ubiquitous gene?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B and 3C</xref>, how is the percent of hyperkeratotic and parakeratotic epidermis quantified?</p><p>4) Are wt animals +/+;+/+;+/+ or compound heterozygotes. Nu/nu is not a genetic background but rather exists on multiple genetic backgrounds. This is confusing in the Methods section.</p><p>5) How representative are the 4 EPI-/- mice of genetic variation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01888.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers contrasted your manuscript and its findings with that of the Kopan Cancer Cell paper (2012), both of which explore the relationship of skin barrier and tumor initiation and invoke TSLP.

We now demonstrate that injection of CD4 blocking antibodies does not abrogate the atopic phenotype of TPA treated EPI-/- mice (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). There is no difference in the abundance of CD8+ cells between TPA treated EPI-/- and WT skin, but there is a marked increase in neutrophil infiltration. We therefore depleted neutrophils with anti-LY6G antibody, and now show no reduction in hyperplasia and dermal inflammation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Nevertheless, treatment with the broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone (DXM) markedly reduces the TPA response in EPI-/- skin (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We conclude that, in contrast to the Kopan model, multiple immune cell types contribute to the tumour resistance of the EPI-/- model.</p><p>One of the novel features of our study, again distinct from the Kopan model, is the demonstration that an intrinsic barrier defect results in activation of the Rae-1/NKG2D/TSLP axis. This provokes a lymphoid stress-surveillance response, which underlies the atopic phenotype in TPA treated EPI-/- mice, since there is reduced dermal infiltration of specific immune cell populations and a reduced keratinocyte response when TSLP or NKG2D is blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-E</xref>).</p><p>Kopan and collaborators show that when mice are treated with calcipotriol, a potent TSLP inducer, tumors shrink over time. In contrast, an interesting feature of our model is that when papillomas do arise in EPI-/- mice they have a higher frequency of malignant conversion to SCCs than WT papillomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We have now compared cytokine levels in WT and EPI-/- SCCs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H, I</xref>). There was no difference in the expression of IL-4 (a type-2 cytokine) or IL-17 (a type-17 cytokine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). However, EPI-/- SCCs expressed higher TSLP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>) and EPI-/- mice bearing papillomas larger than 2mm<sup>2</sup> had higher levels of systemic TSLP than EPI-/- mice with smaller papillomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). Our data again highlight the difference between our model and that of Kopan, and corroborate reports that TSLP is a potent growth-promoting cytokine in breast and pancreatic cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Monte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pedroza-Gonzalez et al., 2011</xref>, now cited).</p><p><italic>The reviewers felt that the link clinically between atopic dermatitis and skin cancer is weak, and here, some of this can be handled textually, by making the paper crisper in its focus and making fewer sweeping statements</italic>.</p><p>We agree and we have revised the text accordingly.</p><p>Experimental issues/interpretations of the data:</p><p><italic>1) While EPI-/- mice have defects in skin tumor initiation, it is possible that these genes also play a role in tumor progression.

We agree that this could play a role in tumour progression as envoplakin and periplakin are desmosome-associated genes, and we now comment on this in the text.</p><p><italic>2) The authors nicely show that the mutagenic effect of DMBA is unaffected by the EPI mutations. The pro-inflammatory effect of TPA, however, is strongly exaggerated in EPI-/- mice. This is likely because barrier defect in these mice makes them more susceptible to the toxic effect of TPA.

Although EPI-/- mice also have fewer DETCs, they develop fewer tumors. Could the overall increase in immune activation in EPI-/- mice render DETC function dispensable? Some comments on this difference would be helpful</italic>.</p><p>We have now included images of γδ T cells (DETCs) in acetone treated EPI-/- and WT mice to show that in EPI-/- epidermis there are fewer γδ T cells (as we reported previously) and those that remain are in an activated state, as demonstrated by their rounded shape (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). It has previously been reported that upon activation γδ T cells acquire a round shape before leaving the epidermis (Strid et al., Nature Immunology 2008; cited). K14-activin βA expressing mice (Antisferova et al., now cited) differ from EPI-/- mice, because downregulation of DETCs only occurs after DMBA/TPA treatment. The exaggerated TPA response in EPI-/- mice resulted in increased numbers of CD4+ T cells, neutrophils, mast cells and eosinophils, and many of these leukocyte populations have been shown to be able to exert tumor protective effects, which could potentially bypass the function of γδ T cells.</p><p><italic>3) Are there any differences in the presence</italic> <italic>of alpha/beta T cells in EPI-/- epidermis?</italic></p><p>We have now included immunostaining for CD4+ T cells in TPA treated WT and EPI-/- skin, showing that CD4+ T cells are not present in WT epidermis, but do infiltrate EPI-/- epidermis (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). In contrast, CD8+ T cells infiltrate the skin of untreated and TPA treated WT and EPI-/- mice to the same extent.</p><p><italic>4) The authors use antibodies against cytokines to suppress cytokine signaling during TPA treatment which many of these cytokines (in particular TSLP) have been implicated before. An extension of this mechanistic angle should implicate which cell types are responsible for the suppression of tumorigenesis. How these signals act in the immune cells etc</italic>.</p><p>As described in the opening response, we have now included additional antibody targeting strategies (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>). One of the novel aspects of our work is that NKG2D has not been implicated before in linking atopic disease with skin tumorigenesis. Our studies show that blocking TSLP and NKG2D can normalize the exaggerated atopic response of keratinocytes and multiple leukocyte types in TPA treated EPI-/- skin, indicating that these targeting strategies affect a plethora of different cell types.</p><p><italic>5) A model might help this manuscript to better depict mechanistic findings of this manuscript. As presented the paper appears to be a set of fairly standard experiments with histology and RT-PCR</italic>.</p><p>We have now included a model summarizing our findings (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) The study reports two sets of findings: first, that EPI mice are protected from DMBA/TPA induced skin papillomas; second, that EPI mice have exaggerated inflammatory response to TPA.

We believe that this is clarified in the revised version of the manuscript and by inclusion of the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Our results are of considerable interest because they provide experimental support for the emerging epidemiological data that allergic defenses can confer protection against environmental carcinogens in some contexts.</p><p>Textual issues/interpretations of the data:</p><p><italic>1) The authors may want to consult with an immunologist regarding their terminology and the choice of genes used as indicators of different types of immune responses.

We show reduced spleen mass as a readout for efficacy of Dexamethasone (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and show that anti-LY6G reduces both the number of neutrophils in circulation and the number of neutrophil containing skin pustules (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G, H</xref>). There is no straightforward method to confirm functional inhibition of NKG2D as this receptor has multiple downstream targets that are shared with other pathways. Nevertheless, we conclude that NKG2D function was at least partially blocked, because of the statistically significant differences in immune cell infiltration and epidermal thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figure 7D and 8A-E</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) How was RNA normalized for the acanthosis observed in EPI-/- skin?

We can exclude the possibility that QPCR data reveal differences in acanthosis rather than specific gene effects, as gene expression levels of Notch pathway genes, H60 and Rae-1 were similar in TPA treated (acanthotic) and vehicle treated EPI-/- epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-F</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figures 3B and 3C</italic></xref><italic>, how is the percent of hyperkeratotic</italic> <italic>and parakeratotic epidermis quantified?</italic></p><p>We quantified hyperkeratosis by measuring the length of epidermis that had marked thickening of the cornified layers relative to untreated WT epidermis.

We therefore used F2 crosses between Sv129 and C57Bl/6 mice as the WT control (51.82%, ± 3.35 Sv129; 49.92%, ± 1.98 C57Bl/6) for all experiments, as now explained in the text. The 4 EPI-/- mice analyzed came from 4 separate breeding pairs that were used to generate the mice for the DMBA/TPA carcinogenesis experiments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
