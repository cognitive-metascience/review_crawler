function thought to involve top-down control over the motor system. Here we aimed to validate this stopping system using high temporal resolution methods in humans. We show that, following the requirement to stop, there was an increase of right frontal beta (~13 to 30 Hz) at ~120 ms, likely a proxy of right inferior frontal gyrus; then, at 140 ms, there was a broad skeletomotor suppression, likely reflecting the impact of the subthalamic nucleus on basal ganglia output; then, at ~160 ms, suppression was detected in the muscle, and, finally, the behavioral time of stopping was ~220 ms. This temporal cascade supports a physiological model of action-stopping, and partitions it into subprocesses that are isolable to different nodes and are more precise than the behavioral latency of stopping. Variation in these subprocesses, including at the single-trial level, could better explain individual differences in impulse control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stop signal task</kwd><kwd>partial response</kwd><kwd>single trial metric</kwd><kwd>electromyography</kwd><kwd>variability</kwd><kwd>beta burst</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS 106822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jana</surname><given-names>Sumitash</given-names></name><name><surname>Hannah</surname><given-names>Ricci</given-names></name><name><surname>Muralidharan</surname><given-names>Vignesh</given-names></name><name><surname>Aron</surname><given-names>Adam R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA 026452</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jana</surname><given-names>Sumitash</given-names></name><name><surname>Hannah</surname><given-names>Ricci</given-names></name><name><surname>Muralidharan</surname><given-names>Vignesh</given-names></name><name><surname>Aron</surname><given-names>Adam R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The sequence of neural and physiological processes underlying action-stopping has been delineated.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to control one’s actions and thoughts is important for our daily lives; for example: changing gait when there is an obstacle in the path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wagner et al., 2016</xref>), resisting the temptation to eat when on a diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sedgmond et al., 2019</xref>), and overcoming the tendency to say something hurtful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). While many processes contribute to such forms of control, one important process is response inhibition – the prefrontal (top-down) stopping of initiated response tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aron, 2007</xref>). In the laboratory, response inhibition is often studied with the stop-signal task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Verbruggen et al., 2019</xref>). On each trial, the participant initiates a motor response, and then, when a subsequent Stop signal occurs, tries to stop. From the behavioral data one can estimate a latent variable; the latency of stopping known as Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT), which is typically 200–250 ms in healthy adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Verbruggen et al., 2019</xref>). SSRT has been useful in neuropsychiatry where it is often longer for patients vs. controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alderson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bari and Robbins, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lavagnino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lijffijt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Snyder et al., 2015</xref>). The task has also provided a rich test-bed, across species, for mapping out a putative neural architecture of prefrontal-basal-ganglia-regions for rapidly suppressing motor output areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bari and Robbins, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schall and Godlove, 2012</xref>). Given this rich literature, this task is one of the few paradigms included in the longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Casey et al., 2018</xref>) of 10,000 adolescents over 10 years.</p><p>Against this background, a puzzle is that the relation between SSRT and ‘real-world’ self-reported impulsivity is often weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhury et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Enkavi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friedman and Miyake, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lijffijt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McLaughlin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Skippen et al., 2019b</xref>). One explanation is that SSRT may not accurately index the brain’s true stopping latency. Indeed, recent mathematical modelling of behavior during the stop-signal task suggests that standard calculations of SSRT may overestimate the brain’s stopping latency by ~100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Skippen et al., 2019b</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bissett and Poldrack, 2019</xref>). Further, in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raud and Huster, 2017</xref>), electromyographic (EMG) recordings revealed an initial increase in EMG activity in response to the Go cue, followed by a sudden decline at ~150 ms after the Stop signal. This decline in EMG could be because of the Stop process ‘kicking in’ to cancel motor output – but the striking thing is that this was 50 ms before the SSRT of 200 ms. This timing is also consistent with experiments using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure the motor evoked potential (MEP) during the stop-signal task (the MEP indexes the excitability of the pathways from motor cortex to muscle). The MEP in the muscle that was-to-be-stopped reduced at ~150 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coxon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van den Wildenberg et al., 2010</xref>). Further, other studies that measured the MEP from muscles that were not needed for the task, show there is ‘global suppression’ also at ~150 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wessel et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wessel and Aron, 2013</xref>) (i.e. corticospinal activity was suppressed for the broader skeletomotor system). This ‘global MEP suppression’ has been linked to activation of the subthalamic nucleus of the basal-ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wessel et al., 2016</xref>), which is thought to be critical for stopping, and might broadly inhibit thalamocortical drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wessel and Aron, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The potential overestimation of the brain’s true stopping latency by SSRT could arise for several reasons. First, the race model assumes that the Stop process is ‘triggered’ on every trial. But recent research shows that this is not the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Skippen et al., 2019b</xref>), and that failing to account for ‘trigger failures’ inflates SSRT. Second, while the standard ‘race model’ assumes that the Go and Stop processes are independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Verbruggen et al., 2019</xref>), recent research show that violations of this independence underestimates SSRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bissett and Poldrack, 2019</xref>). Finally, the standard ways of computing SSRT likely do not account for electromechanical delays between muscle activity and the response. In any event, overestimating the brain’s stopping latency would add variance to SSRT which could potentially weaken the above-mentioned across-participant associations between stopping latency and self-report scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhury et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lijffijt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Skippen et al., 2019b</xref>). Furthermore, if the true stopping latency is ~150 ms, the timing of activation of nodes in the putative response inhibition network should precede this time-point for those nodes to play a causal role in action stopping – and this is important for the interpretation of neuroscience studies. For instance, in electrocorticography, electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies, successful stopping elicits increased beta band power over right frontal cortex in the time period between the Stop signal and SSRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castiglione et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Swann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wessel et al., 2013b</xref>). Whether this, and other, neurophysiological markers of the Stop process occur sufficiently early to directly contribute to action-stopping (if SSRT is overestimated) is unknown; yet this is fundamental to our understanding of brain networks underlying response inhibition.</p><p>Here we leveraged the insight from the above-mentioned study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raud and Huster, 2017</xref>) which used EMG of the task relevant muscles. We now tested whether we could derive a single trial estimate of stopping latency from EMG (referred to as CancelTime). More specifically, we hypothesized that ‘partial’ EMG bursts on the Successful Stop trials (<italic>i.e.</italic> small EMG responses that begin but do not reach a sufficient amplitude to lead to an overt response) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Jong et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGarry et al., 2000</xref>) would carry information about the latency of stopping. We tested this in two studies. In a third study we tested if CancelTime would correspond with the measure of putative basal ganglia-mediated global motor suppression, measured with single-pulse TMS. In studies four and five we turned to the cortical process thought to initiate action–stopping, using the above-mentioned proxy of right frontal beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Swann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>). We measured scalp EEG, derived a right frontal spatial filter in each participant, and then extracted beta bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Little et al., 2018</xref>) in the time period between the Stop signal and SSRT. We tested how the timing of these beta bursts related to CancelTime.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study 1 (EMG)</title><p>10 participants performed the stop-signal task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Intriguingly, in each study, CancelTime was ~ 60 ms less than SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>. To further explore this, we pooled the data across the two studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pooled studies 1 and 2</title><p>Mean CancelTime (147±5 ms) was 60±3 ms shorter than SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> (<italic>t</italic>(41) = 18.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>d</italic> = 2.5, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> &gt; 100; <italic>r</italic> = 0.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> &gt; 100). However, one must note that the criterion for estimating the stopping latency is different for the two measures, CancelTime uses EMG responses, while SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> uses the keypress responses. Hence, inherent differences in latencies between the two responses might lead to these incompatible measures of stopping latency. We hypothesized that the difference between SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> and the time of EMG cancellation (CancelTime) is due to an inherent “ballistic stage” in movements and once the muscle activity crosses the point-of-no-return they can no longer be stopped and a movement is inevitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Jong et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mirabella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Osman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Verbruggen and Logan, 2009</xref>). [The duration of such ballistic stages has been estimated to be ~15 ms in saccades in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boucher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kornylo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Purcell et al., 2010</xref>) and ~50 ms for reaching movements in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gopal and Murthy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jana and Murthy, 2018</xref>)]. In other words, the time of EMG cancellation on partial trials reflects a time just before the point-of-no-return, whereby if EMG activity is allowed to continue develop beyond this point it will exceed a critical threshold such that a button press necessarily ensues (we presume this threshold reflects the point at which the inertia of the finger is overcome). In this respect, what is being tracked by the SSD staircasing procedure is the probability of crossing that EMG threshold, but since SSRT is calculated based on button press response times, it inevitably incorporates the ballistic stage that follows the crossing of this threshold. Hence, although our study was not designed to track the SSD staircase based on EMG, we calculated SSRT using the presence of EMG responses (SSRT<sub>EMG</sub>) instead of the keypress responses (SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>). The purpose of the SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> estimation was to test the idea of a ballistic phase by removing the influence of electromechanical delays and inertia in the neuromuscular system and response device, which likely make-up the ballistic stage, on the estimated stopping latency. We thus considered Partial EMG trials as Failed Stop trials and used EMG onset time (RT<sub>EMG</sub>) on Correct Go trials to recalculate SSRT (<italic>i.e.</italic> instead of using P(Respond|Stop) from behavior and Go RT<sub>Beh</sub> as is typical for SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> calculations; see Materials and methods; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> for an exemplar participant). We then performed 1-way repeated measures ANOVA with 'Stop Time' as the dependent measure and the method of estimation as a factor (SSRT<sub>EMG</sub>, SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>, and CancelTime). There was a significant main effect of the estimation method on ﻿'Stop Time' (<italic>F<sub>GG</sub></italic>(1.4, 56.1) = 66.3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.6). Pairwise comparisons showed that SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> (157±7 ms) was significantly faster than SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> (207±3 ms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>; <italic>t</italic>(41) = 8.2, <italic>p<sub>Bon</sub></italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.3, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> &gt; 100), but importantly, not significantly different from mean CancelTime (<italic>t</italic>(41) = 1.5, <italic>p<sub>Bon</sub></italic> = 0.270, <italic>d</italic> = 0.2, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 0.5).

Across all participants, the EMG response in the Partial EMG trials (when aligned to the EMG onset) had a profile similar to the EMG response in the Correct Go and Failed Stop trials, but diverged ~55 ms after EMG onset (55 ms compared to Correct Go, and 56 ms compared to Failed Stop trials, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). We surmised that if the Partial EMG trials reflect responses that have been actively cancelled at the muscle-level, then the amplitude of these responses should increase with SSD. The rationale was that, at shorter SSDs, the Go process will have been active for a shorter duration, meaning EMG activity will not have increased much before being inhibited, while at longer SSD, the Go process will have been active for a longer duration, meaning EMG activity will have increased much more before being inhibited. Indeed, the amplitude of the Partial EMG responses increased with SSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). A 1-way repeated measures ANOVA with amplitude as the dependent variable and the SSD as the independent variable showed significant effect of SSD on amplitude (<italic>F</italic>(4,24) = 3.7, <italic>p</italic> = 0.018, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.4) (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coxon et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that the Partial EMG trials represent inhibited Go responses and not merely a weak Go process (which would presumably not increase across SSDs). In other words, the partial EMG response does not simply reflect a weak Go response, where the individual intended to execute a response but failed to produce sufficient muscle activity to fully depress the button, since the amplitude of such responses would presumably not vary as a function of SSD.</p><p>To further validate CancelTime, we modelled the behavior using BEESTS (Bayesian Estimation of Ex-gaussian STop-Signal reaction time distributions; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> for model estimates). While SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> produces a single estimate per person, BEESTS uses a Bayesian parametric approach to estimate the distribution of SSRTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matzke et al., 2017</xref>). Also, for each participant, it provides an estimate of the probability of trigger failures (<italic>i.e.</italic> stop trials where the stopping process was not initiated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matzke et al., 2017</xref>). Across participants, mean CancelTime was positively correlated with the mean SSRT<sub>BEESTS</sub> (205 ± 3 ms; <italic>r</italic> = 0.54, p&lt;0.001, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> &gt; 100; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). More interestingly, the SD of CancelTime (33 ± 2 ms) was positively correlated with the SD of SSRT<sub>BEESTS</sub> (48 ± 5 ms; <italic>r</italic> = 0.42, p=0.005, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 6.9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).

These relationships between CancelTime and model estimates give further credence to our interpretation that CancelTime on Partial EMG trials reflects a single-trial measure of the time of implementation of the Stop process.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>BEESTS estimates (mean ± s.e.m.; All values in ms)</title><p><supplementary-material id="table2sdata1"><label>Table 2—source data 1.</label><caption><title>BEESTS estimates for study 1 and 2.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-50371-table2-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Estimated parameters</th><th valign="top">Pooled study 1 and 2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Mean Go RT<sub>Beh</sub></td><td valign="top">483 (13)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">SD Go RT<sub>Beh</sub></td><td valign="top">94 (5)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Mean SSRT<sub>BEESTS</sub></td><td valign="top">205 (3)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">SD SSRT<sub>BEESTS</sub></td><td valign="top">48 (5)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">%Trigger Failures</td><td valign="top">4 (1)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Study 3 (TMS)</title><p>To further validate CancelTime and relate it to brain processes we turned to a different method – single-pulse TMS over a task-irrelevant muscle representation in the brain.

Therefore, we estimate the onset of the global motor suppression to be ~ 140 ms after the Stop signal, which places it ~ 20 ms prior to the mean CancelTime (160 ± 9 ms). There were no significant differences in MEP amplitudes between Failed Stop and Correct Go trials at any time point, though MEP amplitudes on Successful Stop trials were also suppressed compared to Failed Stop trials at 160 ms (<italic>t</italic>(16) = 2.9, <italic>p<sub>Bon</sub></italic> = 0.033, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 4.9).</p><p>It makes sense that global motor suppression occurs before CancelTime as motor cortical output takes time to be transmitted along the corticospinal pathway to the muscles. To verify whether the ~20 ms discrepancy in timings could be accounted for by corticospinal conduction delays, we estimated this corticospinal conduction time in a separate phase of the current study by delivering TMS over the hand representation to evoke MEPs in the left, task-relevant, FDI muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). This was 23 ± 0.3 ms. Thus, a decline in muscle activity would be expected to be preceded by a reduction in motor cortical output by ~23 ms, which is very similar to the ~20 ms difference between global motor suppression and CancelTime. Note, however, that the onset latency of the TMS-evoked MEP is likely an under-estimate of the mean conduction time of all pathways involved in voluntary movement, because TMS is biased towards recruiting fast conducting corticospinal neurons with mono-synaptic connections to the spinal motorneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Day et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edgley et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, the mean latency at which changes in motor cortical output are observable as changes in EMG activity is probably longer than 23 ms by several milliseconds.</p><p>To further elaborate the temporal relationship between global motor suppression and CancelTime, we performed a trial-by-trial analysis whereby MEP amplitudes were sorted according to the time at which TMS was delivered, relative to the time at which EMG decreased on Successful Stop, Failed Stop and Correct Go trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). The suppression of MEPs in Successful Stop trials compared to Correct Go trials began in the 30 ms prior to the EMG decline (−30 to 0 ms: <italic>Z</italic> = 3.12, <italic>p<sub>Bon</sub></italic> = 0.005; 0 to 30 ms: <italic>Z</italic> = 4.48, <italic>p<sub>Bon</sub></italic> &lt;0.001; 30 to 60 ms: <italic>Z</italic> = 2.45, <italic>p<sub>Bon</sub></italic> = 0.045). This lag in the time of EMG decrease relative to the time of the MEP suppression on Successful Stop trials can again be accounted for by the corticospinal conduction time. Thus, these results imply that the brain output to task-relevant muscles declines at approximately the same time as the global motor suppression begins. We note too, that MEPs were also suppressed in Failed Stop versus Correct Go trials, but at some delay relative to Successful Stops and the time of EMG cancellation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that the Stop process is initiated even in Failed Stop trials, and that part of the reason for the failure to stop is that the Stop process is initiated/implemented later in these trials (the other reason being that the Go process might have been completed particularly quickly).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Study 4 (EEG)</title><p>Having established that CancelTime reflects the time of an active stopping process at the muscle (studies 1 and 2, EMG/behavior), which also related tightly with the timing of global motor suppression (study 3, TMS), we then tested whether this EMG measure was also related to the timing of a prefrontal correlate of action-stopping, specifically the increase of beta power (13–30 Hz) before SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> at right frontal electrode sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castiglione et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>).

We started with the recently published observations that the standard behavioral measure of action-stopping (SSRT) is, an over-estimate of stopping latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bissett and Poldrack, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raud and Huster, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Skippen et al., 2019b</xref>). To more precisely delve into this, we validated a trial-by-trial method for estimating stopping latency from EMG. We focused on Successful Stop trials with small impulses (partial bursts) in EMG activity. The amplitude of such partial EMG activity was ~ 50% of the amplitude of EMG activity for outright keypresses, and this decreased at ~160 ms after the Stop signal (CancelTime), which is similar to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Raud et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raud and Huster, 2017</xref>). While, one interpretation of this partial EMG activity is that it merely reflects ‘weak’ Go activation that did not run to completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Jong et al., 1990</xref>), several lines of evidence strongly suggest it is a muscle manifestation of the stopped response. First, CancelTime was positively correlated with SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>, similar to recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huster et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thunberg et al., 2019</xref>). Second, the variability of CancelTime was positively correlated with the variability of SSRT estimated from the BEESTS modeling framework. Third, the partial EMG activity had a profile which was initially similar to the EMG profile seen when actual keypresses were made, and only diverged at ~55 ms after EMG onset. This initial similarity would not be expected if it were a weak Go activation – since previous research has demonstrated that weak and strong muscle activations have distinct profiles that diverge soon after onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bellumori et al., 2011</xref>). Fourth, our TMS experiment demonstrated that CancelTime coincided well with the timing of a putative basal ganglia-mediated global motor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wessel and Aron, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wessel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wessel and Aron, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wessel and Aron, 2017</xref>). This implies that the smaller amplitude and earlier decline of the partial EMG activity on Successful Stop was due to an active suppression of motor output. Fifth, across participants, on Successful Stop trials, CancelTime correlated strongly with the time of right frontal beta bursts (BurstTime) from scalp EEG. This is consistent with response inhibition being implemented via right prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aron et al., 2014</xref>), and with previous research showing an increase of beta at right frontal electrode sites before SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castiglione et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Due to the poor spatial resolution of EEG it is not possible to pin down the origin of the bursts recorded on the scalp to any particular frontal cortical area (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) – these bursts could relate to the rIFC or the presupplementary motor area, preSMA, or both [the rIFC and preSMA are connected via the aslant tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swann et al., 2012</xref>)]. We note again that two studies with intracranial EEG showed increases of right frontal beta for rIFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Swann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swann et al., 2012</xref>) and also that a recent study using source reconstruction of MEG signals based on fMRI in the same subjects showed an especially strong beta power increase for rIFC, that began ~ 140 ms after the Stop-signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>), consistent with our results.</p><p>We also acknowledge that the burst % was quite low on Successful Stop trials (~15%) and that CancelTimes on trials with and without bursts were not different (Study 5: CancelTime<sub>With Burst</sub> = 164 ± 9 ms; CancelTime<sub>No Burst</sub> = 165 ± 9 ms, <italic>t</italic>(12) = 0.6, p=0.58, <italic>d</italic> = 0.2, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 0.3; Study 4: too few trials for meaningful comparisons). While this might indicate that bursts are not necessary or sufficient for action-stopping, we think that the poor signal-to-noise of EEG could explain the low burst %. Further research is needed to test if beta bursts are causal to stopping. On a related point, the presence of beta on Go trials was also interesting. It is possible that beta bursts on Go trials reflected the (partly) spontaneous events that occur periodically (but have some functional consequence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shin et al., 2017</xref>), or the bursts might have had a role in proactive slowing on Go trials (as the task, after all, required participants to prepare to stop their response).</p><p>While several scalp EEG, intracranial EEG, and MEG studies showed increased right frontal beta power for stopping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castiglione et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Swann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>), a recent scalp EEG study focused on the spatial and temporal dynamics of beta bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wessel, 2020</xref>). That study saw that burst probability increased for likely dorsomedial frontal cortex (electrode FCz) rather than right frontal cortex, as we do. This discrepancy could be explained by our use of a spatial filter approach whereas that study analyzed the data in channel space. A further observation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wessel (2020)</xref> was that bursts increased over bilateral sensorimotor cortex ~ 25 ms after the frontal area; and this was interpreted as inhibition of the motor system. This fits our observation of a decrease in corticospinal excitability within ~ 20 ms of right frontal bursts. Putting aside methodological differences, these studies together implicate beta bursts in action-stopping.</p><p>A puzzle in our results was that CancelTime was ~ 60 ms earlier than SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>. To better understand this discrepancy, we calculated SSRT based on the EMG response rather than behavior. We saw that SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> better matched CancelTime than did SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>. Thus, SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> could be an over-estimation of the duration of the Stop process in the brain. This extra time in SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> probably reflects a ‘ballistic stage’ in generation of the button press (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Jong et al., 1990</xref>). We suggest that the maximum CancelTime reflects the last point at which a Stop process can intervene to prevent responses. We note that CancelTime (a muscle measurement) is an overestimation of the brain’s stopping latency since it does not include the corticospinal conduction time, which we estimated as ~ 20 ms, and does not include the stopping latencies of the No EMG trials, which presumably reflect the fastest stopping latencies where the Stop process was fast enough to cancel the impending response before it reaches the muscle. Indeed, our TMS results show that global motor suppression, which we take as the time at which motor areas of the brain are suppressed, is ~ 140 ms (which is ~ 20 ms less than CancelTime). One important consequence of our observation that the brain’s stopping latency is ~ 140 ms is that neural events that mediate stopping need to occur before this time. Indeed, we found that right frontal beta activity increased ~ 120 ms after the Stop signal on Successful Stop trials, and also that, across participants, there was a strong positive relationship between mean BurstTime and mean CancelTime.</p><p>Taken together, these studies motivate a relatively detailed model of the temporal events of action-stopping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). First, we suppose the right frontal beta bursts relate to activity of right inferior frontal gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Swann et al., 2009</xref>), and this happens in ~ 120 ms, which then leads via basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wessel et al., 2016</xref>) to global suppression of the primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wessel and Aron, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wessel and Aron, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wessel and Aron, 2017</xref>) at ~140 ms. After a corticospinal conduction delay of ~ 20 ms, this suppression of motor output is then reflected at ~160 ms as a decline in muscle activity (CancelTime). Finally, SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> occurs at ~220 ms, after, what we suppose is an electromechanical delay of ~ 60 ms. Thus, CancelTime <italic>narrows</italic> the time window for the causal manipulation of neural structures involved in action-stopping. This is in contrast to previous studies that have proposed that the onset of intramuscularly-recorded antagonist EMG responses (which is <italic>longer</italic> than SSRT) can be used as an alternative for estimating the stopping latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atsma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corneil et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goonetilleke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goonetilleke et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model of the temporal cascade of processes underlying human action-stopping.</title><p>Following the Stop signal, the right PFC including the rIFC and the preSMA gets activated at ~120 ms.

However, we note a striking convergence of timings across the current experiments and in other studies, for example CancelTime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hannah et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Raud et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raud and Huster, 2017</xref>), time of MEP suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coxon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van den Wildenberg et al., 2010</xref>), corticospinal conduction time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Groppa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hamada et al., 2013</xref>), BurstTimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hannah et al., 2019</xref>), and the ballistic stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gopal and Murthy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jana and Murthy, 2018</xref>). Together, these all provide support for our model.</p><p>This model specifies the possible chronometrics of stopping in more detail than extant human models, and, more generally, raises questions about the timing reported in some other studies where the neural change appears late. For example, movement neurons in monkey Frontal Eye Field decrease activity in less than 10 ms before SSRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanes et al., 1998</xref>), dopaminergic neurons in rodent substantia nigra and striatum increase activity only 12 ms before SSRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ogasawara et al., 2018</xref>), TMS at ~ 25 ms before SSRT over human Intraparietal Sulcus prolongs SSRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Osada et al., 2019</xref>), and P300 human EEG activity ~ 300 ms after the Stop signal relates to the stopping latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wessel and Aron, 2015</xref>). Whereas the rather late timing of some of these results might be related to processes such as monitoring and feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huster et al., 2019</xref>) as has been ascribed to brain signatures that modulate after SSRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Logan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schall and Boucher, 2007</xref>), our earlier latencies for prefrontal bursts, TMS-MEP and muscle CancelTime are more indicative of a role in stopping itself.</p><p>While our study specifically looked at the chronometrics of the Stop process, and tried to better characterize the physiological model underlying action-stopping, we also now speculate how our results relate to computational models of action-stopping (specifically, the independent race model, the interactive race model, the BEESTS model, and the blocked-input model, and the). First, our results are not compatible with a strictly independent model (of the Go and the Stop processes) since we see active inhibition of M1 (the Go process) already some time before SSRT. Second, our results are compatible with the interactive race model which suggests that the Stop process begins late, but implementation is quick (i.e. within the last 1/3<sup>th</sup> of the stopping latency) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boucher et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, we observed beta bursts in frontal areas ~ 120 ms after the stop signal followed by rapid cancellation at the muscle within ~ 40 ms. Third, our results are also compatible with the BEESTS model insofar as they point to a trigger process that has a duration of about 80–120 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bekker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Skippen et al., 2019a</xref>). Finally, the interactive-race model and blocked-input model are very similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Logan et al., 2015</xref>), so our results do not disambiguate them.</p><p>Our results have several important implications. First, whereas several earlier studies of action-stopping recorded partial EMG for various purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Jong et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGarry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McGarry and Franks, 1997</xref>), some more recent ones specifically interpreted the time of the partial EMG as related to stopping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huster et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Raud et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raud and Huster, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thunberg et al., 2019</xref>). Our results strongly affirm that partial EMG can be used to estimate the latency of stopping reflected in the muscle. Second, as just noted, they provide temporal constraints on neuroscience studies of stopping in the brain. They suggest that methods with high temporal resolution need to focus on the time after the Stop signal and before CancelTime (indeed CancelTime minus conduction time) rather than before SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>, and the current study points to the potential of CancelTime as single-trial metric of stopping (please see our recent pre-print; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hannah et al., 2019</xref>). Third, our results have clinical implications. Whereas meta-analysis shows that SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> is longer for patients (e.g. ADHD, OCD, and substance use disorder) vs. controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alderson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bari and Robbins, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lavagnino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lijffijt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Snyder et al., 2015</xref>), not all such studies show differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kalanthroff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lipszyc and Schachar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). We predict that CancelTime will be more sensitive than SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>. Furthermore, future studies can easily estimate within-subject variability in CancelTime, which will likely discriminate patients from controls. Fourth, our results provide insight into why SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> might only have a modest relationship with more ‘real-world’ measures of impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhury et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Enkavi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friedman and Miyake, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lijffijt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McLaughlin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Skippen et al., 2019b</xref>). As we show, SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> includes not only CancelTime but an extra, and variable, 60 ms ballistic stage. We expect that future studies may show stronger correlations between CancelTime and self-report than that seen between SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> and self-report (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Skippen et al., 2019b</xref>); likewise we predict that right frontal beta burst time might also correlate more tightly with self-report measures. More generally, the detailed timing information of frontal beta at ~ 120 ms, global motor suppression at ~ 140 ms, and CancelTime at ~ 160 ms points to subprocesses of action-stopping that provide potential biomarkers that could better explain individual differences in impulse control.</p><p>In conclusion, we propose a detailed timing model of action-stopping that partitions it into subprocesses that are isolable to different nodes and are more precise than the behavioral latency of stopping. At the core of this timing model is a method of measuring the latency of stopping from the muscles. This offers a potential single-trial estimate of stopping latency that could be easily measured with minimal equipment in any lab that studies human participants.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>All were adult, healthy, human volunteers provided written informed consent and were compensated at $20/hour.

During the task, the coil was positioned on the scalp over the left primary motor cortex representation of the ECR muscle and oriented so that the coil handle was approximately perpendicular to the central sulcus, that is at ~45° to the mid-sagittal line, and the initial phase of current induced in the brain was posterior-to-anterior across the central sulcus. Prior to the experiment, the motor hot spot was determined as the position on the scalp where slightly supra-threshold stimuli produced the largest and most consistent MEPs in ECR. The position was marked on a cap worn by the participants. Resting motor threshold (RMT) was defined as the lowest intensity to evoke an MEP of at least 0.05 mV in 5 of 10 consecutive trials while participants were at rest.

Any EMG activity which was greater than 8 SD of the mean EMG activity in the baseline period (Fixation to Go cue) was marked, on a trial-by-trial basis. Starting from the peak of that EMG activity, we backtracked and marked the onset at the point where the activity dropped below 20% of the peak for five consecutive ms. This method of adjusting the threshold based on the peak EMG activity, allowed better onset detection than a fixed threshold, especially when the amplitude of the EMG activity was small. The time when EMG started to decline was determined as the time when, following the peak EMG, the activity decreased for five consecutive ms. Visual inspection of individual trials showed that this method provided a reliable detection of both EMG onsets (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref> for RT<sub>EMG</sub> vs. RT<sub>Beh</sub> correlation) and decline.

Hence, negative values mean that TMS was delivered before the EMG decline and positive values mean that TMS was delivered after. We then plotted MEP amplitudes for each of the three response types (Correct Go, Failed Stop, and Successful Stop) against the normalized times binned into 30 ms windows.

For each detected burst, the time of the peak beta amplitude was marked as the BurstTime.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For pairwise comparisons, the data were first checked for normality using Lilliefors test, and if normally distributed a two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test (<italic>t</italic>-statistic) was performed, else a Wilcoxon signed rank test (<italic>Z</italic>-statistic) was performed. We interpret the effect sizes as small (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>: 0.2–0.5; Bayes Factor in favor of the alternate hypothesis, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic>: 1–3), medium (<italic>d</italic>: 0.5–0.8; <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic>: 3–10), large (<italic>d</italic> &gt; 0.8; <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> &gt; 10). For comparisons across multiple levels, repeated-measures ANOVA was used, followed by Bonferroni corrected <italic>t</italic>-tests for pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>-value: <italic>p<sub>Bon</sub></italic>). The Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied where the assumption of sphericity in ANOVA was violated (corrected <italic>F</italic>-statistic: <italic>F<sub>GG</sub></italic>). Effect sizes for ANOVAs were interpreted as small (partial eta-squared, <italic>η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup></italic>: 0.01–0.06), medium (<italic>η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup></italic>: 0.06–0.14), and large (<italic>η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> : 0.14). For correlational analyses, Pearson’s correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>) was usually used, but Spearman’s correlation coefficient (<italic>ρ</italic>) was used when the data was bounded in a closed interval. All data are presented as mean ± s.e.m.</p><p>In testing the relationship between BurstTime and CancelTime, we performed a permutation test. We sampled BurstTimes randomly from a uniform distribution between 0 and SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> for a given participant for 3000 iterations. For each iteration, we then computed the correlation (<italic>r</italic>) between the mean BurstTime and the mean CancelTime across participants. This generated a distribution of <italic>r</italic> ranging between −1 and 1. The <italic>p</italic>-value for our analysis was determined as the P(<italic>r</italic> ≥ <italic>r<sub>Obs</sub></italic>|H<sub>0</sub>) in the permuted data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Bayesian modelling of behavioral data</title><p>We used the BEESTS model developed by Dora Matzke and colleagues (run in R Studio 1.1.463) which assumes a race between two stochastically independent process, a Go and a Stop processes. This model estimates the distribution of the SSRT by using the participant’s Go RT<sub>Beh</sub> distribution, and by considering the Failed Stop RT<sub>Beh</sub> as a censored Go RT<sub>Beh</sub> distribution. The censoring points are sampled randomly from the SSRT distribution on each Stop trial. The RT<sub>Beh</sub> distributions underlying the Go and Stop processes are assumed to have a Gaussian and an exponential component and is described by three parameters (<italic>μ<sub>Go</sub></italic>, <italic>σ<sub>Go</sub></italic>, <italic>τ<sub>Go</sub></italic> and <italic>μ<sub>Stop</sub></italic>, <italic>σ<sub>Stop</sub>, τ<sub>Stop</sub></italic>). For such ex-Gaussian distributions, the mean and variance of the RT<sub>Beh</sub> distributions are determined as <italic>μ + τ</italic> and <italic>μ</italic><sup>2</sup> + <italic>τ</italic><sup>2</sup>, respectively. The model also estimates the probability of trigger failures for each participant. The model uses Bayesian Parametric Method (BPE) to estimate the parameters of the distributions. We used a hierarchical BPE, where individual subject parameters are modeled with the group-level distributions. This approach is thought to be more accurate than fitting individual participants and is effective when there is less data per participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matzke et al., 2013</xref>). We pooled the subjects across both study 1 and 2 to estimate the individual parameters. The priors were bounded uniform distributions (<italic>μ<sub>Go</sub></italic>, <italic>μ<sub>Stop</sub>: U</italic>(0,2); <italic>σ<sub>Go</sub></italic>, <italic>σ<sub>Stop</sub>: U</italic>(0,0.5) <italic>τ<sub>Go,</sub> τ<sub>Stop</sub>: U</italic>(0,0.5); pTF: U(0,1)). The posterior distributions were estimated using the Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling and we ran multiple chains. We ran the model for 5000 samples with a thinning of 5. The Gelman-Rubin (R̂) statistic was used to estimate the convergence of the chain. Chains were considered converged if R̂&lt;1.1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data and scripts</title><p>A core element of this paper is a novel method of calculating single-trial stopping latency from EMG.

of EMG cancellation (CancelTime) might be attributed to an inherent ‘ballistic stage’ in movements, and once the muscle activity crosses the point-of-no-return they can no longer be stopped, making the movement inevitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Jong et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mirabella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Osman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Verbruggen and Logan, 2009</xref>). The duration of such ballistic stages has been estimated to be 10–25 ms in saccades in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boucher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kornylo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Purcell et al., 2010</xref>) and 40–50 ms for reaching movements in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gopal and Murthy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jana and Murthy, 2018</xref>). In other words, the time of EMG cancellation on partial EMG trials reflects a time just before the point-of-no-return, whereby if EMG activity is allowed to develop beyond this point it will exceed a critical threshold such that a button press necessarily ensues (we presume this threshold reflects the point at which the inertia of the finger is overcome). In this respect, what is being tracked by the SSD staircasing procedure is the probability of crossing that EMG threshold, but since SSRT is calculated based on keypress response times, it inevitably incorporates the ballistic stage that follows the crossing of this threshold.</p><p>To test the idea that there might be a ballistic stage in responses which inflates SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>we simulated the independent race model with a Go and Stop accumulator which raced to a threshold, where the activity of each accumulator could be described by the mean drift rate (μ) and the SD of the drift rate (σ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boucher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ramakrishnan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>). First, we tested whether the independent race model without a ballistic stage could fit the behavioral results. For each participant, we fitted the RT<sub>EMG</sub> and RT<sub>Beh</sub> distributions in the Correct Go trials, to estimate the (μ<sub>GO-EMG</sub>, σ<sub>GO-EMG</sub>) and (μ<sub>GO-Beh</sub>, σ<sub>GO-Beh</sub>). Next, using the estimated Go parameters, we estimated the (μ<sub>Stop</sub>,σ<sub>Stop</sub>), which would best fit the inhibition function. This estimation of the Stop parameters (μ<sub>Stop</sub>,σ<sub>Stop</sub>) was performed separately for EMG (μ<sub>STOP-EMG</sub>,σ<sub>STOP-EMG</sub>) and keypresses (μ<sub>STOP-Beh</sub>,σ<sub>STOP-Beh</sub>). We reasoned that if the only difference between the two inhibition functions is due to the difference in the Go processes (RT<sub>EMG</sub> vs RT<sub>Beh</sub>) then the μ<sub>STOP-EMG</sub> should be similar to μ<sub>STOP-Beh</sub>. However, this was not the case. First, Stop distributions estimated from the EMG and keypresses were quite distinct, where μ<sub>STOP-EMG</sub> (188 ± 8 ms) was significantly less than μ<sub>STOP-Beh</sub> (207 ± 5 ms; <italic>t</italic>(41) = 2.7, p=0.009, <italic>d</italic> = 0.4, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 4.4). Second, the difference between the simulated and experimental inhibition function was much greater when (μ<sub>STOP-EMG</sub>,σ<sub>STOP-EMG</sub>) was used to fit the behavioral inhibition function compared to the EMG inhibition function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). To quantify this, we computed the squared difference between the experimental and simulated P(Respond|Stop) data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>; EMG inhibition function, squared error between experimental and simulated data = 0.15 ± 0.02; RT inhibition function, squared error = 0.23 ± 0.02, <italic>t</italic>(41) = 2.7, p=0.011, <italic>d</italic> = 0.6, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 3.7). Conversely, the difference between the simulated and experimental inhibition function was much greater when μ<sub>STOP-Beh</sub> was used to fit the EMG inhibition function compared to the behavioral inhibition function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d,e,f</xref>; behavioral inhibition function, squared error = 0.10 ± 0.01; EMG inhibition function, squared error = 0.22 ± 0.02, <italic>t</italic>(41) = 4.7, p&lt;0.001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.7, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> &gt;100). This incompatibility suggests that some change needs to be made to the model such that one Stop distribution is able to fit both the EMG and keypress inhibition functions. Hence, we tested whether incorporating a ballistic stage in the delay between RT<sub>EMG</sub> and RT<sub>Beh</sub> could rescue the model.</p><p>To check this, we used a model previously used to study stopping of reaching movements in the context of coordinated eye-hand movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gopal and Murthy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jana and Murthy, 2018</xref>). Here, the Go process comprises an accumulation phase, and once the accumulator hits the threshold, EMG responses can be observed, and then following a peripheral delay, the EMG builds up enough (i.e. the point-of-no-return) to be able to cross the inertia of the limb and generate a movement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1g,h,i</xref>). If the Stop reaches the threshold before the Go reaches the threshold, then no EMG is elicited (no EMG trial). Further, if the Stop reaches the threshold early during the delay period when the EMG has not built up to a critical level (point-of-no-return) it will be able to inhibit the response resulting in a partial EMG trial. However, if the Stop reaches the threshold after the EMG has reached the point-of-no-return a movement is inevitable, resulting in a Failed Stop trial. We used this model to estimate the duration of the ballistic stage. Across participants, the mean ballistic stage was 34 ± 4 ms. Incorporation of this ballistic stage allowed μ<sub>STOP-EMG</sub> to fit the behavioral inhibition function much better than a model without a ballistic stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1j,k</xref>; squared error = 0.14 ± 0.02, <italic>t</italic>(41) = 4.2, p&lt;0.001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.7, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> &gt; 100). Thus, based on our model, there exists a ballistic stage in keypress responses, which might be responsible for the difference between CancelTime and SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>. While this measure was less than our estimate of ~60 ms, we note that some participants did not have a sigmoidal inhibition function (as the task was designed to have a P(Stop)=0.5 such that SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> could be well estimated) leading to suboptimal estimation of the Stop parameters. Indeed, when we considered only those participants who had lower than the population median error, the duration of the ballistic stage was 47 ± 3 ms which is closer to our estimate of ~60 ms.</p><sec id="s8" sec-type="appendix"><title>Methods</title><p>The rate of accumulation is governed by the differential equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boucher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ramakrishnan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac> <mml:mi/><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>+</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msqrt><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:msqrt><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ξ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac> <mml:mi/><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>+</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msqrt><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:msqrt><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ξ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>da<sub>GO</sub></italic> and<italic>, da<sub>STOP</sub></italic> represents the change in accumulation within a time-step <italic>dt</italic> and a time constant <italic>τ</italic>; <italic>μ<sub>GO</sub></italic> and <italic>μ<sub>STOP</sub></italic> is the mean drift rate; <italic>ξ<sub>GO</sub></italic> and <italic>ξ<sub>STOP</sub></italic> is a Gaussian noise term with mean 0 and SD equal to the σ of the associated accumulator, which represents the noise in the input signal; <italic>k</italic> is the leakage parameter. <italic>k</italic> was set to 0, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac> <mml:mi/></mml:math></inline-formula> was set to 1.</p></sec><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>Parameter estimation of the independent race model with a ballistic stage</title><p><bold>Step 1</bold> was to estimate the (μ<sub>GO-EMG</sub>, σ<sub>GO-EMG</sub>), that is the mean and SD that would generate RT<sub>EMG</sub> distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> <italic>inset</italic> green beeswarm plot) for each participant. A range of values, representing the parameter space for (μ<sub>GO-EMG</sub>, σ<sub>GO-EMG</sub>), which could generate behaviorally relevant distributions were uniformly and ‘coarsely’ sampled, to simulate distributions for 2000 trials. The top 20 parameters which generated a distribution with a mean and SD within 30 ms of the mean and SD of the empirical RT<sub>EMG</sub> distribution and had the minimum least-squared error between the empirical and simulated cumulative distribution function, were fed into MATLAB’s fmincon function for optimization.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Wery van den Wildenbert as the Reviewing Editor and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Ivry (Senior Editor).</p><p>The Reviewing Editor, Wery van den Wildenberg, drafted this letter based on the detailed evaluation reports. As you will see, the reviewers are generally positive about the broad scope and they commend the use of different methodological approaches.</p><p>Several issues, detailed below as major points, deserve attention when preparing a revision of your manuscript. Of these, we would like to highlight the tendency to not give sufficient credit to prior relevant publications of others (some of which are listed under major point 1). The inclusion of relevant previous work on partial EMG and beta-burst analyses (major point 10) might lead to a more balanced rating of the acclaimed novelty of the methods and conclusions.</p><p>Given that this paper addresses questions about when and where stopping occurs, major points 6 and 11 seem to be particularly fundamental. Major point 6 might be viewed as a fundamental challenge to the temporal cascade as proposed by the authors (i.e., about when stopping occurs). Major point 11 seems to fundamentally challenge the attempt to spatially localize a stop command that is necessary and sufficient for stopping (i.e., about where stopping occurs).</p><p>The work is presented as if it &quot;confirms a detailed model of action-stopping&quot; [Abstract]. In general, the reviewers seem to be in agreement in their impression that this should better be toned down (see also major point 4). In its current form, which in and of itself represents elaborate work, such claims might better be framed in terms of tentative evidence for a neural model for stopping.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The in-depth content and broad scope of the manuscript are impressive. The five empirical studies cover different neurocognitive levels of the information processing chain when healthy participants are cued to stop a motor action. Not only is stopping investigated at different stages during processing (from the brain to muscles, and behavior), the lineup of the methods, including EEG, single-pulse TMS, EMG, and modeling techniques, provide a full account of the temporal dynamics and the neural mechanisms that are at play during action stopping. The fact that the extent of these comments go far beyond the recommendation of 500 words reflects the width of methods and topics touched by this manuscript. Whereas some interpretations and claims should be toned down a bit, and the bulk of the comments refer to these rather conceptual issues, the work is considered very important and an innovative contribution to the study of action cancellation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Relevant Background Literature:</p><p>1) The authors are kind to mention work by Huster et al. on residual or partial EMG in successful stop trials.

On the one hand, one may argue that it could avoid rather unspecific biases associated with the use of different response systems for the estimation of the SSRT. Then again, whereas plausible, it is not really clear that this is the case as little research systematically assessed the influence of response devices on the shape and timing of the EMG. Also, I see no good justification for classifying partial response EMG trials as failed stop trials; no overt response was produced, which is the instruction given to the participants, and I think there is no good justification to only classify trials without any EMG response as successful stop trials. In the end, I am unsure about how to interpret this measure meaningfully, and whether it can be used to &quot;validate&quot; the CancelTime (as is implied here). Not least, the calculation of the SSRTEMG relies on a rather small subset of SSDs (three per subject), as described in the subsection “Data analysis”, whereas usually a wide sampling of SSDs is recommended.</p><p>3) When testing the partial response EMG against different SSDs, the H0 of no difference is justified by means of &quot;weak go processes&quot;. I am wondering though what that implies: a very slow response (i.e., shallow slope), or one with a high threshold (thus unlikely to cause a button press), or a relatively delayed onset?</p><p>Functional interpretation of CancelTime:</p><p>4) The authors stress repeatedly that the CancelTime can be considered or is used as single-trial measure of the stop process. I suggest to tone this claim down, because:</p><p>- it is not really used as a single-trial measure in the vast majority of analyses (with exceptions being the SD-based correlations of CancelTime and SSRTBEESTS, or the CancelTime-MEP alignment).</p><p>- a proper metric should undergo testing in terms of its psychometric properties (reliability, validity, objectivity etc.). This is too often overlooked, not only but especially with psychophysiological measures.</p><p>Thus, whereas I am also hopeful that the CancelTime may serve us as such a measure one day, I think we should not make this claim yet.</p><p>5) In order to validate CancelTime, the authors show high correlations with other stop task measures including SSRTbeh and BEESTs model estimates. Along with other traditional measures, CancelTime was positively correlated with trigger failure rate. This seems to challenge the discriminant validity of CancelTime (and/or trigger failure rate). CancelTime was calculated on trials in which a stop signal has been triggered, reaches the muscle of the hand, but a behavioral response is not emitted. It is also intended to be a purer measure of response inhibition. Trigger failures are putative failures of attention and should only occur on failed stop trials. I suggest that the authors discuss this relationship between CancelTime and trigger failure rate.</p><p>Concerning Temporal Dynamics:</p><p>6) If I am understanding correctly, CancelTime is computed exclusively from partial EMG trials. Additionally, it is intended to be an alternative to SSRTbeh, which is a measure of the central tendency of SSRT across all trials. When CancelTime is compared to SSRTbeh, CancelTime is ~60ms shorter. The authors argue that CancelTime is shorter than SSRTbeh because CancelTime does not include the (~60ms) electromechanical delay and therefore is a purer measure of stopping. However, I would like to suggest another explanation for why CancelTime is shorter than SSRTbeh.</p><p>Assuming (1) a race model architecture, (2) variability in the go RT and (3) variability in SSRT, then failed stops will tend to occur when SSD is long, go RT is fast, and SSRT is slow. Successful stops will tend to occur when SSD is short, go RT is slow, and SSRT is fast. Partial EMG trials, which I understand to be trials in which the go process doesn't win as decisively as a successful stop trial or fail as decisively as a failed stop trial, should have SSD, go RT, and SSRT values between these two extremes. However, ~1/2 of trials are failed stop, ~1/4 of trials as partialEMG, and ~1/4 of trials are successful stops. Therefore, partialEMG trials should be preferentially sampled from the half of trials with shorter SSD, slower go RT, and faster SSRT. If this is the case, then CancelTime being faster than SSRTbeh may be partially or completely explained by CancelTime being selectively sampled from faster SSRT trials whereas SSRTbeh is computed across all stop trials.</p><p>To concretize my suggestion in an example, if we assume an SSRT distribution with variability such that the first quantile has a mean of 120 ms, the second 160 ms, the third 250, and the fourth 350 ms. When the first quantile is sampled, these should preferentially result in successful stops, when the second is sampled these should preferentially result in partialEMG trials, and when either of the latter two are sampled these should preferentially result in failed stop. However, if you computed CancelTime on these data it should be closer to 160ms (as a result of preferentially sampling the 2nd quantile) but the overall central tendency of the SSRT distribution would be ~220ms.</p><p>This alternative implies that the average neural latency for stopping may not differ from SSRTbeh, or may differ less than the ~60 ms suggested here. One tool for evaluating this alternative explanation may be to simulate stop trials with variability in go, stop and SSD and evaluate whether computing SSRT only (or preferentially) on trials sampled from the 2nd quartile of SSRT can produce significant differences from the traditional method of computing SSRTbehav. If it may be useful, here is some openly available code that instantiates the interactive race framework and would allow varying go, stop, and SSD: https://github.com/bissettp/SharingContextDependence/blob/master/interactive_race.ipynb).</p><p>7) The authors stress that parts of their model of the processing sequence is supported by the fact that the temporal distance between cortical reduction in excitability (TMS) and the CancelTime corresponds to the corticospinal conduction time (here about 23 ms). The difference between the CancelTime and the reduced motorcortical excitability is about 15 ms (155 – 140). However, the onset of decreased motorcortical excitability, which would best correspond to the onset of the decline in MEP amplitude, does start before that, as can be seen in Figure 4A. An only somewhat smaller effect is apparent already at 120ms, with an onset probably even before that. This would add another 20+ ms to the equation, thus contrasting 23ms vs. 35+ms. The point I want to make is that, even though I find the interpretation of the findings interesting and plausible, care has to be taken not to over-interpret these measures since they are heavily dependent on our statistical procedures (sample size, size of presumably relevant effect, parameterization of onset times etc.).</p><p>8) The validity of the reduced TMS-MEPs as indicators of the stopping process is derived from the strong reduction in successful stop relative to go trials around 140 ms, a notion further supported by Figure 4D. It is not discussed, however, that MEPs also are reduced for unsuccessful stop trials around 140 ms locked to the stop signal (a reduction similar to that of successful stop trials; Figure 4B; the effect does not seem to be that much smaller). How to reconcile these findings?</p><p>9) In the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, the authors cite papers showing that in monkey, rats, and humans that neurons that are putatively related to stopping change close to SSRT. This seems like considerable evidence against the chronometric framework presented here that assumes that the stop command is sent from brain to muscle well before SSRT (~60 ms + conduction time). I think it would be helpful to understand the authors' position on how these seemingly contradictory findings relate to this current framework.</p><p>Functional Significance of Beta Burst Activity:</p><p>10) How does the work presented in Study 4 relate to the recent preprint of a paper by Wessel on the role of beta bursts in stopping? [Wessel, J.R., &quot;β-bursts reveal the trial-to-trial dynamics of movement initiation and cancellation&quot;, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/644682v1].</p><p>11) Study 4 finds an increase in beta bursts for successful stops relative to baseline and go trials, an effect interpreted as indicator of the engagement of the right inferior frontal stopping processes. This is a very interesting finding, but its interpretation is not without some conceptual problems.</p><p>- Given that EEG is plagued with the inverse problem, it seems somewhat unjustified to claim that this signature originates in the right frontal cortex. But even if one would agree that a rough deduction of the source from its topography is possible, I would have a hard time to associate the rather midfrontal topography with a right frontal source close to the sylvian fissure. Beyond, the authors performed dipole fitting on the independent component topographies, and thus could easily check if the individual dipoles of these components at least roughly are fitted to such a position.</p><p>- Βeta burst activity is depicted and analyzed relative to the pre-stop period. If we leave the IC-selection aside for a moment, the resulting time courses may still be in accordance with an effect akin to motor beta: around the time of the stop signal, beta activity would be similarly low for all three categories due to motor preparation, followed by rebound-effects that might be earlier in case of successful stops (cancelled), succeeded by unsuccessful stops and go trials (rebound after execution).</p><p>The IC selection states, however, that a component needed to show a beta power increase between the stop signal and the SSRT compared to a time window prior to the go cue. This should exclude potential motor beta components with typical time courses delineated above. The time course for the go activity supports this assumption. Nevertheless, given the conceptual importance of this beta component in this context, it would be nice to also see the go-locked time courses for the stop-related conditions.</p><p>12) I understand the presented beta burst data to be the probability that a beta burst occurred on any given trial. Assuming this, beta bursts, which are taken as evidence of the frontal (perhaps rIFG) signal to stop, only occur on ~15% of stop trials (14.6% in Experiment 4 and 16.2% in Experiment 5). Additionally, beta bursts often occur on go and stop-failure trials, sometimes at similar rates to successful stop trials (e.g., 15.4% in Experiment 5 for stop-failure rates). Therefore, beta bursts happen on few stop trials and almost as many go trials as stop trials. How does this signal that is neither necessary or sufficient for stopping explain stop success generally? Might there be differences between stop success trials with and without beta bursts? Could trials with beta bursts be edge cases of some sort (e.g., when proactive control is low and reactive stopping is therefore particularly essential) that are not indicative of the general mechanism for stopping on the other 85% of stop success trials?</p><p>Theoretical Implications:</p><p>13) I agree with the authors that these results have potentially striking implications for existing models of stopping. However, I think the paper could be improved by laying out these implications more explicitly. For instance, how does this framework relate to existing models including the original Independent Race Model (Logan and Cowan, 1984 / Psych Review), updated Independent Race Models including blocked input models (Logan et al., 2014; Logan et al., 2015), the Interactive Race Model (Boucher et al., 2007), the BEESTs model and trigger failures (Matzke et al., this relates to comment 5), and perhaps recent work suggesting violations of independence that can be accounted for by variable, sometimes weak inhibition (Bissett, Poldrack and Logan, in revision https://psyarxiv.com/kpa65).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the revised version of your article &quot;Temporal cascade of frontal, motor and muscle processes underlying human action-stopping&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Below you can find the whole line of reasoning (main point 2). More data, additional analyses or simulation studies are not required (or even asked) at this point. A discussion of the seemingly controversial time-courses would be sufficient.</p><p>Elaboration on these issues:</p><p>1) The authors wrote a detailed and insightful response, which essentially clarified my methodological questions. Some of the more conceptual issues were answered well in the response letter, yet the changes in the manuscript were less substantial than what one might have expected.</p><p>a) E.g., regarding Wessel's beta-burst analysis: the authors now cite this work (Results), but rather casually so. The manuscript does not try to compare or integrate the presented findings with Wessel's.</p><p>b) The same goes for the partial EMG work. Most of the studies we provided in the first round of the review are cited, but again rather offhand. The manuscript does not really integrate the different studies. Several studies already used an estimate essentially the same to what the authors still refer to as &quot;our idea of CancelTime&quot; (although admittedly these claims have been toned down), yet no attempt is made to compare these estimates, their correlations with SSRTs etc.</p><p>c) In some ways, I find that some of the claims made are not founded well enough in data, and the authors seem to be aware of it: &quot;we agree that the temporal cascade model that we have constructed is only approximate as it is averaged across participants who had different stopping latencies, and is also contingent on, as the reviewers' rightly point out, on statistical procedures.&quot;</p><p>Yet again, the manuscript has not really been changed in accordance with this. Still, it is not properly discussed, for example, that the exact timing estimates heavily rely on the choice of latency estimates (EMG/MEP onsets or peak, of which each again can be calculated in many different ways.</p><p>2) I reviewed the initial submission of this manuscript. The manuscript is significantly improved in many ways. The editor requested that we evaluate whether claims have been toned down, previous work on EMG and beta-bursts have been acknowledged, and main point 6 regarding the timing estimate of CancelTime and a ballistic phase have been addressed. I think the first two points have been sufficiently addressed. However, the authors response to Main Point 6, especially their point 3, has raised new concerns about their claims about timing of stopping.</p><p>The authors present a 3-part response to main point 6. Part 1 points out that SSRTemg is similar to CancelTime and argues that this is consistent with the remaining ~60ms difference between CancelTime and SSRTbeh being a ballistic stage. Part 2 presents simulations consistent with a ballistic stage that is 34-47ms long (which is perhaps less than the ~60ms difference between canceltime and SSRTbeh). Point 3 argues that the real end of the race (at least as a criterion for evaluating CancelTime) is when EMG amplitude exceeds the threshold set on PartialEMG trials. They show that on correct go trials this threshold is exceeded ~100ms after the average stop signal would occur. Given the SSD tracking algorithm that ensured that the race between going and stopping is roughly tied, then the real latency of the stop process (as measured by EMG) may be ~100ms, so CancelTime may actually be an overestimate of the average stop latency.</p><p>The part 3 simulation results seem to conflict with multiple pieces of evidence in the manuscript and the literature. It appears that the authors are suggesting that the ballistic stage may be ~120ms (~220ms SSRTbeh minus the ~100ms stop process), which is both inconsistent with the simulation results in part 2 and inconsistent with the previous literature presented in the manuscript (e.g., Gopal and Muphy, 2016; Jana and Murthy, 2018 suggested 50ms for reaching movements). It also seems to bring into question the entire temporal sequence presented in the manuscript. Why would the end of the race be observable in muscles at 100ms if the signal to stop from cortex (perhaps rIFG) occurs 20ms later at 120ms?</p><p>Additionally, none of the 3 parts of the response have directly addressed the reviewers' main point 6. To briefly reiterate, assuming a race model, the ~50% of trials that are true failed stops (an overt response occurs) should tend to have the longest SSDs, fastest go RTs, and slowest SSRTs. The ~25% of trials that are successful stops with no EMG should be the opposite: shortest SSDs, slowest go RTs, and fastest SSRTs. This leaves the ~25% of trials that are successful stops with EMG, which should be in between these extremes. However, because there are ~twice as many stop failures as stop successes, the partial EMG trials will tend have shorter SSDs, slower go RT, and faster SSRTs than each measure's overall average. Therefore, CancelTime may be an underestimate of the true central tendency of SSRT across all stop trials.</p><p>In the text, the authors seem to agree with parts of this point, at least in part. They say &quot;CancelTime… does not include the stopping latencies of the No EMG trials, which presumably reflect the fastest stopping latencies where the Stop process was fast enough to cancel the impending response before it reaches the muscle&quot;. However, they do not point out that CancelTime also does not include stop-failure trials, which presumably reflect the slowest stopping latencies, leaving CancelTime to reflect stopping latencies that are faster than the slowest half of stop trials but slower than the fastest quarter of stop trials. Also, in Figures 1G-I in their response, they illustrate how they believe correct stops with No EMG, correct stops with partial EMG, and failed stops arise from an accumulator model framework. No EMG has the fastest stop process, failed stop has the slowest stop process, and partial EMG is in between.</p><p>To conclude, I do not think that the response to main point 6 addressed the original concern, and I believe that the new simulations bring up new questions about the temporal cascade of processes in stopping. Does the stop process reach the muscle ~150-160ms after the stop signal, as suggested by CancelTime and SSRTemg, or is it ~100ms after the stop signal, as seemingly suggested by their part 3 in response to Main Point 6? If the latter, then how does this fit in with TMS evidence of motor suppression at ~140ms or beta-burst in cortex (perhaps rIFG) at 120ms? Also, if the argument from Main Point 6 is valid (and the authors do not address its validity directly), how can this be synthesized with the Part 3 response suggesting that CancelTime is an overestimate of the latency of the stop process?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50371.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Relevant Background Literature:</p><p>1) The authors are kind to mention work by Huster et al. on residual or partial EMG in successful stop trials.

On the one hand, one may argue that it could avoid rather unspecific biases associated with the use of different response systems for the estimation of the SSRT. Then again, whereas plausible, it is not really clear that this is the case as little research systematically assessed the influence of response devices on the shape and timing of the EMG. Also, I see no good justification for classifying partial response EMG trials as failed stop trials; no overt response was produced, which is the instruction given to the participants, and I think there is no good justification to only classify trials without any EMG response as successful stop trials. In the end, I am unsure about how to interpret this measure meaningfully, and whether it can be used to &quot;validate&quot; the CancelTime (as is implied here). Not least, the calculation of the SSRTEMG relies on a rather small subset of SSDs (three per subject), as described in the subsection “Data analysis”, whereas usually a wide sampling of SSDs is recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we would like to sincerely apologize for an erroneous reporting in the Materials and methods section of the manuscript, <italic>all</italic> SSDs were considered for calculation of SSRT<sub>EMG</sub>, and <italic>not</italic> 3 SSDs per subject. The results mentioned for SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> thus considered the whole range of SSDs per subject. In fact, when the 3 most frequent SSDs are selected, mean SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> = 163 ± 6 ms, as opposed to 157 ± 7 ms in the manuscript. We have accordingly changed this in the revised manuscript (subsection “Data analysis”).</p><p>The reviewers point out that the use of SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> could potentially avoid biases in the determination of stopping latency associated with different response devices, but question whether this is likely to be the case because we don’t know how EMG profiles and onsets differ across devices. However, SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> relies mainly on being able to detect an increase in EMG above baseline, and not really on the shape of the EMG after onset. EMG onsets can be reliably detected (Gopal et al., 2015; Jana et al., 2016) and correlate well with response times across a range of response devices (Botwinick and Thompson, 1966) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), despite differences mechanical responses and thus electromechanical delays, supporting their use as a criterion measure. Thus, for simple movements (e.g. single joint) one might expect EMG onsets, but not electromechanical delays, to remain relatively consistent across devices, and consequently that SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> might be less susceptible to device-related differences in estimations of stopping latency.</p><p>Moreover, our contention is that a large part of the difference between SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> and the time of EMG cancellation (CancelTime) is due to an inherent “ballistic stage” in movements, and once the muscle activity crosses the point-of-no-return they can no longer be stopped, and a movement is inevitable (De Jong et al., 1990; Mirabella et al., 2006; Osman et al., 1986; Verbruggen and Logan, 2009). The duration of such ballistic stages has been estimated to be 10-25 ms in saccades in non-human primates (Boucher et al., 2007; Kornylo et al., 2003; Purcell et al., 2010) and 40-50 ms for reaching movements in humans (Gopal and Murthy, 2016; Jana and Murthy, 2018). In other words, the time of EMG cancellation on partial trials reflects a time just before the point-of-no-return, whereby if EMG activity is allowed to continue beyond this point it will exceed a critical threshold such that a button press necessarily ensues (we presume this threshold reflects the point at which the inertia of the finger is overcome). In this respect, what is being tracked by the SSD staircasing procedure is the probability of crossing that EMG threshold, but since SSRT is calculated based on keypress response times, it inevitably incorporates the ballistic stage that follows the crossing of this threshold. The purpose of the SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> estimation was to test the idea by essentially removing the influence of any potentially ballistic phase (incorporating any electromechanical delays and inertia in the neuromuscular system and response device), on the estimated stopping latency. In order to do this, we re-classified successful and failed stops on the basis of the absence or presence of an EMG activation. The results of this analysis produce an estimate of stopping latency that very closely approximates our estimate based on CancelTime, and that are considerably shorter than the button-based estimate of SSRT. We have now added a few lines explaining the rationale in the revised manuscript (Results).</p><p>We admit that this was a post hoc analysis of data and that the task was designed to titrate SSD based on button presses, and not on the basis of whether EMG was detected. However, we believe it is reasonable to classify a response as the presence or not of EMG. Although participants were not explicitly trying to prevent EMG from being emitted, ~50% of successful stop trials contained no EMG, and so it seems reasonable to ask how quick the stopping latency has to be to prevent any EMG from being emitted. Also, in the wider context of action stopping, the choice of what is considered a response is rather arbitrary and depends on the question at hand. For example, whilst most studies, including ours, tend to use button presses, others have used continuous force or displacement measures and defined a response as anything exceeding a fixed force (25% maximum, (De Jong et al., 1990)), displacement threshold (0.01 m radius, (Atsma et al., 2018)) or velocity threshold (10% of peak velocity, (Jana and Murthy, 2018)). Therefore, we feel that this analysis is still informative, though we now acknowledge in the manuscript that our analysis of SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> would potentially benefit from further validation in future, basing the SSD staircasing on whether EMG was present or not (Results).</p><p>In effect, the SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> measure also might provide a solution to a long-standing puzzle in the literature where global motor suppression, i.e. the time when the Stop is implemented in the brain, is seen at ~150 ms of the Stop signal (Cai et al., 2012; Wessel et al., 2013) while SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>, i.e. the actual stopping of the response,is ~ 60 ms greater. The difference between SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> and SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> suggests that this discrepancy might be due to a ballistic stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) When testing the partial response EMG against different SSDs, the H0 of no difference is justified by means of &quot;weak go processes&quot;. I am wondering though what that implies: a very slow response (i.e., shallow slope), or one with a high threshold (thus unlikely to cause a button press), or a relatively delayed onset?</p></disp-quote><p>By “weak Go process” we mean one in which the individual intended to execute a response but failed to reach the threshold level of muscle activity required to fully depress the button. We have clarified this in the manuscript (Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Functional interpretation of CancelTime:</p><p>4) The authors stress repeatedly that the CancelTime can be considered or is used as single-trial measure of the stop process. I suggest to tone this claim down, because:</p><p>- it is not really used as a single-trial measure in the vast majority of analyses (with exceptions being the SD-based correlations of CancelTime and SSRTBEESTS, or the CancelTime-MEP alignment).</p><p>- a proper metric should undergo testing in terms of its psychometric properties (reliability, validity, objectivity etc.). This is too often overlooked, not only but especially with psychophysiological measures.</p><p>Thus, whereas I am also hopeful that the CancelTime may serve us as such a measure one day, I think we should not make this claim yet.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ assessment that in the majority of the analyses in the manuscript the single-trial capability of CancelTime has not been utilized. We chose to mention this to highlight the possibility of using CancelTime as a single-trial measure in future experiments. Indeed, we are currently exploring the possibility of using CancelTime as a single-trial measure (see Hannah et al., 2019 for single-trial correlations with right frontal beta bursts), and using the shape of the CancelTime distribution to better understand the network underlying human action-stopping. Likewise, we admit that the measure has not undergone thorough evaluation of its psychometric properties. Therefore, in line with the reviewers’ suggestion, we have toned down such statements (Abstract and Discussion). However, as alluded to above we have recently submitted a new manuscript (Hannah et al., 2019), in which we use single pulse TMS over the right inferior frontal cortex while concurrently measuring CancelTime from the hand. We show that real vs. sham TMS elongates CancelTime, and especially in those participants for whom the time of the pulse came closer to Cancel Time. This was a double-blind study, and the Sham coil was roughly equally as uncomfortable. The fact that real TMS elongated CancelTime reaffirms that it is a metric of stopping, and the single-trial correlations with frontal beta bursts supports its use on a single-trial basis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In order to validate CancelTime, the authors show high correlations with other stop task measures including SSRTbeh and BEESTs model estimates. Along with other traditional measures, CancelTime was positively correlated with trigger failure rate. This seems to challenge the discriminant validity of CancelTime (and/or trigger failure rate). CancelTime was calculated on trials in which a stop signal has been triggered, reaches the muscle of the hand, but a behavioral response is not emitted. It is also intended to be a purer measure of response inhibition. Trigger failures are putative failures of attention and should only occur on failed stop trials. I suggest that the authors discuss this relationship between CancelTime and trigger failure rate.</p></disp-quote><p>Trigger failure trials ostensibly reflect those trials where the participant failed to detect the Stop signal or initiate the Stop process (Band et al., 2003). Unfortunately, there is no established physiological metric of this detection (although the N1 ERP during auditory SST might hold some promise), hence we relied on the BEESTS output which provides a single estimate of the probability of observing trigger failures (<italic>p</italic>(TF)) in a participant. The relationship we observed between CancelTime and trigger failure rate might be due to several factors. First, the reviewers’ point relies on the assumption that the detection of the stop signal and implementation of the stop process are independent processes, but they might not be. In other words, it is possible that a participant who is more likely to fail to detect the Stop Signal, is also likely to be slower to initiate the stop process which would result in a relationship between <italic>p</italic>(TF) and CancelTime. Second, it is not entirely obvious that so-called “trigger failures” truly reflect a failure to trigger the Stop process. Another interpretation could be that the measure reflects the “strength” of the Stop process once activated, in other words activation of the Stop network (Band et al., 2003) [but see (Matzke et al., 2017)]. One could imagine that a stronger Stop process would be quicker to stop a response leading to a relationship between <italic>p</italic>(TF) and CancelTime. We have commented on these issues in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerning Temporal Dynamics:</p><p>6) If I am understanding correctly, CancelTime is computed exclusively from partial EMG trials. Additionally, it is intended to be an alternative to SSRTbeh, which is a measure of the central tendency of SSRT across all trials. When CancelTime is compared to SSRTbeh, CancelTime is ~60ms shorter. The authors argue that CancelTime is shorter than SSRTbeh because CancelTime does not include the (~60ms) electromechanical delay and therefore is a purer measure of stopping. However, I would like to suggest another explanation for why CancelTime is shorter than SSRTbeh.</p><p>Assuming (1) a race model architecture, (2) variability in the go RT and (3) variability in SSRT, then failed stops will tend to occur when SSD is long, go RT is fast, and SSRT is slow. Successful stops will tend to occur when SSD is short, go RT is slow, and SSRT is fast. Partial EMG trials, which I understand to be trials in which the go process doesn't win as decisively as a successful stop trial or fail as decisively as a failed stop trial, should have SSD, go RT, and SSRT values between these two extremes. However, ~1/2 of trials are failed stop, ~1/4 of trials as partialEMG, and ~1/4 of trials are successful stops. Therefore, partialEMG trials should be preferentially sampled from the half of trials with shorter SSD, slower go RT, and faster SSRT. If this is the case, then CancelTime being faster than SSRTbeh may be partially or completely explained by CancelTime being selectively sampled from faster SSRT trials whereas SSRTbeh is computed across all stop trials.</p><p>To concretize my suggestion in an example, if we assume an SSRT distribution with variability such that the first quantile has a mean of 120 ms, the second 160 ms, the third 250, and the fourth 350 ms. When the first quantile is sampled, these should preferentially result in successful stops, when the second is sampled these should preferentially result in partialEMG trials, and when either of the latter two are sampled these should preferentially result in failed stop. However, if you computed CancelTime on these data it should be closer to 160ms (as a result of preferentially sampling the 2nd quantile) but the overall central tendency of the SSRT distribution would be ~220ms.</p><p>This alternative implies that the average neural latency for stopping may not differ from SSRTbeh, or may differ less than the ~60 ms suggested here. One tool for evaluating this alternative explanation may be to simulate stop trials with variability in go, stop and SSD and evaluate whether computing SSRT only (or preferentially) on trials sampled from the 2nd quartile of SSRT can produce significant differences from the traditional method of computing SSRTbehav. If it may be useful, here is some openly available code that instantiates the interactive race framework and would allow varying go, stop, and SSD: https://github.com/bissettp/SharingContextDependence/blob/master/interactive_race.ipynb).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an interesting point, however, there are several reasons why we think our interpretation that the extra 60 ms reflects an electromechanical delay, rather than us sampling preferentially from the faster portion of the stopping distribution.</p><p>1) As we hopefully clarified in an earlier response, our calculation of SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> produces an estimate of stopping latency that is similar to CancelTime. Since the SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> calculation utilized all the SSDs it is unlikely that our results are a manifestation of preferential sampling of the faster half of the true Stop distribution, and instead suggests that the difference between the two measures is due to a ballistic stage in responses that is insensitive to the Stop process. We now better describe our rationale behind calculating SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> in the revised manuscript (Results).</p><p>2) We further tested the idea that there might be a ballistic stage in responses which inflates SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> by simulating the independent race model. Here, the Go and Stop accumulator raced to a threshold, and the outcome of the trial was determined by which accumulator reached the threshold first. The activity of each accumulator could be described by the mean drift rate (μ) and the SD of the drift rate (σ) (Boucher et al., 2007; Ramakrishnan et al., 2012; Usher and McClelland, 2001) [Please note that although the interactive race model might be more appropriate, we choose the independent race model for simplicity. Future studies might investigate these issues further]. First, we tested whether the independent race model without a ballistic stage could fit the empirical results. It provided a poor fit suggesting that a modification to the model is needed. We then added a ballistic stage to the model and observed a better fit indicating that the difference between CancelTime and SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> might be a reflection of this ballistic stage. Below we describe our steps.</p><p>To test the independent race model without a ballistic stage, for each participant, we estimated the Go parameters, (μ<sub>GO-EMG</sub>, σ<sub>GO-EMG</sub>) and (μ<sub>GO-Beh</sub>, σ<sub>GO-Beh</sub>) which best fit the RT<sub>EMG</sub> (Go cue to EMG onset) and RT<sub>Beh</sub> (Go cue to keypress) distributions in the Correct Go trials, respectively [further details outlined in Appendix 1]. Next, using the estimated Go parameters (μ<sub>GO-Beh</sub>, σ<sub>GO-Beh</sub>), we estimated the Stop parameters (μ<sub>STOP-Beh</sub>,σ<sub>STOP-Beh</sub>) that best fit the behavioral inhibition function (Figure 1A). Similarly, for EMG, we used its respective Go parameters (μ<sub>GO-EMG</sub>, σ<sub>GO-EMG</sub>) to estimate the Stop parameters (μ<sub>STOP-EMG</sub>,σ<sub>STOP-EMG</sub>) using the EMG inhibition function (Figure 1D). We reasoned that the Stop distribution underlying the inhibition of both the EMG and keypresses should be the same as both are part of the same response, and thus μ<sub>STOP-EMG</sub> should be similar to μ<sub>STOP-Beh</sub>. Additionally, the observed difference between the EMG and behavioral inhibition functions might be attributed to the difference in the underlying Go processes (RT<sub>EMG</sub> vs. RT<sub>Beh</sub>). However, this was not the case. The Stop distributions estimated from the EMG and keypresses were distinct, where μ<sub>STOP-EMG</sub> (188 ± 9 ms)was significantly less than μ<sub>STOP-Beh</sub> (207 ± 5 ms; <italic>t</italic>(41) = 2.7, <italic>p</italic> = 0.011, <italic>d</italic> = 0.4, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 3.7). Second, the difference between the two inhibition functions could not be attributed to just the difference between the two Go processes. To check this, we used (μ<sub>STOP-Beh</sub>,σ<sub>STOP-Beh</sub>) as the Stop distribution and (μ<sub>GO-EMG</sub>, σ<sub>GO-EMG</sub>) as the Go distribution, and simulated the EMG inhibition function. We observed that the simulated EMG inhibition function did not match the empirical one (Figure 1B). To quantify this, we compared the squared error between the simulated and empirical EMG inhibition functions to the squared error between the simulated and empirical behavioral inhibition functions. The difference was significantly greater for the EMG inhibition functions compared to the behavioral ones (Figure 1C; behavioral inhibition function, squared error = 0.10 ± 0.01; EMG inhibition function, squared error = 0.21 ± 0.02, <italic>t</italic>(41) = 4.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.7, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> &gt; 100). Conversely, when we used (μ<sub>STOP-EMG,</sub> σ<sub>STOP-EMG</sub>) as the Stop distribution and (μ<sub>GO-Beh</sub>, σ<sub>GO-Beh</sub>) as the Go distribution, and simulated the EMG inhibition function we again did not observe a good fit (Figure 1E, F; EMG inhibition function, squared error between experimental and simulated data = 0.12 ± 0.02; RT inhibition function, squared error = 0.23 ± 0.02, <italic>t</italic>(41) = 4.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.9, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> &gt; 100). This incompatibility suggests that some change needs to be made to the model such that a single Stop distribution is able to fit both the EMG and behavioral inhibition functions. Hence, we made two changes based a model previously used to describe stopping of reaching movements (Gopal and Murthy, 2016; Jana and Murthy, 2018). First, we added a peripheral delay to the Go process reflecting the observed delay between RT<sub>EMG</sub> and RT<sub>Beh</sub>. Second, we partitioned this delay period into a non-ballistic and ballistic stage. And we then tested whether this model with a ballistic stage fit the empirical results better than the one without a ballistic stage.</p><p>In this physiologically relevant model, the Go process comprises an accumulation phase and a delay phase. Once the accumulator hits the threshold, EMG responses can be observed, and then following a peripheral delay, the EMG builds up enough (i.e. the point-of-no-return) to be able to cross the inertia of the limb and generate a movement (Figure 1G). If the Stop reaches the threshold before the Go reaches the threshold, then no EMG is elicited (no EMG trial; Figure 1G). Further, if the Stop reaches the threshold early during the delay period when the EMG has not built up to a critical level (point-of-no-return) it will be able to inhibit the response resulting in a partial EMG trial (Figure 1H). However, if the Stop reaches the threshold after the EMG has reached the point-of-no-return a movement is inevitable, resulting in a Failed Stop trial (Figure 1I). Thus, the point-of-no-return partitions the delay phase into a non-ballistic (where Stop can act) and a ballistic stage (where Stop cannot act). We tested whether this model provides a better fit compared to the model without a ballistic stage. Indeed, this was the case, as incorporation of a ballistic stage allowed μ<sub>STOP-EMG</sub> to fit the behavioral inhibition function much better (Figure 1J). We quantified this by comparing the squared error between the simulated and empirical behavioral inhibition functions (Figure 1K; Model with ballistic stage: squared error = 0.14 ± 0.02; Model without ballistic stage: squared error = 0.23 ± 0.02; <italic>t</italic>(41) = 4.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.7, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> &gt; 100). Across participants, the mean ballistic stage was estimated to be 34 ± 4 ms. Thus, based on our model, there exists a ballistic stage in keypress responses, which we think is responsible for the difference between CancelTime and SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> (we now mention this in the Results, and add Figure 3—figure supplement 1 to the revised manuscript, and have added the simulation methods and results as an Appendix 1). While this measure was less than our estimate of ~60 ms, we note that some participants did not have a sigmoidal EMG inhibition function leading to suboptimal parameter estimation. Indeed, when we considered only those participants who had lower than the population median squared error, the duration of the ballistic stage was 47 ± 3 ms which is closer to our estimate of ~60 ms.</p><p>3) In a similar vein, we carried out another analysis which provides a similar answer, and is based on the idea that there is a critical EMG threshold that once exceeded will inevitably result, after some electromechanical delay, in a button press (i.e. a ballistic stage). Consider <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> showing theoretical distributions of the end of the Go and Stop processes assuming that button presses reflect the end of the Go process (solid lines). Due to the SSD staircasing procedure employed in the studies, on average, the Go and Stop processes should end at the same time. By contrast, on the Failed Stop trials the Go process ends earlier than the Stop process. Going by definition of SSRT, on average, the Go process across all Go trials ended (i.e. button was pressed) ~220 ms after the stop signal (computed using the keypress RT minus the mean SSD). Now note that our mean CancelTime preceded SSRT by ~60 ms. At first glance, this might be taken to suggest that the reviewer is correct and CancelTime samples from the left half of the stop end time distribution. However, such comparisons are unfair because the criterion for the end time is different in each case: button press versus EMG.</p><p>If there is a ballistic stage, then the end time of the Go process ought to be the time at which EMG crosses the putative threshold. We therefore estimated the end time of the Go process on Failed Stop trials and Go trials as the time at which EMG activity exceeded the mean of the EMG amplitude recorded on Partial trials (as our estimate of the threshold for a response, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We expressed this relative to the time of the Stop signal for Failed Stop and Go trials, respectively. When we do this, the mean end time of the Go process for the Correct Go trials is ~100 ms, while CancelTime is ~150 ms. While these timings are only rough estimates, it suggests that, as the reviewers propose, CancelTime only samples from a part of the whole Stop distribution, <italic>but</italic> it does not seem to be sampling from the faster half. If anything, this analysis suggests it samples the slower half of the Stop distribution. This makes sense as CancelTime does not include the stopping latency in the No EMG trials, where the Stop process was presumably quick (or the Go process was slow). This also lines with our TMS evidence where we detect MEP suppression (ostensibly marking the implementation of the Stop process) ~30 ms prior to CancelTime. Thus, we believe that while CancelTime is much shorter than SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>, it is still an overestimation of the true stopping latency. We note this in the revised manuscript (Discussion).</p><p>Thus, taken together, these results provide additional evidence that, 1) CancelTime preferentially subsamples the true Stop distribution, but in contrast to the reviewers’ suggestion, we think that it likely samples from the center or potentially the slower half of the true Stop distribution; and, 2) The difference between CancelTime (and SSRT<sub>EMG</sub>) and SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> might be due to a ballistic stage.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>End time of the Stop process using keypress and EMG amplitude.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the distributions of the mean end time of the Go and Stop process in the Correct Go (green), Failed Stop (orange), and the Successful Stop (red) trials, while considering the keypress as the response.

The difference between the CancelTime and the reduced motorcortical excitability is about 15 ms (155 – 140). However, the onset of decreased motorcortical excitability, which would best correspond to the onset of the decline in MEP amplitude, does start before that, as can be seen in Figure 4A. An only somewhat smaller effect is apparent already at 120ms, with an onset probably even before that. This would add another 20+ ms to the equation, thus contrasting 23ms vs. 35+ms. The point I want to make is that, even though I find the interpretation of the findings interesting and plausible, care has to be taken not to over-interpret these measures since they are heavily dependent on our statistical procedures (sample size, size of presumably relevant effect, parameterization of onset times etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, we would like to apologize as there was a minor error in the reporting of the data, and the actual mean CancelTime was 160 ms, not 155 ms as reported previously. The difference was due to slightly different cut-off and outlier rejection procedures compared to the other experiments. These procedures are now consistent across experiments. We have rectified this in the revised manuscript (Results, and in Figure 4B).</p><p>To the reviewers’ point, we agree that the temporal cascade model that we have constructed is only approximate as it is averaged across participants who had different stopping latencies, and is also contingent on, as the reviewers’ rightly point out, on statistical procedures. For example, there is a degree of uncertainty even in our estimates of corticomotor conduction latency. The reason for this is that the conduction delay measured by TMS-evoked MEP is biased towards assessing the fastest corticospinal pathways: large-diameter, fast-conducting corticospinal neurons with mono-synaptic connections to the spinal motoneurons (Day et al., 1989; Edgley et al., 1997; Groppa et al., 2012). Yet conduction velocities in the (primate) pyramidal tract vary hugely (Firmin et al., 2014) and we presume that voluntary motor commands recruit a mixture of both faster and slower conducting (i.e. smaller diameter neurons and/or poly-synaptic connections to the spinal motorneurons) pathways. This would mean our estimate of conduction time is an underestimate and that the mean time at which changes in motor cortical output are observed at the level of the muscle (i.e. in the electromyogram) is probably several milliseconds longer than our estimate of 23 ms. In line with the reviewers’ comments, we have acknowledged a degree uncertainty in our temporal model on the whole, as well as in relation to this particular issue concerning the timing of the MEP and EMG suppression (Results, Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The validity of the reduced TMS-MEPs as indicators of the stopping process is derived from the strong reduction in successful stop relative to go trials around 140 ms, a notion further supported by Figure 4D. It is not discussed, however, that MEPs also are reduced for unsuccessful stop trials around 140 ms locked to the stop signal (a reduction similar to that of successful stop trials; Figure 4B; the effect does not seem to be that much smaller). How to reconcile these findings?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers’ for making this observation. Indeed, we do see a relative reduction in MEPs in the Failed Stop trials. The fact this happens doesn’t invalidate our use of the MEPs as an indicator of the Stop process. In fact, it seems to make some sense if we think that the Stop process is initiated (nearly) every time a Stop signal is presented (as the signal is quite salient and the studies were conducted on young, healthy adults), and that failure to stop generally occurs when the Go process is particularly fast or the Stop process is particularly slow. Thus, the MEP reduction in Failed Stop trials is the expression of the Stop process, i.e. it crossing the line, despite the fact that the Go process has already crossed the point-of-no-return. Indeed, the reviewers pointed out that in Successful Stops the MEP suppression might even begin a little earlier than in Failed Stops (120 ms versus 140 ms), which would be consistent with the idea that some stops fail because of a slower Stop process (rather than a particularly fast Go). Bear in mind too, that the suppression we are observing here is in a task-irrelevant muscle. A benefit of this is that we can observe the timing of the Stop-related suppression in the absence of any Go-related muscle activity that would otherwise overlap and potentially blur the true timing. We have included a few lines in the manuscript discussing this issue (Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, the authors cite papers showing that in monkey, rats, and humans that neurons that are putatively related to stopping change close to SSRT. This seems like considerable evidence against the chronometric framework presented here that assumes that the stop command is sent from brain to muscle well before SSRT (~60 ms + conduction time). I think it would be helpful to understand the authors' position on how these seemingly contradictory findings relate to this current framework.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we acknowledge that additional evidence may be required, based on our current results, we believe that some of the brain signatures previously reported might not be causally-related to the initiation/implementation of the Stop per se [for example, the intraparietal sulcus which has been described to be important for stopping movements (Osada et al., 2019) might not be so (Hannah and Jana, 2019)]. They could instead reflect some other aspect of the Stop, for example, monitoring or feedback related to the implementation of the Stop as has been ascribed to certain brain signatures that modulate after SSRT (Logan et al., 2015; Schall and Boucher, 2007). We now discuss this in the revised manuscript (Discussion).</p><p>Relatedly, a recent study in non-human primates performing the Stop signal task has demonstrated that the premotor cortical network dynamics in the Successful Stop trials diverge from that seen in the Failed Stop and Go trials within 70-120 ms of the Stop signal (Pani et al., 2019). This again highlights that rapid action-stopping might be implemented in the motor system much earlier than that observed at the behavioral end point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Functional Significance of beta Burst Activity:</p><p>10) How does the work presented in Study 4 relate to the recent preprint of a paper by Wessel on the role of beta bursts in stopping? [Wessel, J.R., &quot;β-bursts reveal the trial-to-trial dynamics of movement initiation and cancellation&quot;, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/644682v1].</p></disp-quote><p>There are some clear similarities between the Wessel, 2019 study and ours. First, similar to what we have reported, he observes an increase in bursts% in frontocentral electrodes prior to SSRT in the Successful Stop trials compared to the Failed Stop trials. Second, this increase seems to occur quite early after the Stop signal and much before the SSRT (Figure 2B, 25-75 ms and 75-125 ms bin). In fact, the difference between the Successful and Failed Stop trials seems to subside close to SSRT (see Figure 5—figure supplement 4 for the burst% modulation across time). Thus, the average timing of beta bursts in the Successful Stop trials might be similar in both studies. However, we would also like to highlight some differences between the two studies. First, while Wessel analyzed the EEG channel space, we analyzed beta bursts in a frontal spatial filter. Indeed, the signal-to-noise observed in a spatial filter is much improved (Muralidharan et al., 2019; Wessel, 2018). This allowed us to detect beta bursts despite having far fewer number of subjects (N = 11, 13 vs. N = 234). In fact, we were unable to detect enough beta bursts in the channel space in our pool of subjects at all to make any predictions about the timings of the bursts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> for exemplar subject where beta burst probability is computed over the entire channel space as in Wessel’s case). Second, while we defined bursts based on the beta power during a baseline period prior to the presentation of the Stop Signal, Wessel defined it based on the beta power in a channel across time. Third, Wessel does not show if the increase beta burst% in the Successful Stop trials prior to SSRT is greater than that observed before the Stop signal. Indeed, if beta bursts were to play a role in movement cancellation then one might expect it to increase once the Stop signal is presented. Thus, taking all these together, we believe that our method might be better suited for detection of beta bursts in future EEG studies. Nevertheless, despite all these differences, the study by Wessel, 2019, reinforces our observation that the timing of beta bursts in the frontal cortex might have a key role during movement cancellation.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Beta burst analysis in the channel space.</title><p>Please note that the SNR is far worse than that observed using a spatial filter.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50371-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Study 4 finds an increase in beta bursts for successful stops relative to baseline and go trials, an effect interpreted as indicator of the engagement of the right inferior frontal stopping processes. This is a very interesting finding, but its interpretation is not without some conceptual problems.</p><p>- Given that EEG is plagued with the inverse problem, it seems somewhat unjustified to claim that this signature originates in the right frontal cortex. But even if one would agree that a rough deduction of the source from its topography is possible, I would have a hard time to associate the rather midfrontal topography with a right frontal source close to the sylvian fissure. Beyond, the authors performed dipole fitting on the independent component topographies, and thus could easily check if the individual dipoles of these components at least roughly are fitted to such a position.</p></disp-quote><p>While we have converging evidence that beta bursts might have originated from the right frontal cortex (Swann et al., 2009, 2012), we agree that it is inappropriate to establish the origin of the beta bursts from EEG due to its poor spatial resolution. However, as suggested, we performed a dipole localization analysis of the right-frontal ICs which were selected from both Study 4 and Study 5 and plotted the average dipole location along and its variability in an average MNI space. The dipole is fronto-central (but biased towards the right) which roughly estimates the origin of this beta from the mid to right frontal cortex. However, future studies are required to establish whether the beta bursts recorded at the scalp do originate from the right inferior frontal gyrus, a key node in the stopping network, or rather to preSMA or to both (note that these are connected via white matter (Catani et al., 2013; Swann et al., 2012)). We discuss this in the revised manuscript (Discussion, and have added Figure 5—figure supplement 2 to the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Beta burst activity is depicted and analyzed relative to the pre-stop period. If we leave the IC-selection aside for a moment, the resulting time courses may still be in accordance with an effect akin to motor beta: around the time of the stop signal, beta activity would be similarly low for all three categories due to motor preparation, followed by rebound-effects that might be earlier in case of successful stops (cancelled), succeeded by unsuccessful stops and go trials (rebound after execution).</p><p>The IC selection states, however, that a component needed to show a beta power increase between the stop signal and the SSRT compared to a time window prior to the go cue. This should exclude potential motor beta components with typical time courses delineated above. The time course for the go activity supports this assumption. Nevertheless, given the conceptual importance of this beta component in this context, it would be nice to also see the go-locked time courses for the stop-related conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this issue. While it is possible that the motor beta rebound might contaminate the increase in burst% following the Stop signal, we think that this is unlikely to explain our results. First, as mentioned above, the dipole localization does not support a sensorimotor source for the generation of this beta and points to a frontal source. Secondly, post-movement beta rebound occurs at least ~500 ms after the EMG offset. However, in the frontal spatial filter, when the burst% is time-locked to the Go cue (see Figure 5—figure supplement 4), the increase in burst% in the Successful Stop trials starts well before both CancelTime (average time when EMG activity starts decreasing) and SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> (average time of movement execution). In addition, there is either no modulation of burst% in the Go trials (Study 5) or the modulation occurred after the average RT (Study 4). We mention this in the revised manuscript (Results) and add Figure 5—figure supplement 4 to the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) I understand the presented beta burst data to be the probability that a beta burst occurred on any given trial. Assuming this, beta bursts, which are taken as evidence of the frontal (perhaps rIFG) signal to stop, only occur on ~15% of stop trials (14.6% in Experiment 4 and 16.2% in Experiment 5). Additionally, beta bursts often occur on go and stop-failure trials, sometimes at similar rates to successful stop trials (e.g., 15.4% in Experiment 5 for stop-failure rates). Therefore, beta bursts happen on few stop trials and almost as many go trials as stop trials. How does this signal that is neither necessary or sufficient for stopping explain stop success generally? Might there be differences between stop success trials with and without beta bursts? Could trials with beta bursts be edge cases of some sort (e.g., when proactive control is low and reactive stopping is therefore particularly essential) that are not indicative of the general mechanism for stopping on the other 85% of stop success trials?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, it is quite curious why beta bursts are observed on a small percentage of trials. One potential explanation could be that we are not able to detect a burst reliably on every trial. This could be due to the low SNR of EEG and if we were recording directly from these brain regions, we could get a better estimate of the percentage of bursts in Successful Stop trials. However, the presence of beta bursts in the Go trials does raise a question about the role of beta bursts. It is possible that beta bursts are (partly) spontaneous events that occur all the time (but have some functional consequence) (Shin et al., 2017), or it might have a role in proactive slowing in the Go trials (as they are embedded in a task where the participants have to stop their response in a minority of trials). Nevertheless, we did an additional analysis of looking at CancelTimes in the Successful Stop trials with and without bursts between Stop signal and SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>. There was no difference in the CancelTimes between these trial types (CancelTime<sub>With Burst</sub> = 164 ± 9 ms; CancelTime<sub>No Burst</sub> = 165 ± 9 ms, <italic>t</italic>(12) = 0.57, <italic>p</italic> = 0.58, <italic>d</italic> = 0.2, <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 0.32) We now discuss this in the revised manuscript (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Theoretical Implications:</p><p>13) I agree with the authors that these results have potentially striking implications for existing models of stopping. However, I think the paper could be improved by laying out these implications more explicitly. For instance, how does this framework relate to existing models including the original Independent Race Model (Logan and Cowan, 1984 / Psych Review), updated Independent Race Models including blocked input models (Logan et al., 2014; Logan et al., 2015), the Interactive Race Model (Boucher et al., 2007), the BEESTs model and trigger failures (Matzke et al., this relates to comment 5), and perhaps recent work suggesting violations of independence that can be accounted for by variable, sometimes weak inhibition (Bissett, Poldrack, and Logan, in revision https://psyarxiv.com/kpa65).</p></disp-quote><p>Our study sheds light on the temporal profile of the physiological/network model underlying action-stopping (Aron et al., 2014). To this end we characterize the chronometrics of the Stop process and observe, frontal beta activity at ~120 ms, followed by decreased M1 excitability at ~140 ms, and cancellation of the muscle response at ~160 ms. As we have not formally tested all the computational models existing in the literature, it is probably premature to comment on the computational relationship between the Go and the Stop process. However, we can conjecture as to which models might best explain our results. Our results are not compatible with a strictly independent model since we see active inhibition of M1 (the Go process) already some time before SSRT. We think that the interactive race model (Boucher et al., 2007) best explains out data, but we must note that this model was originally tested on inhibition of saccades on over-trained non-human primates (SSRT ~90 ms), whereas our results are on inhibition of keypresses in naïve human participants (SSRT ~220 ms). Boucher et al. considered SSRT as a sum of Delay<sub>Stop</sub> (delay in activation of the Stop process, ~60 ms, i.e. ~70% of the SSRT), Stop<sub>interrupt</sub> (duration in which the Stop process is implemented, starting from the accumulation to the inhibition of the Go process, ~20 ms), and Go<sub>Ballistic</sub> (ballistic stage preceding movement initiation, ~10 ms). First, frontal beta bursts occur ~120 ms after the Stop while CancelTime is ~160 ms, i.e. the Delay<sub>Stop</sub> is ~75% of the duration of the Stop duration, which is similar to that reported by Boucher et al., 2007. Second, frontal beta bursts are followed by decrease in M1 excitability within ~20 ms. This is similar to the Stop<sub>interrupt</sub> value reported by Boucher et al., 2007. However, the duration of the ballistic stage is probably longer for manual responses (~50 ms for reaching movements (Gopal and Murthy, 2016; Jana and Murthy, 2018)). Our simulations also support this (see response to a previous question). Thus, we believe that, SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> = Delay<sub>Stop</sub> + Stop<sub>interrupt</sub> + Delay<sub>Corticospinal</sub> + Go<sub>Ballistic</sub>.</p><p>The initial delay in activation of the Stop process might relate to the triggering/detection of the Stop process [which might take about 80-120 ms (Bekker et al., 2005)] which is a key component of the BEESTS model. Another support of the interactive race model is that, we observe a decrease in corticomotor excitability in task-unrelated muscles at ~140 ms which persists for at least ~60 ms. This probably reflects an active inhibition of the Go process to directly suppress the output neurons of the primary motor cortex, but we presume that there is also a suppression of upstream drive to the motor cortex. For example, exogenous suppression of motor cortical output with TMS over the primary motor cortex seems only to delay voluntary motor output, rather than abolish it (Day et al., 1989). Thus, while we favor the interactive race model where the initial delay is related to the triggering/detection of the Stop signal. We note that the interactive-race model and blocked-input model are very similar (Logan et al., 2015), so our results do not disambiguate them.

Most of the studies we provided in the first round of the review are cited, but again rather offhand. The manuscript does not really integrate the different studies.

Still, it is not properly discussed, for example, that the exact timing estimates heavily rely on the choice of latency estimates (EMG/MEP onsets or peak, of which each again can be calculated in many different ways.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there is some uncertainty in our timing estimates. We did previously mention in the revised manuscript that the timings for the temporal model were approximate (Discussion), and as such Figure 6 is described as a “hypothetical” model of the temporal cascade of process underlying human action-stopping. We also previously had a section noting the imprecision in our estimates of MEP latencies (Results). We have now amended the manuscript to further acknowledge some of the likely sources of imprecision in our timing estimates (Discussion). We would like to point out too, that despite these uncertainties, our estimates do seem broadly consistent with those from numerous other studies, e.g. “CancelTime” (Hannah et al., 2019; Raud et al., 2019; Raud and Huster, 2017), time of MEP suppression (Coxon et al., 2006; van den Wildenberg et al., 2010), corticomotor conduction time (Groppa et al., 2012; Hamada et al., 2013), BurstTimes (Hannah et al., 2019), and the ballistic stage (Gopal and Murthy, 2016; Jana and Murthy, 2018). We now mention this explicitly in the revised manuscript (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I reviewed the initial submission of this manuscript. The manuscript is significantly improved in many ways. The editor requested that we evaluate whether claims have been toned down, previous work on EMG and beta-bursts have been acknowledged, and main point 6 regarding the timing estimate of CancelTime and a ballistic phase have been addressed. I think the first two points have been sufficiently addressed. However, the authors response to Main Point 6, especially their point 3, has raised new concerns about their claims about timing of stopping.</p><p>The authors present a 3-part response to main point 6. Part 1 points out that SSRTemg is similar to CancelTime and argues that this is consistent with the remaining ~60ms difference between CancelTime and SSRTbeh being a ballistic stage. Part 2 presents simulations consistent with a ballistic stage that is 34-47ms long (which is perhaps less than the ~60ms difference between canceltime and SSRTbeh). Point 3 argues that the real end of the race (at least as a criterion for evaluating CancelTime) is when EMG amplitude exceeds the threshold set on PartialEMG trials. They show that on correct go trials this threshold is exceeded ~100ms after the average stop signal would occur. Given the SSD tracking algorithm that ensured that the race between going and stopping is roughly tied, then the real latency of the stop process (as measured by EMG) may be ~100ms, so CancelTime may actually be an overestimate of the average stop latency.</p><p>The part 3 simulation results seem to conflict with multiple pieces of evidence in the manuscript and the literature. It appears that the authors are suggesting that the ballistic stage may be ~120ms (~220ms SSRTbeh minus the ~100ms stop process), which is both inconsistent with the simulation results in part 2 and inconsistent with the previous literature presented in the manuscript (e.g., Gopal and Muphy, 2016; Jana and Murthy, 2018 suggested 50ms for reaching movements). It also seems to bring into question the entire temporal sequence presented in the manuscript. Why would the end of the race be observable in muscles at 100ms if the signal to stop from cortex (perhaps rIFG) occurs 20ms later at 120ms?</p><p>Additionally, none of the 3 parts of the response have directly addressed the reviewers' main point 6. To briefly reiterate, assuming a race model, the ~50% of trials that are true failed stops (an overt response occurs) should tend to have the longest SSDs, fastest go RTs, and slowest SSRTs. The ~25% of trials that are successful stops with no EMG should be the opposite: shortest SSDs, slowest go RTs, and fastest SSRTs. This leaves the ~25% of trials that are successful stops with EMG, which should be in between these extremes. However, because there are ~twice as many stop failures as stop successes, the partial EMG trials will tend have shorter SSDs, slower go RT, and faster SSRTs than each measure's overall average. Therefore, CancelTime may be an underestimate of the true central tendency of SSRT across all stop trials.</p><p>In the text, the authors seem to agree with parts of this point, at least in part. They say &quot;CancelTime… does not include the stopping latencies of the No EMG trials, which presumably reflect the fastest stopping latencies where the Stop process was fast enough to cancel the impending response before it reaches the muscle&quot;. However, they do not point out that CancelTime also does not include stop-failure trials, which presumably reflect the slowest stopping latencies, leaving CancelTime to reflect stopping latencies that are faster than the slowest half of stop trials but slower than the fastest quarter of stop trials. Also, in Figures 1G-I in their response, they illustrate how they believe correct stops with No EMG, correct stops with partial EMG, and failed stops arise from an accumulator model framework. No EMG has the fastest stop process, failed stop has the slowest stop process, and partial EMG is in between.</p><p>To conclude, I do not think that the response to main point 6 addressed the original concern, and I believe that the new simulations bring up new questions about the temporal cascade of processes in stopping. Does the stop process reach the muscle ~150-160ms after the stop signal, as suggested by CancelTime and SSRTemg, or is it ~100ms after the stop signal, as seemingly suggested by their part 3 in response to Main Point 6? If the latter, then how does this fit in with TMS evidence of motor suppression at ~140ms or beta-burst in cortex (perhaps rIFG) at 120ms? Also, if the argument from Main Point 6 is valid (and the authors do not address its validity directly), how can this be synthesized with the Part 3 response suggesting that CancelTime is an overestimate of the latency of the stop process?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the insightful comments here and apologize for the confusion caused by our response. A key tenet of the paper, and our response to Main Point 6, is that SSRT may overestimate stopping latency by virtue of an inherent ballistic stage. All three of the additional analyses in Point 6 of our response provide further evidence of this: #1 the EMG-based calculation of SSRT very closely approximates CancelTime; #2 our simulation supported the notion of a ballistic stage, implying that SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> might be an overestimate of the true stopping latency; and #3 used a crude estimate of the end of the Go process relative to a theoretical stop cue, and suggested the mean was ~100 ms, which is <italic>closer</italic> to CancelTime than it is SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>.</p><p>To be clear about #3, the idea we were attempting to illustrate with this analysis was that comparing the SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> distribution with the CancelTime distribution is inappropriate because the former includes an electromechanical delay that the latter does not. The fact that the center of the Go distribution does not line up perfectly with the center of the CancelTime distribution probably reflects the particular EMG threshold chosen for the end of the Go process. This is a conservative estimate because the EMG amplitude on ~50% of the Partial EMG trials exceeded this value without generating an overt keypress, implying that there is actually a significant buffer. We note that raising the threshold slightly to account for this would bring the estimates of the end of the Go process closer to that of CancelTime.</p><p>We also note that unlike timing, the amplitude of EMG is quite variable and probably not the only determinant of response time (e.g. the rate of EMG rise as well as synergist and stabilizer muscle activity may contribute). This is evident in the fact that the tails of the EMG amplitude distributions for Partial EMG and Go trials overlap. Given these issues, we would urge against using this #3 analysis to infer the latency of stopping and thus do not feel that this analysis invalidates our temporal model of the processes contributing to stopping. We hope this allays the reviewer’s concerns.</p><p>In relation to the reviewer’s original point about whether CancelTime sub-samples from the true Stop distribution, our #1 response was intended to deal specifically with this issue. The point we were trying to make was that SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> is calculated in the same manner as SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>, only the definition of a response differs. Thus, SSRT<sub>EMG</sub> is calculated from the <italic>whole</italic> distribution, i.e. it does not sub-sample, and yet it still gives a similar estimate of stopping latency as CancelTime. This seems contrary to the reviewer’s suggestion that CancelTime underestimates the central tendency of the true Stop distribution.</p><p>In summary, our analyses provide converging evidence that SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> seems to include a ballistic stage and thus may overestimate stopping latency. This creates a temporal disparity between SSRT<sub>Beh</sub> and neurophysiological measures of stopping latency which appear much earlier. CancelTime measures the latency of stopping at the level of the muscle and bridges this temporal disparity. Thus, a main contribution of the paper is in demonstrating the temporal relationship between brain signatures and the muscle (CancelTime) and behavioral markers of stopping latency (SSRT<sub>Beh</sub>). [Another main contribution is that CancelTime is a potentially single trial estimate of the speed of stopping – which has big implications for our field].</p></body></sub-article></article>
