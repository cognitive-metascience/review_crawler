Yet, the roles of cilia in these neurons are poorly understood. To shed light into their functions, we studied EFHC1, an evolutionarily conserved protein required for motile cilia function and linked to a common form of inherited epilepsy in humans, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). We demonstrate that <italic>C. elegans</italic> EFHC-1 functions within specialized non-motile mechanosensory cilia, where it regulates neuronal activation and dopamine signaling. EFHC-1 also localizes at the synapse, where it further modulates dopamine signaling in cooperation with the orthologue of an R-type voltage-gated calcium channel. Our findings unveil a previously undescribed dual-regulation of neuronal excitability at sites of neuronal sensory input (cilium) and neuronal output (synapse). Such a distributed regulatory mechanism may be essential for establishing neuronal activation thresholds under physiological conditions, and when impaired, may represent a novel pathomechanism for epilepsy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EFHC1</kwd><kwd>juvenile myoclonic epilepsy</kwd><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd><italic>Caenorhabditis

form of idiopathic epilepsy in humans, making up 10–30% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delgado-Escueta, 1984</xref>). Most genes implicated in idiopathic epilepsies encode ion channels with predictable consequences on neuronal excitability, yet disruption of EFHC1, a non-ion channel protein, has been reported as the most frequent cause of JME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delgado-Escueta, 2007</xref>). While several neuronal roles have been proposed for EFHC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Nijs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Nijs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Nijs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rossetto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>), it remains unclear how mutations in <italic>EFHC1</italic> lead to epilepsy. Interestingly, EFHC1 is also specifically associated with motile cilia that project from specialized cells to enable fluid flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conte et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>), but a role for EFHC1 in non-motile cilia that emanate from most cell types to allow for sensory and signaling functions largely remains unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the human brain, there are both motile cilia, which enable cerebrospinal fluid flow, and non-motile cilia, which project from the cell bodies of all or most neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bishop et al., 2007</xref>). Although EFHC1 dysfunction impairs motility of ependymal cilia in mice, the accompanying ventricle enlargement does not correlate with epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, although several neuronal functions have been attributed to EFHC1, including regulation of ion channels, apoptosis, cell division, neuronal migration, neurite architecture and neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Nijs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Nijs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Nijs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rossetto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>), a possible role for EFHC1 in non-motile cilia of neuronal cells has not been explored. As a core component of the protofilament ribbon structure of motile cilia thought to dictate the ordered attachment/arrangement of proteins required for motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ikeda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Linck et al., 2014</xref>), EFHC1 may play a similar role in neuronal cilia to anchor/regulate signaling molecules and modulate neuronal excitability.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that rather than being a core component of ciliary motility-associated machinery, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of EFHC-1 is required for mechanosensation in a class of non-motile cilia, where it regulates neuronal activation and dopamine signaling. Interestingly, EFHC-1-mediated signaling also occurs at the synapse in cooperation with a known EFHC1-interaction partner, an R-type voltage-gated calcium channel. Our work highlights the importance of exaptation (functional adaptation) of a cilium motility protein in non-motile sensory cilia. Moreover, our findings reveal a previously undescribed dual-regulation of neuronal excitability at the site of sensory neuron input (cilium) and sensory neuron output (synapse) and suggest an important correspondance between dopamine neurotransmission and epilepsy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EFHC-1 localizes to cilia and synapses of mechanosensory dopaminergic neurons and to the distal regions of male-specific dopaminergic ray neurons</title><p>To isolate possible non-motile ciliary functions of EFHC1, we took advantage of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a nematode which only has non-motile sensory cilia.

In these ciliated neurons, the generated EFHC-1::GFP fusion protein is enriched within cilia, alongside the intraflagellar transport protein (IFT) XBX-1 (DLIC orthologue) which marks ciliary basal bodies and axonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, while endogenously GFP-tagged EFHC-1 mostly accumulates in both OLQ and ADE cilia, it is weakly present in CEP cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), possibly reflecting a lower abundance and/or a tight incorporation with the microtubules at regular intervals within the CEP cilia that limits/masks the fluorescence associated with endogenously GFP-tagged EFHC-1. Ciliary localization of EFHC-1 is further supported by the ability of a truncated protein (C-terminal fragment containing the second of two evolutionarily conserved DM10 domains of unknown function) to specifically localize to OLQ, CEP, ADE and PDE cilia in a manner indistinguishable from the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is in contrast to a second truncated protein (N-terminal fragment containing the first DM10 domain) that displays non-specific localization throughout all neuronal processes of glutamatergic (OLQ) and dopaminergic (CEP, ADE and PDE) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Given that EFHC-1 is a core component of the protofilament ribbon structure of motile cilia that closely associates with microtubules and is ideally positioned to anchor proteins at specific locations along cilia, we hypothesized that ciliary localization of EFHC-1 is largely static. Consistent with this, when either the distal or middle portions of CEP and OLQ cilia are photobleached, the EFHC-1::GFP signal does not rapidly recover within 30 s, as would be expected for proteins dependent on diffusion to maintain their proper ciliary localizations, such as ARL-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cevik et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>). Moreover, kymograph analyses suggest that EFHC-1 proteins present in CEP and OLQ cilia are not associated with IFT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). EFHC-1 localization is also not dependent on UNC-101, a protein required for dendritic transport and proper ciliary localization of a set of ciliary proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dwyer et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>). For example, ODR-10 expressed in AWB olfactory neurons of wild-type animals predominantly accumulates in cilia, but in <italic>unc-101</italic> mutant animals it no longer concentrates inside cilia and diffuses to dendrites, cell bodies, and axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Interestingly, ciliary expression of EFHC-1 is not dependent on DAF-19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>), a transcription factor required for the expression of many ciliary genes, again suggesting the unique nature of this ciliary protein, typically associated with motility, which has been retained in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to facilitate ciliary mechanosensation.</p><p>In addition to EFHC-1’s ciliary localization, we find that the EFHC-1::GFP fusion protein is present at presynaptic regions in dopaminergic neurons, partially overlapping with the synaptic vesicle protein, synaptobrevin (SNB-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). By tagging endogenous EFHC-1 with GFP, we confirm that EFHC-1 localizes to these presynaptic regions, where it partially overlaps with a second synaptic vesicle protein (RAB-3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). More specifically, EFHC-1 is found to partially colocalize with the active zone protein (ELKS-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B–C</xref>), where it is ideally positioned to regulate synaptic release in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Since the presynaptic localization of synaptic vesicle proteins such as RAB-3, but not some active zone proteins like ELKS-1, depends on the kinesin-3 motor, UNC-104 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deken et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nonet et al., 1997</xref>), we examined whether EFHC-1 also requires UNC-104 for its synaptic localization in CEP neurons. While RAB-3 localization is abrogated in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants, accumulating in cell bodies and diffusing to dendrites/axons of CEP neurons, UNC-104 is dispensable for both ELKS-1 and EFHC-1 localization (and consequently their partial colocalization pattern) to presynaptic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A–C</xref>). The presence of EFHC-1 at both the cilium and presynaptic regions of dopaminergic neurons suggests that it may play important roles in both sensation and regulation of neuronal output.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>EFHC-1 influences habituation to a mechanical stimulus by modulating dopamine signaling</title><p>We first investigated a possible role for EFHC-1 in dopamine signaling. In the presence of food, ciliary TRP-4 channels (orthologous to TRPN/NOMPC) are mechanically activated, resulting in the release of dopamine that modulates several behaviors through dopamine receptors (DOP-1, DOP-3 and DOP-4) on various postsynaptic/target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chase et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ezcurra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanyal et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). One such behavior is the basal slowing response, where wild-type animals slow in the presence of food.

These data, together with the localization of EFHC-1 at synaptic regions, are consistent with EFHC-1 preventing spontaneous release of dopamine at synapses in the absence of mechanical stimulation by food.</p><p>The release of dopamine at the synapse requires the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels at presynaptic termini, which allows for calcium influx and subsequent dopamine-bearing vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In humans, EFHC1 physically interacts with and modulates the alpha subunit of the R-type voltage-gated calcium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>), which is most closely related to UNC-2 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We therefore hypothesized that EFHC-1 prevents spontaneous activity of UNC-2 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> dopaminergic neurons, such that loss of <italic>efhc-1</italic> would stimulate UNC-2 activity even in the absence of mechanosensation at the cilium and result in increased dopamine release. Since <italic>unc-2</italic> mutants are uncoordinated and cannot be tested for habituation defects, we took advantage of a gain-of-function (gf) allele that shows slow habituation compared to both wild-type animals and <italic>efhc-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Also, because <italic>unc-2</italic> expression is found in many neurons apart from the dopaminergic neurons that may modulate tap habituation, a construct was made with UNC-2(gf) under the control of the <italic>efhc-1</italic> promoter. Remarkably, expressing overactive UNC-2 specifically in <italic>efhc-1-</italic>expressing cells results in a slow habituation phenotype similar (but not identical) to that seen in <italic>efhc-1</italic> mutants; crossing the UNC-2(gf) construct into <italic>efhc-1</italic> mutants did not result in slower habituation, but instead leads to habituation similar to that seen in animals with UNC-2(gf) specifically in <italic>efhc-1-</italic>expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Similarly, these trends were replicated in SWIP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Our findings therefore provide evidence that independent of its sensory/activation role at the cilium, EFHC-1 may negatively regulate UNC-2, such that loss of EFHC-1 results in maximum activation of the voltage-gated channel at the synapse.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the cilia of multicellular organisms are typically classified as either motile or non-motile, unicellular organisms possess one or more cilia responsible for both producing movement and responding to mechanosensory cues to modulate movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Our work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> provides a unique perspective given that EFHC-1-containing cells harbor both ciliary and synaptic regions, thus raising the intriguing possibility of differential trafficking to these two distinct locations within single cells. We show that EFHC-1’s ciliary localization is independent of UNC-101 and synaptic localization is independent of UNC-104, indicating that EFHC-1’s unique localization pattern does not rely on these known active transport mechanisms. While it is possible that EFHC-1’s localization pattern is dictated by other transport mechanisms, it could also result from diffusion of EFHC-1 throughout cells, followed by ciliary/synaptic retention through interactions with cytoskeletal arrangements, or specific proteins, unique to each location that enable scaffolding (<italic>e.g.</italic>, microtubule-associated proteins for ciliary localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ikeda et al., 2005</xref>] and actin-associated proteins for synaptic localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Torres and Inestrosa, 2018</xref>]).

At least one hour before testing, 20–30 worms were transferred to fresh NGM plates, with or without food. Plates with food were seeded with 50 μL of liquid culture OP50 bacteria in lysogeny broth (LB) 24 hr beforehand, while plates without food were seeded with 50 μL LB. Plates with worms were then placed into the Multi-Worm Tracker (MWT), and after a 300 or 600 s acclimatization period, 30 taps were administered to the side of the plate using a solenoid tapper at 10 s interstimulus intervals (ISI) [31].

The negative results are interesting, suggesting that targeting of EFHC1 occurs by some novel mechanism. However, the bottom line is a bit unsatisfying, as we still don't know details about the mechanism of localization or function. The colocalization of EFHC-1 and ELKS<sup>-1</sup> at active zones (which the authors say is better imaged in new Figure 1—figure supplement 5BFigure) is not convincing without seeing yellow puncta and without any quantification. This also puts in question the argument that these active zone proteins don't require UNC-104 for location because the data do not provide convincing evidence that EFHC-1 is an active zone protein. Overall, EFHC1 seems to be in the vicinity of synapses, but whether this means anything functionally has not been determined, nor has it been determined the mechanism of differential localization. Without more evidence along these lines, we think the manuscript would be better suited to another journal.

Our manuscript mentions the reported interaction between EFHC1 and the R-type voltage-gated calcium channel. Two complementary approaches based on EFHC1 constructs instead of nonspecific antibodies were used to support the interaction of EFHC1 and Cav2.3</p><p>(electrophysiological analyses and co-immunoprecipitation; Suzuki et al., 2003). Our own efforts to carry out pull-down interaction studies in the worm, which is known for not being readily amenable to biochemical analysis, have not been successful. Part of the reason is that cilium-associated proteins such as EFHC1 are only expressed, typically at (very) low levels, in a small subset of cells within the organism (at maximum, 60 of nearly 1000 cells, but lower in this case).</p><p>As such, we have resorted to genetic analyses to infer functional interactions between EFHC-1 and UNC-2. We now include truncation analyses of EFHC-1 (Figure 1D) which provide mechanistic insights for how the C-terminal region is sufficient for ciliary localisation; notably, this region contains only one of two poorly-studied DM10 domains found in the protein. While additional mechanistic insights into EFHC1 will be necessary (and this is mentioned in our Discussion section), we hope that on the whole, our discovery of a link between EFHC-1 and dopamine signalling will be of great interest to researchers interested in this protein, cilia, dopamine signalling, epilepsies and synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Loucks et al. characterizes the C. elegans ortholog of the ciliary protein EFHC1 that has been linked to Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.

Active transport to axons would be convincing – diffusion would not.</p></disp-quote><p>Although overexpressed GFP transgenes show localisation patterns consistent with that of endogenous protein localisation, it is possible that such localisation may not accurately represent the endogenous localisation of EFHC-1. To address this possibility, we tagged the endogenous <italic>efhc-1</italic> locus with GFP using the CRISPR genome editing tool and determined the localisation of the EFHC-1 expressed at physiological levels. <italic>efhc-1::gfp</italic> is expressed in OLQ, CEP and ADE neurons, and the EFHC-1 protein localises to the OLQ, CEP and ADE cilia. Given that both the overexpressed EFHC-1::GFP construct and the endogenously GFP-tagged EFHC-1 localise specifically to cilia as well as synaptic regions, we feel that this provides strong evidence for the function of EFHC-1 at these two subcellular regions. Consistent with this, EFHC1 is a known cilium-associated protein (<italic>e.g.</italic>, in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, see Ikeda et al., 2005), and in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> study, was also found to localise to the synaptic region (Rossetto et al., 2011).</p><p>To further support our assertion that EFHC-1 functions at the cilium and the synapse as recommended by the reviewer, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in the EFHC-1::GFP overexpression strain and the endogenously GFP-tagged EFHC-1 strain to examine whether EFHC-1 proteins can freely diffuse inside cilia. GFPtagged ARL-13 shows rapid recovery in bleached cilia, indicative of its ciliary localisation being dependent on diffusion (Cevik et al., 2013). In contrast, when we photobleached a portion of either CEP or OLQ cilia, we could not observe a similar rapid recovery within 30 seconds, indicating that EFHC-1’s localisation to cilia is mostly static (Figure 1—figure supplement 4A-B). Moreover, we generated kymographs to observe potential associations between intraflagellar transport (IFT) and EFHC-1, a scenario that is observed for several ciliary proteins. Unlike IFT proteins, we could not observe any clear (anterograde/retrograde) IFT tracks, suggesting that ciliary-localised EFHC-1 proteins are not associated with IFT (Figure 1—figure supplement 4C). Lastly, to determine whether dendritic transport is essential for ciliary localization of EFHC-1, we investigated the ciliary localisation of a control protein, the odorant receptor, ODR-10, that is dependent on dendritic transport mediated by UNC-101 (Dwyer et al., 2001). GFPtagged ODR-10, which is expressed in AWB neurons, mainly accumulates in cilia of wild-type animals, but diffuses throughout the whole AWB neurons in <italic>unc-101</italic> mutants. In contrast, we found that the ciliary localization of EFHC-1 was unchanged in <italic>unc-101</italic> mutants, suggesting that UNC-101 is dispensable for the OLQ and CEP ciliary localisation of EFHC-1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 4D).</p><p>We agree that the quality of the EFHC-1 colocalisation images with RAB-3 and ELKS<sup>-1</sup> needed to be improved to adequately infer the suggested colocalisations. We have replaced these images with ones that are much clearer (Figure 1—figure supplement 5). We also thank the reviewers for suggesting the important experiment of directly assessing active transport of EFHC-1 to synapses using the <italic>unc-104</italic> mutant. Synaptic vesicle proteins like RAB-3 are not transported to synaptic regions from cell bodies in the <italic>unc104 (e1265</italic>) mutant (Nonet et al., 1997). However, we discovered that the axonal localisation of EFHC-1 is UNC-104 independent. Importantly, such a localisation pattern that is independent of UNC-104 transport is also seen for active zone proteins such as ELKS<sup>-1</sup> (Deken et al., 2005), providing further support that EFHC-1 localises to presynaptic active zones. We include this data in Figure 1—figure supplement 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does EFHC-1 ciliary vs synaptic localization rely on the same elements?

However, EFHC-1(1-216) variant diffuses throughout the neurons but is weakly present at the cilium (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).

It was thus not surprising that no ciliary ultrastructure defects were seen in other ciliated cell types.

The orientation of images was originally chosen to best visualize cell bodies and axons, but we now include colocalization images in two different orientations, where the second (flipped 180° through the z axis) shows yellow puncta more clearly. These data are in the revised Figure 1—figure supplement 5B (last frame represents the added image).</p><p>These colocalization images for both wild-type and <italic>unc-104</italic> animals show partial colocalization in axons, as quantified using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). We find that the average PCC of EFHC-1::GFP and ELKS<sup>-1</sup>::tdTomato is 0.2541 in wild-type animals and 0.243 in <italic>unc-104</italic> animals. The quantitation results are found in Figure 1—figure supplement 5C.</p><p>Since a value of 1 indicates perfect colocalization, our results indicate only partial colocalization between EFHC-1 and ELKS<sup>-1</sup>, an established active zone protein. This colocalization is not significantly different upon the loss of UNC-104, the kinesin motor implicated in the axonal transport of vesicles to synapses.</p><p>Together, our data support the assertion that endogenous EFHC-1 tagged with GFP localizes to synaptic regions in close proximity to the active zone protein, ELKS<sup>-1</sup>, and that the synaptic localization pattern of EFHC-1 does not appear to rely on UNC-104, much like ELKS<sup>-1</sup> itself: see Nonet et al., 1997; Deken et al., 2005; and Patel et al., 2006.</p><p>These results do not allow us to classify EFHC-1 as an active zone protein (as the reviewers pointed out), and we have ensured that our manuscript text only specifies that EFHC-1 localizes in close proximity to active zones. The relevant change within the text of the manuscript is shown below (presynaptic regions is now used instead of presynaptic active zones):</p><p>In addition to EFHC-1’s ciliary localization, we find that the EFHC-1::GFP fusion protein is present at presynaptic regions in dopaminergic neurons, partially overlapping with the synaptic vesicle protein, synaptobrevin (SNB-1) (Figure 1E). By tagging endogenous EFHC-1 with GFP, we confirm that EFHC-1 localizes to these presynaptic regions, where it partially overlaps with a second synaptic vesicle protein (RAB-3) (Figure 1—figure supplement 5A). More specifically, EFHC-1 is found to partially colocalize with the active zone protein (ELKS<sup>-1</sup>) (Figure 1—figure supplement 5B-C), where it is ideally positioned to regulate synaptic release in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Since the presynaptic localization of synaptic vesicle proteins such as RAB-3, but not some active zone proteins like ELKS<sup>-1</sup>, depends on the kinesin-3 motor, UNC-104 (Deken et al., 2005; Nonet et al., 1997), we examined whether EFHC-1 also requires UNC-104 for its synaptic localization in CEP neurons. While RAB-3 localization is abrogated in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants, accumulating in cell bodies and diffusing to dendrites/axons of CEP neurons, UNC-104 is dispensable for both ELKS<sup>-1</sup> and EFHC-1 localization (and consequently their partial colocalization pattern) to presynaptic regions (Figure 1—figure supplement 5A-C). The presence of EFHC-1 at both the cilium and presynaptic regions of dopaminergic neurons suggests that it may play important roles in both sensation and regulation of neuronal output.</p><p>Notably, the localization (and function) of EFHC-1 at synaptic regions is further supported by our genetic analyses with UNC-2, a protein localized at presynaptic active zones and involved in provoked neurotransmitter release at the synapse. Specifically, we provide evidence, using tap habituation and swimming induced paralysis assays, both of which are modulated by dopamine signaling, that EFHC-1 negatively regulates UNC-2 activity (Figures 4C and Figure 2—figure supplement 2E). Importantly, human EFHC1 has been found to physically interact with the R-type voltage-dependent calcium channel, Ca<sub>v</sub>2.3, which is related to <italic>C. elegans</italic> UNC-2 (Suzuki et al., 2004). There is also consensus in the literature that EFHC1 likely interacts with Ca<sub>v</sub>2.3 to modulate its function (see Suzuki et al., 2004 and Katano et al.,2012). In summary, these data support a role for EFHC1 at synaptic regions, consistent with previously published work.</p><p>In conducting the requested experiments to help understand how EFHC-1 is transported to ciliary and synaptic regions in glutamatergic and mechanosensory neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we show that the localizations of EFHC-1 are independent of either UNC-101 (dendritic transport) or UNC-104 (axonal transport). This indicates that EFHC-1 may be transported to either location viaother transport mechanisms. Furthermore, our results highlight new avenues of research that might help to better understand this epilepsy-associated protein. To further address this in the manuscript, we include a paragraph in the discussion in which we bring attention to the importance of this area for better understanding EFHC-1’s proposed functions. Specifically, we propose that EFHC-1 may differentially localize to ciliary/synaptic regions through diffusion, followed by specific retention at these locations, possibly facilitated by cytoskeletal arrangements and associated proteins unique to each location (microtubule arrangements such as the EFHC-1-containing protofilament ribbon at the cilium, or actin arrangements that act as scaffolds to organize synaptic release machinery close to active zones). The paragraph we added to the Discussion section is shown below:</p><p>Previous work has identified EFHC1 at both ciliary (Conte et al., 2009; Ikeda et al., 2003b, 2005; Suzuki et al., 2008, 2009) and synaptic (Rossetto et al., 2011) regions, yet proposed functions at either location have only been considered separately. Our work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> provides a unique perspective given that EFHC1-containing cells harbor both ciliary and synaptic regions, thus raising the intriguing possibility of differential trafficking to these two distinct locations within single cells. We show that EFHC-1’s ciliary localization is independent of UNC-101 and synaptic localization is independent of UNC-104, indicating that EFHC-1’s unique localization pattern does not rely on theseknown active transport mechanisms. While it is possible that EFHC-1’s localization pattern is dictated by other transport mechanisms, it could also result from diffusion of EFHC-1 throughout cells, followed by ciliary/synaptic retention through interactions with cytoskeletal arrangements, or specific proteins, unique to each location that enable scaffolding; for example, microtubule-associated proteins for ciliary localization (Ikeda et al., 2005) and actin-associated proteins for synaptic localization (Torres and Inestrosa, 2018). These possibilities warrant further attention to help better understand EFHC-1’s mechanism of action at each site.</p><p>We agree that how EFHC-1 differentially localizes to ciliary and synaptic regions is an interesting and important problem, but our work has also uncovered several important insights into the functions of EFHC-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons that may have parallels in the human brain. Firstly, we show that EFHC-1 allows for normal dopamine signaling, suggesting that in its absence dopamine transmission is impaired, a phenomenon that may have consequences for neuronal excitability, leading to epilepsy in the human brain (Bozzi and Borrelli, 2013 and Ciumas et al., 2008).</p><p>Secondly, we find that EFHC-1 is required for mechanosensation, another novel finding given that EFHC-1 has previously been associated with ciliary motility and not sensory functions. Given that the loss of EFHC-1 prevents the mechanosensation required for dopamine release and yet also increases dopamine signaling (as measured by several behavioral assays), our work demonstrates that EFHC-1 localizes to and functions at the cilium, as well as downstream (in close proximity to synaptic active zones) to facilitate dopamine signaling.</p><p>This dual localization and function of EFHC-1, which regulates neuronal sensory input and output to allow appropriate dopamine release/signaling, represents a novel, central finding of our study. We hope our findings will not only help illuminate the function of EFHC-1, but also provide interesting insights into the connection between dopamine signalling, cilia, the synapse, and epilepsy.</p></body></sub-article></article>
