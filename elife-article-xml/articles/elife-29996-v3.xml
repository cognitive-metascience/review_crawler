neurons and oligodendrocytes can be generated from neural stem cells located within the Sub-Ventricular Zone (SVZ). Physiological signals regulating neuronal <italic>versus</italic> glial fate are largely unknown. Here we report that a thyroid hormone (T<sub>3</sub>)-free window, with or without a demyelinating insult, provides a favorable environment for SVZ-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor generation. After demyelination, oligodendrocytes derived from these newly-formed progenitors provide functional remyelination, restoring normal conduction. The cellular basis for neuronal <italic>versus</italic> glial determination in progenitors involves asymmetric partitioning of EGFR and TRα1, expression of which favor glio- and neuro-genesis, respectively. Moreover, EGFR<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocyte progenitors, but not neuroblasts, express high levels of a T<sub>3</sub>-inactivating deiodinase, Dio3. Thus, TRα absence with high levels of Dio3 provides double-pronged blockage of T<sub>3</sub> action during glial lineage commitment. These findings not only transform our understanding of how T<sub>3</sub> orchestrates adult brain lineage decisions, but also provide potential insight into demyelinating disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adult neural stem cell</kwd><kwd>thyroid hormone</kwd><kwd>oligodendrocytes</kwd><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>cell fate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Association Française contre les Myopathies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Remaud</surname><given-names>Sylvie</given-names></name><name><surname>Demeneix</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demeneix</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Remaud</surname><given-names>Sylvie</given-names></name><name><surname>Zalc</surname><given-names>Bernard</given-names></name><name><surname>Demeneix</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angulo</surname><given-names>Maria Cecilia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Production of remyelinating subventricular zone oligodendrocyte progenitors is stimulated by transient abrogation of thyroid hormone signalling in the adult neural stem cell niche.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In Multiple Sclerosis (MS) neurological disability results from myelin and axonal degeneration. Inflammation-induced loss of myelin renders axons more susceptible to injury, leading to greater probability of permanent handicap and accumulated disease burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutta and Trapp, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mahad et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, alongside available anti-inflammatory treatments, current therapeutic strategies aim at enhancing myelin repair. In particular, screening of repurposing molecules favoring proliferation, differentiation and maturation of endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) have been deployed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buckley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deshmukh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Najm et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Endogenous myelin repair could exploit the two sources of OPCs that exist in the adult mammalian brain: the resident parenchymal OPCs (pOPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tripathi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolswijk and Noble, 1989</xref>) and mouse subventricular zone-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors that then generate newly formed OPCs locally (SVZ-OPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nait-Oumesmar et al., 2007</xref>). Remyelination from pOPCs is known to produce thin myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xing et al., 2014</xref>). In pathological settings such as MS, this limited remyelination produces so-called shadow plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franklin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Périer and Grégoire, 1965</xref>). However, autopsies of a large cohort of MS patients show complete remyelination in certain periventricular areas, that is, in the vicinity of the SVZ, as opposed to shadow plaques, usually observed elsewhere in the brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patrikios et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, examination of post-mortem MS brains revealed mobilization of human SVZ-OPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nait-Oumesmar et al., 2007</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that in humans, endogenous remyelination driven by SVZ-OPCs can provide full remyelination. Supporting this concept, it has been recently shown in mice that SVZ-OPCs produce thicker myelin sheets, similar to those formed during normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xing et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, stimulation of the regenerative potential of SVZ-OPCs could be a promising perspective for the development of therapies in the context of demyelinating diseases such as MS.</p><p>In the adult rodent, Neural Stem Cells (NSC) localized in the SVZ neurogenic niche generate glial and neuronal progenitor cells. Neuroblasts migrate tangentially toward the olfactory bulb through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) and differentiate as interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doetsch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1993</xref>). In contrast, oligodendrocyte progenitor derived SVZ-OPCs migrate radially and tangentially into the corpus callosum (CC), striatum or cortex and differentiate into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. Under physiological conditions, production of SVZ-OPCs is lower compared with the number of neuroblasts that migrate along the RMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Menn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suzuki and Goldman, 2003</xref>). However, after a demyelinating insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keirstead and Blakemore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nait-Oumesmar et al., 1999</xref>) or exposure to various extrinsic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El Waly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ortega et al., 2013</xref>), NSC commitment switches towards production of oligodendrocyte progenitors that give rise to OPCs that migrate into the neighboring white matter. Stimuli favoring oligodendrocyte progenitor production include <italic>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor signaling (</italic>EGFR). EGFR overexpression in the adult rodent SVZ increases oligodendrogenesis under physiological and pathological conditions, facilitating brain recovery after demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doetsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scafidi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The continuous generation of neuronal and glial progenitors makes the adult SVZ a unique system in which to study the molecular mechanisms regulating stem cell fate decisions. Whether and how the same signal can orient cell fate decision towards one or the other direction is still an open question. Thyroid hormone (TH) is a key homeostatic signal dynamically regulating neurogenesis. Within the neurogenic niches of the adult mammalian brain, TH regulates progenitor commitment to a neuronal fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kapoor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">López-Juárez et al., 2012</xref>), influencing learning, memory and mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kapoor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Remaud et al., 2014</xref>). T<sub>3</sub>, the active form of TH, and its nuclear receptor TRα1 promote NSC specification toward a neuronal identity <italic>in vivo</italic> through downregulation of (i) the pluripotency gene <italic>Sox2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">López-Juárez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Remaud et al., 2014</xref>) and (ii) the cell cycle genes <italic>Ccnd1</italic> and <italic>Myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lemkine et al., 2005</xref>). This raises the question of whether T<sub>3</sub> influences oligodendrogenesis from NSCs, at the level of progenitor determination in the adult SVZ, upstream of its well-established role in oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barres et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dugas et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To this end, we analyzed consequences on oligodendrogenesis of T<sub>3</sub>-depletion (hypothyroidism) in a well-established murine model of demyelination after which we allowed for a short period of T<sub>3</sub>-stimulated remyelination. We report that in a cuprizone-induced-demyelination model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ludwin, 1978</xref>) a hypothyroid window during the demyelination phase favors production of mature myelinating oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum from SVZ-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors. This newly generated wave of SVZ-derived oligodendrocytes produces a myelin of normal thickness, whereas control euthyroid animals generate thinner myelin sheaths. By measuring compound action potentials we show complete functional recovery.</p><p>We also addressed the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this T<sub>3</sub>-free dependent oligodendrocyte production. We show that during adult neurogenesis, the neuron <italic>versus</italic> glia cell fate decision in newly derived NSC progenitors is determined respectively by the presence or absence of both TRα1 and, T<sub>3,</sub> its ligand. Absence of TRα1 in oligodendrocyte progenitors is ensured by asymmetric segregation during mitosis of TRα1, a neurogenic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">López-Juárez et al., 2012</xref>) and EGFR, an established inductor of oligodendrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre et al., 2007</xref>). Absence of the ligand, T<sub>3</sub>, in the EGFR + oligodendrocyte progenitors is ensured by high levels of Dio3, the T<sub>3</sub> inactivating deiodinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">St Germain et al., 2009</xref>). This oligodendrocyte progenitor-specific Dio3 expression restricts TH availability in the glial lineage. In contrast, lower levels of Dio3 are found in neuronal progenitors where TRα1 represses <italic>Egfr</italic>, reinforcing neuronal commitment. Taken together, the data provide evidence that transient hypothyroidism favors lineage determination of adult multipotential SVZ-progenitors towards an oligodendroglial fate and promotes functional brain remyelination <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A T<sub>3</sub>-free window during demyelination favors functional remyelination</title><p>Since T<sub>3</sub> and its receptor, TRα, promote neuronal fate in the adult SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">López-Juárez et al., 2012</xref>) we reasoned that the absence of T<sub>3</sub>, (hypothyroidism) might favor gliogenesis. To address this question we investigated the role of hypothyroidism in generating oligodendrocyte progenitors in the adult SVZ. Hypothyroidism was induced using MMI (0.1%) and NaClO4 (0.5%) during experimental demyelination induced by oral administration of cuprizone (CPZ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). CPZ treatment causes marked demyelination in the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ludwin, 1978</xref>). The demyelination phase was followed by three T<sub>3</sub>/T<sub>4</sub> pulses to stimulate oligodendrocyte maturation. A first control was to verify responses to transient hypothyroidism without cuprizone treatment followed by T<sub>3</sub>/T<sub>4</sub> treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> four weeks of hypothyroidism were sufficient to stimulate significantly, and by nearly two-fold, oligodendrocyte progenitor numbers within the adult SVZ without affecting numbers of corpus callosum resident OPCs. We next quantified responses to hypothyroidism during a CPZ-induced demyelination. CPZ has the experimental advantage that the process of demyelination is temporally separated from the subsequent process of remyelination, allowing the latter to be specifically studied without the complication of ongoing demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franklin, 2015</xref>). CPZ-induced demyelination was accompanied by increased astrocytic (GFAP<sup>+</sup>) and microglial (IBA1<sup>+</sup>) responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). In accordance with our hypothesis, transitory hypothyroidism during demyelination, followed by T<sub>3</sub>/T<sub>4</sub> pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to favor oligodendrocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barres et al., 1994</xref>), increased Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) and Myelin Oligodendrocyte (MOG), two markers of maturing oligodendrocytes, in the corpus callosum and septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,E,F</xref>). Moreover, transient hypothyroidism during demyelination also increased OLIG2 expression in the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). OLIG2 is a basic loop helix transcription factor expressed throughout oligodendrocyte lineage development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2000</xref>). The nuclear localization of OLIG2 permitted quantification. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>, after 7 days of recovery, the number of OLIG2+ cells in the corpus callosum was decreased to 29.8 ± 10.6 OLIG2+ cells per 10<sup>3</sup> µm<sup>2</sup> (p&lt;0.05) in euthyroid CPZ-treated mice (EuCPZ), whereas values were not significantly different for controls (unexposed to CPZ) and hypothyroid CPZ-treated mice (HypoCPZ) (60 ± 8.1 and 44 ± 6.6 OLIG2+ cells per 10<sup>3</sup> µm<sup>2</sup> respectively). Interestingly, in the latter mice (HypoCPZ), we observed a restricted lateral localization of the MBP<sup>+</sup> and MOG<sup>+</sup> cell masses, above the dorsal part of lateral ventricles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> for MBP and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref> for MOG).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29996.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hypothyroidism during demyelination favors oligodendrogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental procedure: Cuprizone (CPZ) was added to the diet for 6 weeks (d0 to d42) and a T<sub>3</sub>-free window applied for one month, two weeks after onset of CPZ treatment (d14 to d42).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to quantify myelinated axons in the corpus callosum and to quantify whether the oligodendrocytes generated from hypothyroidism-induced oligodendrocyte progenitors myelinate more than resident adult pOPCs. TEM revealed increased myelinated axon density in the periventricular area of HypoCPZ <italic>versus</italic> EuCPZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Further, evaluation of g-ratios representing myelin thickness with respect to axon diameter revealed that the significant reduction in myelin thickness in EuCPZ (g = 0.83 ± 0.07) <italic>versus</italic> controls not subjected to demyelination (g = 0.75 ± 0.07, p&lt;0.001) was rescued in HypoCPZ mice (g = 0.77 ± 0.06) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>).

However, no differences were observed in normalized stimulation-response curves between groups at any stimulation pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; p&gt;0.05 two way-ANOVA).

First, there is asymmetric distribution of EGFR and TRα1 in a subpopulation of proliferating progenitors. Second, the presence of the inactivating deiodinase, Dio3 in NSCs, progenitors and early OPCs will ensure degradation of any surrounding T<sub>3</sub>. Third, this Dio3-generated absence of T<sub>3</sub> will limit repression of EGFR by any residual TRα1. Together these mechanisms block T<sub>3</sub>/TRα1 signaling in glial-restricted progenitors. In contrast, in cells receiving TRα1, residual <italic>Egfr</italic> expression will be repressed by T<sub>3</sub>/TRα1 permitting neuronal determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">López-Juárez et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>These results could appear paradoxical given the rich datasets detailing the importance of T<sub>3</sub> for oligodendrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barres et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billon et al., 2002</xref>), maturation and myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dugas et al., 2012</xref>). Yet our results do not contradict this well-established concept. As expected, addition of T<sub>3</sub> following a period of hypothyroidism consolidates remyelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Strikingly, our data indicate that transient hypothyroidism during demyelination, prior to the addition of T<sub>3</sub>, activates oligodendrogenesis in the dorsal SVZ favoring migration of remyelinating OPCs into the corpus callosum.</p><p>Even if we cannot exclude a role of resident adult pOPCs following a transient lack of T<sub>3</sub>, several arguments from our experiments favor a facilitating role of SVZ-derived OPCs in functional brain repair. First, cell tracing using a eGFP lentivirus showed that the remyelinating OPCs derive from the SVZ. Second, a hypothyroid window (without cuprizone treatment) was sufficient to bolster significantly SVZ-OPCs and not resident pOPCs. Lastly, transient hypothyroidism increased the number of cycling oligodendrocyte progenitors in the SVZ, but decreased the number of cycling pOPCs located within the corpus callosum. Each of these findings suggest that SVZ-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors preferentially respond to a lack of T<sub>3</sub>, as compared to pOPC populations.</p><p>The efficient remyelination capacity of SVZ–mobilized OPCs has been well-documented experimentally in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nait-Oumesmar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xing et al., 2014</xref>). In accordance with our results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xing et al. (2014)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brousse et al. (2015)</xref> demonstrated by <italic>in vivo</italic> fate-mapping that the region of the corpus callosum adjacent to the SVZ is more permissive to remyelination than that arising from pOPCs. A higher density of SVZ-derived OPCs is found adjacent to the dorso-lateral part of the SVZ after acute demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xing et al., 2014</xref>; Brousse et al., 2015). Moreover, our study of myelin integrity deposited by newly generated oligodendrocytes after one-week of recovery in hypothyroid mice showed a g-ratio similar to control mice and significantly lower than in euthyroid mice. Of note, since animals were not examined for longer periods after stopping the cuprizone diet, we cannot ascertain the stability of the remyelination observed. However, this finding is again in agreement with published data showing that axons myelinated by SVZ-derived oligodendrocytes have lower g-ratios than axons myelinated by pOPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xing et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, our work and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xing et al., 2014</xref>); Brousse et al., 2015) show that resident pOPCs should not be considered as the only source of remyelinating cells and that SVZ-OPCs are also involved in efficient myelin repair.</p><p>A potential caveat might be that our observation is limited to the corpus callosum and that our findings cannot be extrapolated to other brain or spinal cord regions. However, in MS, lesions of the corpus callosum and prefrontal cortex are also of primary clinical concern, with ensuing cognitive impairments affecting decision-making with crucial consequences. So these findings have clinical relevance, although we realize that reaching therapeutic applications through local modulation of thyroid hormone availability is complicated by the fact that MS lesions are asynchronous and not localized to one particular area.</p><p>Turning to the capacity of resident OPCs to carry out remyelination, it is plausible that, despite the thin myelin and short internodes generated, conduction speed could be partially restored. A potential scenario would be recovery from a complete conduction block (demyelinated) to 45 m/s (thin myelin) as opposed to 50 m/s with thick myelin. However, cognitive actions depend on rapid decision-making and so, even in daily life, this slower conduction could still represent a severe handicap. In this respect, the recovery of CAPs suggests that remyelination in the cuprizone model preserves axon integrity as recently shown in an EAE model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mei et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that, although the movement or mobilisation of cells can only be inferred when examining post-mortem tissue, in brains of MS patients, early glial progenitors were observed more frequently in periventricular lesions as opposed to lesions further away from the ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nait-Oumesmar et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, in experimental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunge et al., 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stidworthy et al., 2003</xref>) as well as in MS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Périer and Grégoire, 1965</xref>), lesions that spontaneously remyelinate, forming ‘shadow plaques’, are characterized by a thinner myelin sheath. From our data, one could predict that remyelination closest to the SVZ should not yield shadow plaques because oligodendrocytes generated from SVZ-derived OPCs myelinate more efficiently and with normal sheath thickness. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patrikios et al. (2006)</xref> described 51 autopsies of human MS cases and observed that complete remyelination was detected in some periventricular plaques, contrasting with shadow plaques observed at a greater distance from ventricles. This finding bolsters the clinical relevance of our findings and strengthens the concept that transient hypothyroidism could enhance generation of SVZ-derived OPCs in demyelinating diseases, a property that could be exploited for translational purposes.</p><p>Here we show that nerve conduction measured by evoked compound action potential is altered in EU-CPZ treated-mice and is completely restored in Hypo-CPZ animals. Crawford and collaborators reported that following 6 weeks-cuprizone diet with 3 to 6 weeks of normal diet led to regeneration of myelin but did not fully reverse nerve conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crawford et al., 2009</xref>), underlining the contrast with our data in hypothyroid conditions. Furthermore, using a mouse model of hypoxia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scafidi et al. (2014)</xref> demonstrated that EGFR treatment rescued the increase in g-ratio in association with a complete functional recovery. These data emphasize the importance of myelin repair to recover normal functional axon conduction.</p><p>Our work demonstrates how an inactivating deiodinase that limits availability of a homeostatic endocrine signal, T<sub>3</sub>, determines neuronal cell fate decision. This result has evolutionary implications. Beyond the questions raised by co-evolution of the thyroid gland and the appearance of myelination, current hypotheses on the changes in vertebrate brain structure and function implicate control of progenitor pool size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, it has been shown that the Drosophila EGFR homologue DER regulates midline glial cells survival during embryonic and larval stages in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hidalgo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zak and Shilo, 1990</xref>). The steroid ecdysone receptor (EcR), the invertebrate homolog of TR that controls metamorphosis in insects, stops mitotic activity in the glial population and may induce terminal differentiation by interfering with Ras/MAPK activity underlying DER activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giesen et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the ecdysone receptor may be a functional homologue of vertebrate TR in the regulation of the number of glial cells and their differentiation. It is well established that brain development shares remarkable similarities between vertebrates and invertebrates, notably in the biology of NSC niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reichert, 2009</xref>). Here we propose a new evolutionary conserved crosstalk, between EGFR and the nuclear receptor superfamily containing EcR and TR, between vertebrates and invertebrates in the regulation of gliogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, three major findings arise from this work. First, our results place a key homeostatic factor, thyroid hormone, at the crossroads of cellular decisions in the adult mouse neural stem cell niche, modulating actions of other players including TRα1 or EGFR that determine adult NSC commitment to neuronal or oligodendrocyte progenitors, respectively. Second, we observe that newly-generated OPCs produce myelin of normal thickness. This contrasts with the thinner myelin sheath usually observed when remyelination is carried out by resident pOPCs, a situation that leads in MS to shadow plaques. Finally, remyelination with a thick myelin sheath provides a fully functional recovery, suggesting novel therapeutic targets for demyelinating disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Swiss and C57BL/6 wild-type male mice, 8 weeks-old, were purchased from Janvier (Le Genest St. Isle, France).

Second, DCX was found to be co-expressed with TRα1 when TRα1 was detected either using Rockland antibody in WT mice (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">López-Juárez et al., 2012</xref>) as well as with βgal antibody to detect tagged TR protein in <italic>TRα/LacZ</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, this paper). Finally, the antibody gave the same cell-specific pattern as GFP following in vitro transfection of pTRα1:GFP DNA plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mavinakere et al., 2012</xref>) transfection using the neurosphere assay (data not shown).,</p><p>Secondary antibodies used: donkey anti-rabbit (Alexa Fluor 488, 594 and 647 nm), donkey anti-guinea pig (594 nm), donkey anti-goat (594 nm), donkey anti-chicken (594 nm), donkey anti-mouse (594 nm) all used diluted (1/500) in PBS containing 1% BSA and 1% normal donkey serum.</p><p>Images were acquired using LSM 710 and SP5 confocal microscopes. For confocal imaging of asymmetric cell division, a stack of images through the SVZ (a minimum of 20 images with a 0.2 µm step in the z-axis) was collected and projection (average) images made from z-stacks using Fiji software Amira software was used to create 3D reconstructions of the asymmetric cells. Note that cell divisions were easily observed using two parameters: (i) PH3 staining reporting cell undergoing mitosis and (ii) condensed chromatin throughout the various stages of mitosis. The major phases of cell cycle progression were determined as a function of chromatin condensation, nuclear size and separation of daughter nuclei.</p><p>A signal threshold was applied using Fiji software to separate cell populations expressing different levels of protein markers determined by immunohistochemistry. Following this analysis, the statistical validity of the differences between sub-populations was established using ANOVA test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Real-time PCR analysis</title><p>Lateral walls of the lateral ventricles were dissected under a binocular microscope, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Total RNA was extracted with RNAble according the protocol provided with the reagent (Eurobio), concentrations/integrity were measured and stored at −80°C in Tris 10 nM (ou mM)/EDTA 0.1 mM (pH 7.4). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using high capacity cDNA reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). For qPCR analysis, 2 µl of cDNA (diluted 20-fold) were used as template in a final volume of 20 µl per well. TaqMan specific probes (Applied Biosystems) used were the following: <italic>Egfr</italic> (Mm00433023_m1) and control assays (GAPDH, Mm99999915_g1). qPCR reaction was performed using ABI PRISM 7300 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decherf et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Neurosphere culture and differentiation</title><p>Five animals were sacrificed per preparation and the brains were sliced into small pieces. SVZ were dissected in DMEM-F12-glutamax (Gibco) and the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles were incubated in papain solution for 30 min at 37°C to obtain a single-cell suspension. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 rcf for 5 min. The cellular pellets were resuspended in 200 µl of DMEM-F12 (Gibco). Cells (10<sup>5</sup>) were cultured in complete culture medium (DMEM-F12 [Gibco], 40 µg/ml insulin [Sigma], 1/200 B-27 supplement [Gibco], 1/100 N-2 supplement [Gibco], 0.3% glucose, 5 nM Hepes, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin) containing 20 ng/ml of EGF and 20 ng/ml of FGF2 (Peprotech) for one week to obtain primary neurospheres. The cultures were maintained in a 5% CO2 environment at 37°C for 7 days. To analyse cell differentiation, neurospheres were dissociated into single cells and 2.10<sup>5</sup> cells were plated on Matrigel-coated glass coverslips in 24-well plated in complete culture medium without EGF/FGF2 for 7 days. To test the effects of T<sub>3</sub> on the early neuron/glia cell fate choice, a dose-dependent pulse of T<sub>3</sub> (1 nM, 10 nM, 50 nM) was given at day 1 of differentiation. Cells from the control group were grown in complete culture medium with no addition of T<sub>3</sub>. Six days later, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Demyelination induction</title><p>Adult male mice C57BL/6, aged 8 weeks, were fed with 0.2% cuprizone (w/w) mixed into standard mouse chow for a total of 6 weeks (42 days) to induce demyelination in the corpus callosum. After cuprizone treatment, the diet was changed to normal chow for one week before studying remyelination at 49d. Aged matched normal controls (CTL) were fed with a standard chow without cuprizone. To analyze the effects of a lack of T<sub>3</sub> on remyelination, a critical hypothyroid window was applied during the active phase of demyelination, for one month (from 14d to 42d).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Transmission Electron Microscopy</title><p>One week after the end of the CPZ diet animals were perfused with an intra-cardiac injection of a solution containing 1.6% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (0.12M, pH7.4). Brains were dissected and post fixed overnight in the same fixative solution at +4°C. Thick coronal sections (1 mm) at the level of the lateral ventricle (mouse brain atlas from Paxinos interaural: 4.30 mm bregma: 0.50 mm) were performed using a mouse brain slicer matrix (Zivic Instruments). Sections were rinsed with PB and post fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in PB for 1 hr. Samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions (75, 80, 90% and 100%, 10 min each). Final dehydration was performed twice in 100% acetone for 20 min. Infiltration with Epon812 (epoxy resin) was performed in 2 steps: 1 night at +4°C in a 50:50 mixture of Epon and acetone, 6 hr at RT in fresh Epon812. Half sections were flat embedded with a drop of fresh resin in between two pieces of Aclar plastic foil. Polymerization was performed at 56°C for 48 hr in a dry oven. For sectioning samples were positioned at 90° (from flat) and cut with an UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica). Semi-thin sections (0.5 µm thick) were stained with 1% toluidine blue in 1% borax. Ultra-thin sections (70 nm thick) were contrasted with 2% uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead citrate (Reynolds, ES (1963). The use of lead citrate at high pH as an electron opaque stain in electron microscopy. They were observed with a Hitachi HT7700 electron microscope, operating at 80 kV. Pictures (2048x2048 pixels) were taken with an AMT41B (pixel size: 7.4 µm x7.4 µm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Acute slice preparation and compound action potential recordings</title><p>Acute coronal slices of <italic>corpus callosum</italic> (300 µm) were prepared from 3.5-month-old mice in an ice-cold solution containing (in mM): 93 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 2 thiourea, 5 ascorbate, 3 pyruvate, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and incubated for 8 min in the same solution at 34°C (pH 7.4 equilibrated with HCl). Then, they were transferred for 20 min at 34°C into a standard extracellular solution containing (in mM): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 20 glucose, 5 pyruvate, 1 CaCl2 and 2 MgCl2 and maintain at RT (95% O2, 5% CO2). This procedure allows for a good recovery and preservation of adult brain tissue after slicing. Compound action potentials (CAPs) were recorded in a recording chamber perfused with the extracellular solution at 2–3 mL/min at 34°C. For comparison between the three groups of interest, CAPs were always recorded in the same rostral <italic>corpus callosum</italic> region identified under the microscope by the size of lateral ventricles opposed to the SVZ (N = 5 mice per group). Compound action potentials (CAPs) were evoked by stimulating white matter fibers with a monopolar tungsten electrode while a recording electrode (glass pipette) was placed either in the lesion core or normal appearing white matter, according to the group (100 μs stimulations; Iso-Stim 01D, npi electronic GmbH, Tamm, Germany). Electrophysiological recordings were obtained using Multiclamp 700B, filtered at 4 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz. Digitized data were analyzed off-line using pClamp10.1 (Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.00 software (Sans Diego, California).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers and receiving additional comments from members of the <italic>eLife</italic> editorial board. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews, we regret to inform you that your work can not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will read below, the referees find your work in principle interesting and agree that transient hypothyroidism followed by T3 pulses comprise a novel way to approach the role of thyroid hormone role in myelination in vivo. However, there were too many concerns that the data presented do not justify the claims. There remained ambiguity around the origin of the cells contributing to remyelination and the many interesting and somewhat unexpected aspects of this paper do not &quot;hang together as a whole to make an entirely compelling study&quot; (as one referee put it). Referees were in particular missing direct evidence that the thicker myelin is mediated by newly generated cells from the SVC. The claims regarding translational potential appeared overstated.</p><p>The referees felt that it is not possible to solve the shortcomings of the present paper by reasonable revision experiments within a two month timeframe. A new submission with all points considered might receive more favourable comments. However, unlike a revision this would lead a new editorial assessment, most likely with different referees.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Remaud, S. et al., seeks to show that:</p><p>1) A transient hypothyroid window (T<sub>3</sub>-/-), induced using MMI (0.1%)+NaClO4(0.5%), followed by 3 T<sub>3</sub>/T<sub>4</sub> pulses, is sufficient to induce SVZ oligodendrogenesis. These SVZ-derived OPCs then migrate to the corpus callosum. Following toxic demyelinating injury (Cuprizone), SVZ-OPCs migrate into the corpus callosum to repopulate lost myelin.</p><p>2) These newly derived SVZ-OPCs are sufficient to functionally remyelinate the corpus callosum.</p><p>3) T<sub>3</sub>, and its endogenous receptor TRa1, are neurogenic. EGFR is gliogenic. T<sub>3</sub> is sufficient to repress Egfr transcription in the adult SVZ.</p><p>4) TRa1 and EGFR segregate asymmetrically during mitosis, forming crescents on opposing poles during prophase. This asymmetric division within <italic>Sox2Sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> cycling cells is responsible for oligodendroglial or neuronal fate.</p><p>5) T<sub>3</sub> bioavailability is determined by the opposing actions of the deiodinases Dio2 and Dio3. Dio3-the inactivating deiodinase, protects EGFR+ positive cells from the potential effects of T<sub>3</sub> availability. Dio3 is sufficient to modulate neural stem cell fate distributions.</p><p>Review Summary:</p><p>The idea of focusing on transient hypothyroidism before T<sub>3</sub> pulses is a novel, innovative way to approach thyroid hormone's role in re/myelination. However, while the authors show correlational data, there are major concerns with whether the data presented justify the ultimate claims. The authors have not concretely proven that T<sub>3</sub> pulses following the transient hypothyroid window are not stimulating endogenous pOPC differentiation in the corpus callosum, accounting for the lateral localization of oligodendrocytes.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors sought to prove that a hypothyroid window followed by T<sub>3</sub> pulses was sufficient to stimulate SVZ oligodendrogenesis and migration to the corpus callosum, followed by differentiation and myelination. The authors claims are based on correlational data. In order to determine substantively that these OPCs were derived from the SVZ, the authors would need to fate map the cells to determine their origin, and eliminate the possibility that T<sub>3</sub> pulses are not stimulating endogenous OPCs in the corpus callosum to differentiate.</p><p>2) Furthermore, to remove the potential contaminating effect of T<sub>3</sub> on pOPC endogenous differentiation, I would like to see quantifications of cycling OPCs, number of myelinated axons, and g-ratios repeated across many models: control mice, euthyroid (no T<sub>3</sub>) mice, euthyroid mice, hypothyroid (no T<sub>3</sub>) mice, hypothyroid mice. This concern applies also to all tests of myelin functionality.</p><p>3) The authors suggest that TRa1 is excluded from cells expressing OLIG2 and SOX10, but that it is later turned on in cells expressing O4. This claim suggests that expression of TRa1 is developmentally regulated, thereby showing that expression of TRa1 is more intrinsically important than T<sub>3</sub> pulses/general bioavailability of T<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>4) In the final figure, the authors claim that Dio3 is sufficient to modulate cell fate. However, the authors only show that the downregulation of Dio3 reduced cell proliferation by 50% and number of OLIG2+ progenitors by 30%. The authors do not show a subsequent increase in neuronal cells. This only shows fewer cells and does not prove that the plasmid is not simply killing cells. The authors would need to show a subsequent increase in neuronal cell fate in order to claim Dio3 expression is sufficient to modulate cell fate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a generally well-presented paper that reports some interesting and to some extent unexpected findings. Given the well-documented role of thyroid hormone in inducing oligodendrocyte differentiation from its progenitor (indeed TH is one the most reliable means of generation oligodendrocytes from OPs in tissue culture) it is unexpected that this hormone should have the opposite effect in guiding the differentiation of progenitors from the SEZ.</p><p>While the biology presented is of interest, the translational implications seem to me overstated. First, as the authors point out in the Introduction, the white matter adjacent to the SEZ tends to undergo efficient remyelination and is therefore not a major target for remyelination therapy. Second, since there is now reasonable and growing evidence that TH may have pro-remyelinating effects on OPs elsewhere in the CNS (that is beyond the very restricted region around the SEZ), inhibiting TH signalling to encourage remyelination close to the SEZ is likely to be detrimental to the regeneration of the much greater burden of demyelination throughout the rest of the CNS. In other words, the very small gain in repair close to the SEZ would likely be at the expense of limiting a much greater need for repair elsewhere – so why would you ever want to do it?</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Is it really possible to identify mobilization of cells from the SEZ into adjacent tissue from MS post-mortem material? This seems to be inference rather than fact.</p><p>I would question whether SVZ-derived OPCs really produce 'thicker' myelin sheaths during remyelination. SVZ-OPCs remyelinate axons within the corpus callosum, which are amongst the smallest diameter axons in the CNS. It is well established that for these small diameter axons the myelin sheath thickness is the same for normally myelinated and remyelinated axons – it is only as axons get bigger that the thickness of the two diverge.</p><p>Results:</p><p>The authors should provide more details of how hypothyroidism is induced in the Results text.</p><p>Since Olig2 is expressed by all stages of the lineage it is not valid to use it as an OP marker and therefore neither is valid to state that there is a two-fold increase in OPs after 4 weeks of hypothyroidism.</p><p>The labelling for the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> need to be explicit indicating what the measurements are rather than what the inference is.</p><p>Re <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, I</xref>'m sure it would be possible to provide some quantitative data on the MBP expression in the three groups.</p><p>Subsection “A T<sub>3</sub>-free window during demyelination favors functional remyelination”, first paragraph, the last sentence is entirely speculative and should be removed from the Results section.</p><p>The remyelination gradient that the authors refer to is not evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>.

The decision has been reached that the paper is acceptable for <italic>eLife</italic> provided that the following text changes are made to the manuscript.</p><p>1) One remaining issue, as pointed out by one referee, is whether the observed effects are spatially restricted or without further evidence generalizable to other white matter tracts (&quot;it is likely to be true elsewhere in the brain&quot;).

Please rephrase.</p><p>2) Also the claim that scientist would believe 'demyelination is restricted to sensory motor systems' was not approved and should be dropped.</p><p>3) One referee writes: &quot;…my point about mobilisation of cells in MS has been misunderstood. I am fully aware of the paper by Nait-Oumesmar and colleagues but my point is that the movement or mobilisation of cells is always an inference when one examines post-mortem MS tissue – it is never definitely proven and so should not be stated as such.

The stereotaxic injections of the viral vectors (1 µl of the lentiviral stock titered as 1.64E+09 TU/ml by FACS) were performed at 14d of demyelination. At 34d after starting the cuprizone diet, we observed not only GFP+ cells in the SVZ, but also groups of GFP+ cells that had migrated into the corpus callosum and into the striatum. We confirmed that more SVZ cells are recruited during a demyelinating insult in EuCPZ mice (3.6 ± 2,8 GFP+ cells per section, n=3) compared to control mice (2 ± 1,4 GFP+ cells per section, n=3). Hypothyroidism during cuprizone diet increases this recruitment even more. In HypoCPZ mice we found nearly 4 more GFP+ cells (11,8 ± 20,9 GFP+ cells per sections, n=3) and they display oligodendrocyte morphology (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The question of whether T<sub>3</sub> pulses are not stimulating pOPC to differentiate is addressed in the next question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Furthermore, to remove the potential contaminating effect of T<sub>3</sub> on pOPC endogenous differentiation, I would like to see quantifications of cycling OPCs, number of myelinated axons, and g-ratios repeated across many models: control mice, euthyroid (no T<sub>3</sub>) mice, euthyroid mice, hypothyroid (no T<sub>3</sub>) mice, hypothyroid mice. This concern applies also to all tests of myelin functionality.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an interesting point. We have performed these control groups that just received NaCl after cuprizone treatment. Microtome sections were prepared to quantify myelinated axons in the corpus callosum, as has been done after T<sub>3</sub> administration. Moreover, electron microscopy was performed to measure the g-ratio and thus to evaluate myelin thickness.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C-E</xref> shows we observed that the numbers of myelinated axons in control and EuCPZ mice are not different after NaCl or T<sub>3</sub> pulses during the recuperation phase. Moreover, in HypoCPZ mice, the density of myelinated axons is significantly increased compared to EuCPZ mice. This result shows that the hypothyroid window is sufficient to increase the density of myelinated axons. Accordingly, g-ratio measurements show that myelin thickness in HypoCPZ mice is also rescued. Thus, the T<sub>3</sub>-free window applied during demyelination, without the T<sub>3</sub> pulses, is sufficient to promote generation of OPCs capable to remyelinate efficiently axons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors suggest that TRa1 is excluded from cells expressing OLIG2 and SOX10, but that it is later turned on in cells expressing O4.

As to the effect of TRα1 expression in the absence of ligand (in this cellular context), this is a question that remains to be addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the final figure, the authors claim that Dio3 is sufficient to modulate cell fate.

Although our observation is limited to the corpus callosum, it is likely that it is also true elsewhere in the brain. These possibilities require investigation as in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions are spread out in the brain and spinal cord. In the meantime even though our demonstration is limited to the corpus callosum, it is relevant to treatment of MS. Many people, even scientists, (though usually scientists who are not neurologists), think that demyelination effects are only seen in the sensory-motor systems (with the prototypical images of MS patients in wheelchair or with a white cane). However, it is important to recall that cognitive symptoms are also present in MS. In this respect lesions of the corpus callosum and of the prefrontal cortex are of primary concern. In terms of decision making such cognitive impairments may have crucial consequences. Of course remyelination with resident OPCs, i.e., thin myelin and short internode, may restore to some extent the speed of conduction, let’s say from a conduction block (demyelinated) to 45m/s (thin myelin) instead of 50m/s (thick myelin), but considering all our cognitive actions depending on rapid decision, even in our daily life, this may create a severe handicap. Such differences are always difficult to appreciate because interhemispheric lesions are rarely pure and their clinical consequences blurred by intrahemispheric lesions.</p><p>Furthermore, one should not limit one’s vision to general, whole body hypothyroidism. In fact a recent paper in Cell (Finan et al., 2016) showed the possibility of targeted thyroid hormone therapeutic approaches. Even if not immediately applicable, these possibilities have to be born in mind when discussing how our findings can stimulate new research avenues for many forms of neurodegenerative disease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction:</p><p>Is it really possible to identify mobilization of cells from the SEZ into adjacent tissue from MS post-mortem material?

Similarly, Vittorio Gallo has shown in several papers that one can measure differences in gratio depending on the level of myelination in the corpus callosum (see for instance Hammond et al., Neuron. 2014). In our case, in addition to the similar EM evidence, we also provide significant differences in Compound Action Potential measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>The authors should provide more details of how hypothyroidism is induced in the Results text.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested this point has been clarified:</p><p>“Hypothyroidism was induced using MMI (0.1%) and NaClO4 (0.5%) during experimental demyelination induced by oral administration of cuprizone (CPZ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since Olig2 is expressed by all stages of the lineage it is not valid to use it as an OP marker and therefore neither is valid to state that there is a two-fold increase in OPs after 4 weeks of hypothyroidism.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s comment would be relevant if we were considering regions outside the neurogenic niche. However, regarding the SVZ niche, a major site of gliogenesis in the adult brain, Olig2 expression necessarily corresponds to early stages of determination. Moreover, we observed a strong co-expression of Olig2 and Sox10 in progenitors located within the adult SVZ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, differentiation occurs in white matter close to the lateral ventricle, such as the corpus callosum or the striatum.

Sam Ludwin gave 6 weeks for recovery and noted that: ‘The sheaths eventually reach a thickness approximately half that of normal development, with a disturbed relationship between myelin thickness and axon diameter’. So even extending the recovery period to 6 weeks does not allow full remyelination. Thus, showing that significantly greater functional recovery is found after transient hypothyroidism within one week post treatment adds to the clinical relevance of the finding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The report that Olig2+ cells don't express TRb but O4+ cells do is very puzzling because all O4+ cells should also be Olig2+.</p></disp-quote><p>We show in vitro that TRa1 is expressed is some O4+ cells. We did not show in vitro immunohistochemistry against both Olig2 and TRa1. Olig2+ OP in the SVZ in vivo do not express TRa1 but we did not perform this double IHC in vitro. It is true that Olig2 expression persists in immature oligodendrocyte cells and thus we cannot exclude that TRa1 is detected in Olig2 immature oligodendrocytes in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> does not convince – it is very difficult to see co-localisation and the staining pattern for the PDGFRA-GFP is not what one would expect – it looks nuclear – is there an nls in the reporter construct?</p></disp-quote><p>The mice PDGFRa<sup>EGFP</sup> from The Jackson Laboratory express a H2B-eGFP fusion protein from the endogenous <italic>Pdgfra</italic> locus, hence the nuclear localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) One remaining issue, as pointed out by one referee, is whether the observed effects are spatially restricted or without further evidence generalizable to other white matter tracts (&quot;it is likely to be true elsewhere in the brain&quot;).

Please rephrase.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, this point has been clarified:</p><p>“A potential caveat might be that our observation is limited to the corpus callosum and that our findings cannot be extrapolated to other brain or spinal cord regions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Also the claim that scientist would believe 'demyelination is restricted to sensory motor systems' was not approved and should be dropped.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have removed this ambiguous statement: “lesions are not limited to motor control regions”.</p><p>3) One referee writes: &quot;…my point about mobilisation of cells in MS has been misunderstood. I am fully aware of the paper by Nait-Oumesmar and colleagues but my point is that the movement or mobilisation of cells is always an inference when one examines post-mortem MS tissue – it is never definitely proven and so should not be stated as such. It may well be the most likely interpretation but it is only that.&quot; Please adapt the text accordingly.</p><p>The reviewer is right when (s)he asks whether it is possible to identify mobilization of cells from the SVZ into adjacent tissue from MS post-mortem tissues.
