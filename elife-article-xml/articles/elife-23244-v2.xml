Here, we show that a p53-regulated lncRNA which we named <italic>PINCR</italic> (p53-induced noncoding RNA), is induced ~100-fold after DNA damage and exerts a prosurvival function in human colorectal cancer cells (CRC) <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Targeted deletion of <italic>PINCR</italic> in CRC cells significantly impaired G1 arrest and induced hypersensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. <italic>PINCR</italic> regulates the induction of a subset of p53 targets involved in G1 arrest and apoptosis, including <italic>BTG2, RRM2B</italic> and <italic>GPX1</italic>. Using a novel RNA pulldown approach that utilized endogenous S1-tagged <italic>PINCR</italic>, we show that <italic>PINCR</italic> associates with the enhancer region of these genes by binding to RNA-binding protein Matrin 3 that, in turn, associates with p53. Our findings uncover a critical prosurvival function of a p53/<italic>PINCR</italic>/Matrin 3 axis in response to DNA damage in CRC cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23244.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23244.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23244.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Though DNA contains the information needed to build the proteins that keep cells alive, only 2% of the DNA in a human cell codes for proteins. The remaining 98% is referred to as non-coding DNA. The information in some of these non-coding regions can still be copied into molecules of RNA, including long molecules called lncRNAs. Little is known about what lncRNAs actually do, but growing evidence suggests that these molecules are important for a number of vital processes including cell growth and survival.</p><p>When the DNA in an animal cell gets damaged, the cell needs to decide whether to pause growth and repair the damage, or to kill itself if the harm is too great. One of the best-studied proteins guiding this decision is the p53 protein, which increases the number of protein-coding genes needed to carry out either option in this decision. That is to say that, p53 regulates the genes needed to kill the cell and the genes needed to temporarily pause its growth and repair the damage, which instead keeps the cell alive. So, how does the p53 protein guide the decision, and are lncRNA molecules involved?</p><p>Using human colon cancer cells, Chaudhary et al. now report that when DNA is damaged, the levels of a specific lncRNA increase 100-fold. Further experiments showed that this lncRNA ‚Äì named <italic>PINCR</italic>, which refers to <underline>p</underline>53-<underline>i</underline>nduced <underline>n</underline>on<underline>c</underline>oding <underline>R</underline>NA ‚Äì promotes the survival of cells. Chaudhary et al. showed that <italic>PINCR</italic> molecules do this by recruiting a protein called Matrin 3 to a certain region in the DNA called an enhancer and then links it to promoter region in the DNA of specific genes that temporarily pause cell growth but keep the cell alive. This in turn activates these ‚Äòpro-survival genes‚Äô. In further experiments, when the <italic>PINCR</italic> molecules were essentially deleted, p53 was not able to fully activate these genes and as a result more of the cells died.</p><p>Together these findings increase our knowledge of how lncRNAs can work, especially in the context of DNA damage in cancer cells. A next important step will be to uncover other roles for the <italic>PINCR</italic> molecule in both cancer and healthy cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23244.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23244.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>lncRNA</kwd><kwd>Matrin 3</kwd><kwd>RP3-326I13.1</kwd><kwd>PINCR</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH IRP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lal</surname><given-names>Ashish</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional and mechanistic analysis of p53-regulated lncRNA <italic>PINCR</italic> and its interacting RNA-binding protein Matrin 3 uncovers context-dependent regulation of specific p53 target genes during DNA damage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The tumor suppressor p53 functions as a sequence-specific master regulatory transcription factor that controls the expression of hundreds of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vogelstein et al., 2000</xref>) and is mutated at a high frequency in human cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oren, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vogelstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vousden and Lane, 2007</xref>). Although p53 exerts its tumor suppressor effects by regulating a wide variety of cellular processes, it has context-dependent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aylon and Oren, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vousden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zilfou and Lowe, 2009</xref>) that are determined by various factors including cell-type, genetic background of the cell, extracellular environment, and the nature and duration of stress. Depending on the cellular context, p53 can have opposite effects on cell survival, cell migration, differentiation and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aylon and Oren, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kruiswijk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zilfou and Lowe, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with these pleiotropic effects of p53, the expression of genes that have opposing effects on the above-mentioned processes are regulated by p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aylon and Oren, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riley et al., 2008</xref>). For example, in the context of DNA damage, p53 induces the expression of prosurvival genes such as <italic>CDKN1A</italic> (p21), <italic>14-3-3œÉ</italic> and <italic>BTG2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Polyak et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rouault et al., 1996</xref>) that cause cell cycle arrest, as well as proapoptotic genes such as <italic>PUMA, BAX</italic> and <italic>NOXA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riley et al., 2008</xref>) that cause cell death. Interestingly, these prosurvival and proapoptotic genes are all upregulated by p53 in a cell regardless of the effect of p53 on cellular outcome. Therefore, it is important to investigate the function of a p53 target gene in the appropriate cellular context.</p><p>While the protein-coding genes regulated by p53 have been extensively studied and we and others have identified critical roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the p53 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hermeking, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raver-Shapira et al., 2007</xref>), the function of the newly discovered long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in p53 signaling remains largely unknown. LncRNAs are transcripts¬†&gt;¬†200 nucleotides (nt) long that lack a functional open reading frame. Growing evidence suggests critical roles of lncRNAs in multiple cellular processes including differentiation, dosage compensation, genomic stability, metabolism, metastasis and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fatica and Bozzoni, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mueller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Redis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tripathi et al., 2013</xref>). Some p53-regulated lncRNAs including <italic>lincRNA-p21</italic>, <italic>PANDA</italic>, <italic>PINT, LED, NEAT1</italic> and <italic>DINO</italic> have been shown to function as downstream effectors of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adriaens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blume et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dimitrova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huarte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">L√©veill√© et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mar√≠n-B√©jar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmitt et al., 2016</xref>). However, the function and mode of action of most p53-regulated lncRNAs has yet to be elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we focused on a previously uncharacterized lncRNA that we named <italic>PINCR</italic> (<underline>p</underline>53-<underline>i</underline>nduced <underline>n</underline>on<underline>c</underline>oding <underline>R</underline>NA). We show that during DNA damage, <italic>PINCR</italic> has a context-dependent function. RNA pulldowns from cells expressing endogenous <italic>PINCR</italic> fused to an S1-RNA aptamer show that <italic>PINCR</italic> binds to the RNA-binding protein Matrin 3 to regulate the induction of a subset of prosurvival p53 targets by associating with the enhancers of these genes via a Matrin 3-p53 complex. Our results identify <italic>PINCR</italic> as a lncRNA that functions as a context-dependent prosurvival gene in the p53 pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of <italic>PINCR</italic>, a p53-regulated lncRNA</title><p>To identify lncRNAs regulated by p53 in multiple cell lines, we performed microarray analysis (Affymetrix HT2.0) from three colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines (HCT116, RKO and SW48) following activation of p53 with Nutlin-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1‚Äîsource data 1</xref>), a pharmacological inhibitor of MDM2.

The final concentration of DOXO in this and all subsequent experiments was 300 nM, unless stated otherwise. The known p53 target <italic>PUMA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakano and Vousden, 2001</xref>) was used as a positive control. Although <italic>PINCR</italic> was almost undetectable at the basal level, after DNA damage it was significantly induced as early as 8 hr after DOXO treatment and was induced¬†&gt;100 fold after 24 hr, in a p53-dependent manner in both lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>To determine if <italic>PINCR</italic> is a direct target of endogenous p53, we first utilized publicly available p53 ChIP-seq (Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Menendez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nikulenkov et al., 2012</xref>). Upon p53 activation, we observed a single p53 ChIP-seq peak in a region¬†~118 bp upstream of the first exon of <italic>PINCR</italic> in MCF7 (breast cancer) and U2OS (osteosarcoma) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 2B</xref>). We validated this result in HCT116 cells by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We next inserted a¬†~2 kb region of the <italic>PINCR</italic> promoter into a promoterless luciferase reporter vector (pGL3) and co-transfected this construct in HCT116 cells along with a mammalian expression vector (pCB6) or pCB6 overexpressing p53 (pCB6-p53). We found that the <italic>PINCR</italic> promoter drives luciferase expression upon p53 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Deletion of the p53-response element (p53RE) in the <italic>PINCR</italic> promoter resulted in significant decrease in luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>PINCR</italic> is a direct target of p53.</p><p>A detailed subsequent analysis of <italic>PINCR</italic> revealed many features of this lncRNA: (1) <italic>PINCR</italic> is a noncoding RNA because its coding potential was comparable to the noncoding RNA <italic>NEAT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>); (2) <italic>PINCR</italic> is highly enriched in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), similar to the nuclear-retained lncRNA <italic>MALAT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hutchinson et al., 2007</xref>); (3) the 5‚Äôand 3‚Äôends of <italic>PINCR</italic> matched the annotated transcript based on analysis of our RNA-seq data from HCT116 cells (Li et al., unpublished) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 3</xref>); (4) analysis of the length of the <italic>PINCR</italic> transcript by RT-PCR revealed two closely migrating bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 4</xref>) that matched the expected size of the amplicon (~1.8 kb); (5) <italic>PINCR</italic> is expressed at¬†~13‚Äì26 molecules per HCT116 cell after DNA damage and less than one molecule per cell without DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 5A‚ÄìC</xref>) based on comparison of the FPKM of <italic>PINCR</italic> with the lncRNA <italic>NORAD</italic>, known to be expressed at 500‚Äì1000 molecules per HCT116 cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2016</xref>).

Although, reintroduction of <italic>PINCR</italic> in the <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells significantly rescued apoptosis at both 48 and 72 hr after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), we did not observe a rescue of G1 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 3B</xref>). The incomplete rescue may be because unlike endogenous <italic>PINCR</italic> that is induced¬†~100 fold after DOXO-treatment, the extent of exogenous <italic>PINCR</italic> overexpression was¬†~40 fold. Another possibility is that in the rescue experiments, we overexpressed the annotated isoform, whereas we had found that HCT116 cells express at least two isoforms of <italic>PINCR</italic>.</p><p>In response to DOXO treatment, HCT116 cells arrest in G1 but the majority arrest in G2. p53 has been shown to play a critical role in the G1 arrest and in keeping the cells in G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuerbitz et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levine, 1997</xref>). To determine if in addition to its role in G1 arrest, <italic>PINCR</italic> also regulates G2 arrest, we examined the integrity of the nuclear envelope by performing immunostaining for Nucleoporin after treating <italic>PINCR</italic>-WT and <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells with DOXO for 72 hr. We found that the nuclear membrane was intact in both <italic>PINCR</italic>-WT and <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells suggesting that loss of <italic>PINCR</italic> does not result in aberrant entry into mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Immunostaining for cleaved caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, further confirmed increased apoptosis after DNA damage upon loss of <italic>PINCR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 4A</xref>). This hypersensitivity to DNA damage was persistent and also observed in colony formation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 4B</xref>). In this experiment, we did not observe a difference in clonogenicity upon loss of <italic>PINCR</italic> in untreated cells, which is consistent with the unaltered cell cycle profile upon loss of <italic>PINCR</italic> in untreated cells.</p><p>To confirm that <italic>PINCR</italic> is involved in p53-dependent G1 arrest, we performed cell cycle analysis from <italic>PINCR</italic>-WT and <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells after Nutlin-3 treatment. As expected, in both <italic>PINCR</italic>-WT and <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells, Nutlin-3 treatment resulted in dramatic reduction in the population of cells in S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 5</xref>). As compared to <italic>PINCR</italic>-WT cells, we observed reduced G1 population and increased G2/M population in both <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO clones after Nutlin-3 treatment. These data indicate that <italic>PINCR</italic> plays a role in p53-dependent G1 arrest and it has a prosurvival function in response to DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>PINCR</italic> loss results in hypersensitivity to 5-FU and decreased tumor growth</title><p>If the major function of <italic>PINCR</italic> after DNA damage is to arrest cells in G1, the effect of <italic>PINCR</italic> loss should be more pronounced if the DNA damaging agent mainly causes G1 arrest. We therefore examined the effect on G1 arrest and apoptosis 48 hr after treatment of <italic>PINCR</italic>-WT and <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells with three chemotherapeutic drugs: DOXO (300 nM), the radiomimetic NCS (Neocarzinostatin, 400 ng/ml) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU, 100 ¬µM). After confirming the induction of <italic>PINCR</italic> in response to NCS and 5-FU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>), we performed cell cycle analysis. In <italic>PINCR</italic>-WT cells, the percentage of cells arrested in G1 was smallest (11%) for NCS and largest (63%) for 5-FU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Loss of <italic>PINCR</italic> resulted in decreased G1 arrest for NCS, DOXO and 5-FU. However, in <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells, the sub-G1 population was highest (36%) after 5-FU treatment indicating that hypersensitivity of <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells to chemotherapeutic drugs is dependent on G1 arrest. Importantly, this impaired G1 arrest and increased apoptosis after 5-FU treatment upon loss of <italic>PINCR</italic> was observed in both <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>) and was further confirmed by immunoblotting for the apoptosis marker cleaved-PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 3‚Äîsource data 1</xref>).

However, given the well-established role of p21 in controlling G1 arrest after DNA damage, it was important to make sure that loss of <italic>PINCR</italic> did not alter p21 protein levels, p21 subcellular localization and/or Rb-phosphorylation. Indeed, we found similar levels of total, nuclear or cytoplasmic p21 in <italic>PINCR</italic>-WT and <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells under untreated condition and after 5-FU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 2A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 2‚Äîsource data 1</xref>). The decrease in Rb phosphorylation in response to 5-FU treatment was comparable in <italic>PINCR</italic>-WT and <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 2‚Äîsource data 1</xref>). These results indicate that p21 expression is not altered upon loss of <italic>PINCR</italic> and it can therefore be used as a negative control.</p><p>We next asked the question if depletion of the <italic>PINCR</italic> targets <italic>BTG2</italic>, <italic>GPX1</italic> and <italic>RRM2B</italic> recapitulated the effects of <italic>PINCR</italic> depletion. We validated significant knockdown of these genes by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 3A</xref>) and found significantly increased apoptosis (sub-G1 cells) upon knockdown of each of these genes followed by 5-FU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 3B‚Äì3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 4</xref>). Significant reduction in G1 arrest after 5-FU treatment was observed after knockdown of <italic>GPX1</italic> but not <italic>BTG2</italic> or <italic>RRM2B</italic>. These data indicate that depletion of <italic>BTG2</italic>, <italic>GPX1</italic> or <italic>RRM2B</italic> recapitulates the effects of <italic>PINCR</italic> depletion in response to 5-FU treatment.</p><p>Consistent with our microarray data, we observed impaired induction of <italic>BTG2</italic>, <italic>GPX1</italic> and <italic>RRM2B</italic> mRNAs upon loss of <italic>PINCR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, by p53 ChIP-qPCR, we observed substantial decrease in the binding of p53 to the p53RE of <italic>BTG2, GPX1</italic> and <italic>RRM2B</italic> upon loss of <italic>PINCR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). There is evidence in the literature that p53 can directly bind to RNA including a recent report showing direct binding of p53 to the p53-regulated lncRNA <italic>DINO</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Riley and Maher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmitt et al., 2016</xref>). However, we found that <italic>PINCR</italic> does not directly bind to p53 (data not shown).</p><p>To make sure that the altered induction of <italic>BTG2</italic>, <italic>GPX1</italic> and <italic>RRM2B</italic> reflect a function of the <italic>PINCR</italic> transcript itself, we measured the induction of these genes after <italic>PINCR</italic> knockdown using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). We tested 5 ASOs that potentially target <italic>PINCR</italic> RNA (data not shown). Robust knockdown of <italic>PINCR</italic> in HCT116 cells was observed with one ASO that we designated as <italic>PINCR</italic>-ASO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Importantly, as observed with <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells, knockdown of <italic>PINCR</italic> followed by 5-FU treatment resulted in decreased induction of <italic>BTG2</italic>, <italic>GPX1</italic> and <italic>RRM2B</italic> but not <italic>p21</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and caused decreased G1 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and increased apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) after 5-FU or DOXO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 5</xref>). In clonogenic survival assays, knockdown of <italic>PINCR</italic> resulted in reduced colony formation after 5-FU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 6A</xref>). Surprisingly, unlike <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells that did not show significant difference in proliferation from <italic>PINCR</italic>-WT cells in untreated condition, decreased colony formation in untreated condition was observed after <italic>PINCR</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 6B</xref>). Although this result indicates that basal <italic>PINCR</italic> levels can regulate proliferation despite low expression, this growth defect may be restored long-term during genetic deletion of <italic>PINCR</italic> using CRISPR/Cas9. Taken together, the results from <italic>PINCR</italic> knockdown experiments corroborates our findings from the <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO clones.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>RNA pulldowns and mass spectrometry identifies Matrin 3 as a <italic>PINCR</italic>-interacting protein that mediates the effect of <italic>PINCR</italic></title><p>Because we found that <italic>PINCR</italic> does not bind to p53, we hypothesized that <italic>PINCR</italic> binds to an RNA-binding protein that serves as an adaptor protein and mediates this effect of <italic>PINCR</italic>.

Given the evidence that Matrin 3 associates with enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skowronska-Krawczyk et al., 2005</xref>), we reasoned that Matrin 3 modulates the induction of these genes by binding to their enhancer regions. More recently, it has been shown that proper enhancer-gene pairing is enabled by insulated neighborhoods formed by CTCF anchoring at domain boundaries and cohesion looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hnisz et al., 2016</xref>) and are mostly conserved across cell types. To test this possibility, we identified insulated neighborhoods around <italic>PINCR</italic> targets, ChIP-seq data tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>) in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>) for (1) CTCF, a protein known to bind to chromatin domain boundaries, (2) the chromatin loop-enabling cohesion component RAD21, (3) promoter associated histone mark H3K4me3 and (4) active promoter/enhancer associated mark H3K27ac. To determine the overlap of these peaks with p53, we utilized p53 ChIP-seq data from MCF7 and U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, to determine potential chromatin looping near these <italic>PINCR</italic> targets, we utilized Hi-C data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>). For each of the three <italic>PINCR</italic> targets, the Hi-C data indicated chromatin looping with appropriate CTCF and cohesion signal consistent with insulated domain structure. Within the loop, we observed the following: (1) a strong p53 ChIP-seq peak corresponding to the p53RE in the promoter of these genes that was also marked by strong signal for H3K4me3 and H3K27ac; (2) a weak p53 ChIP-seq peak that was also marked by strong signal for H3K27ac and weak signal H3K4me3. Promoters are marked by high H3K4me3 and high H3K27ac whereas enhancers typically have low H3K4me3 and high H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ernst et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, our Hi-C and ChIP-seq data analysis indicates potential chromatin looping between a weak p53 binding region in the enhancer and strong p53 binding region in the promoter of the <italic>PINCR</italic> targets <italic>BTG2</italic>, <italic>GPX1</italic> and <italic>RRM2B</italic>. Notably, whereas the strong ChIP-seq peak at the promoters of these three genes had a canonical p53RE, the weak p53 binding region in their enhancers did not have a canonical p53RE indicating indirect association of p53 at these enhancers.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23244.051</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title><italic>PINCR</italic> modulates the association of Matrin 3 with enhancers of <italic>PINCR</italic> targets within insulated neighborhoods.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Topological domain and looping structure indicated by 3D contact domain profile (top) surrounding <italic>BTG2</italic> gene and Hi-C data from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rao et al., 2014</xref>).

To determine if <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> associates with the p53RE of <italic>BTG2</italic>, <italic>GPX1</italic> and <italic>RRM2B</italic>, we performed streptavidin pulldowns from formaldehyde-crosslinked parental HCT116 cells (negative control) and the <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> cells after 5-FU treatment. We found that the p53RE of each of these three genes but not the <italic>p21</italic> p53RE, was specifically enriched in the <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> pulldowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Finally, we examined the association of <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> with the p53RE and enhancer regions of <italic>PINCR</italic> targets in the presence and absence of p53 or Matrin 3. To do this, we knocked down p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8‚Äîfigure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13-data">Figure 8‚Äîfigure supplement 5‚Äîsource data 1</xref>) or Matrin 3 with siRNAs and performed streptavidin pulldowns. As compared to the p53RE in the <italic>PINCR</italic> promoters, in CTL siRNA transfected cells treated with 5-FU, we found stronger association of <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> with the enhancers of the <italic>PINCR</italic> targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Silencing Matrin 3 or p53 resulted in dramatic reduction of association of <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> with these enhancers and p53REs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Because p53 is important for <italic>PINCR</italic> expression, it is likely that the reduced association of <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> to these regions after p53 knockdown is due to lack of expression. On the other hand, the observed loss in association of <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> to the enhancers and promoters upon knockdown of Matrin 3 indicates that Matrin 3 recruits <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> to these regions. Taken together, these results suggest that a p53-Matrin 3-<italic>PINCR</italic> complex associates with the p53RE and enhancers of <italic>BTG2</italic>, <italic>GPX1</italic> and <italic>RRM2B</italic> and plays a critical role in modulating the induction of these genes after DNA damage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we report the first functional characterization of <italic>PINCR</italic>, an intergenic nuclear lncRNA, strongly induced by p53 after DNA damage. Several p53-regulated lncRNAs have been recently identified and shown to play important roles in the p53 network. However, <italic>PINCR</italic> is unique from these recently characterized p53-regulated lncRNAs. Firstly, following p53 activation, the p53-regulated lncRNAs <italic>LED</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">L√©veill√© et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Linc-475</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Melo et al., 2016</xref>) regulate G1 arrest and prevent entry of cells into mitosis. However, <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells show a defect in G1 arrest but the cells arrest in the G2 phase after DNA damage. Secondly, the p53-regulated lncRNAs <italic>lincRNA-p21</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dimitrova et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>LED</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">L√©veill√© et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Linc-475</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Melo et al., 2016</xref>) regulate the levels of <italic>p21</italic>. In addition, in a recent study, the p53-induced lncRNA <italic>DINO</italic>, was shown to directly bind to and regulate p53 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmitt et al., 2016</xref>). However, <italic>PINCR</italic> does not alter p53 or p21 levels but instead regulates the expression of the p53 targets <italic>BTG2, GPX1</italic> and <italic>RRM2B</italic> that also regulate G1 arrest after DNA damage.</p><p>Our study together with other recent studies shows that specific RNA-binding proteins and transcription factors play an important role in mediating the effects of a lncRNA. For example, in the context of p53 activation, <italic>lincRNA-p21</italic> interacts with hnRNP-K and functions as a coactivator for p53-dependent p21 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dimitrova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huarte et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>PANDA</italic>, another p53-regulated lncRNA upstream of <italic>p21</italic>, associates with the transcription factor NF-YA to regulate the expression of pro-apoptotic genes during genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hung et al., 2011</xref>). The data presented here indicates that <italic>PINCR</italic> and Matrin 3 act as coactivators of p53 on a subset of p53 targets. It is known that Matrin 3 interacts with enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Romig et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Skowronska-Krawczyk et al., 2014</xref>), and our data shows that the induction of these genes may be mediated by chromatin looping between Matrin 3 bound to the enhancer regions of these genes and p53 bound to the p53RE in their promoters. <italic>PINCR</italic> recruits Matrin 3 to enhancers of <italic>PINCR</italic>-dependent p53 target genes. Future studies on the identification of genome-wide-binding sites of Matrin 3 and p53 and epigenetic marks in <italic>PINCR</italic>-WT and <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells in the absence or presence of DNA damage will be important. Interestingly, similar intrachromosomal interactions containing enhancer activity have been reported recently and shown to express enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) that are required for efficient transcriptional enhancement of interacting target genes and induction of a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">L√©veill√© et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Melo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The development of new approaches to identify targets of endogenous lncRNAs is an active area of investigation and remains a major challenge in the lncRNA field. We developed a new approach in which we knocked-in an S1 tag at the 3'end of <italic>PINCR</italic> using CRISPR/Cas9 and determined the association of <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> with the p53RE of specific p53 targets by qPCR following streptavidin pulldowns from crosslinked cells. Our results show a Matrin-3-dependent association of <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> with the enhancer region of <italic>BTG2</italic>, <italic>RRM2B</italic> and <italic>GPX1</italic> and indicate a direct and specific role of <italic>PINCR</italic> in regulating these genes in response to DNA damage. Given the strong interaction between the S1 tag and streptavidin and studies utilizing transfected S1-tagged RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vasudevan and Steitz, 2007</xref>) or in vitro transcribed S1-tagged RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iioka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Srisawat and Engelke, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2002</xref>) for the identification of interacting RNA-binding proteins or miRNAs, this method has the potential to identify the genome-wide targets of <italic>PINCR</italic> and other lncRNAs.</p><p>In summary, our study suggests that <italic>PINCR</italic> is an important modulator of gene expression in the p53 pathway that regulates the induction of a subset of p53 targets and this effect is mediated in part via its interaction with Matrin 3. Future investigations on <italic>PINCR</italic> in normal cells and in an expanded panel of cell lines will enhance our understanding of its role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, treatments and siRNA transfections</title><p>The colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116 (ATCC Number: CCL-247), SW48 (ATCC Number: CCL-231) and RKO (ATCC Number: CRL-2577) and HEK293T (ATCC Number: CRL-11268) cells were purchased from ATCC.

Chromatin folding was inferred from 3D contact matrices calculated from in situ HiC data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rao et al., 2014</xref>) and visualized using the Juicebox desktop application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durand et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Tom Misteli, Glenn Merlino, Susan Gottesman, Shiv Grewal, Curtis Harris and Javed Khan for their critical comments on the manuscript and Bert Vogelstein for the isogenic cell lines.

Your work is being evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>We are in the process of discussing the reviews. Before advising further and reaching a decision, we would like to hear your response to the following concerns, along with an estimated time frame for completing any additional work (please see the reviews below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a tantalizing paper reporting the existence of p53-inducible lncRNA, dubbed PINCR, that is supposed to act as a gene-specific cofactor for induction of select p53 target genes, such as BTG2, GPX1 and RRM2B, but not the potent CDK inhibitor p21. In the absence of PINCR, the authors observe and impairment in G1 arrest upon p53 activation with genotoxic agents, concurrently with increased apoptosis. Mechanistically, PINCR is required for binding of p53 to the enhancers of some of the genes it regulates (e.g. BTG2, RRM2B, GPX1). However, PINCR does not bind to p53 directly, but binds instead to the RNA-binding protein Matrin-3. In turn, Matrin-3 is required for p53 transactivation of the genes that require PINCR. In sum, the authors conclude that the PINCR-Matrin complex is a gene-specific cofactor of p53, required for p53 binding to select enhancers.</p><p>Overall, the paper is tantalizing and interesting, but there are many unresolved aspects that prevent its publication in its current form. There are several areas where more clarity is needed about the observations made, as some of them contradict well known facts in the p53 field.</p><p>The major concerns are:</p><p>1) A p21-independent role of PINCR in p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. The authors show that PINCR is required for p53-dependent G1 arrest in response to doxorubicin, neocarcinostatin and 5FU. The authors also show that PINCR does not affect p21 expression or binding of p53 to the p21 enhancer. This is highly paradoxical, because p21 is required for G1 arrest in response to the three p53-activating agents mentioned above. The results counter this well-established and reproducible observation, and suggest that p21 cannot enforce G1 arrest without transactivation of other p53 targets, such as BTG2, RRM2B and GPX1. If this is the case, it should be demonstrated thoroughly. Can depletion of BTG2 and/or RRM2B and/or GPX1 recapitulate the effects of PINCR depletion? Is it true that these genes are required for p21-dependent cell cycle arrest? This could be answered with siRNA knockdowns. Is it true that p21 is unable to block CDKs, prevent RB phosphorylation and stall the cell cycle in the absence of PINCR? This should be explored in detail by looking a p21 localization, Rb phosphorylation and other markers of p21 action and G1-S progression.</p><p>2) A gene-specific role for PINCR and Matrin. A key observation in this paper is that PINCR and Matrin are required for p53 transactivation at selective loci, and this is explained by a requirement of PINCR for p53 binding to the respective enhancers at those genes. The notion of a RNA (or a RNA binding protein) being required for p53 binding to some DNA elements but not others is very provocative and requires further investigation. Biochemically speaking, p53 is a potent DNA-binding protein that works as a tetramer to bind a 4-repeat DNA sequence (a 20 mer consensus made of two half sites with two palindromic repeats per half site). How is this activity modified by RNA and/or a RNA-binding protein at some DNA elements but not others? This is very tantalizing and hard to comprehend. In vitro protein-DNA binding experiments should be performed to investigate this. The genome-wide requirement for PINCR and Matrin should be defined. Is it true that only 11 p53 targets require PINCR? If so, is it true that PINCR regulates p53 binding at only those 11 loci? Is it true that PINCR binds only to those p53 target loci? What about Matrin? What is Matrin's binding pattern relative to p53 target genes, those sensitive and insensitive to PINCR?</p><p>These questions should be answered with careful ChIP-seq experiments for p53, PINCR-S1 and Matrin, and a detailed investigation of this 'gene-specific effects'. This is important, because the latest and most comprehensive investigations of p53 functionality at enhancers indicate that p53 does not employ cofactors to recognize and activate transcription from ~1000 enhancers in a wide variety of contexts (see for example Verfaillie et al., Genome Research 2016). This notion is further supported by earlier work demonstrating that p53 can recognize its p53REs in nucleosomal context, often leading to nucleosome displacement.</p><p>3) DNA- versus RNA-dependent effects of PINCR. The authors conclude that PINCR acts by a RNA-dependent mechanism. However, this is based mostly on an unsatisfactory rescue overexpression experiment in PINCR knockout cells. This is important, because the field has been profoundly misled by earlier reports of another p53-inducible lncRNA, lincRNA-p21, which was first described to be acting by an RNA-dependent mechanism, yet now is ample clear that the lincRNA-p21 locus acts by a DNA-dependent, enhancer-like mechanism (see latest work from John Rinn's team in Cell Reports, backtracking on his original Cell paper by Huarte et al). To clarify this for PINCR, the authors should elaborate more on their knockout. What exact region of the genome did they delete when they deleted the 'entire PINCR region'? Did they delete the proximal p53 binding site as well? If they preserved the p53 enhancer, they should demonstrate that p53 binding to that region is intact by ChIP.</p><p>Other concerns:</p><p>1) Repeats and error bars in 2B.</p><p>2) Is PINCR upregulated in published GRO-seq data in HCT116 cells? It is unclear which ncRNA in Allen et al. the authors refer too. Is it refereed by a different name in Allen et al? A genome viewer screenshot will go a long way to show that PINCR is truly a direct p53 target is truly direct.</p><p>3) Raw cell cycle profiles for 3B-C.</p><p>4) To confirm that PINCR is involved in p53-dependent G1 arrest, they should repeat the experiments they did with genotoxic agents using Nutlin instead.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript by Chaudhary et al. describes the characterization and functional analysis of a new p53-induced lncRNA, designated PINCR. The authors demonstrated that PINCR is a direct p53 target gene that is necessary for the induction of a subset of p53 targets involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Evidence is presented supporting a model in which a PINCR-Matrin 3 complex facilitates p53 association with select promoters. The identification of a lncRNA that is essential for transactivation of specific p53 targets and, as a result, whose loss impairs the p53 pathway is a significant finding and, in principle, appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are several aspects of the work that are incomplete and require further experimentation to convincingly support the conclusions put forward.</p><p>1) Since this is the first functional analysis of PINCR, additional basic characterization of the lncRNA is important. The authors should confirm the 5'/3' ends and splicing of the transcript by RACE and RT-PCR. The copy number of the expressed transcript should be determined (e.g. +/- Nutlin, DOXO, and/or 5-FU). A northern blot would be helpful if possible to confirm the existence of a discrete transcript at the expected size. The conservation pattern of the transcript and p53 response element should be commented upon.</p><p>2) The use of genome editing to stably delete PINCR is a good approach to establish a robust system for functional studies. However, the authors chose to delete a ~50 kb segment to remove the lncRNA which raises concerns regarding whether other important sequences were removed in addition to the 2.2 kb spliced PINCR sequence. I appreciate the authors' attempts to mitigate these concerns by performing a rescue experiment but the analysis of rescued cells does not go nearly far enough. Cell cycle analysis of rescued cells should be shown in addition to the provided analysis of cell survival after DOXO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The clonogenic survival assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) should also be performed on rescued cells. Likewise, cell cycle, cell survival, and clonogenic survival of rescued cells after 5-FU treatment should be added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-F</xref>.</p><p>Any concerns about the genome editing approach could be fully mitigated if the authors employed an orthogonal method to inhibit PINCR such as siRNA knockdown or CRISPRi, followed by analysis of cell cycle, survival, clonogenic growth, and target gene induction (e.g. BTG2, GPX1, RRM2B).</p><p>3) While p53-mediated PINCR induction was demonstrated in multiple cell lines, all functional analyses are limited to HCT116. PINCR should be knocked out or inhibited in a second cell line to confirm that the phenotypic effects observed are not unique to HCT116.</p><p>4) Knockdown of Matrin 3 partially phenocopies PINCR knockout with respect to cell survival after 5-FU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). As this is a very important prediction of their model, the analysis of Matrin 3 knockdown should be extended. First, at least 2 independent siRNAs should be tested to avoid off-target effects (this is especially important when monitoring general cellular phenotypes such as survival). Furthermore, the cell cycle should be examined after knockdown of Matrin 3 and 5-FU treatment and both cell cycle and apoptosis should be examined after DOXO treatment.</p><p>5) What happens to the Matrin-p53 interaction in PINCR KO cells? Co-IP assays (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-B</xref>) should be performed in these cells. Likewise, does PINCR associate with p53 response elements in the absence of Matrin and/or p53? The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref> should be repeated after Matrin and p53 knockdown.</p><p>6) While the observation that p53-mediated induction of BTG2, GPX1, and RRM2B is attenuated in PINCR KO cells and after Matrin 3 knockdown is interesting, there is no evidence that these changes in gene expression are responsible for the impaired p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PINCR KO cells. Does knockdown of any of these targets phenocopy PINCR KO? Does overexpression of any of these genes rescue PINCR KO?</p><p>7) The p53-RE luciferase assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> would be much more convincing if a reporter with mutations in the p53-RE were tested in parallel as a negative control.</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7‚Äîfigure supplement 1C</xref>, it appears that the polyadenylation signal was removed when the S1 tag was inserted (at the end of the red sequence). Does this affect the level of PINCR expression? Although the authors show PINCR-S1 induction after DOXO treatment, PINCR-S1 levels should be directly compared to endogenous PINCR.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this original study, the authors identify the lincRNA PINCR as a new direct transcriptional target of p53. They further show that PINCR is required for p53-mediated G1 arrest, owing to the contribution of PINCR to the induction of a specific subset of p53 target genes in response to DNA damage. Importantly, they identify an interaction between PINCR and the RNA binding protein matrin 3, which is required for the induction of this subset of genes, and show nicely that PINCR binds directly to the p53 response elements (p53 RE's) of those genes.</p><p>Overall, this is a very interesting and well performed study. Publication in <italic>eLife</italic> is recommended if the authors can address, in a satisfactory manner, several important issues as listed below.</p><p>1).<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. In view of the suggested biology of PINCR, one might expect it to be selectively LESS induced under conditions that favor p53-dependent cell death. What happens, for example, upon treatment of HCT116 cells with high dose 5-FU? As a matter of fact, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and its supplemental already point in this direction: 5-FU, at the concentration used by the authors, induces more apoptosis (11%) than the other treatments, while causing a relatively modest increase in PINCR. Thus, the relative extent of endogenous PINCR induction might be a determinant of the likelihood of the cells to die rather than arrest. I suggest that the authors address this possibility more closely, e.g. by employing several different concentrations of 5-FU and comparing the extent of PINCR induction, induction of a typical pro-apoptotic p53 target gene (e.g. PUMA or CD95), and the accrual of sub-G1 cells.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>. The in vivo result is impressive. However, it does not necessarily support a pro-survival function of PINCR as concluded in the subsection ‚ÄúPINCR loss results in hypersensitivity to 5-FU and decreased tumor growth‚Äù: the authors did not address survival/death at all in this experiment. It will be important to perform histopathological examination of the tumors, and show (by cleaved caspase 3 or TUNEL) that the PINCR KO tumors indeed manifest a greater extent of apoptosis.</p><p>3) I could not find any ChIP experiment showing that matrin 3 is required for optimal binding of p53 to the p53RE's of BTG2 etc. Did I miss it? This is an important experiment, as the authors attribute the reduced expression of those genes to reduced recruitment of p53 to their p53RE's.</p><p>4) Why does PINCR bind only to a subset of p53RE's? Is there significant homology between the sequence of PINCR and that of the DNA in the vicinity of those p53RE's, but not the p21 p53RE for example?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-E</xref>: How does PINCR overexpression affect the cell cycle profile and the expression of the specific subset of G1-related genes without and with DNA damage?

All 3 reviewers found our paper interesting. We believe that we can address all of the major concerns of reviewers 2 and 3. Reviewer 1 has made some excellent suggestions and we can carefully address most of his/her concerns. However, to be realistic and to carefully conduct the ChIP-seq experiments (suggested by Reviewer 1) on Matrin 3 and PINCR-S1, it may take several months; thus, these experiments are beyond the scope of this study. As an alternative approach, we have proposed a series of experiments that will prove our model according to which <italic>PINCR</italic> regulates a subset of p53 targets by binding to Matrin 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>This is a tantalizing paper reporting the existence of p53-inducible lncRNA, dubbed PINCR, that is supposed to act as a gene-specific cofactor for induction of select p53 target genes, such as BTG2, GPX1 and RRM2B, but not the potent CDK inhibitor p21. In the absence of PINCR, the authors observe and impairment in G1 arrest upon p53 activation with genotoxic agents, concurrently with increased apoptosis. Mechanistically, PINCR is required for binding of p53 to the enhancers of some of the genes it regulates (e.g. BTG2, RRM2B, GPX1).</italic></p><p>We would like to clarify that in our paper, we showed that PINCR is required for binding of p53 to the p53RE in the promoters of these genes (Line 256). Regulation of binding of p53 to the enhancers of these genes via Matrin 3 and PINCR may be one mechanism by which PINCR acts, a point that we had mentioned in the Discussion but if we are given an opportunity to revise this paper, we will test this as mentioned (please see: response # 5 to reviewer #1).</p><p><italic>However, PINCR does not bind to p53 directly, but binds instead to the RNA-binding protein Matrin-3. In turn, Matrin-3 is required for p53 transactivation of the genes that require PINCR. In sum, the authors conclude that the PINCR-Matrin complex is a gene-specific cofactor of p53, required for p53 binding to select enhancers.</italic></p><p><italic>Overall, the paper is tantalizing and interesting, but there are many unresolved aspects that prevent its publication in its current form. There are several areas where more clarity is needed about the observations made, as some of them contradict well know facts in the p53 field.</italic></p><p>We thank this reviewer for appreciating our findings and the constructive comments. Below is our response and plans to address the unresolved issues.</p><p><italic>The major concerns are:</italic></p><p><italic>1) A p21-independent role of PINCR in p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. The authors show that PINCR is required for p53-dependent G1 arrest in response to doxorubicin, neocarcinostatin and 5FU. The authors also show that PINCR does not affect p21 expression or binding of p53 to the p21 enhancer. This is highly paradoxical, because p21 is required for G1 arrest in response to the three p53-activating agents mentioned above. The results counter this well-established and reproducible observation, and suggest that p21 can not enforce G1 arrest without transactivation of other p53 targets, such as BTG2, RRM2B and GPX1. If this is the case, it should be demonstrated thoroughly. Can depletion of BTG2 and/or RRM2B and/or GPX1 recapitulate the effects of PINCR depletion? Is it true that these genes are required for p21-dependent cell cycle arrest? This could be answered with siRNA knockdowns. Is it true that p21 is unable to block CDKs, prevent RB phosphorylation and stall the cell cycle in the absence of PINCR? This should be explored in detail by looking a p21 localization, Rb phosphorylation and other markers of p21 action and G1-S progression.</italic></p><p>This is an excellent point. As the reviewer pointed out, p21 plays an important role in mediating the effects of p53 when it comes to G1 arrest after DNA damage. According to some papers, in the absence of p21, there is no G1 arrest after DNA damage (Waldman et al., Cancer Res, 1995). However, according to other papers (also cited in the Waldman et al. paper), p21 is not the only player (Deng et al., Cell, 1995). In addition, there are other papers in support of both models. Our data shows that the% of cells arrested in G1 after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) is 28-35% in PINCR-WT clones and 10-15% in PINCR-KO clones. However, we found no difference in p21 mRNA induction upon loss of PINCR.</p><p>This was an unexpected result and indicates, as pointed out by the reviewer, that p21 cannot enforce G1 arrest if BTG2, RRM2B and GPX1 are not induced. Although this may seem paradoxical, it may be a truly novel finding ‚Äì p21 may need these 3 genes to enforce G1 arrest. As suggested by the reviewer, we will test the roles of these genes in p21-dependent G1 arrest by siRNA knockdown of p21, and these 3 genes. This experiment will give us a sense of the contribution of each of these genes to the G1 arrest and their significance to p21 biology. In addition, as suggested, we will look at p21 localization because as mentioned by the reviewer, it may be the case that loss of PINCR alters p21 localization leading to altered Rb phosphorylation. In addition, we will look at other markers of p21 action and G1/S progression, as suggested by this reviewer.</p><p>These are straightforward experiments that can be addressed in a timely manner and the results will be instrumental in determining the role of these 3 PINCR targets in G1 arrest after DNA damage and their role in in p53 and p21 biology.</p><p><italic>2) A gene-specific role for PINCR and Matrin. A key observation in this paper is that PINCR and Matrin are required for p53 transactivation at selective loci, and this is explained by a requirement of PINCR for p53 binding to the respective enhancers at those genes. The notion of a RNA (or a RNA binding protein) being required for p53 binding to some DNA elements but not others is very provocative and requires further investigation. Biochemically speaking, p53 is a potent DNA-binding protein that works as a tetramer to bind a 4-repeat DNA sequence (a 20 mer consensus made of two half sites with two palindromic repeats per half site). How is this activity modified by RNA and/or a RNA-binding protein at some DNA elements but not others? This is very tantalizing and hard to comprehend. In vitro protein-DNA binding experiments should be performed to investigate this. The genome-wide requirement for PINCR and Matrin should be defined. Is it true that only 11 p53 targets require PINCR?</italic></p><p>Our data indicates that PINCR regulates only 11 p53 targets. This result is consistent with our additional data (to be added to the revised paper) that PINCR is expressed at 19-38 copies per HCT116 cell after DNA damage. A lncRNA expressed at 19-38 copies per cell is likely not to regulate all p53 targets, until it regulates p53 itself, which is not the case.</p><p><italic>If so, is it true that PINCR regulates p53 binding at only those 11 loci? Is it true that PINCR binds only to those p53 target loci? What about Matrin? What is Matrin's binding pattern relative to p53 target genes, those sensitive and insensitive to PINCR?</italic></p><p>Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7‚Äîfigure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>)) shows that Matrin 3 and PINCR associate specifically with the p53RE of BTG2, RRM2B and GPX1 but not the p53RE of p21. We can extend this analysis to the remaining 8 out of 11 p53 targets. The results will further establish the role of PINCR and Matrin 3 in regulation of this subset of p53 targets. In addition, the proposed PINCR-S1 pulldown experiments after knockdown of p53 or Matrin 3 (please see: response # 10 to reviewer # 2) will support these conclusions.</p><p><italic>These question should be answered with careful ChIP-seq experiments for p53, PINCR-S1 and Matrin, and a detailed investigation of this 'gene-specific effects'. This is important, because the latest and most comprehensive investigations of p53 functionality at enhancers indicate that p53 does not employ cofactors to recognize and activate transcription from ~1000 enhancers in a wide variety of contexts (see for example Verfaillie et al., Genome Research 2016). This notion is further supported by earlier work demonstrating that p53 can recognize its p53REs in nucleosomal context, often leading to nucleosome displacement.</italic></p><p>The reviewer‚Äôs suggestion of conducting ChIP-seq experiments for p53, PINCR- S1 and Matrin 3 will allow detailed gene-specific effects of PINCR and Matrin 3. We can do the p53 ChIP-seq from PINCR-WT and PINCR-KO cells ¬± 5-FU. The results will further support our model of gene-specific regulation by PINCR.</p><p>The suggestion to do ChIP-seq for Matrin 3 and PINCR-S1 is great. However, unlike p53 ChIP-seq, the conditions for Matrin 3 ChIP-seq will need to be optimized. Moreover, to make sure that the ChIP-seq peaks are bona fide Matrin 3 associated sites, the experiments will also have to be done from Matrin 3 knockdown and/or Matrin 3 knockout cells. Likewise, the PINCR-S1 ChIP-seq will require optimization and scaling up because even for the very abundant lncRNAs such as MALAT1, NEAT1 and HOTAIR, endogenous lncRNA pulldown methods such as ChIRP, RAP and CHART require 50-100 million cells. Thus, it will take several months to get high confidence Matrin 3 and PINCR-S1 ChIP-seq data, if done carefully. These experiments are therefore beyond the scope of this study but we plan to follow-up on this.</p><p><italic>How is this activity modified by RNA and/or a RNA-binding protein at some DNA elements but not others?</italic> </p><p>This is an intriguing question. A likely scenario is that Matrin 3 binds to enhancer regions of these genes and regulates p53 occupancy of their promoter (see Discussion,). To address this question, we hypothesize that Matrin 3 and PINCR associate with the enhancer regions upstream of BTG2, RRM2B and GPX1. We have looked at potential p53 binding sites in the enhancer regions for these genes (and negative controls such as p21) and will examine the association of p53, Matrin 3, PINCR-S1 and epigenetic marks in these regions in PINCR-WT and PINCR-KO cells by ChIP-qPCR.</p><p><italic>3) DNA- versus RNA-dependent effects of PINCR. The authors conclude that PINCR acts by a RNA-dependent mechanism. However, this is based mostly on an unsatisfactory rescue overexpression experiment in PINCR knockout cells. This is important, because the field has been profoundly misled by earlier reports of another p53-inducible lncRNA, lincRNA-p21, which was first described to be acting by an RNA-dependent mechanism, yet now is ample clear that the lincRNA-p21 locus acts by a DNA-dependent, enhancer-like mechanism (see latest work from John Rinn's team in Cell Reports, backtracking on his original Cell paper by Huarte et al). To clarify this for PINCR, the authors should elaborate more on their knockout. What exact region of the genome did they delete when they deleted the 'entire PINCR region'? Did they delete the proximal p53 binding site as well? If they preserved the p53 enhancer, they should demonstrate that p53 binding to that region is intact by ChIP.</italic></p><p>We used 2 gRNAs that were designed upstream of the first and downstream of the last exon on PINCR, respectively. Based on Sanger sequencing data, we found that out of the 2 PINCR-KO clones used in our study, one clone has intact p53RE whereas the other clone has partially intact p53RE. We can provide the DNA sequence showing the exact region of the genome that was deleted. As suggested, we can check the binding of p53 to the p53RE of PINCR in both PINCR-KO clones. We would like to mention that unlike lincRNA-p21 that is encoded upstream of p21, PINCR is expressed from an intergenic region from the X-chromosome and none of the 11 p53 PINCR-regulated genes are on the X-chromosome. Therefore, unlike lincRNA-p21, PINCR is a trans-acting lncRNA.</p><p>Other concerns:</p><p>1) Repeats and error bars in 2B.</p><p>We will repeat this experiment to generate error bars.</p><p><italic>2) Is PINCR upregulated in published GRO-seq data in HCT116 cells? It is unclear which ncRNA in Allen et al. the authors refer too. Is it refereed by a different name in Allen et al? A genome viewer screenshot will go a long way to show that PINCR is truly a direct p53 targetis truly direct.</italic> </p><p>The reference Allen et al. was cited to determine how many of the protein-coding genes in our lncRNA array data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) were also identified in the p53 GRO-seq paper. Genome viewer screenshot of p53 ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the sequence of the p53RE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>) and the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-E</xref> indicate that PINCR is a direct target of p53. In addition, as suggested by reviewer # 3 (please see: response # 3 to reviewer # 3), we will mutate the p53RE in the PINCR promoter that was inserted upstream of luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and perform luciferase assays.</p><p><italic>3) Raw cell cycle profiles for 3B-C.</italic> </p><p>We will add these profiles to supplemental material.</p><p><italic>4) To confirm that PINCR is involved in p53-dependent G1 arrest, they should repeat the experiments they did with genotoxic agents using Nutlin instead.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we will do this experiment to further support the role of PINCR in p53-dependent G1 arrest.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>This manuscript by Chaudhary et al. describes the characterization and functional analysis of a new p53- induced lncRNA, designated PINCR. The authors demonstrated that PINCR is a direct p53 target gene that is necessary for the induction of a subset of p53 targets involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Evidence is presented supporting a model in which a PINCR-Matrin 3 complex facilitates p53 association with select promoters. The identification of a lncRNA that is essential for transactivation of specific p53 targets and, as a result, whose loss impairs the p53 pathway is a significant finding and, in principle, appropriate for publication in eLife. However, there are several aspects of the work that are incomplete and require further experimentation to convincingly support the conclusions put forward.</italic></p><p>We thank this reviewer for appreciating our findings and the constructive comments. Below is our response and plans to address his/her comments.</p><p><italic>1) Since this is the first functional analysis of PINCR, additional basic characterization of the lncRNA is important. The authors should confirm the 5'/3' ends and splicing of the transcript by RACE and RT-PCR.</italic></p><p>This is a very important point. We have done RNA-seq data from HCT116, RKO and SW48 p53+/+ and p53-/- cells (Li et al., unpublished). This data can be used to show the 5‚Äô and 3‚Äôends of this transcript. The RNA-seq data matches the annotated 5‚Äô and 3‚Äôends of PINCR. This can be further supported by RT-PCR. If the reviewer wants, we can also do 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô RACE.</p><p><italic>The copy number of the expressed transcript should be determined (e.g. +/- Nutlin, DOXO, and/or 5-FU).</italic> </p><p>We have found that after DNA damage with DOXO, PINCR is expressed at 19- 38 copies per cell. This data will be added to the revised paper.</p><p><italic>A northern blot would be helpful if possible to confirm the existence of a discrete transcript at the expected size.</italic> </p><p>We tried the Northern blot but it did not work. This is not surprising given our finding that PINCR is expressed at 19-38 copies per cell.</p><p><italic>The conservation pattern of the transcript and p53 response element should be commented upon.</italic></p><p>We will add this information in the revised paper.</p><p><italic>2) The use of genome editing to stably delete PINCR is a good approach to establish a robust system for functional studies. However, the authors chose to delete a ~50 kb segment to remove the lncRNA which raises concerns regarding whether other important sequences were removed in addition to the 2.2 kb spliced PINCR sequence. I appreciate the authors' attempts to mitigate these concerns by performing a rescue experiment but the analysis of rescued cells does not go nearly far enough. Cell cycle analysis of rescued cells should be shown in addition to the provided analysis of cell survival after DOXO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The clonogenic survival assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) should also be performed on rescued cells. Likewise, cell cycle, cell survival, and clonogenic survival of rescued cells after 5-FU treatment should be added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-F</xref>.</italic></p><p>We have the cell cycle data from the rescue experiments and will add it to the revised paper. Alternatively, these issues can be addressed by PINCR knockdown with antisense oligos (ASOs) and/or CRISPRi as suggested below.</p><p><italic>Any concerns about the genome editing approach could be fully mitigated if the authors employed an orthogonal method to inhibit PINCR such as siRNA knockdown or CRISPRi, followed by analysis of cell cycle, survival, clonogenic growth, and target gene induction (e.g. BTG2, GPX1, RRM2B).</italic></p><p>Excellent point. When we initiated this study, we tried to knockdown PINCR with siRNAs but we did not get robust knockdown. However, we now have antisense oligos (ASOs) and CRISPR-KRAB expressing HCT116 cells that can be used to knockdown PINCR and examine the phenotype and target gene induction, as suggested by the reviewer. We are confident that this approach will successfully knockdown PINCR and the results will further solidify our findings from the PINCR-KO clones.</p><p><italic>3) While p53-mediated PINCR induction was demonstrated in multiple cell lines, all functional analyses are limited to HCT116. PINCR should be knocked out or inhibited in a second cell line to confirm that the phenotypic effects observed are not unique to HCT116.</italic></p><p>This is an important point. We will knockdown PINCR in another cell line with ASOs or CRISPRi and determine if the observed phenotypic effects are not restricted to HCT116.</p><p><italic>4) Knockdown of Matrin 3 partially phenocopies PINCR knockout with respect to cell survival after 5-FU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). As this is a very important prediction of their model, the analysis of Matrin 3 knockdown should be extended. First, at least 2 independent siRNAs should be tested to avoid off-target effects (this is especially important when monitoring general cellular phenotypes such as survival). Furthermore, the cell cycle should be examined after knockdown of Matrin 3 and 5-FU treatment and both cell cycle and apoptosis should be examined after DOXO treatment.</italic></p><p>In our paper, we have used smart pool siRNAs that contain 4 siRNAs. If the reviewer insists, we will do the experiments with 2 independent siRNAs. In addition, we will perform the cell cycle and apoptosis after Matrin 3 knockdown as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>5) What happens to the Matrin-p53 interaction in PINCR KO cells? Co-IP assays (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-B</xref>) should be performed in these cells.</italic></p><p>Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) indicates that p53-Matrin 3 interaction is RNA-independent. So, we expect p53 to interact with Matrin 3 even in PINCR-KO cells. However, it would be good to do this co- IP experiment in PINCR-KO cells, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>Likewise, does PINCR associate with p53 response elements in the absence of Matrin and/or p53? The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref> should be repeated after Matrin and p53 knockdown.</italic></p><p>Great suggestion. The suggested experiments can be done easily and will further establish the model and also answer reviewer #1 and # 3 concern.</p><p><italic>6) While the observation that p53-mediated induction of BTG2, GPX1, and RRM2B is attenuated in PINCR KO cells and after Matrin 3 knockdown is interesting, there is no evidence that these changes in gene expression are responsible for the impaired p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PINCR KO cells. Does knockdown of any of these targets phenocopy PINCR KO?</italic></p><p>A similar point was raised by reviewer # 1 (please see: response # 1 to reviewer # 1). We will address this by knocking down BTG2, GPX1 and RRM2B alone or in combination and determine the effect on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, as suggested.</p><p>Does overexpression of any of these genes rescue PINCR KO?</p><p>We can attempt this experiment but if overexpression of these genes in the absence of DNA damage causes cell cycle arrest, it may be complicate the analysis.</p><p><italic>7) The p53-RE luciferase assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> would be much more convincing if a reporter with mutations in the p53-RE were tested in parallel as a negative control.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer and will be do this experiment.</p><p><italic>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7‚Äîfigure supplement 1C</xref>, it appears that the polyadenylation signal was removed when the S1 tag was inserted (at the end of the red sequence). Does this affect the level of PINCR expression?

They further show that PINCR is required for p53-mediated G1 arrest, owing to the contribution of PINCR to the induction of a specific subset of p53 target genes in response to DNA damage. Importantly, they identify an interaction between PINCR and the RNA binding protein matrin 3, which is required for the induction of this subset of genes, and show nicely that PINCR binds directly to the p53 response elements (p53 RE's) of those genes.</italic></p><p><italic>Overall, this is a very interesting and well performed study. Publication in eLife is recommended if the authors can address, in a satisfactory manner, several important issues as listed below.</italic></p><p>We thank this reviewer for his/her kind words and constructive comments. Below is our response and plans to address the reviewer‚Äôs comments.</p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. In view of the suggested biology of PINCR, one might expect it to be selectively LESS induced under conditions that favor p53-dependent cell death. What happens, for example, upon treatment of HCT116 cells with high dose 5-FU? As a matter of fact, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and its supplemental already point in this direction: 5-FU, at the concentration used by the authors, induces more apoptosis (11%) than the other treatments, while causing a relatively modest increase in PINCR. Thus, the relative extent of endogenous PINCR induction might be a determinant of the likelihood of the cells to die rather than arrest. I suggest that the authors address this possibility more closely, e.g. by employing several different concentrations of 5-FU and comparing the extent of PINCR induction, induction of a typical pro-apoptotic p53 target gene (e.g. PUMA or CD95), and the accrual of sub-G1 cells.</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting point. As suggested, at several different concentrations of 5-FU, we will measure the induction of PINCR, PUMA and CD95 and also determine the effect on G1 arrest and the sub-G1 population.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>. The</italic> in vivo <italic>result is impressive. However, it does not necessarily support a pro-survival function of PINCR as concluded in the subsection ‚ÄúPINCR loss results in hypersensitivity to 5-FU and decreased tumor growth‚Äù: the authors did not address survival/death at all in this experiment. It will be important to perform histopathological examination of the tumors, and show (by cleaved caspase 3 or TUNEL) that the PINCR KO tumors indeed manifest a greater extent of apoptosis.</italic></p><p>This is an important point. We have the frozen tissues and will compare apoptosis between the injected PINCR-WT and PINCR-KO cells as suggested.</p><p><italic>3) I could not find any ChIP experiment showing that matrin 3 is required for optimal binding of p53 to the p53RE's of BTG2 etc. Did I miss it? This is an important experiment, as the authors attribute the reduced expression of those genes to reduced recruitment of p53 to their p53RE's.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer. This experiment was also suggested by reviewer # 2 (please see: response #10 to reviewer # 2) and will test the binding of p53 to the p53RE of the PINCR targets after Matrin 3 knockdown.</p><p><italic>4) Why does PINCR bind only to a subset of p53RE's? Is there significant homology between the sequence of PINCR and that of the DNA in the vicinity of those p53RE's, but not the p21 p53RE for example?</italic></p><p>This point was also raised by reviewer # 1. Please see our response to reviewer # 1 (response #2-4 to reviewer # 1).</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-E</xref>: How does PINCR overexpression affect the cell cycle profile and the expression of the specific subset of G1-related genes without and with DNA damage? Is PINCR overexpression alone sufficient to upregulate those genes?</italic></p><p>Another great suggestion. This is a straightforward experiment that will test if PINCR overexpression is sufficient to upregulate these genes and to determine the effect on G1 arrest after DNA damage.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>: What happens to matrin 3 after DNA damage? Do its levels increase? Does it become more localized to the nucleus?</italic></p><p>As suggested, we will measure Matrin 3 protein levels and nuclear localization after DNA damage. Preliminary data suggests that Matrin 3 expression is not deregulated after DNA damage.</p><p><italic>7) Does PINCR regulate its own expression after DNA damage? Does PINCR knockout affect the binding of p53 to the PINCR promoter?</italic></p><p>We will check the effect of overexpressing exogenous PINCR on PINCR-S1 cells using primers specific to the S1-tagged lncRNA. As mentioned before, the PINCR-KO cells have a complete or partial loss of the p53RE in the PINCR promoter. We will test the binding of p53 to the p53RE, as mentioned in the response to reviewer 1 (response # 6 to reviewer # 1).</p><p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. Does matrin 3 bind those promoters also without DNA damage, or is it recruited only after DNA damage?</italic></p><p>We will determine by ChIP-qPCR this in the revised paper.</p><p><italic>9) Does matrin 3 affect the induction of BTG2 etc in response to Nutlin, or is this DNA damage-specific?</italic></p><p>We will address this in the revised paper by knocking down Matrin 3 and treating the cells with Nutlin.</p><p>[Editors‚Äô notes: the authors‚Äô response after being formally invited to submit a revised submission follows.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Overall, the paper is tantalizing and interesting, but there are many unresolved aspects that prevent its publication in its current form. There are several areas where more clarity is needed about the observations made, as some of them contradict well known facts in the p53 field.</italic> </p><p><italic>The major concerns are:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) A p21-independent role of PINCR in p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. The authors show that PINCR is required for p53-dependent G1 arrest in response to doxorubicin, neocarcinostatin and 5FU. The authors also show that PINCR does not affect p21 expression or binding of p53 to the p21 enhancer. This is highly paradoxical, because p21 is required for G1 arrest in response to the three p53-activating agents mentioned above. The results counter this well-established and reproducible observation, and suggest that p21 cannot enforce G1 arrest without transactivation of other p53 targets, such as BTG2, RRM2B and GPX1. If this is the case, it should be demonstrated thoroughly.</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent point. As the reviewer pointed out, p21 plays an important role in mediating the effects of p53 to induce G1 arrest after DNA damage. According to some papers, in the absence of p21, there is no G1 arrest after DNA damage (Waldman et al., Cancer Res, 1995). However, other papers (also cited in the Waldman et al. paper) show that p21 is not the only player (Deng et al., Cell, 1995).</p><p><italic>Can depletion of BTG2 and/or RRM2B and/or GPX1 recapitulate the effects of PINCR depletion?</italic> </p><p>To address this point we have added new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 4</xref>). We indeed found that depletion of <italic>BTG2, GPX1</italic> or <italic>RRM2B</italic> using siRNAs, recapitulates the effects of <italic>PINCR</italic> depletion in response to 5-FU treatment. Accordingly, we made changes in the text as described below.</p><p>‚ÄúWe next asked the question if depletion of the <italic>PINCR</italic> targets <italic>BTG2, GPX1</italic> and <italic>RRM2B</italic> recapitulated the effects of <italic>PINCR</italic> depletion. [‚Ä¶] Significant reduction in G1 arrest after 5-FU treatment was observed after knockdown of <italic>GPX1</italic> but not <italic>BTG2</italic> or <italic>RRM2B</italic>. These data indicate that depletion of <italic>BTG2, GPX1</italic> or <italic>RRM2B</italic> recapitulates the effects of <italic>PINCR</italic> depletion in response to 5-FU treatment.‚Äù</p><p><italic>Is it true that these genes are required for p21-dependent cell cycle arrest? This could be answered with siRNA knockdowns.</italic></p><p>To address this question, we knocked down p21 alone or p21 and each of these <italic>PINCR</italic> targets and examined the effect on G1 arrest and apoptosis after 5-FU treatment. The results from 3 biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>) and the raw cell cycle profiles from a representative experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref>) show that concurrent knockdown of p21 and BTG2 results in further reduction in G1 arrest and increased apoptosis as compared to knockdown of p21 alone. On the other hand, concurrent knockdown of p21 and RRM2B results in less G1 arrest and decreased apoptosis as compared to knockdown of p21 alone. These data indicate that in the absence of p21, BTG2 may function as a G1-arrest promoting gene in response to 5-FU, whereas RRM2B may function as a G1-arrest antagonizing gene upon 5-FU treatment. However, future investigations are needed to further understand the crosstalk between p21 and these genes during cell cycle arrest.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23244.068</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PINCR-WT HCT116 cells were transfected with CTL siRNA (siCTL) or p21 siRNAs (sip21) for 48 hr and p21 knockdown was measured by immunoblotting.

A key observation in this paper is that PINCR and Matrin are required for p53 transactivation at selective loci, and this is explained by a requirement of PINCR for p53 binding to the respective enhancers at those genes. The notion of a RNA (or a RNA binding protein) being required for p53 binding to some DNA elements but not others is very provocative and requires further investigation. Biochemically speaking, p53 is a potent DNA-binding protein that works as a tetramer to bind a 4-repeat DNA sequence (a 20 mer consensus made of two half sites with two palindromic repeats per half site).</italic> </p><p>Our analysis of the overlap between the PINCR-regulated transcriptome identified by microarrays and the list of p53-regulated genes identified in the p53 GRO-seq paper (Allen et al., 2014) indicates that PINCR regulates the mRNA levels of only 11 p53 targets. This result is consistent with our additional data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 5</xref>) showing that PINCR is expressed at ~25 molecules per HCT116 cell after DNA damage. A lncRNA expressed at ~25 molecules per cell is most likely not to regulate hundreds of p53 targets, unless it regulates p53 itself, which is not the case, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><p><italic>How is this activity modified by RNA and/or a RNA-binding protein at some DNA elements but not others?</italic> </p><p>This is an important question that was also raised by Reviewer # 3.</p><p>To address this point, we have added new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref> and 2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Briefly, we found that Matrin 3 associates with the enhancers of BTG2, GPX1 and RRM2B and this interaction is mediated by the binding of <italic>PINCR</italic> to Matrin 3. In addition, using published Hi-C data and ChIP- seq data for CTCF, RAD21, H3K4Me3, H3K27ac and p53, we provide evidence of chromatin looping between the enhancer region and p53RE in the promoter region of BTG2, GPX1 and RRM2B. As a control, Matrin 3 and PINCR do not associate with the p21 promoter. Accordingly, we made changes in the text as described below.</p><p>‚ÄúGiven the evidence that Matrin 3 associates with enhancer regions (Skowronska-Krawczyk et al., 2005), we reasoned that Matrin 3 modulates the induction of these genes by binding to their enhancer regions. [‚Ä¶] These results indicate a role of Matrin 3 and <italic>PINCR</italic> in facilitating the association of p53 with the enhancers of specific p53 targets <italic>BTG2, GPX1</italic> and <italic>RRM2B</italic> and provide evidence of chromatin looping between the enhancers and promoters of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).‚Äù</p><p>Interestingly, when we looked at the sequence in the peaks of these enhancer regions, we were unable to find a canonical p53RE indicating indirect binding of p53.</p><p>‚ÄúFinally, we examined the association of <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> with the p53RE and enhancer regions of <italic>PINCR</italic> targets in the presence and absence of p53 or Matrin 3. [‚Ä¶] On the other hand, the observed loss in association of <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> to the enhancers and promoters upon knockdown of Matrin 3 indicates that Matrin 3 recruits <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> to these regions.‚Äù</p><p><italic>This is very tantalizing and hard to comprehend. In vitro protein-DNA binding experiments should be performed to investigate this. The genome-wide requirement for PINCR and Matrin should be defined. Is it true that only 11 p53 targets require PINCR?</italic> </p><p>Our analysis of the overlap between the PINCR-regulated transcriptome identified by microarrays and the list of p53-regulated genes identified in the p53 GRO-seq paper (Allen et al., 2014) indicates that PINCR regulates the mRNA levels of only 11 p53 targets. This result is consistent with our additional data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 5</xref>) showing that PINCR is expressed at ~25 molecules per HCT116 cell after DNA damage. A lncRNA expressed at ~25 molecules per cell is most likely not to regulate hundreds of p53 targets, unless it regulates p53 itself, which is not the case, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><p><italic>If so, is it true that PINCR regulates p53 binding at only those 11 loci? Is it true that PINCR binds only to those p53 target loci? What about Matrin? What is Matrin's binding pattern relative to p53 target genes, those sensitive and insensitive to PINCR?</italic> </p><p>One approach to address this question is by identifying genome-wide binding sites of p53, Matrin 3 and PINCR-S1. As suggested by the reviewers in the decision letter, we did not perform the Matrin 3 ChIP-seq or PINCR-S1 ChIP-seq experiments during the revision. However, our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) shows that Matrin 3 and PINCR associate specifically with the p53RE of BTG2, RRM2B and GPX1 but not the p53RE of p21.</p><p><italic>These questions should be answered with careful ChIP-seq experiments for p53, PINCR-S1 and Matrin, and a detailed investigation of this 'gene-specific effects'. This is important, because the latest and most comprehensive investigations of p53 functionality at enhancers indicate that p53 does not employ cofactors to recognize and activate transcription from ~1000 enhancers in a wide variety of contexts (see for example Verfaillie et al., Genome Research 2016). This notion is further supported by earlier work demonstrating that p53 can recognize its p53REs in nucleosomal context, often leading to nucleosome displacement.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned above, we did not conduct the ChIP-seq for Matrin 3 and PINCR- S1 during the revision. As requested by the reviewers, we performed p53 ChIP-seq in biological duplicates from PINCR-WT and PINCR-KO cells ¬± 5-FU. Unfortunately, in the first replicate there was too much background binding of p53 in one sample. In the second set, we observed specific p53 ChIP-seq peaks for only 41 among the 198 p53 targets identified in the p53 GRO-seq paper (Allen et al., 2016). Given this lack of significant overlap with well-established p53 target database and the fact that this data was from a one-time experiment, we believe that the p53 ChIP-seq experiments will need further optimization and we plan to investigate this in the future.</p><p><italic>3) DNA- versus RNA-dependent effects of PINCR. The authors conclude that PINCR acts by a RNA-dependent mechanism. However, this is based mostly on an unsatisfactory rescue overexpression experiment in PINCR knockout cells. This is important, because the field has been profoundly misled by earlier reports of another p53-inducible lncRNA, lincRNA-p21, which was first described to be acting by an RNA-dependent mechanism, yet now is ample clear that the lincRNA-p21 locus acts by a DNA-dependent, enhancer-like mechanism (see latest work from John Rinn's team in Cell Reports, backtracking on his original Cell paper by Huarte et al). To clarify this for PINCR, the authors should elaborate more on their knockout. What exact region of the genome did they delete when they deleted the 'entire PINCR region'? Did they delete the proximal p53 binding site as well? If they preserved the p53 enhancer, they should demonstrate that p53 binding to that region is intact by ChIP.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer‚Äôs concern. To address the concern on the rescue experiment, we have added new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>) showing that PINCR knockdown using antisense oligos in HCT116 or knocking out PINCR in another CRC line SW48 cells, has phenotypes similar to PINCR-KO HCT116 cells. Accordingly, we have made changes in the text as described below:</p><p>‚ÄúTo make sure that the altered induction of <italic>BTG2, GPX1</italic> and <italic>RRM2B</italic> reflect a function of the <italic>PINCR</italic> transcript itself, we measured the induction of these genes after <italic>PINCR</italic> knockdown using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs).[‚Ä¶] Taken together, the results from <italic>PINCR</italic> knockdown experiments corroborates our findings from the <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO clones.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúNext, to determine if the observed phenotypes are not restricted to HCT116, we knocked out <italic>PINCR</italic> in SW48 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 2A and B</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, deletion of the p53RE resulted in marked reduction in luciferase activity under basal conditions and after DNA damage.

We found that the 5‚Äôand 3‚Äôend of the <italic>PINCR</italic> RNA matched the annotated transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 3A</xref>). Interestingly, the reads from the first exon were substantially higher than the reads from the last exon which may be due to 3‚Äô to 5‚Äô degradation of this lncRNA, as recently reported for other lncRNAs (Schlackow et al., 2017). Finally, to determine the length of the <italic>PINCR</italic> transcript, we performed RT-PCR using a forward primer at the start of exon 1 and reverse primer complementary to the last exon (exon 6). As a positive control, we used pCB6-<italic>PINCR</italic>, a mammalian expression construct in which the full-length annotated <italic>PINCR</italic> RNA (~2.2 kb) was inserted into pCB6. Because the reverse primer at the end of the annotated last exon did not work even for pCB6-<italic>PINCR</italic>, we had to use an alternative reverse primer that started at position 1864 of the annotated ~2.2 kb long <italic>PINCR</italic> RNA.

We found that the <italic>PINCR</italic> promoter including the p53RE, mature <italic>PINCR</italic> transcript and the transcription start site are well conserved among primates but poorly conserved between human and mouse.</p><p><italic>2) The use of genome editing to stably delete PINCR is a good approach to establish a robust system for functional studies. However, the authors chose to delete a ~50 kb segment to remove the lncRNA which raises concerns regarding whether other important sequences were removed in addition to the 2.2 kb spliced PINCR sequence. I appreciate the authors' attempts to mitigate these concerns by performing a rescue experiment but the analysis of rescued cells does not go nearly far enough. Cell cycle analysis of rescued cells should be shown in addition to the provided analysis of cell survival after DOXO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The clonogenic survival assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) should also be performed on rescued cells. Likewise, cell cycle, cell survival, and clonogenic survival of rescued cells after 5-FU treatment should be added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-F</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We have added the cell cycle analysis of the rescued cells. Reintroduction of PINCR in PINCR-KO cells significantly rescues the sub-G1 population but not the G1 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 3B</xref>). The incomplete rescue (rescue of cell death but not G1 arrest) may be because unlike endogenous <italic>PINCR</italic> that is induced ~100-fold after DOXO-treatment, the extent of exogenous <italic>PINCR</italic> overexpression was ~40-fold. Another possibility is that in the rescue experiments, we overexpressed the annotated isoform whereas we found that HCT116 cells express at least 2 isoforms of <italic>PINCR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 4</xref>). Overall, the results from these rescue experiments indicate that the observed cell death phenotype after DOXO treatment of <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO cells was due to loss of <italic>PINCR</italic> RNA.</p><p>We would like to mention that in the interest of time, we did not perform the clonogenic survival assays and other suggested experiments with 5-FU. Instead, as shown below and as suggested in the decision letter, we addressed these issues using an orthogonal method in which we knocked down PINCR.</p><p><italic>Any concerns about the genome editing approach could be fully mitigated if the authors employed an orthogonal method to inhibit PINCR such as siRNA knockdown or CRISPRi, followed by analysis of cell cycle, survival, clonogenic growth, and target gene induction (e.g. BTG2, GPX1, RRM2B).</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent point. As suggested by the reviewers in the decision letter, we have now examined the cell cycle, survival, clonogenic growth and target gene induction after knockdown of PINCR RNA. In collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, we tested 5 antisense oligos (ASOs) that target PINCR RNA. We achieved robust knockdown with only one ASO designated as PINCR-ASO. We have added the data from these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 5s</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref>) and made changes in the text as described below:</p><p>‚ÄúTo make sure that the altered induction of <italic>BTG2, GPX1</italic> and <italic>RRM2B</italic> reflect a function of the <italic>PINCR</italic> transcript itself, we measured the induction of these genes after <italic>PINCR</italic> knockdown using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs).

As suggested by the reviewer, we knocked out PINCR in another CRC line (SW48 cells) to confirm that the phenotypic effects observed are not unique to HCT116. We found that loss of PINCR in SW48 cells results in reduced G1 arrest, increased apoptosis and reduced clonogenicity in response to 5-FU. Accordingly, we made changes in the text as described below:</p><p>‚ÄúNext, to determine if the observed phenotypes are not restricted to HCT116, we knocked out <italic>PINCR</italic> in SW48 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 2A and 2B</xref>).

As this is a very important prediction of their model, the analysis of Matrin 3 knockdown should be extended. First, at least 2 independent siRNAs should be tested to avoid off-target effects (this is especially important when monitoring general cellular phenotypes such as survival). Furthermore, the cell cycle should be examined after knockdown of Matrin 3 and 5-FU treatment and both cell cycle and apoptosis should be examined after DOXO treatment.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer‚Äôs comment. As suggested, we now provide evidence with 2 independent Matrin siRNAs, that knockdown of Matrin 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 1C</xref>) results in increased cell death in PINCR-WT cells but not in PINCR-KO cells after 5-FU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). However, the effect on G1 arrest was consistently observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 2A</xref>) with only one siRNA (siMatrin 3-I). Cell cycle analysis in response to DOXO-treatment showed that knockdown of Matrin 3 resulted in increased sub-G1 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 2C</xref>) but the effect on G1 arrest was not the same for both siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Raw cell cycle profiles from a representative experiment are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>These data suggest that Matrin 3 mediates the anti-apoptotic effect of PINCR in response to DNA damage induced by 5-FU or DOXO.

The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref> should be repeated after Matrin and p53 knockdown.</italic> </p><p>Great suggestion. As suggested, we examined the association of <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> with the p53RE and enhancer regions of <italic>PINCR</italic> targets in the presence and absence of p53 or Matrin 3. To do this, we knocked down p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8‚Äîfigure supplement 5</xref>) or Matrin 3 with siRNAs and performed streptavidin pulldowns. As compared to the p53RE in the <italic>PINCR</italic> target gene promoters, in CTL siRNA transfected cells treated with 5-FU, we found stronger association of <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> with the enhancers of the <italic>PINCR</italic> targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Silencing Matrin 3 or p53 resulted in dramatic reduction in the association of <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> with these enhancers and p53REs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Because p53 is important for <italic>PINCR</italic> expression, it is likely that the reduced association of <italic>PINCR-S1</italic> to these regions after p53 knockdown is due to lack of <italic>PINCR</italic> expression.

Does knockdown of any of these targets phenocopy PINCR KO?</italic> </p><p>This point was also raised by reviewer #1. To address this point we have added new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 4</xref>). We indeed found that depletion of <italic>BTG2, GPX1</italic> or <italic>RRM2B</italic> using siRNAs, recapitulates the effects of <italic>PINCR</italic> depletion in response to 5-FU treatment.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, we found that deletion of the p53RE in the PINCR promoter resulted is profound reduction in luciferase activity, both in the absence and presence of DOXO.</p><p><italic>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7‚Äîfigure supplement 1C</xref>, it appears that the polyadenylation signal was removed when the S1 tag was inserted (at the end of the red sequence). Does this affect the level of PINCR expression? Although the authors show PINCR-S1 induction after DOXO treatment, PINCR-S1 levels should be directly compared to endogenous PINCR.</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting point. The reviewer is correct. The potential polyadenylation signal was removed when the S1 tag was inserted. We call this as a potential polyadenylation signal because according the RefSeq annotation, PINCR is not a polyadenylated lncRNA but this needs to be confirmed in future experiments. As suggested by the reviewer, we compared PINCR-S1 levels to endogenous PINCR by qRT-PCR (normalized to GAPDH) in PINCR-S1 HCT116 cells and in parental HCT116 cells. We found that PINCR-S1 is expressed at levels similar to <italic>PINCR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8‚Äîfigure supplement 3C</xref>). These data indicate that insertion of the S1-tag does not affect PINCR expression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[‚Ä¶] 1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. In view of the suggested biology of PINCR, one might expect it to be</italic> </p><p><italic>selectively LESS induced under conditions that favor p53-dependent cell death. What happens, for example, upon treatment of HCT116 cells with high dose 5-FU? As a matter of fact, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and its supplemental already point in this direction: 5-FU, at the concentration used by the authors, induces more apoptosis (11%) than the other treatments, while causing a relatively modest increase in PINCR. Thus, the relative extent of endogenous PINCR induction might be a determinant of the likelihood of the cells to die rather than arrest. I suggest that the authors address this possibility more closely, e.g. by employing several different concentrations of 5-FU and comparing the extent of PINCR induction, induction of a typical pro-apoptotic p53 target gene (e.g. PUMA or CD95), and the accrual of sub-G1 cells.</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting point. As suggested, we treated the cells with several different concentrations of 5-FU and measured the induction of PINCR and PUMA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 5A</xref>, both PINCR and PUMA are induced ~10-14-fold after treatment of PINCR-WT cells with 0, 10, 50, 100 or 375 Œºm of 5-FU. The sub-G1 cells for this range of 5-FU was 0, 3, 8, 14 and 43% in PINCR-WT cells and 0, 9, 17, 34 and 83% in PINCR-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 5B</xref>). In addition, at each dose of 5-FU, the% of cells arrested in G1 was smaller in PINCR-KO cells as compared to PINCR-WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 5B</xref>). Based on these data, it appears that the relative extent of endogenous PINCR induction may not be a determinant of the likelihood of the cells to die rather than arrest.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>. The in vivo result is impressive. However, it does not necessarily support a pro-survival function of PINCR as concluded in the subsection ‚ÄúPINCR loss results in hypersensitivity to 5-FU and decreased tumor growth‚Äù: the authors did not address survival/death at all in this experiment. It will be important to perform histopathological examination of the tumors, and show (by cleaved caspase 3 or TUNEL) that the PINCR KO tumors indeed manifest a greater extent of apoptosis.</italic> </p><p>This is an important point. As suggested, we performed immunohistochemical staining of the tumors for the proliferation marker Ki67 and the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 7</xref>). We found that both <italic>PINCR</italic>-WT and <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO tumors had a high proportion of Ki67- positive cells (&gt;50%) and a very low proportion of cleaved caspase-3-positive cells (&lt;1%). As compared to <italic>PINCR</italic>-WT tumors, the <italic>PINCR</italic>-KO tumors had significantly decreased Ki67-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 7A</xref>), suggesting that the observed reduced tumor volume is due to inhibition of cell proliferation.</p><p>Based on these data, we have accordingly modified the text on page 11. We agree that the in vivo data does not support a pro-survival function of PINCR. However, our in vitro data from 2 CRC cell lines suggests that PINCR has a prosurvival function in response to DNA damage.</p><p><italic>3) I could not find any ChIP experiment showing that matrin 3 is required for optimal binding of p53 to the p53RE's of BTG2 etc. Did I miss it? This is an important experiment, as the authors attribute the reduced expression of those genes to reduced recruitment of p53 to their p53RE's.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer. In the revised manuscript, we show that the binding of p53 to the p53RE element of BTG2, GPX1 and RRM2B is not affected after knockdown of Matrin 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>). This was a surprising result. However, our analysis of the enhancer region of these genes and potential chromatin looping between their promoter and enhancer regions indicates that Matrin 3 may regulate these genes not by controlling p53 binding at their promoters but by modulating their expression after 5-FU treatment by associating with their enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7‚Äîfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Why does PINCR bind only to a subset of p53RE's?

We did not find significant homology between the PINCR RNA and the DNA in the vicinity of the p53RE of BTG2, GPX1 and RRM2B. Our data indicates that PINCR binds to Matrin 3 and after binding to Matrin 3, PINCR is recruited to the p53RE of these genes but not the p21 p53RE as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6‚Äîfigure supplement 1B</xref>. This is further supported by our data showing PINCR does not associate to these p53REs upon Matrin 3 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-E</xref>: How does PINCR overexpression affect the cell cycle profile and the expression of the specific subset of G1-related genes without and with DNA damage?

We found that PINCR overexpression has no effect on the expression of BTG2, GPX1 and RRM2B, without and with DNA damage induced by 5-FU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8‚Äîfigure supplement 4</xref>). In addition, there was no effect on cell cycle profile after PINCR overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 6B and C</xref>). Thus, our data indicates that PINCR overexpression alone is not sufficient to upregulate those genes.
