(SOD1). A major challenge in understanding ALS disease pathology has been the identification and atomic-level characterization of these conformers. Here, we use a combination of NMR methods to detect four distinct sparsely populated and transiently formed thermally accessible conformers in equilibrium with the native state of immature SOD1 (apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>). Structural models of two of these establish that they possess features present in the mature dimeric protein. In contrast, the other two are non-native oligomers in which the native dimer interface and the electrostatic loop mediate the formation of aberrant intermolecular interactions. Our results show that apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> has a rugged free energy landscape that codes for distinct kinetic pathways leading to either maturation or non-native association and provide a starting point for a detailed atomic-level understanding of the mechanisms of SOD1 oligomerization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07296.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07296.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07296.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (or ALS) is a disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, such that more and more of these cells die as the disease progresses. Since nerve cells direct muscle movement, people with ALS increasingly lose control of their muscles, and may therefore lose the ability to speak, eat, move, and breathe.</p><p>Around one in five people who have an inherited form of ALS also have mutations in a gene that encodes an enzyme called SOD1. This antioxidant enzyme detoxifies harmful chemicals that are the byproducts of normal cellular activity. The mature active form of this enzyme contains two SOD1 proteins, each of which binds one copper ion and one zinc ion. Each protein in a pair also contains a strong bond that helps to stabilize its three-dimensional structure. However, immature copies of this protein, which lack the strong bond and metal ions, often fold into the wrong shape. These misfolded proteins can clump together into clusters, and potentially lead to the development of ALS.</p><p>Efforts to study misfolded proteins are limited by the fact that misfolding is a rare event. As a result, protein samples generally contain very small fractions of misfolded molecules and most techniques for investigating protein structure are ill-suited to probe the process of misfolding. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (or NMR for short) is one technique that has been used to visualize flexible proteins, and protein folding and misfolding, down to the level of individual atoms. Recent improvements in NMR spectroscopy have opened up the possibility of studying protein structures that exist at levels as low as 1% of the sample.</p><p>Now, Sekhar et al. have used NMR to document the dynamics of immature SOD1 proteins. The experiments show that the protein is flexible and readily switches back and forth between its ‘default’ shape and one of at least four different shapes; and at any one time, the fraction of molecules in solution that were in each of these shapes was around 1%. Two of the shapes have many of the same features as those in a mature SOD1 protein pair. But the other two shapes involve SOD1 proteins interacting in unusual ways, and may resemble the cluster-forming misfolded SOD1 proteins.</p><p>By using the NMR data to create three-dimensional models of the SOD1 proteins, Sekhar et al. were able to identify two sites on immature SOD1 proteins involved in these unusual interactions that are inaccessible in mature enzymatically active SOD1. These findings suggest that targeting these two sites with drugs could possibly block the formation of toxic versions of SOD1 early in the course of ALS, and thus prevent the progression of the disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07296.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07296.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>human Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase</kwd><kwd>CPMG relaxation dispersion</kwd><kwd>non-native oligomer</kwd><kwd>transient conformation</kwd><kwd>CEST</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research (Instituts de recherche en santé du Canada)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meiering</surname><given-names>Elizabeth M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kay</surname><given-names>Lewis E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000196</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation (Fondation canadienne pour l'innovation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kay</surname><given-names>Lewis E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000192</institution-id><institution>Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation (Ministre Du Développement Économique Et De L'innovation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kay</surname><given-names>Lewis E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003579</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto (UofT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kay</surname><given-names>Lewis E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Solution NMR spectroscopy reveals the energy landscape of immature Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase and leads to atomic resolution structural models of transiently populated non-native oligomers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is an extensively studied metalloenzyme that has become a paradigm for understanding protein structure and function as well as folding and misfolding associated with disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Valentine et al., 2005</xref>). The mature enzymatically active form of this antioxidant protein (Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>SOD1<sup>S–S</sup>) is a homodimer comprised of 153-residue monomer subunits, each of which binds 1 Cu and 1 Zn ion and contains one intra-subunit disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Valentine et al., 2005</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>sod1</italic> gene encoding for this enzyme account for ∼20% of all familial ALS (fALS) cases, or about 2% of all ALS occurrences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Robberecht and Philips, 2013</xref>). Despite the link between SOD1 and fALS and the identification of over 150 disease causing mutants, the molecular events leading to disease remain poorly understood. Inclusions containing SOD1 have been observed in patients afflicted with both familial and sporadic ALS, suggesting that both forms of the disease may share a common pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Matsumoto et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rotunno and Bosco, 2013</xref>). However, whether cytotoxicity arises from the aggregates or from soluble misfolded conformers further upstream remains unclear. In its metal-bound oxidized form SOD1 is exceptionally stable, with a melting temperature over 90°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stathopulos et al., 2006</xref>) and is highly resistant to aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stathopulos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Broom et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the most immature form of SOD1, apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>, that lacks metal ions and the disulfide bond has a much higher propensity to misfold and aggregate in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Furukawa and O'Halloran, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Broom et al., 2014</xref>) and has been hypothesized to be the primary cause of toxicity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zetterström et al., 2013</xref>). Studies of apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> form the basis of the work described herein.</p><p>Misfolded protein conformations can be notoriously difficult to characterize because the tools of structural biology are most suited to proteins which adopt only single conformations that are extensively populated. In contrast, misfolded conformers can be high-energy states that are only marginally populated and transiently sampled by the native protein under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chiti and Dobson, 2008</xref>). In this case they cannot be observed directly using ‘traditional’ biophysical approaches. Recent methodological advances in NMR spectroscopy have rendered such previously ‘invisible’ states (also referred to as excited states in what follows) amenable to structural analysis so long as they exchange with a ‘visible’ (ground) state, are populated at a level of approximately 0.5% or higher and have lifetimes ranging from 0.5–20 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Palmer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sekhar and Kay, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have used a combination of different spin relaxation NMR experiments to explore the energy landscape of apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> and to elucidate the structural features of several invisible states that are populated via conformational fluctuations originating from the monomeric ground conformer of the protein. Analysis of the resulting data yields structural information about each of the excited states in the form of chemical shifts as well as the kinetics and thermodynamics of the exchange process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Palmer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Korzhnev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nikolova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Neudecker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sekhar and Kay, 2013</xref>). We detect four excited state conformers in equilibrium with native apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>. Two of these, involving either the local folding of a helix or dimerization, lead to structural features that are found in the native state of the mature metallated protein. In contrast, the other two conformers correspond to non-native oligomers. Structural models generated from the NMR data highlight the native dimer interface and the electrostatic loop as key motifs in forming non-native intermolecular contacts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ApoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> is a monomeric β-barrel with dynamic loops</title><p>Detailed structural studies have established that each monomer of homodimeric Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>SOD1<sup>S–S</sup> forms an 8-stranded antiparallel Greek key β-barrel with two short helices, one each in the Zn-binding (49–80) and electrostatic loops (126–143) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Valentine et al., 2005</xref>).

Metal binding is additionally stabilized by residues in the electrostatic loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Strange et al., 2003</xref>).

When the r.f. is positioned close to an invisible excited state resonance the effect of the perturbation will be transferred to the ground state peak via chemical exchange, leading to a decrease in the intensity of the observed ground state resonance.

Further, the pervasive nature of exchange in this system significantly complicates analysis of the CEST and CPMG data. This is especially the case because there is considerable overlap in the regions that report on the various processes, with residues associated with the native dimer interface participating in three of the four exchange events that have been characterized. Not surprisingly, therefore, in some cases the relaxation data show complex exchange behaviour. This does not necessarily imply that the four exchange events discussed here are coupled, but can also result from spin probes reporting on one process ‘sensing’ fluctuating fields from proximal exchange events. For example, CEST profiles of G51, N53, T54, and G61 clearly establish that these residues report on native dimerization, with shift differences in excess of ∼4 ppm between ground and excited state conformers. Yet, for these residues, <sup>15</sup>N CPMG relaxation dispersion profiles recorded on pWT samples could not be fit to models of two-site exchange. In contrast, the corresponding profiles from a G85R apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> mutant, where process II is eliminated and process IV reduced, could be fit to the simplest two-state exchange model. Further, the CEST profiles for these residues in pWT and G85R apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> are very similar, suggesting that process I has not been significantly affected via the mutation. A likely explanation is that the ‘seemingly more simple exchange behaviour’ in the G85R mutant is the result of the elimination of local field fluctuations from these additional processes. The inability to fit the dispersion data for these residues in the pWT protein is, thus, at least in part the result of fluctuating local magnetic fields that arise from a number of simultaneous proximal processes.</p><p>Most certainly, the multiple exchange processes do complicate assignment of residues to distinct exchange events. A detailed description of the approach taken, involving studies at a number of different temperatures and protein concentrations, is provided in ‘Materials and methods’ ‘Separating processes I–IV’. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> summarize the criteria used for separating residues into distinct exchange processes and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> further indicates what residues were subsequently used as constraints in structure calculations (see below).

Convergence was not achieved when the restraints derived from all active residues for each of the monomers were enforced without first separating them as described above and shown in the circles in <bold>A</bold> (green, denoted by ‘single interface’), with on average ∼80% of the restraints violated over the 200 final calculated structures and an average violation of 4.7 Å. By contrast, modelling Process IV as involving distinct interfaces (i.e., asymmetric dimer) leads to less than 1 restraint violated on average, per structure, with an average distance of 0.4 Å per violation. Plots of the HADDOCK score vs RMSD (to the lowest scored structure, left) and a histogram of restraint violations (right) illustrate this. In these initial simulations both electrostatic and Zn-loops were kept fixed to the X-ray coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Strange et al., 2003</xref>), but were allowed to move in further calculations to generate the final set of structures, as described in ‘Materials and methods’.

The larger RMSD spreads for the non-native dimers reflect to a large extent the fact that both electrostatic and Zn-loops were allowed to be flexible in the final set of calculations while the Zn-loop was fixed for the native dimer. Averaged over the lowest 10 members of the ensemble, 4 restraints were violated per structure with an average violation of 0.5 Å for the native dimer, 1.5 restraints per structure with an average violation of 0.7 Å for non-native dimer 1 and 1 restraint per structure with an average violation of 0.8 Å for non-native dimer 2.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07296.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07296.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07296-fig9-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig9s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07296.022</object-id><label>Figure 9—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>The asymmetric dimer from process IV can serve as a hub for the formation of larger oligomers.</title><p>A pair of low energy dimers formed via process IV was docked via HADDOCK as described in ‘Materials and methods’ using restraints from process IV (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) to form tetramers and the process repeated with the resulting tetramers to form octamers (Monomer–Dimer—Tetramer–Octamer pathway).

These differ significantly from the mature dimeric form of Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>SOD1<sup>S–S</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The non-native dimer formed via process III (referred to as non-native dimer 1) is symmetric and topologically related to the native dimer by a 180° rotation of one of the monomer units about an axis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>. It is stabilized by an interface very similar to that of the native dimer, involving Zn-binding and β6-β7 loops, as well as strands β1 and β8. Notably, the restraints used to model the excited state formed via this process (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>) localize to the native dimer interface on one side of the monomer, consistent with the symmetric dimer structural model. These restraints are a subset of those for process I, and it is reasonable to ask why the native structure is not generated in this case. This can be understood by noting that the native dimer interface involves contacts between residues from β1–β8 in one monomer and residues localized to the Zn-loop from a second, placing the corresponding β1–β8 residues in the second monomer far from those in the first. In contrast, since the restraint residues for process III include those from β1–β8 but not the Zn-loop, the process of satisfying the restraints (i.e., bringing restraint residues within a prescribed distance from each other) places β1–β8 from both monomers of the dimer in proximity, leading to a structure where one of the monomers is rotated 180<sup>o</sup> compared to the native dimer.</p><p>Unlike both dimeric structures formed via processes I and III, the second non-native dimer (non-native dimer 2, process IV) is asymmetric, with the orientation of the monomers with respect to each other illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>. In this case the interface is formed by the β6–β7 and Zn loops as well as strands 1 and 8 from one monomer and by the electrostatic and Zn-binding loops from the second molecule. The asymmetry is to be expected based on the location of the input restraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), which are not localized to a particular region of the molecule, but spread into a number of clusters. These clusters of restraints cannot be simultaneously satisfied by a symmetric dimer, but can be readily accounted for by an asymmetric dimeric structure that brings one cluster on one monomer close to the remaining clusters on a second molecule.</p><p>The structural models all point to an important role for strand β1 in the formation of excited states derived from processes I, III, and IV. This leads to the prediction that mutations in this region could disrupt association. To test this, we mutated A4 in β1 to V and recorded further CPMG experiments to evaluate its effects on the association processes. As expected, the effect is pronounced with both native (I) and non-native dimerization processes (III) completely abolished, while formation of the asymmetric dimer via process IV is considerably diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have used a combination of CEST and CPMG NMR relaxation experiments to probe the energy landscape of apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>, an immature form of SOD1 that is monomeric, metal free and lacking the stabilizing disulfide bond between C57 and C146.

Most applications of either CEST or CPMG relaxation experiments have involved systems where the majority of residues report on a single exchange event, although in some cases the processes have been more than two-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Korzhnev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Neudecker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Korzhnev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sugase et al., 2007</xref>). When more than a single exchange event is present residues reporting on a specific process may be localized structurally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vallurupalli and Kay, 2006</xref>), simplifying the analysis. The situation is more complex for apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>. Because the dimer interface plays critical roles in both native and non-native oligomer formation, residues do not cluster spatially to separate processes and a large number of different experiments are thus necessary to resolve each exchange event. Untangling the four exchange processes described in the present study has required a combination of both CEST and CPMG relaxation experiments, as described in ‘Materials and methods’ ‘Separating probes of processes I–IV’, and summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. For example, an initial <sup>15</sup>N CEST study showed large minor state dips for G51, N53, T54, and G61 that were very well separated from the ground state (8.3 ppm, 8.1 ppm, 3.8 ppm, and −7.3 ppm, respectively). These chemical shifts matched those of Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>SOD1<sup>S–S</sup>, so that a straightforward assignment of reporters of process I was obtained, along with the identification of the nature of the exchange event. By comparison, the corresponding CPMG dispersion profiles for these residues could not be well fit together, although those for N53 and T54 could be fit, that reflects the sensitivity of the dispersion profiles to more than a single exchange process. CEST profiles can, of course, also be sensitive to multiple exchange events and indeed, those from G51, N53, T54, and G61 are. However, unlike dispersion data that must be rigorously fit to extract shift differences, the chemical shifts of the excited state can be obtained by simple inspection of CEST profiles so long as they are significantly different from those of the ground state. In cases involving multiple processes where only one has large chemical shift differences between interconverting conformers it is therefore possible to get accurate shift values for residues of this excited state from the position of the minor dips, as is made clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3D,E, 4D,E</xref>. In contrast to process I where CEST data were critical, the small chemical shift differences between states involved in processes III and IV (less than 1.5 ppm, see ‘Materials and methods’ ‘Separating probes of processes I–IV’) precluded analysis via CEST since major and minor state dips are, in general, poorly resolved. In these cases, however, high quality two-state fits of the CPMG dispersion data are obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5A, 6A</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the pair of complementary methodologies used in this study, a large number of different experiments are further necessary to separate the exchange events (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). A detailed description of the approaches that have been used is given in ‘Materials and methods’. Briefly, we have distinguished between intra- and inter-molecular processes by recording experiments as a function of protein concentration, separating process II which was concentration independent (electrostatic loop helix formation) from the other exchange events that showed increased minor state dips (CEST) or larger dispersion profiles (CPMG) at the higher protein concentrations. Temperature dependent studies were also performed that clearly distinguished processes I and III (increased CPMG dispersion profiles with higher temperature) from process IV (decreased profiles). Residues involved in processes I and III could be separated because different exchange parameters gave rise to profiles that could not be fit simultaneously. Finally, studies on G85R and A4V apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> have provided confidence in our assignment of residues to particular exchange events, since reporter residues of a particular process in the WT protein that is subsequently abolished via mutation no longer show evidence of conformational exchange. By means of example, process II is eliminated in G85R apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>, while processes I, III, and IV can no longer be detected in A4V apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>.</p><p>The combination of CEST and CPMG experiments described above leads to a kinetic scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), in which native apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> appears as a central hub for exchange processes leading to maturation (processes I, II) or aberrant association (processes III, IV). Experiments on G85R and A4V apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> have further clarified details of this kinetic network by providing insights into the interconversion between different excited state conformations. For example, evidence that helix formation and dimerization are largely uncoupled is provided by mutations in apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> that eliminate either helix folding (G85R) or dimerization (A4V). The A4V mutant has no effect on helix folding, while G85R apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> does not influence dimerization processes I and III with only some effect on IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, helix formation is not on-pathway for formation of the native dimer or non-native dimer I from apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>. In addition dimerization is not a prerequisite for helix formation (process II) since this would entail a concentration dependence for the helix process which is not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, relaxation dispersion data from residues reporting on processes III and IV are all well fit to a two-state model. While this certainly does not prove that the exchange mechanisms for aberrant dimerization cannot be more complex, our present data do not justify such an interpretation. Accordingly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> depicts the simplest kinetic scheme consistent with the spin relaxation data recorded on apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> where each of the four processes studied in this work has been shown separately. We cannot rule out the existence of a more complex network in which for instance the helical population dimerizes, the electrostatic loop in the dimeric population folds, or native and non-native dimers form larger assemblies. However, these processes involve populations of conformers that are below the detection limits of CEST and CPMG methods.</p><p>Having established the kinetic network and assigned residues to particular processes, structural models of the excited states were calculated using the molecular docking program HADDOCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9 fig10">Figures 9, 10</xref>, see ‘Materials and methods’). We have also attempted to supplement chemical shift restraint data with distances generated from paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments by carrying out experiments involving mixtures of <sup>15</sup>N-apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> and spin-labeled <sup>14</sup>N-apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>, as first described in other studies of SOD1 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Teilum et al., 2009</xref>). However, these experiments were not successful because the exchange regimes for processes I, III, and IV (k<sub>ex</sub> = 150–600 s<sup>−1</sup>) preclude the determination of PREs in the excited dimeric state, which can be reliably measured only for much faster processes (k<sub>ex</sub> &gt; 10,000 s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Iwahara and Clore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clore, 2011</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A–C</xref> highlights the residues and secondary structure elements present at the interfaces of the native and non-native dimers that have been determined in this study. Despite the fairly low resolution of the calculated models important insights can, nevertheless, be obtained. For example, identification of the interfaces of the aberrant oligomers helps explain why Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>SOD1<sup>S–S</sup> is so resistant to oligomerization, and potentially, why many of the ALS mutants localize to the dimer or the metal-binding region. The key elements of these non-native inter-molecular interfaces are strands β1, β8 and part of the Zn-binding loop, which are sequestered and hence protected upon formation of the native dimer, as well as the electrostatic loop, which is rigid in Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>SOD1<sup>S–S</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and thus less likely to form promiscuous interactions. The protective nature of loop ordering is made clear in studies of S134N SOD1, which has a disordered electrostatic loop even in the holo state and has been suggested to form oligomers in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banci et al., 2005</xref>). Crystals of this variant show non-native symmetric interactions whereby the disordered electrostatic loop from one monomer interacts with the cleft between strands β5–β6 of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elam et al., 2003</xref>). Loss of metal and disruption of quaternary structure thus promote improper association both by destabilizing the protein and making higher energy conformations thermally accessible and by exposing regions of the protein most prone to forming these intermolecular interactions. It is noteworthy that the stabilizing disulfide bond in mutants of SOD1 is more easily reduced than in wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tiwari and Hayward, 2003</xref>), thus leading to larger concentrations of apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> and a higher tendency for forming aberrant oligomers.</p><p>Regions of apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> with millisecond timescale fluctuations that lead to the formation of non-native oligomers (processes III and IV) have been predicted to be aggregation-prone and to be involved in the initial stages of aggregation. For example, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations identified the N- and C-termini of SOD1, as well as residues I35-F45 and H110–H120, to have a pronounced tendency to aggregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khare et al., 2005</xref>). CPMG measurements recorded here show that many residues from the termini of SOD1 as well as from H110–H120 participate in both exchange processes III and IV. Moreover, nanosecond timescale simulations starting from dimeric SOD1 in the absence of bound metal show that the Zn and electrostatic loops become flexible and move away from one another, exposing strands β4 and β5. These observations led to the hypothesis that the initial events in SOD1 oligomerization may be triggered by the misfolded form of the protein possessing flexible Zn and electrostatic loops as well as exposed β4 and β5 strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Strange et al., 2007</xref>). This is consistent with results from our experiments showing that conformational fluctuations involving residues 45–46 (β4) and 85–87 (β5) as well as the dimer interface and parts of the electrostatic loop lead to non-native oligomerization (process IV).</p><p>Interestingly, the structural features of the non-native oligomers identified here are in keeping with expectations based on studies of soluble and insoluble SOD1 species in protein inclusions isolated from human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rakhit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosco et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Forsberg et al., 2010</xref>) and mouse models of ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rakhit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosco et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zetterström et al., 2013</xref>). For example, SEDI antibodies raised against native–dimer interface residues 143–151, and for which there is no cross-reactivity with monomeric SOD1, could identify misfolded SOD1 in degenerating neurons of presymptomatic mice models of ALS, and also in mice overexpressing wild-type SOD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rakhit et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, this region is exposed in non-native dimer II. In a second example, inclusions from neurons of sporadic ALS patients were immunoreactive to the C4F6 antibody raised against G93A SOD1, indicating that misfolded WT SOD1 species were present, since properly folded WT SOD1 is not reactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosco et al., 2010</xref>). The C4F6 antibody recognizes residues 80–118 which are sequestered in the WT protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Strange et al., 2003</xref>) but large stretches of which are exposed in the non-native oligomers that have been characterized here. Moreover, the importance of small dimeric particles in ALS disease pathology is made clear by a report in which 32 kDa SOD1 species were identified by biotinylation based chemical crosslinking of inclusion bodies obtained from spinal cords of sporadic and familial ALS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gruzman et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Structural models for the non-native conformers described in this work provide further clues as to the molecular architecture of misfolded oligomers detected in vivo. Aggregates of SOD1 have been found to contain various protease resistant cores including regions 1–30, 90–120, and 135–153 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Furukawa et al., 2010</xref>), all of which contain residues present at the interfaces of the non-native oligomers identified presently, suggesting that these oligomers may serve as nuclei for downstream aggregation. Indeed, it is possible to dock asymmetric dimers formed via process IV to other subunits via native or non-native interfaces described here to generate higher order oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The presence of oligomeric conformations separated from native apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> by small free energy barriers under physiologically relevant conditions provides a compelling example of how improper protein assembly and aggregation can originate from locally unfolded or misfolded protein states accessible from the native free energy basin via thermal fluctuations. The oligomers reported here are formed at rates of ∼100 s<sup>−1</sup>, five orders of magnitude faster than the rate of unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lindberg et al., 2004</xref>), and are more likely to be sampled under physiological conditions in vivo than the globally unfolded conformation. Locally unfolded states have been implicated as key precursors in the aggregation of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chiti and Dobson, 2008</xref>) such as transthyretin (TTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Quintas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hammarström et al., 2003</xref>), human lysozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canet et al., 2002</xref>) and β2-microglobulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jahn et al., 2006</xref>) involved in other protein conformational disorders. The disruption of a stable quaternary TTR tetramer via mutations leads to a monomeric form which is aggregation-prone, and the subsequent formation of amyloid fibrils is associated with diseases such as senile systemic amyloidosis. In the case of TTR the less stable monomer transiently samples a non-native and potentially amyloidogenic conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lim et al., 2013</xref>). This situation is not unlike that for SOD1 where demetallation and disulfide reduction destabilize the native dimer, resulting in a rugged landscape with thermally accessibly native and non-native conformations. It is noteworthy that the aberrant SOD1 oligomers identified here form without significant intra-molecular conformational rearrangements with most of the protein retaining its native structure, as is clear from the relatively small <sup>15</sup>N chemical shift differences between ground and excited states associated with processes III and IV. Thus native apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>, which is populated in the cell during the SOD1 maturation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banci et al., 2012</xref>), already appears to be poised to form aberrant interactions without the need for barrier crossing to a more pathological conformational state.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Using NMR methods exquisitely sensitive to the presence of excited protein conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sekhar and Kay, 2013</xref>), we have demonstrated that under physiologically relevant conditions immature monomeric apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> has a rugged free energy landscape on which mature conformations resembling the native state of metallated SOD1 coexist with aberrant non-native oligomers. The high propensity of the exposed dimer interface and the flexible electrostatic loop to self-associate results in the formation of three distinct oligomeric forms which exist in equilibrium with the native state of apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>.

Its concentration is an order of magnitude smaller than what would be required to give rise to the excited state populations observed (2–3%), since for the protein concentration of 1.3 mM used in the analysis approximately 30 μM of metal would be necessary for the excited state to correspond to a Ca-bound state. This is further supported by the fact that very similar CEST profiles were obtained from samples that had been placed in regular glass NMR tubes where the Ca concentration was determined to be below the detection limit of ICP-AES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>To further confirm that CEST profiles observed for residues reporting on processes I and II are not the result of direct Zn binding we added ∼140 μM Zn to a Zn and Cu-free apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> sample in a Suprasil tube.

First, a number of residues whose <sup>15</sup>N CEST and CPMG profiles indicated large chemical shift differences between the ground and excited states were identified for each process (Gly 51, Asn 53, Thr 54 and Gly 61 for process I and Thr 135 and Thr 137 for process II); these residues were used in subsequent analyses to extract exchange parameters. Next, a complete set of three-state models was chosen making use of the fact that the chemical shifts for probes in two of the three states are known from CEST profiles, referred to as the ground (N) and the excited state (H) in what follows. Note that only two dips are observed in the CEST profiles, suggesting that the third state has similar chemical shifts to either N or H.

Previous studies of ground states of monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banci et al., 2003</xref>) and dimeric (CMD and EMM, unpublished) forms of apoSOD1<sup>S–S</sup> clearly show that the <sup>15</sup>N chemical shift of G61 moves from ∼108 ppm to ∼100 ppm upon dimerization. The presence of such a similarly large chemical shift change for G61 in an excited state of apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> provides strong evidence that the transition observed via CEST is a dimerization process to a native-like conformation. In addition to G61, three other residues were identified with minor state dips that were well separated from those of the ground state (G51: 8.3 ppm, N53: 8.1 ppm, T54: 3.8 ppm chemical shift changes), and all localized to the same region of the protein structure. As with G61, these chemical shift differences were essentially identical to those observed between monomeric and dimeric apoSOD1<sup>S–S</sup> in conventional NMR studies of ground state conformers. The <sup>15</sup>N CEST profiles for G51, N53, T54, and G61 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) are all clearly protein concentration-dependent, consistent with a dimerization event. Because these residues localize to a region of the protein that comprises the dimer interface in Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>2</sub>SOD1<sup>S–S</sup> and report on native dimerization, we included additional residues as reporters so long as a decrease in solvent accessible surface area of greater than 2 Å<sup>2</sup> was calculated between the monomer and the native dimer. A complete list of residues selected in this manner is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. Notably, R<sub>ex</sub> values obtained from <sup>15</sup>N CPMG measurements for the four residues reporting on process I for which the largest dispersions were obtained (G51, N53, T54, and G61:maximum of 3 s<sup>−1</sup>, see below) displayed the same temperature dependence (increase in R<sub>ex</sub> with increasing temperature), as would be expected for probes reporting on the same exchange event.</p><p>Interestingly, <sup>15</sup>N CEST profiles for residues involved in process I in pWT apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> (that included 2 B<sub>1</sub> fields—31 and 59 Hz) could not be well fit together using a two-state exchange model even at the single residue level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Therefore, additional fits involving three-state models, as described above in ‘Three-state fitting of CEST and CPMG data’ were performed, based on an extensive grid search of parameter space to obtain optimum rate constants of exchange and populations of the interconverting states. However, combined analysis of <sup>15</sup>N CEST and <sup>15</sup>N CPMG profiles for residues G51, N53, T54, and G61 (largest Δϖ values) could not simultaneously be well fit to a three-state model. This is not unexpected given that the native dimer interface participates in three different oligomerization processes (I, III, and IV), as discussed in the text. In order to estimate the excited state dimer population and its lifetime for the pWT protein, residue-specific CEST data at each B<sub>1</sub> field were fitted separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In this case, fits improve significantly and estimates for the excited state population range from 1.5–4.5% (1.3 mM protein concentration) and its lifetime from 2.2–4.5 ms. By means of comparison, high quality two-state fits of <sup>15</sup>N CPMG data from residues reporting on process I in the G85R mutant (in which process II is eliminated and process IV decreases significantly) were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and the resultant Δϖ values correlate well with those obtained via CEST. Further, CPMG profiles acquired at 2 B<sub>o</sub> fields for residues N53 and T54 of pWT apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> reporting on process I could also be fit well (together) to a two-state model and Δϖ values derived from the fit are in excellent agreement with those obtained from CEST measurements.</p><p>Despite the fact that the exchange dynamics at the level of the dimer interface are complex, all CEST profiles showed only a single minor dip and its position (and hence the chemical shift of the probe in the excited state) was determined robustly, even when the exchange parameters were not.

Large CEST dips corresponding to a minor state conformation were observed in pWT apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> profiles for both T135 and T137 that match the expected positions of a state in which the helix is present (∼10 ppm upfield from resonance positions of the major conformation in both cases). This provides strong evidence for an excited state in which the electrostatic loop helix is formed. Amino acids localized to the electrostatic loop (residues 130–140) were thus selected as reporting on process II (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Focusing on <sup>15</sup>N CEST profiles for residues in this region with large separations between major and minor dips (Δϖ values &gt; 3 ppm) clearly establishes that the sizes of the minor dips are independent of protein concentration, as expected for a unimolecular process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, all the minor state <sup>15</sup>N CEST dips assigned to this process disappeared in the G85R mutant, as would be expected for residues reporting on the same event. Further, in A4V apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> minor dips in <sup>15</sup>N CEST profiles involving residues reporting on process II could be distinctly observed, though those for the concentration-dependent processes I, III, and IV were no longer present.

(ii) Residues involved in the generation of the excited state of process III localize to a very specific region of structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Formation of a symmetric dimer with each monomer contributing the same interfacial region can account for the shift changes. More complex models of oligomerization need not be invoked, but if they are then additional interfaces would have to be involved. This is not consistent with the localization of chemical shift changes to only a specific region of structure. (iii) Residues involved in the interface of the oligomer generated from process IV localize to two distinct regions and the chemical shift perturbations can be explained by the formation of an asymmetric dimer, as the simplest model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This does not prove that the structure is dimeric and as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>, more complex models involving additional subunits can be generated simply by extending the basic dimeric building block using the same interfaces as those involved in formation of the various dimers via processes I, III and IV.

The Zn-loop residues (49-80) and the electrostatic loop (126–143) were fixed to the coordinates of the crystal structure in initial trial runs, but subsequently defined as completely flexible segments to generate dimers for processes III and IV. For process I, only the electrostatic loop was allowed to be fully flexible because chemical shifts indicate that the Zn-loop becomes ordered upon forming the excited state dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In all HADDOCK runs, histidine protonation states were set using the software WhatIf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vriend, 1990</xref>). Docking was done in three stages starting with an initial rigid body step, followed by semi-flexible simulated annealing and a final refinement in explicit water. 1000 structures were generated in the initial rigid-body docking step and the 200 lowest energy structures were chosen for subsequent annealing and refinement.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the CIHR (EMM and LEK).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Volker Dötsch, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a beautiful work that provides unprecedented atomic insight into the conformational landscape of the immature SOD1 protein (apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>). The system is of exceptional biomedical importance given its involvement in ALS. The authors used an integrated NMR approach spearheaded by CEST and CPMG techniques that provide structural, kinetic and thermodynamic information on alternate, lowly populated conformational states. These very detailed experiments revealed, for the first time, that apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> undergoes at least 4 distinct conformational exchange processes, three of which involve protein dimerization and the other one an intramolecular helix folding transition. Very interestingly, two of the dimerization processes involve the formation of non-native dimers. Untangling such a complex conformational equilibrium (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) is extremely challenging. In addition to obtaining kinetics and populations of the excited states, they also determined the chemical shifts of these states and using docking programs they were able to obtain structural models of the various conformational states.</p><p>However, every description of a complex system requires some simplification and regarding the justification of these simplifications some questions remain:</p><p>1) For process I, the excited state chemical shifts, derived from the CEST spectra, resemble those of the native dimer. While it is clear that the CEST data do report on native dimer formation, the fact that they can be fitted neither to two- or three-state exchange models underscores the complexity of the system and the difficulty in determining accurate kinetic parameters. Some discussion about additional processes that may contribute to the exchange behavior is needed.</p><p>2) For process II, the authors invoke a mechanism involving helix formation within the electrostatic loop. They argue that this process is independent of all other processes for the molecule. However, they are unable to model this process as 2-state and again resort to 3-state fitting. In this case the authors appear to fit only linear three-state models. In the SI they show two such schemes. It is not clear which one of these schemes is correct, however only the second scheme (off-pathway) is mentioned in the text and no explanation of this behavior is offered. Might it be due to isomerization of proline 62, with the cis and trans states forming helix at different rates? A number of residues around Pro62 show splitting in the HSQC spectrum. The authors observe that the mutation G85R modifies both process II and IV; does this indicate that these two processes are not independent? Is it possible that the rate of formation of the asymmetric dimer via process IV depends on the presence or absence of the electrostatic loop helix?</p><p>3) The kinetic scheme shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is oversimplified and none of the processes are truly independent; the monomer exchanges at comparable rates with all of the dimer states and with the helical state and most residues would therefore be expected to exhibit very complex multi-state exchange behavior. The kinetic scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> seems to suggest that native helix formation in the monomer (process II) precludes the formation of any dimer, including the native dimer. Can the helical state of the monomer dimerize? If not, then why is helix formation not also observed in process I? The processes that form the three dimer species are not independent but are mutually exclusive in that the formation of one dimer means that a different dimer does not form. Further, given that all the dimers are simply rotations of one of the subunits there is no reason to believe that they cannot directly exchange with one another. In this case a much more complex cubic kinetic scheme would be more appropriate than <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p>4) The deconvolution of the dispersion and CEST data to assign residues to the different exchange processes and identify contact sites is not well described and is not entirely convincing. Given the numerous processes involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), it would appear that much of the protein would show multi-state exchange profiles. Identification of chemical shift changes that are uniquely associated with individual processes is difficult and assignment of contact restraints is questionable. Is it not possible that some of the shift changes reflect conformational changes rather than direct contacts within the dimer states? How can the authors justify removal of the restraint for L67, simply because it is violated in structure calculations for non-native dimer 1? This appears to be the only active restraint for process III that differentiates the non-native dimer 1 structure from that of the native dimer formed by process I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A better explanation is required as to how the structure of non-native dimer 1 was determined when the only active restraint was persistently violated. Many of the residues that apparently report on process III are not used as restraints in the docking calculation (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and Figure 8–figure supplement 1). Why is this? This comment also applies to process IV (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and Figure 8–figure supplement 1). The residues identified with process IV in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> appear to be scattered over much of the protein surface and there seems to be more going on than formation of a non-native dimer. The authors need to do a better job of describing, in the main text, the constraints used and how they were derived.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is misleading, giving the impression that a large number of residues marked with spheres were used to determine the dimer structures. A more informative figure would show all of the residues that are associated with each process and color code those residues that were used as active restraints in the HADDOCK calculations. This would provide the reader with an immediate visual assessment of the extent and quality of data used in the structure calculations; at the moment, this information is available only in the supplemental table.</p><p>6) A final concern is that the paper seems to gloss over the asymmetry of the non-native SOD1 dimer 2. It seems from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> that this is an asymmetric dimer. For asymmetric dimers the resonances of residues located in the interface are expected to be split, which should have implications for fitting of CEST and CPMG data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07296.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) For process I, the excited state chemical shifts, derived from the CEST spectra, resemble those of the native dimer.

Some discussion about additional processes that may contribute to the exchange behavior is needed</italic>.</p><p>Part of the reason that the native dimer process in pWT is multi-state is because of interference from fluctuating magnetic fields arising in other processes. This is seen from the fact that for G85R apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>, where process II is eliminated and process IV is reduced, the CPMG profiles for process I can be nicely fit to two-state. We have added discussion about the exchange behaviour of all processes in a new section in Results, titled ‘Complications arising from multiple exchange processes’. With reference to process I, we add:</p><p>“For example, CEST profiles of G51, N53, T54 and G61 clearly establish that these residues report on native dimerization, with shift differences in excess of ∼4 ppm between ground and excited state conformers. […]The inability to fit the dispersion data for these residues in the pWT protein is, thus, at least in part the result of fluctuating local magnetic fields that arise from a number of simultaneous proximal processes.”</p><p><italic>2) For process II, the authors invoke a mechanism involving helix formation within the electrostatic loop. They argue that this process is independent of all other processes for the molecule. However, they are unable to model this process as 2-state and again resort to 3-state fitting. In this case the authors appear to fit only linear three-state models</italic>.</p><p>Our data is not good enough to reliably resolve the triangular model from linear ones and we have a statement to that effect in Materials and methods under the section titled “Three-state fitting of CEST and CPMG data”:</p><p>“The CEST and CPMG data were not of sufficiently high quality to distinguish the triangular model with all three states connected from the linear schemes described above, so the simplest linear 3-state schemes were selected.”</p><p><italic>In the SI they show two such schemes. It is not clear which one of these schemes is correct, however only the second scheme (off-pathway) is mentioned in the text and no explanation of this behavior is offered</italic>.</p><p>We cannot distinguish between the on-pathway and the off-pathway models with statistical significance, as both models fit the available data equally well. The numbers that we cite for populations and lifetimes in the Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, as well as now in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, are the mean and standard deviation of the parameter values obtained from the two models. In other words, the reported parameter values are averages over the models. Despite the difference between the two models (on-pathway vs off-pathway), the values for the excited state lifetime (12.4 ms vs 13.6 ms) and populations (2.0 % vs 2.2%) obtained as detailed in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref> are very similar to one another. Indeed, these are the only two parameters we would expect to reliably extract from a three-state fit of CEST profiles where the third state is not explicitly observed as a minor CEST dip but is necessary for obtaining a robust fit.</p><p>We have clarified this point in the figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>Might it be due to isomerization of proline 62, with the cis and trans states forming helix at different rates? A number of residues around Pro62 show splitting in the HSQC spectrum. The authors observe that the mutation G85R modifies both process II and IV; does this indicate that these two processes are not independent</italic>?</p><p>Proline isomerization is typically too slow to be detected by CEST (k<sub>ex</sub> &gt; 20 s<sup>-1</sup>) or CPMG (k<sub>ex</sub> &gt; 100 s<sup>-1</sup>) methods. If indeed Pro isomerization was an obligate on-pathway step for the formation of the helical folded state, CEST dips would not be observed for this process because of the slow rate of exchange between cis and trans Pro. Consequently, we think it is highly unlikely that the three-state behaviour is due to Pro isomerization.</p><p>In the A4V mutant, where all three dimerization processes (I, III and IV) have been eliminated, helix formation (process II) can be adequately modeled as a two-state process, suggesting that the observed three-state behaviour in pWT for helix folding is a result of interference between process II and one or more of the dimerization events, which share some common regions.</p><p>The G85R mutant affects both process II and process IV, primarily because the mutation is located in a region of the protein capable of affecting both processes. G85, N86 and V87 are residues which show dispersions belonging to process IV. So it is not surprising that the G85R mutation affects process IV. Further, in wild type SOD1, G85, F45 and D124 (in the electrostatic loop) are involved in a hydrogen bonding network, and this provides some rationale for the G85R mutation can lead to the elimination of process II that involves residues in the electrostatic loop.</p><p><italic>Is it possible that the rate of formation of the asymmetric dimer via process IV depends on the presence or absence of the electrostatic loop helix</italic>?</p><p>While processes II and IV do have residues in common, we do not think they are thermodynamically coupled, because process IV can be eliminated without affecting process II in the A4V mutant. Moreover, a coupling of the two would suggest that process II should be concentration dependent (dimerization process IV is) and this is not observed. We have now added an additional paragraph in the Discussion discussing the kinetic scheme that we propose (of necessity highly simplified). See response to point 3 immediately following.</p><p><italic>3) The kinetic scheme shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref> <italic>is oversimplified and none of the processes are truly independent; the monomer exchanges at comparable rates with all of the dimer states and with the helical state and most residues would therefore be expected to exhibit very complex multi-state exchange behavior.

[…] these processes involve populations of conformers that are below the detection limits of CEST and CPMG methods.”</p><p><italic>4) The deconvolution of the dispersion and CEST data to assign residues to the different exchange processes and identify contact sites is not well described and is not entirely convincing. Given the numerous processes involved (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref><italic>), it would appear that much of the protein would show multi-state exchange profiles. Identification of chemical shift changes that are uniquely associated with individual processes is difficult and assignment of contact restraints is questionable</italic>.</p><p>We provided a detailed description of how residues were sorted into different processes in the Materials and methods section. In order to further clarify this point, we have added a new figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, summarizing the essential details involved in identifying the residues belonging to each process. We have also added <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, which summarizes how processes were distinguished from one another and complements the details provided in Discussion, Materials and methods and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref> and its associated legend.</p><p>Indeed conformational exchange in apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> is complicated by the presence of multiple processes and the fact that probes of the different processes can be proximal. However, we have used a combination of complementary experiments, conditions (concentrations and temperatures) and mutants to tease out the residues belonging to each exchange process and define restraints for structural modelling (as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, Results and Discussion, and Materials and methods). The assignment of restraints is further supported by the robust characterization of each non-native dimer interface, as seen from the small number of restraint violations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>) and in controls where essentially identical structures are recovered when one restraint is left out at a time in the HADDOCK structure calculations (legend to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>Is it not possible that some of the shift changes reflect conformational changes rather than direct contacts within the dimer states? How can the authors justify removal of the restraint for L67, simply because it is violated in structure calculations for non-native dimer 1</italic>?</p><p>This is definitely a possibility and a drawback of using chemical shifts as input restraints in HADDOCK. We believe that L67 is changing in chemical shift during process III not because it is at the interface but because it is either sensing fluctuating fields in the vicinity or is a part of a secondary conformational/allosteric effect resulting from dimer formation. We have clarified this point in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref> where we state:</p><p>“It appears that spin probes from L67 are not localized to the non-native dimer interface but rather report on a secondary process that depends on dimerization, such as a change in conformation.”</p><p><italic>This appears to be the only active restraint for process III that differentiates the non-native dimer 1 structure from that of the native dimer formed by process I (</italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data"><italic>Supplementary file 1</italic></xref><italic>). A better explanation is required as to how the structure of non-native dimer 1 was determined when the only active restraint was persistently violated</italic>.</p><p>First, L67 is not the only active restraint. There are 12 other active restraints (2 x 6) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The reviewers are correct in stating that L67 is indeed one of the few active residues in process III that is not present in process I (I17 is another one – it is not active in Process I) and was identified using the L67Cδ methyl resonance. There are two reasons why L67 was not considered in process I. Firstly, it does not bury significant surface area at the native dimer interface, which is the criterion for selecting a residue to report on process I. Secondly, the amide resonance of L67 is in an overlapped region of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum and reliable CEST profiles of L67 could not be obtained. However, we have now recorded <sup>15</sup>N CEST profiles of L67 by resolving the spectral overlap in a third <sup>13</sup>CO dimension (manuscript in preparation). We find that the excited state <sup>15</sup>N chemical shift of L67 matches well with the value in holo SOD, confirming that L67 also responds to process I. Thus, L67 is a probe of both processes I and III.</p><p>We have added a paragraph in Results under the section ‘Structural models of excited states of pWT apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>’ to elaborate on why the structure of non-native dimer 1 is different from the native dimer, considering that the restraints from process III are essentially a subset of process I. The explanation turns out to be quite simple.</p><p>“Notably, the restraints used to model the excited state formed via this process (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>) localize to the native dimer interface on one side of the monomer […], leading to a structure where one of the monomers is rotated 180<sup>o</sup> compared to the native dimer.”</p><p><italic>Many of the residues that apparently report on process III are not used as restraints in the docking calculation (compare</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref> <italic>and Figure 8–figure supplement 1).

This comment also applies to process IV (compare</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref> <italic>and Figure 8–figure supplement 1)</italic>.</p><p>This is because many of the residues responding to the dimerization event are not solvent exposed and cannot be used to define the interface in the form of a HADDOCK restraint, as only solvent accessible residues are used as restraints in HADDOCK. In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, we now explicitly state how residues for each process were selected, and how restraints for HADDOCK were chosen from among the selected residues.</p><p><italic>The residues identified with process IV in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref> <italic>appear to be scattered over much of the protein surface and there seems to be more going on than formation of a non-native dimer</italic>.</p><p>The residues identified for process IV are indeed scattered all over the protein, and the restraints derived from these residues cannot be satisfied by a symmetric dimer. However the restraints are adequately satisfied in an asymmetric dimer, wherein a fraction of the restraints localized to one part of the molecule contribute to the interface of one of the monomers in the asymmetric dimer, while the remaining fraction forms the interface of the other monomer. We have elaborated on this point in the new version of the paper by adding the following in the ‘Structural models of excited states of pWT apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>’ section:</p><p>“Unlike both dimeric structures formed via processes I and III, the second non-native dimer (non-native dimer 2, process IV) is asymmetric […] that brings one cluster on one monomer close to the remaining clusters on a second molecule.”</p><p><italic>The authors need to do a better job of describing, in the main text, the constraints used and how they were derived</italic>.</p><p>We have now added a new figure and a new table, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, to the main manuscript to summarize the details of how residues were selected for each process and how restraints were picked from the selected residues.

A more informative figure would show all of the residues that are associated with each process and color code those residues that were used as active restraints in the HADDOCK calculations. This would provide the reader with an immediate visual assessment of the extent and quality of data used in the structure calculations; at the moment, this information is available only in the supplemental table</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) is a key figure intended to highlight the regions of the protein involved in the interface of dimers from processes I, III and IV. We believe this figure is important in demonstrating crucial structural features of the non-native dimers in juxtaposition to the native one, and to bring across the point that native dimerization can effectively chaperone SOD1 from forming aberrant interactions. Consequently, we have opted to retain <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> as is. However, we wish to point out in response to the above comment that we do have figures detailing the residues involved in the non-native processes shown on the structure of SOD1 (panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref>) as well as similar figures showing only the active and passive restraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref> panel A) relevant for each dimer process, since we also considered this information important. We chose not to show residues selected as parts of processes I and II because they were chosen based on our initial idea of what each process was.</p><p><italic>6) A final concern is that the paper seems to gloss over the asymmetry of the non-native SOD1 dimer 2. It seems from</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9C</italic></xref> <italic>that this is an asymmetric dimer. For asymmetric dimers the resonances of residues located in the interface are expected to be split, which should have implications for fitting of CEST and CPMG data</italic>.</p><p>Non-native dimer 2 is indeed asymmetric. In order to clarify the implications of formation of an asymmetric dimer on the Bloch-McConnell equations relevant for fitting CEST and CPMG data, we have added a paragraph in the Materials and methods section ‘Separating probes of processes I-IV’ subsection ‘Process IV: transient non-native dimer II formation’ where we state:</p><p>“In general, asymmetric dimerization is described in terms of a three-state exchange process, whereby a particular nucleus can have different chemical shifts in the monomer (ω<sub>M</sub>) and in each of the monomers that comprise the dimer (ω<sub>D1</sub>, ω<sub>D2</sub>). However, for the particular case where the environment of the spin probe changes in only one of the monomers of the dimer, as in the case of process IV, it is reasonable to assume that ω<sub>D2</sub> = ω<sub>M</sub>. In this case, and if the differences in intrinsic transverse relaxation rates of the monomer and dimer are not significantly different, the three-state Bloch-McConnell equations for transverse magnetization (M<sub>+</sub>) reduce to a form similar to those describing a two-state exchange process and are given by<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>[2]</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtable columnalign="center"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where k<sub>MD</sub> and k<sub>DM</sub> are the rate constants for formation and dissociation of the dimer, respectively (manuscript in preparation).
