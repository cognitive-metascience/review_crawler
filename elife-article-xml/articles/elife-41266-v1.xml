Here we examine the hunchback P2 (HbP2) enhancer which drives a sharp expression pattern in the Drosophila blastoderm embryo in response to the transcriptional activator Bicoid (Bcd). We systematically interrogate cis and trans factors that influence the shape and position of expression driven by HbP2, and find that the prevailing model, based on pairwise cooperative binding of Bcd to HbP2 is not adequate. We demonstrate that other proteins, such as pioneer factors, Mediator and histone modifiers influence the shape and position of the HbP2 expression pattern. Comparing our results to theory reveals how higher-order cooperativity and energy expenditure impact boundary location and sharpness. Our results emphasize that the bacterial view of transcription regulation, where pairwise interactions between regulatory proteins dominate, must be reexamined in animals, where multiple molecular mechanisms collaborate to shape the gene regulatory function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41266.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Building an organism from scratch requires genes to be switched on or off at precisely the right time, in the right place, and at the right level. Enhancers are stretches of DNA that work as switches to turn on target genes. For instance, in the front part of fruit fly embryos, the P2 enhancer switches on a gene called <italic>Hunchback</italic>, which is crucial for development.</p><p>A number of molecular actors, including proteins called transcription factors, work together to turn on genes by interacting with enhancers. Genes like <italic>Hunchback</italic> can turn on suddenly, even though they are controlled by transcription factors whose levels are changing gradually: in other words, if <italic>Hunchback</italic> were controlled by a light switch with a dimmer, the light would suddenly come on as the dimmer was gradually moved up. For enhancers, the question is how transcription factors interact with DNA to convert a gradual input into an abrupt, sharp switch. A commonly accepted view is that <italic>Hunchback</italic> is turned on when molecules of a transcription factor called Bicoid help each other to bind to multiple binding sites on the P2 enhancer.</p><p>Park et al. investigated this mechanism by examining how the <italic>Hunchback</italic> gene responded to changes in the sequence of the P2 enhancer, and to changes in the levels of regulatory proteins that bind to it. The resulting observations were then compared to mathematical models that simulate turning on <italic>Hunchback</italic> under different conditions. The experiments revealed that, in fact, switching on <italic>Hunchback</italic> requires more than Bicoid proteins helping each other to bind on the P2 enhancers. Molecules other than Bicoid were also needed, and the cell also potentially had to burn energy.</p><p>Variations in the sequence of enhancers are linked to evolution of new species but also to problems in development or even diseases such as cancer. Understanding precisely how these sequences turn on genes will give us insight into which types of changes are important for disease and evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>enhancer</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5K99HD073191-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wunderlich</surname><given-names>Zeba</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM122928</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gunawardena</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name><name><surname>DePace</surname><given-names>Angela H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006781</institution-id><institution>Giovanni Armenise-Harvard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DePace</surname><given-names>Angela H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The sharp expression pattern driven by a classic, simple animal enhancer is determined by multiple molecular mechanisms, not only cooperative binding of the activating transcription factor as was previously thought.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During development, multicellular organisms control cell differentiation by expressing genes in intricate patterns in space and time. These patterns are achieved by interactions between regulatory proteins and DNA, which convert incoming signals into transcription of mRNA; we refer to the quantitative relationship between the concentrations of transcription factors and the rate of mRNA, or protein, expression in steady state as the Gene Regulatory Function (GRF). Many GRFs for developmental genes are highly non-linear; they convert graded inputs to sharp, step-like outputs. A key mechanistic question is therefore how a sharp GRF is encoded in the regulatory DNA sequence and the interactions of proteins that regulate it.</p><p>In animals, gene expression patterns are controlled by enhancers, regulatory DNA comprised of multiple binding sites for transcription factors (TFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>). The canonical model of how an enhancer gives rise to a non-linear GRF focuses on pairwise cooperative TF binding to these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Val et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jolma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Panne et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rodda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Struhl, 2001</xref>), an idea that first emerged to explain gene regulation in phage lambda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Johnson et al., 1979</xref>) and has since been widely applied to other systems including eukaryotes. For example, the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Hunchback P2 enhancer (HbP2) drives a highly nonlinear GRF in response to the transcriptional activator Bicoid (Bcd) in the early embryo; it has long been thought that the nonlinearity arises from pairwise cooperative binding of Bcd to six DNA binding sites in the enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Driever et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ma et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Struhl et al., 1989</xref>). Eukaryotic TFs can indeed influence each other’s binding through direct protein-protein interactions (for Bcd examples include (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burz and Hanes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lebrecht et al., 2005</xref>), and this observation led to substantial efforts to find a ‘cis-regulatory code’ where the position, orientation and affinity of TF binding sites can predict the output of a given enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yáñez-Cuna et al., 2013</xref>). However, such a code has remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catarino and Stark, 2018</xref>), indicating that there are likely additional molecular mechanisms contributing to non-linear GRF formation.</p><p>In addition to direct protein-protein interactions between TFs, there are many ways that TFs can cooperate indirectly, especially in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gertz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>). The eukaryotic transcriptional machinery involves not only TFs, but also chromatin remodeling machinery, and cofactors that relay information about TF binding to the basal transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Taatjes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hargreaves and Crabtree, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Levine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</xref>). Thus cooperativity between TFs can potentially arise indirectly through any mechanism that facilitates subsequent TF binding, or through synergistic activation of the basal transcriptional machinery. Indirect mechanisms that can affect TF binding include collaborative cooperativity, where TFs each affect nucleosome binding or modification state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mirny, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Voss et al., 2011</xref>), TFs co-binding to a co-factor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Taatjes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borggrefe and Yue, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), TFs altering the topology of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Courey, 2001</xref>) or TFs increasing the effective local concentration of other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Landman et al., 2017</xref>). Indirect mechanisms that do not rely on facilitating TF binding include synergistic activation of the basal transcriptional machinery through multiple allosteric interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nussinov et al., 2013</xref>), or synergy through activation of multiple steps in the transcription cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coulon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duarte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Govind et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herschlag and Johnson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scholes et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We recently used mathematical theory, grounded in molecular biophysics, to explore the mechanisms underlying nonlinear GRFs generated by a single activating TF, inspired by the example of HbP2 activation by Bcd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Estrada et al., 2016b</xref>). GRFs are often characterized by fitting experimental data to a Hill function, which parameterizes the shape of a GRF in terms of three parameters (below) but does not give any mechanistic or biophysical insight into how the GRF arises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weiss, 1997</xref>). The GRF of early anterior Hunchback expression with respect to Bcd fits a Hill function with coefficient 5–6. It is often informally assumed that this can be explained in terms of pairwise cooperative binding of Bcd to six sites in HbP2, with the Hill coefficient matching the number of sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Driever et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gregor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lopes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ma et al., 1996</xref>). We used our mathematical theory to prove that this assumption is unfounded, providing further evidence that additional mechanisms are required to fully explain the response of HbP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Singh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fu et al., 2004</xref>). We showed that if there are <italic>n</italic> binding sites for a transcriptional activator, the GRF can reach a Hill coefficient of nearly <italic>n</italic> only through two non-exclusive mechanisms: either there is ‘higher-order’ cooperativity, through which binding of a TF to one site can be influenced by multiple other sites, or there is energy expenditure which maintains the regulatory system away from thermodynamic equilibrium.</p><p>In this study, we experimentally probe the mechanisms underlying the shape of the HbP2 GRF using quantitative experiments and compare the results to our previously developed theory. We created a number of variants of HbP2, where we changed the number of Bcd binding sites and the background sequence of HbP2; we measured the resulting GRFs using quantitative imaging of reporter constructs in embryos. A synthetic version of HbP2 containing only Bcd binding sites indicates that other TFs play a role in determining the anterior/posterior position of the GRF. We perturbed the concentration of multiple transcriptional cofactors using RNAi and found that cofactors can also affect the shape of the HbP2 GRF, both in terms of the anterior/posterior position of expression and the steepness of the curve. Finally, we compared our experimental results to theoretical predictions for HbP2 and its variants; this comparison confirms our previous conclusion that higher cooperativity and/or energy expenditure are required to achieve the sharp response of HbP2 to Bcd. Together, our results demonstrate that the shape of the non-linear HbP2 GRF is determined by multiple underlying molecular mechanisms which can be regulated independently and collectively by distinct inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The HbP2 reporter system</title><p>Our study focuses on a canonical developmental enhancer, HbP2, that drives expression of hunchback (hb) in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> blastoderm embryo. The anterior expression of hb is set by three enhancers: HbP2, which is promoter-proximal, a distal shadow enhancer and a distal stripe enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). HbP2 drives early expression of hb at nuclear cycle 14, while the shadow enhancer and stripe enhancer contribute to expression at later times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Perry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Perry et al., 2011</xref>). Many studies have correlated in vivo hb expression (using either hb mRNA or protein) to HbP2 sequence features without accounting for these other enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gregor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duarte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lopes et al., 2012</xref>); this approach is only valid when analysing early timepoints when HbP2 is active and the others are not, and even then may suffer from errors. To control for this complexity, we isolated HbP2 in a reporter construct consisting of HbP2 and the native hunchback promoter driving expression of lacZ (hereafter called WTHbP2). This construct is the basis for our permuted enhancers, including Bcd binding site deletions and synthetic hbP2 constructs (SynHbP2 plus variants thereof). We inserted all reporter constructs into the attP2 landing site on chromosome 3LT via PhiC31 integrase-mediated transgenesis (see Materials and Methods).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41266.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The WTHbP2 enhancer directs a sharp expression pattern in the Drosophila blastoderm embryo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of the hunchback (hb) gene locus showing the three enhancers active in the blastoderm (top) and our reporter construct designed to express lacZ mRNA from the proximal enhancer (HbP2) and hb native promoter.

We measured the Bcd expression profile using fluorescent immunostaining, both separately and in embryos co-stained for LacZ mRNA (see Materials and Methods). We imaged entire embryos using 2-photon microscopy and parsed image stacks into cellular resolution pointclouds using a semi-automated pipeline (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fowlkes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fowlkes et al., 2008</xref>) and Materials and Methods). Full 3D images of embryos are particularly useful for alignment, which reduces error due to dorsal ventral variation in the hb expression pattern. We gathered data from the earliest stages of nuclear cycle 14 when HbP2 is active. In subsequent figures, we present a subset of this full 3D dataset for simplicity; we show a lateral trace along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Full cellular resolution data are available for download from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/s/e01d29ef80d10b46755f">Figshare</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8235491.v1">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8235491.v1</ext-link> [1]).</p><p>To analyze the relationship between Bcd concentration and transcription driven by HbP2, we extract the gene regulatory function (GRF) relating these two quantities. The Bcd gradient is highly reproducible from embryo to embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gregor et al., 2007</xref>); we therefore plot the average Bcd protein profile from six embryos against the LacZ expression profile from individual embryos stained for LacZ mRNA driven by the HbP2 reporters. We chose to analyze individual reporter output against the average Bcd profile for two reasons. First, by obtaining an average Bcd profile once and using it as a standard, our embryos can be stained either for protein or RNA, but not both; incompatibilities between in situ hybridization (to detect LacZ) and immunostaining (to detect Bcd protein) lead to noisier data than staining for either alone. Second, we can detect if our perturbations affect variability in expression pattern between individual embryos, which would otherwise be masked in average to average fitting which is commonly used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gregor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lopes et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>For convenience of analysis, we will describe the shape of our GRFs by fitting lateral traces to a Hill function of the form,<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>/</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Here, E is the hb mRNA expression level in steady state, in arbitrary units, with Emax being its maximal value. The Hill coefficient, nH, is a measure of how sharply the GRF changes, while the parameter Ka gives the concentration at which the expression level becomes half-maximal and determines the location of the GRF on the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the embryo. We will refer to Ka as the ‘generalised Michaelis-Menten constant’ (gMM constant), as it reduces to the well-known Michaelis-Menten constant when the GRF becomes a hyperbolic function with a Hill coefficient of 1. As noted above, the Hill function gives little biophysical insight but it offers a widely-used measure of shape. We will later interpret the shape of the GRF in terms of the mathematical theory that we introduced previously, from which we will draw more mechanistic conclusions.</p><p>We measure a Hill coefficient for the endogenous hb mRNA expression pattern of 6.2 +/- 1.1, which corresponds with other reports in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gregor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lopes et al., 2012</xref>). For WTHbP2, the Hill coefficient is 5.2+/- 0.3, indicating that HbP2 enhancer alone can drive sharp expression comparable to expression from native hb locus. The boundary position for the HbP2 pattern (gMM = 0.072 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mo>±</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> 0.011) is also comparable to that of the endogenous hb (gMM = 0.063 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mo>±</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>0.011).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HbP2 variants do not adhere to the classical hill function model</title><p>A common assumption based on Hill fits to the endogenous Hb mRNA pattern is that Bcd binds cooperatively to 6 Bcd binding sites in HbP2 and that this gives rise to a Hill coefficient of ~6; more generally this model states that cooperative binding at <italic>n</italic> sites gives rise to a Hill function with coefficient nH = <italic>n</italic>. A concrete test of this hypothesis is to measure the GRF when Bcd binding sites are removed from WTHbP2 where this ‘classical Hill function model’ predicts two outcomes. First, removing all Bcd binding sites from HbP2 should eliminate expression. Second, deleting individual Bcd binding sites should lead to a progressive, integral decrease in the Hill coefficient. We tested the classical Hill function model by mutating individual Bcd binding sites in the WTHbP2 reporter and measuring LacZ expression. We deleted each Bcd binding site in series starting from the distal end relative to the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41266.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sequence variants of HbP2 contradict the classical Hill function model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (left) Schematics of hbP2-reporter constructs with Bcd binding sites sequentially removed by mutation to preserve the length of the construct.

This indicates that other binding sites, either for Bcd or other TFs, contribute to HbP2 expression, which has been previously argued in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Holloway and Spirov, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu and Ma, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mito et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). We analyzed the sequence of HbP2 and hb native promoter and found two predicted binding sites for Bcd. Removing these additional sites further reduced gene expression level, however it did not completely abolish it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, while the Hill coefficient does decrease as Bcd sites are removed, it only decreases by ~0.5 for each site removed. Removing Bcd binding sites also decreases the gMM constant and shifts the expression of HbP2 toward the anterior. Together, these results indicate that the assumption that Hill coefficient follows a one-to-one relationship with the number of binding sites in the enhancer is wrong, as we would have predicted from our biophysical model.</p><p>A common question is whether individual Bcd binding sites contribute differently to the WTHbP2 GRF. Of the six Bicoid binding sites, three are strong affinity sites (sTFBSs) and three weak affinity sites (wTFBSs). wTFBSs are clustered together at the center of WTHbP2 while sTFBS are located on the flanks with varying distance to the nearest Bcd binding site (13 bp to 106 bp, center to center). The role of these individual sites has been investigated in terms of pairwise interactions between Bcd molecules in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ma et al., 1996</xref>) and in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burz and Hanes, 2001</xref>), where binding is influenced by the location and orientation of the sites. The role of individual binding sites in embryos has been explored, but without quantitative imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Driever et al., 1989</xref>), making the effects difficult to discern.</p><p>We also did limited experiments to test whether the affinity or location of the weak and strong Bcd binding sites influences the WTHbP2 GRF in our reporter construct. To compare the effect of weak and strong Bcd binding sites, we deleted single binding sites with different affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In all cases, removing a Bcd binding site decreased the Hill coefficient by ~0.5 indicating that this parameter was not disproportionately affected by any particular site. The gMM constant also decreased sequentially upon TFBS removal without distinctive dependence on any particular single site. To test whether the cluster of weak Bcd binding sites has a disproportionate effect on sharpness, we deleted sets of two and three binding sites, either all in the central cluster or not. We found removing Bcd binding sites from the central cluster differentially affects both the gMM constant and the Hill coefficient, with the central cluster having a moderately larger effect on the gMM but the differences are within error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, these results indicate that all six binding sites contribute roughly equally to GRF shape, despite variations in affinity and position, which was also observed in other work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Bcd and other transcription factors contribute to expression driven by HbP2</title><p>HbP2 contains predicted binding motifs for TFs other than Bcd, including Hb itself and the pioneer factor Zelda (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To test if these other binding sites contribute to the WTHbP2 GRF, we created a synthetic HbP2 enhancer (synHbP2). This sequence maintains the endogenous Bcd binding sites in place but replaces the intervening sequences with computationally designed ‘neutral sequences’; these neutral spacers are devoid of motifs for 11 TFs known to regulate <italic>even-skipped</italic> that are expressed in the blastoderm (Bcd, Cad, dStat, D, Gt, Hb, Kni, Kr, Nub, Tll, Zld) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Estrada et al., 2016a</xref>). We chose this limited list because designing sequences lacking motifs for all 37 TFs expressed in the blastoderm is technically intractable and often results in highly repetitive sequences. Bcd is a homeodomain protein and these are sensitive to DNA shape dictated by sequence outside of the core binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dror et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore made constructs with various amounts of endogenous sequence flanking each Bcd site. Robust expression requires 7 bp of endogenous sequence flanking each Bcd binding site; using only the 7 bp core Bcd binding motif, or motifs flanked by 2 bp did not drive robust expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41266.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Synthetic HbP2 enhancer reveals the contribution of Bicoid and other transcription factors to the shape and location of expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of WTHbP2 illustrating the location and affinity of predicted binding sites for Bicoid (Bcd, dark blue), Hunchback (Hb, green), Zelda (Zld, red), Tailless (tll, grey) and Krüppel (Kr, light blue), and SynHbP2 where these other sites have been replaced by a computationally designed synthetic DNA backbone.

These results indicate that Bcd alone can mediate sharp expression but that other TFs, such as Hb and Zelda may affect the gMM constant and the location of the GRF along the AP axis. To further test the role of Hb and Zelda in mediating a sharp response from HbP2, we knocked down expression of Hb and Zelda in trans using RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

If SynHbP2’s anterior shift is due to missing activity from Hb or Zelda, we expect similar anterior shifts in WTHbP2 expression when depleting these proteins in trans. Indeed, knock-down of hb and Zelda shifted the location of expression by 8% and 5% anteriorly along the AP axis without distinctive changes in the steepness of the response (nH(hbRNAi)=5.9 ± 0.6, nH(Zelda RNAi)=5.8 ± 0.9).

We developed a theoretical framework, rooted in molecular biophysics, to explore how individual TFs contribute to the GRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Estrada et al., 2016b</xref>). If energy is not being expended to regulate transcription, so that regulation may be assumed to take place at thermodynamic equilibrium, our theory allows for arbitrary forms of ‘higher-order’ cooperativity (HOC), through which the affinity of binding at a site can be influenced by binding at multiple other sites. Such HOC allows any form of information integration which can be accomplished at thermodynamic equilibrium to be accommodated in a model. The molecular mechanisms that give rise to such higher-order effects may include chromatin, nucleosomes or co-regulators like Mediator. To assess the shape and location of the GRF, we introduced two non-dimensional parameters, called ‘steepness’ and ‘position’, which correspond to the maximal derivative and the location of the maximal derivative, respectively, of the normalised GRF. These intrinsic measures of shape are more biophysically informative than the nH and gMM constant of a fitted Hill function.</p><p>Higher order effects have rarely been considered previously.

The model underlying these studies, described in detail in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reinitz et al., 2003</xref>), allows for higher order interactions of multiple binding sites, assuming thermodynamic equilibrium. These higher order effects seem important for the accuracy of the model. However, the effects are treated in a phenomenological way, which makes it difficult to draw quantitative comparisons with the biophysical model that we use.</p><p>In our previous work, mRNA expression was treated as an average over different TF binding microstates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Estrada et al., 2016b</xref>). For the present paper, we introduced a more refined model in which RNA polymerase is explicitly recruited to the promoter. In effect, RNA polymerase was treated as another molecular entity which can bind to DNA at a single site. The rate of mRNA expression was then taken to be proportional to the probability of RNA polymerase being bound. This model more accurately represents the behavior of TFs, which include domains that bind specifically to DNA, as well as domains which interact directly or indirectly with RNA polymerase. Accordingly, higher-order cooperativities may arise between TF binding sites (TF-TF HOC) as well as between TF sites and RNA polymerase (TF-Pol HOC).</p><p>Here, we compare our model with various numbers of TF binding sites to our experimental data from deletions of WTHbP2 and SynHbP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In our model, we created GRFs by randomly choosing HOCs, for both TF-TF and TF-Pol, within a plausible range and determined the boundary of the position-steepness region occupied by any of such GRFs. This allows us to ask whether the position and steepness of the experimentally determined GRF is found within this biophysically plausible region. Note that this approach does not require fitting the GRF to experimental data. Instead, we mathematically determine the region of position and steepness in which the data should fall. We find that the WTHbP2 and SynHbP2 GRFs lie on the boundary of the position-steepness region, and that pairwise cooperativities, either TF-TF or TF-Pol, are inadequate to explain the data. Moreover, the deletion constructs yield GRFs whose steepness is higher than the model can accommodate, especially for low numbers of TF binding sites.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41266.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Deleting binding sites from WTHbP2 and SynHbP2 reveals discrepancies between experimentally measured GRFs and a model at thermodynamic equilibrium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Using an updated version of the mathematical model in Estrada et al., we calculated the boundaries of the steepness and position for GRFs that can be generated by six transcription factor binding sites, either including higher-order cooperativities (solid grey line), pairwise TF-TF cooperativities (dashed grey line, lower left) or pairwise TF-Pol cooperativities (dashed grey line, lower right).

For example, there may be cryptic Bcd binding sites that contribute to HbP2 expression. Alternatively, because our model accommodates all thermodynamically feasible mechanisms for a single transcriptional activator, additional regulators may play a crucial role. However, we attempted to control for this possibility by creating SynHbP2, which consists of only Bcd binding sites and still generates expression patterns with position and steepness beyond the limits of our model. We are left to consider whether non-equilibrium models requiring energy dissipation are central to generating the HbP2 GRF. We address these various possibilities further in the Discussion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In 1989, Driever and Nusslein-Volhard proposed that Bcd binds cooperatively to the HbP2 enhancer to generate a sharp response from a graded input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Driever et al., 1989</xref>). Fitting the sigmoidal output of an HbP2 reporter construct to a Hill function revealed a Hill coefficient of 5 to 6, and this was interpreted to mean that Bcd bound cooperatively to HbP2, resulting in a GRF where <italic>n</italic> binding sites give rise to a Hill coefficient of <italic>n</italic>; this idea has been persistent in the Drosophila literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gregor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lopes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Here we test this model directly by making mutations in the HbP2 enhancer and measuring the consequences quantitatively. We first demonstrate that predicted relationship between binding site number and Hill coefficient does not hold. Then, we put forward data to support an alternative model where Bcd, other TFs and co-factors such as Mediator and CBP work together to shape the GRF through two largely separable properties - the steepness and position of the response. Finally, by comparing our results to theory, we propose that either unrecognized Bcd binding sites contribute to HbP2 expression, or that activation by a single TF at thermodynamic equilibrium may not be adequate to explain the response of HbP2, even when accounting for higher order cooperativities between TFs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Experimental distinctions between our work and previous studies</title><p>Our results agree qualitatively with previous studies, including those by Driever and Nusslein-Volhard. Upon removal of Bcd binding sites from HbP2, the expression boundary shifts toward the anterior and the sharpness decreases. However, our constructs do differ from that previous study in some important respects. Driever and Nusslein-Volhard removed Bcd TFBS by truncating WTHbP2 to shorter pieces. This strategy not only removes Bcd TFBS but also other neighboring sequences and it changes the distance of binding sites relative to the promoter. In contrast, our series of HbP2 variants preserve enhancer length, binding site positions and inter-motif sequences. All of our reporters used the native Hb promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Perry et al., 2012</xref>) rather than using the HSP 70 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Driever et al., 1989</xref>) or a smaller fragment of the Hb promoter (+1 to+107) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Driever et al., 1989</xref>). But most significantly, we used quantitative imaging methods to measure the output of our HbP2 variants; this allows us to interpret our data differently. We find that the changes to the GRF upon binding site removal do not conform to the simple model where <italic>n</italic> binding sites can produce a GRF with a Hill coefficient of <italic>n</italic>. Instead, the Hill coefficient decreases by 0.5 with each site removed (rather than by one as would be predicted).</p><p>Our work also differs from recent quantitative studies on the Bcd/Hb GRF. In (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gregor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lopes et al., 2012</xref>), the authors measured the endogenous Hb protein expression profile, whereas we measured mRNA from an HbP2 reporter construct. In (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He et al., 2011</xref>), the authors compared Bcd to endogenous hb mRNA expression using in situ hybridization. Importantly, all of these studies, including ours, largely agree, measuring Hill coefficients between 5 and 6. However endogenous hb mRNA (and endogenous Hb protein) cannot be directly interpreted as the output of the HbP2 GRF because it is difficult to exclude outputs from other hb enhancers that are known to contribute to anterior hb gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Perry et al., 2012</xref>). For the purpose of deciphering the molecular details of an enhancer, our reporter designs and assays provide the most direct experimental tests. Lastly, we note that a recent quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization study showed evidence of ~6 Bicoid molecules bound to the hb locus of earlier stage embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Our results suggest that either more than 6 Bcd molecules are interacting on HbP2, or energy is being spent to maintain the system away from equilibrium.</p><p>Multiple studies have focused on identifying interactions between Bcd molecules that could help explain cooperative binding. The studies used synthetic DNA sequences and mutated proteins in cell culture assays, and came to varied conclusions about the role of distance and clustering between Bcd binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Driever et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ochoa-Espinosa et al., 2005</xref>). In our study using the endogenous enhancer in embryos, the arrangement, position, orientation, clustering and affinity of Bcd binding sites were not distinctive features for the degree of cooperativity. However, the number of perturbations we did to explore these parameters is limited, and it remains possible that they contribute partially to the degree of sharpness in the Bcd/HbP2 GRF.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Flanking sequence influences bcd binding site efficacy</title><p>Bcd belongs to the homeodomain protein family, which recognize a common -TAAT- motif. While some homeodomain proteins have a degenerate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christensen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Noyes et al., 2008a</xref>), Bcd binds to the specific TAATCC motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Noyes et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Noyes et al., 2008b</xref>). Bcd has some unique structural features that allow this specificity, including recognition of -CC by direct contact with K50/R54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baird-Titus et al., 2006</xref>), and recognition of a weak binding motif (-TAAGCT-, X1) by the ‘recognition helix’ that harbors R54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikary et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dave et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhao et al., 2000</xref>). This degree of specific binding makes it reasonable to assume that the core motif would be sufficient for Bcd binding and activity in vivo; however, here we show that including 7 bp of endogenous flanking sequence around each core Bcd motif dramatically increases the activity of a synthetic HbP2 enhancer. When we increased the flanking sequence to 12 bp, we didn’t observe any additional effect. These flanking sequences do not have any obvious similarity to one another, though the number we have is far too small to analyze bioinformatically. We hypothesize that the flanks form a specific DNA shape that is favorable for Bcd recognition, as has been shown for other homeodomain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dror et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Additional bcd binding sites outside HbP2</title><p>Even after all six known binding sites are removed from WTHbP2, we still observe gene expression with a sigmoidal, non-linear response. WTHbP2 does not express at all when Bcd is removed by RNAi (data not shown), indicating that some Bcd responsive element remains even after removing the canonical six sites. In our constructs, WTHbP2 is conjugated with its native hb promoter which is ~500 bp in length. The WTHbP2 sequence contains one additional predicted Bcd binding site in addition to the canonical six which overlaps with a weak binding site, and the native hb promoter also contains an additional predicted Bcd binding site. These two sites are obvious candidates for the residual Bcd responsive activity. We deleted these two additional sites and measured expression; expression is lowered further but still detectable (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also calculated the limits of steepness and position assuming 7 or 8 TFBS and compared the boundaries to the experimental data from our TFBS deletion series. As expected, including 1 or two additional sites broadened the boundary of the steepness/position space. However, experimental data still often fall on the edge of the boundary and at lower number of TFBS, experimental data is outside the the boundary (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because of the complexity of the native WTHbP2 enhancer sequence, we believe that synthetic constructs with defined binding site content such as the one we present here will be an important tool for dissecting the role of individual TF binding sites in dictating a response. In future studies, coupling our SynHbP2 to a synthetic promoter could also prove to be useful. We also note that promoters and enhancers have similar abilities to recruit PolII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Henriques et al., 2018</xref>), and especially in systems like ours where the enhancer is immediately adjacent to the promoter, may need to be considered as a single functional unit.</p><p>Importantly, our conclusion that pairwise cooperative binding of Bcd is inadequate to produce the observed expression from HbP2 is unaffected by how many Bcd sites there are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Estrada et al., 2016b</xref>). However, when considering the role of higher order cooperativity, additional binding sites allow the theory and experiment to be within range of one another. We therefore conclude that future efforts to understand the mechanism of cooperativity for WTHbP2 should focus on how higher order cooperativity can be achieved, or non-equilibrium mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Modulating the position of expression through effective concentration of Bcd</title><p>Multiple perturbations shifted the anterior/posterior location of expression driven by WTHbP2, reflecting a change in the sensitivity to Bcd concentration. We hypothesize that these perturbations all influence the accessibility of WTHbP2, and thus the ability of Bcd to bind. For example, removing binding sites for the pioneer factor Zelda may result in decreased accessibility of WTHbP2, a requirement for higher levels of Bcd to activate expression, and an anterior shift in expression. Similarly, Hb may also facilitate Bcd binding through collaborative cooperativity, and CBP may be necessary to modify nucleosomes. This hypothesis is consistent with previous studies where modulating Bcd concentrations influences the location of expression without altering the steepness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Struhl et al., 1989</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Cofactors shape the gene regulatory function</title><p>Because of their central role in regulating transcription, TFs have been the primary focus of research to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the shape of gene regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Janssens et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Junion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kazemian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Segal and Widom, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zinzen et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, pairwise cooperative binding between TFs has been widely proposed to underlie sharp responses to graded inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">He et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Segal et al., 2008</xref>), though a series of models from the Reinitz group allow for higher-order cooperativity between TFs and other components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reinitz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Janssens et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). In the scenario where cooperative binding between TFs dominates, the many cofactors crucial for eukaryotic gene regulation serve as ‘cogs in the machine’ to relay decisions from TFs to the basal transcriptional machinery.</p><p>Our work calls the TF-centric view into question using both theory and experiment. We show that theory grounded in physics must include higher order cooperativity between TFs to generate GRFs with sufficient steepness and position to compare to in vivo measurements; this assumes that the regulatory mechanism is operating at thermodynamic equilibrium, which may still be inadequate to capture experimental data, indicating that energy dissipation may be required. Cofactors are prime candidates for implementing higher-order cooperativity or energy dissipation through binding directly to multiple TFs or by facilitating their binding through indirect processes such as chromatin remodeling or modification. Indeed, we present experimental evidence that perturbing some cofactors changes the WTHbP2 GRF by altering either the anterior/posterior position or shape of expression. A role for cofactors in shaping the GRF is consistent with in vitro studies where purified Bcd protein binds to HbP2 but yields a Hill coefficient of only 3–4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ma et al., 1996</xref>). In independent work, we have shown that allosteric interactions arising from dynamically changing conformations can give rise to higher-order cooperativities (Biddle et al., submitted) and it is conceivable that cofactors may employ this mechanism at HbP2. We hope to investigate this in future studies. Together, these results argue that cofactors do not simply execute the decisions made by TFs; they collaborate with TFs to shape the quantitative features of the gene regulatory function.</p><p>Cooperativity between TFs mediated by cofactors may help to explain the rapid evolution of regulatory DNA. Because cooperative binding requires direct TF-TF contact, it should be a strong constraint on regulatory evolution. However, the number, position and affinity of WTHbP2 binding sites varies over evolutionary time. We speculate that cooperativity through cofactors may enable rapid evolution of regulatory sequence as motifs at disparate locations can still be integrated into the output of the enhancer.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Broader implications</title><p>The shape of a gene regulatory function reflects the underlying molecular mechanisms of transcription. Coupling quantitative measurements to mechanistically meaningful biophysical models is a powerful strategy to decipher the individual role of such mechanisms, and how they collaborate to influence gene expression.

Drosophila embryos are becoming a flagship system for this strategy due to key strengths developed by the community over time: the transcriptional network is well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Levine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980</xref>), high resolution imaging of mRNA and protein is tractable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fowlkes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gregor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pisarev et al., 2009</xref>), and genetic and optogenetic perturbations are possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). Controlled synthetic systems, like the one we develop here and others that are emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crocker et al., 2017</xref>), will be another crucial tool to harness the molecular complexity of animal transcription. As we show, coupling measurements to models has the power to reveal fundamental features of transcription that differ between animals and bacteria. As models improve, they will be a valuable tool in predicting the activity of animal enhancers and their variants and in engineering enhancers with desired activities, both of which are central goals

For the expression level comparison among transgenic reporter lines, hkb was costained for normalization as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wunderlich et al., 2014</xref>). Probes were sequentially detected with anti-DIG HRP (horseradish peroxidase) antibody (Roche) plus coumarin-tyramide color reaction (PerkinElmer) and anti-DNP HRP (PerkinElmer) antibody plus Cy3-tyramide color reaction (PerkinElmer). Embryos were treated with RNase A and then nuclei stained with Sytox Green (Life Technologies). Embryos were mounted in DePex (Electron Microscopy Sciences), using a bridge of #1 coverslips to preserve embryo morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image acquisition, Processing, and Analysis</title><p>A two-photon laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 710) with a plan-apochromat 20 × 0.8 NA objective was used to acquired z-stacks of each embryo. Each stack was converted into a PointCloud; a text file that includes the location and levels of gene expression for each nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Luengo Hendriks et al., 2006</xref>).

This divides the embryo into 16 strips along the AP axis of the embryo and, for each strip, calculates the mean expression level in 100 bins along the AP axis. Strips were extracted along the right lateral sides of the embryos and subtracted the minimum value along the axis to remove background noise.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Estimating position and steepness from experimental data</title><p>For each embryo, the expression level driven by the corresponding reporter construct is measured as described above. The Bcd expression profile is estimated from a single sample of six embryos stained with Bcd antibody. This allows an estimate of a gene regulatory function (GRF) for each reporter construct, where expression level is expressed as a function of Bcd concentration. Normalized position (P) and normalized steepness (S) are estimated from an averaged GRF obtained by averaging over a random subsample of half the number of embryos in a particular condition. Given an averaged GRF, we estimate normalized steepness and position by: 1) Computing Bcd05: Bcd concentration for which expression level is half its maximum value 2) Computing the maximum derivative of the GRF (raw steepness: rS) and the Bcd concentration for which it is found (raw position: rP) 3) Normalizing the raw steepness and raw position using Bcd05: p=rP/Bcd05 and S = rS*Bcd05. 100 random subsamples per condition are taken, allowing to compute a distribution of possible positions and steepnesses for a given condition. Kernel Density Estimation is used to estimate a probability distribution for the particular reporter construct to exhibit a particular combination of steepness and position. A gaussian basis is used, where the bandwidth is estimated using <italic>Silverman's rule of thumb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Silverman, 2018</xref>), which is optimal, provided the underlying distribution is, in fact, Gaussian. A p-value for the probability of finding GRFs inside the thermodynamic equilibrium region is estimated by computing the proportion of the estimated kernel density that lies within the equilibrium boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Model of gene regulation</title><p>The biophysical approach to gene regulation used in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Estrada et al., 2016b</xref>) was introduced in (Ahsendorf, Wong, Eils, Gunawardena, ‘<italic>A framework for modelling gene regulation which accommodates non-equilibrium mechanisms’</italic>, BMC Biology 12:102 2014). It allows for multiple molecular entities interacting with DNA, giving rise to ‘microstates’, corresponding to the various molecular patterns which can arise on DNA, and transitions between these microstates, corresponding, for instance, to binding and unbinding. This specifies in a graphical way the master equation of the underlying Markov process, from which the steady-state probabilities of the microstates can be calculated algebraically, without having to know the numerical values of the transition rates. If the steady-state is one of thermodynamic equilibrium, then the model can be parameterised by association constants, corresponding to ratios of on-rates to off-rates, along with the concentrations of the interacting molecular entities. The steady-state probabilities are identical to those given by equilibrium statistical mechanics for the grand canonical formalism. The parameterisation by association constants is more convenient for representing biochemical mechanisms than the conventional formulation in terms of free energies of microstates. The treatment accommodates any form of information integration that is achievable without energy expenditure.</p><p>The mathematical foundations for this approach were developed in previous work on the graph-based ‘linear framework’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Estrada et al., 2016a</xref> for references) and are summarised for the specific application to gene regulation in Section 1 of the Supplementary Information of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Estrada et al., 2016b</xref>). We provide sufficient information here to reproduce the results of the present paper, based on these previously published results. This general approach to gene regulation was applied to the Hb-Bcd system in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Estrada et al., 2016a</xref>), assuming a single activating transcription factor (TF) binding at any number of sites, with mRNA synthesis given by averaging over the steady-state probabilities of the microstates. Higher-order cooperativites (HOCs), defined as ratios of association constants, were introduced as non-dimensional parameters which measure information integration.</p><p>For the present paper, we followed the same approach with a slightly extended model, in which RNA polymerase was introduced as a molecular entity with a single binding site, corresponding to the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Higher-order cooperativity can now arise from subsets of TF sites acting on a TF site (TF-TF HOC) and between subsets of TF sites acting on RNA polymerase (TF-Pol HOC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, bottom inset). The mRNA synthesis rate is assumed to be proportional to the steady-state probability of RNA polymerase being bound and the steady-state amount of mRNA is then determined as the balance between synthesis and linear degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Estrada et al., 2016a</xref>, SI, Section 5). Using the rules described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Estrada et al., 2016b</xref>, SI, Section 1), the normalised mRNA amount can be calculated algebraically in terms of the concentration of the TF and the HOCs, giving thereby a fully specified gene regulation function (GRF).</p><p>To measure the sharpness of this GRF, we follow the method in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Estrada et al., 2016b</xref>) by using ‘steepness’ (maximum of the derivative of the GRF) and ‘position’ (normalised concentration at which the maximum is achieved). To compare these biophysically defined GRFs to data, we do not fit them but, instead, we plot the region of position and steepness which is accessible, assuming that the HOC parameters are independently chosen as 10 <sup>u</sup>, where u is drawn at random from the uniform distribution on [−3, 3]. This range seems plausible on biophysical grounds but the boundaries of the position-steepness regions stabilise rapidly as the parameter range is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Estrada et al., 2016a</xref>). Changing the range from [−3, 3] to [−4,4] changes the boundary only slightly, indicating that the boundary has nearly stabilized, and does not affect our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge all members of the DePace and Gunawardena groups, for their helpful feedback on the work and manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a guest Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors have quantitatively assessed the in vivo activity of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> hunchback regulatory element controlled by Bicoid binding sites in the embryo. Simple cooperative binding models do not reproduce the effects of perturbations, suggesting that either the thermodynamic equilibrium assumption is invalid for these types of elements, or that the cooperativities are more complex, possibly involving the influence of cofactors, chromatin, or DNA shape. The authors test the influence of additional transcriptional regulators by cis-element mutations and RNAi knockdowns. Previous studies showed that Zld and Hb are involved in Bcd-dependent activation, and these effects are confirmed using shRNA interference of each gene.

PWMs do not impact our models (which do not explicitly contain DNA sequence), but they do impact the design of the SynHbP2 construct. For our experiments on WTHbP2, we manipulated the footprinted Bcd binding sites, which does not require the use of PWMs. For SynHbP2, we used PWMs to predict binding sites for other TFs to screen against the creation of those sites in our neutral backbone. To explore the possibility that additional Bcd binding sites exist, outside of the footprinted sites, we also used a PWM for Bcd, and we now include a supplemental figure addressing that possibility. Note that it does not substantively alter our conclusions. We added full information on PWMs we used in the Materials and methods (subsection “Creating Transgenic Fly Lines”) with link to Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8235587.v1) .</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Hill Equation given in the subsection “The HbP2 reporter system”, is an incredibly simple model of regulation.

We discuss the simplicity of this model in the paper (<italic>“</italic>As noted above, the Hill function gives little biophysical insight but it offers a widelyused measure of shape. We will later interpret the shape of the GRF in terms of the mathematical theory that we introducedpreviously, from which we will draw more mechanistic conclusions.”), and do not claim that it is surprising that it doesn’t fit. Instead, we use the lack of agreement with the predictions of the Hill equation to justify more complex and mechanistically insightful models. We now reference other such mechanistic models, even though they were developed for other enhancers, in the Results section as described above.</p><p>In regards to the equivalence of sites, we tested this explicitly in the paper (Figure 2), and found that they were indeed roughly equal contributors.

We have revised the main text (see subsection “Comparing expression driven by variants of WTHbP2 and SynHbP2 to theory indicates multiple molecular mechanisms underlie the GRF”) and added a description to the Materials and methods, including a new supplementary figure describing the graph that we use, which indicates the notation, and describes the rules for calculating steady states (see Figure 6—figure supplement 3 and Figure 6—figure supplement 4). These rules are extensively described in the supplement to Estrada et al., 2016, so we do not reproduce them here. This information is sufficient to reconstruct our model, but does not delineate every equation and parameter. We are happy to elaborate in further detail if the reviewers deem it necessary.</p></body></sub-article></article>
