In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, deficiency of DCAP-1/DCP1, the essential co-factor of the major cytoplasmic mRNA decapping enzyme, impacts normal development, stress survival and ageing. Here, we show that overexpression of <italic>dcap-1</italic> in neurons of worms is sufficient to increase lifespan through the function of the insulin/IGF-like signaling and its effector DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor. Neuronal DCAP-1 affects basal levels of INS-7, an ageing-related insulin-like peptide, which acts in the intestine to determine lifespan. Short-lived <italic>dcap-1</italic> mutants exhibit a neurosecretion-dependent upregulation of intestinal <italic>ins-7</italic> transcription, and diminished nuclear localization of DAF-16/FOXO. Moreover, neuronal overexpression of DCP1 in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> confers longevity in adults, while neuronal DCP1 deficiency shortens lifespan and affects wing morphogenesis, cell non-autonomously. Our genetic analysis in two model-organisms suggests a critical and conserved function of DCAP-1/DCP1 in developmental events and lifespan modulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>DCAP-1/DCP1</kwd><kwd>iongevity</kwd><kwd>ins-7</kwd><kwd>wing development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201975</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Syntichaki</surname><given-names>Popi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Sante</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Syntichaki</surname><given-names>Popi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>mRNA decapping function in neuronal cells regulates neurosecretion and intertissue signaling, affecting developmental and ageing processes in two model organisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Addition of an m<sup>7</sup>G cap structure at the 5’-end of nascent transcripts (capping) is a universal modification of eukaryotic mRNAs, which takes place co-transcriptionally, briefly after incorporation of the first nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moteki and Price, 2002</xref>). m<sup>7</sup>GpppN (where N is the first transcribed nucleotide) cap is a major <italic>cis</italic> regulatory element that interacts with multiple binding partners to promote pre-mRNA processing, to guide nuclear export and eventually to drive the formation of the translation apparatus in the cytoplasm. Removal of the 5’-cap structure (decapping), predominately occuring after shortening of the poly(A) tail (deadenylation), constitutes a pivotal event in mRNA lifecycle, since it pulls the transcript out of the translational pool and renders it susceptible to degradation by the highly conserved 5’−3’ exoribonuclease XRN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2012</xref>). This cytoplasmic 5’−3’ mRNA decay pathway can be also triggered in a transcript-specific manner through the interaction of mRNAs with miRNAs or specific RNA-binding proteins that regulate gene expression in response to various endogenous or external signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borbolis and Syntichaki, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although for years, the common consensus stated that decapping is an irreversible process that commits transcripts to degradation, this view was overturned mainly by the discovery of mRNA capping enzymes in the cytoplasm of diverse eukaryotic cells and the identification of capped mRNA ends that did not correspond to transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trotman and Schoenberg, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Affymetrix ENCODE Transcriptome Project and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ENCODE Transcriptome Project, 2009</xref>). These findings introduced the concept of ‘cap homeostasis’ in gene expression, where cyclic decapping and recapping regulates translational activity of at least a subset of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukherjee et al., 2012</xref>). In this setting, uncapped transcripts are stored in a translationally inactive, but stable form in cytoplasmic mRNP granules termed P-bodies, where they coincide with decapping factors, translational repressors and components of the 5’−3’ mRNA decay and RNA interference machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukherjee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Standart and Weil, 2018</xref>). Despite their composition though, P-bodies seem to be primarily involved in the coordinated storage of mRNA regulons rather than mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Standart and Weil, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). Such discoveries underscored the role of mRNA decapping as a potent post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression. Interestingly, most decapping defects have been linked to severe neurological disorders, highlighting the importance of decapping activity in neuronal cells, where spatiotemporal control of translation is of supreme importance and the presence of P-bodies and related mRNP granules is more frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donlin-Asp et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To exert the appropriate control over mRNA decay, eukaryotes have developed a multi-protein decapping complex, formed around the catalytic subunit DCP2 and its essential co-factor DCP1. Together DCP1/DCP2 form a poorly active holoenzyme that needs to interact with more auxiliary factors in order to work efficiently and to provide substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charenton and Graille, 2018</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests that both availability and activity of DCP1 play a major regulatory role in cap homeostasis and mRNA decay, controlling the balance between decapping, translation and degradation. FRAP experiments in human cells have shown that the fraction of P-body localized DCP2 is rather fixed but DCP1 molecules can be rapidly exchanged between P-bodies and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aizer et al., 2008</xref>), while P-body formation is induced by DCP1 overexpression, endogenous or environmental stressors and ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rousakis et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that depletion of <italic>dcap-1</italic> or <italic>dcap-2</italic>, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs of human DCP1 and DCP2 respectively, can affect various aspects of worm physiology, provoking reduced fertility, developmental defects, increased sensitivity to stress and shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rousakis et al., 2014</xref>). Particularly, neuronal DCAP-1 has been found to influence critical developmental events that modulate the worm’s growth rate under optimal conditions, and affect its ability to form stress resilient dauer larvae at high temperature, partially by affecting insulin/IGF-like signaling (IIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borbolis et al., 2017</xref>). IIS is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that participates in various cellular processes and regulates lifespan across species, from invertebrates to mammals. <italic>C. elegans</italic>’ genome encodes for ~40 insulin-like peptides (ILPs) that initiate IIS by binding to insulin/IGF-like receptor (DAF-2) and regulate the localization/function of the downstream target DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). Previous work has shown that IIS mediates the communication of multiple tissues to regulate the rate of ageing; while it is DAF-2 activity predominantly in the nervous system that regulates lifespan, DAF-16 acts mainly in the intestine to confer DAF-2-regulated longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolkow et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Libina et al., 2003</xref>). This kind of inter-tissue communication is considered a vital part of organismal ageing in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals. Especially the bidirectional communication between nervous system and intestinal tissue, known as the brain-gut axis, has recently emerged as an important regulatory circuit that controls lifespan across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Westfall et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we provide evidence that DCAP-1 activity in the nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic> participates in the regulation of a neurosecreted ILP, which ultimately affects the function of DAF-16 transcription factor in distal tissues. In consistence with the central role of IIS in ageing and stress response, we show that neuronal overexpression of DCAP-1 increases lifespan and enhances stress resistance of aged worms. Moreover, we unveil evolutionarily conserved functions of neuronal DCP1 activity in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Our observations suggest a critical role for neuronal mRNA decapping during normal ageing and provide insights into the underlying mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neuronal decapping regulates lifespan</title><p>We have previously reported that expression of a <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic> transgene driven by the native <italic>dcap-1</italic> promoter, can fully rescue all the defects of <italic>dcap-1(tm3163)</italic> mutants, including their short lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rousakis et al., 2014</xref>). In order to explore the tissue-specific requirement of DCAP-1 in lifespan regulation, we generated a series of transgenic lines that overexpress this <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic> fusion gene in different tissues of <italic>dcap-1</italic> worms. We found that restoring the function of <italic>dcap-1</italic> gene specifically in the nervous system (<italic>unc-119p</italic>-<italic>synEx293 array</italic>) could significantly increase lifespan of <italic>dcap-1</italic> mutants, rendering it comparable to that of wild type (wt/N2) animals at 20°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar results were obtained by creating a second transgenic strain that expresses the fusion under the control of a different pan-neuronal promoter (<italic>rab-3p-synEx345</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

The fact that overexpression of this <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic> transgene exclusively in the nervous system was able to fully rescue the short-lived mutant phenotype, suggests a strong positive regulation of lifespan even though <italic>dcap-1</italic> is missing from other tissues. We therefore examined the impact of overexpressing all tissue-specific <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic> fusions on the lifespan of otherwise wt animals. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, neuronal overexpression of <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic> under the <italic>unc-119</italic> promoter (<italic>synEx293</italic>) resulted in a significant increase of both median and maximum lifespan of N2 worms, by ~16% and~26%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Comparable results were obtained when expression was driven by <italic>rab-3</italic> promoter (<italic>synEx345</italic>,~13% and~18% lifespan increase) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). In agreement with our observations from the complementation analysis, expression in either muscles (<italic>synEx326</italic>) or epidermis (<italic>synEX364</italic>) did not have any effect on the longevity of wt animals, whereas a smaller extension of lifespan (~8% in median and ~10% in maximum) was achieved by overexpressing <italic>dcap-1</italic> in the intestine (<italic>synEx328</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C, D</xref>). Most importantly, lifespan extension in all cases was accompanied by an analogous delay in the onset of age-dependent movement impairment, which is considered a reliable marker of ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Son et al., 2019</xref>), with worms remaining responsive to touch longer than their respective controls (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Therefore, neuronal (and to a lesser extent intestinal) overexpression of <italic>dcap-1</italic> can extend the lifespan and healthspan of both <italic>dcap-1</italic> and wt animals. Moreover, the mechanism underlying their longevity completely depends on mRNA decapping, as the effect of neuronal or intestinal overexpression was absent in <italic>dcap-2(ok2023)</italic> mutants that lack decapping catalytic subunit activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Neuronal overexpression of <italic>dcap-1</italic> extends lifespan through mRNA decapping, DAF-16/FOXO and IIS.</title><p>Lifespan at 20°C of (<bold>A–D</bold>) wt worms overexpressing a <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic> fusion in neurons, epidermis, muscles or intestine, (<bold>E</bold>) worms overexpressing neuronal or intestinal <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic> in <italic>dcap-2</italic> mutant genetic background, (<bold>F</bold>) worms overexpressing neuronal <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic> in <italic>daf-16</italic> mutant genetic background, (<bold>G</bold>) worms overexpressing neuronal <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic> under post-developmental <italic>daf-16</italic> RNAi knockdown, (<bold>H</bold>) worms overexpressing neuronal <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic> during post-developmental daf-2 RNAi knockdown. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ****p&lt;0.0001.

The little residual longevity observed in these animals is most likely to reflect the inability of post-developmental RNAi to completely eliminate DAF-16 activity. Collectively, our results suggest that the effect of neuronal DCAP-1 in adult life is mediated by DAF-16. It is noteworthy that we did not find any significant difference in lifespan between double <italic>dcap-1(tm3163);daf-16(mu86)</italic> and single <italic>daf-16(mu86)</italic> mutants, suggesting that loss of <italic>dcap-1</italic> reduces lifespan through negative regulation of DAF-16 activity or that <italic>daf-16</italic> is epistatic to <italic>dcap-1</italic> in lifespan determination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>).</p><p>Given that <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons are fairly refractory to RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamath et al., 2003</xref>) our data suggest that neuronal DCAP-1 acts in a cell non-autonomous manner, involving signals that influence DAF-16 behavior in distal tissues. The prevalent pathway that integrates intercellular signals to regulate DAF-16 activity, with a great impact on longevity, is IIS. We thus reassessed the lifespan of <italic>synEx293</italic> (<italic>unc-119p::dcap-1::gfp</italic>) animals, under conditions of reduced IIS, caused by post-developmental knockdown of insulin/IGF-1 receptor gene <italic>daf-2</italic>.

This lack of an additive effect indicates that decapping in the nervous system acts through IIS to regulate DAF-16 activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Neuronal <italic>dcap-1</italic> regulates INS-7 to confer longevity</title><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, DAF-2 receives input from at least 40 insulin-like peptides (ILPs) that act as agonists or antagonists to regulate stress resistance, reproduction, development and ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandes de Abreu et al., 2014</xref>).

We detected fluorescence mainly in head neurons and some intestinal cells, with advanced age resulting in increased intestinal fluorescence for both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3B—figure supplement 1</xref>). Even so, total fluorescence intensity of <italic>dcap-1;wwEx66</italic> worms was greater at all examined ages compared to single <italic>wwEx66</italic>, with the difference fluctuating between 1.6- and 2.1-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Such an increase in promoter activity argues in favor of DCAP-1 regulating <italic>ins-7</italic> expression at the level of transcription. In particular, we observed that this effect is restricted to the intestine of <italic>dcap-1;wwEx66</italic> worms, as there was no discernible effect on neuronal cells of the head region or elsewhere, in respect to <italic>wwEx66</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3B—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Therefore, the observed differences in <italic>ins-7</italic> mRNA abundance between wt and <italic>dcap-1</italic> probably reflect transcriptional changes in the intestine.</p><p>Apart from acting as a DAF-2 agonist, <italic>ins-7</italic> is also negatively regulated by DAF-16 in intestinal cells, in sharp contrast to neurons where <italic>ins-7</italic> is not responsive to IIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>). Since IIS intertissue signaling is mainly initiated by neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Libina et al., 2003</xref>), we argued that induction of <italic>ins-7p::gfp</italic> expression in the intestine of <italic>dcap-1</italic> animals could be the response to an upsurge in neuronal release of ILPs. Indeed, we found that deletion of <italic>unc-31</italic>/CAPS (allele <italic>e928</italic>), which is required for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated release of neuropeptide-carrying dense core vesicles (DCVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Speese et al., 2007</xref>), eliminates differences in <italic>ins-7p::gfp</italic> fluorescence intensity between <italic>dcap-1 (tm3163);wwEx66</italic> and single <italic>wwEX66</italic> worms at all examined ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3C—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Given its self-regulatory function, we considered that INS-7 could be this factor. Indeed, deletion <italic>ok1573</italic>, which abolishes <italic>ins-7</italic> expression, completely suppressed the effect of <italic>dcap-1</italic> depletion on <italic>ins-7p::gfp</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3F—figure supplement 6</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, there was a two-fold induction of mature mRNA levels in both 1- and 9-day <italic>dcap-1</italic> adults compared to wt. This was not due to a general effect on mRNA maturation and stability, as it did not apply to the reference gene <italic>eft-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>), indicating the selective stabilization of <italic>ins-7</italic> mRNA in neurons of decapping mutants.</p><p>Previous work has shown that INS-7 serves as a carrier of FOXO-to-FOXO intertissue signaling coordinating the rate of ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>). Consequently, the deficit in <italic>ins-7</italic> induction during ageing in neuronal <italic>dcap-1</italic> overexpressing animals, could be the reason for their prolonged lifespan. To support this theory, we assessed the longevity of wt and <italic>synEx345 (rab-3p::dcap-1::gfp)</italic> worms under post-developmental <italic>ins-7</italic> RNAi that should eliminate differences in <italic>ins-7</italic> expression between strains. To achieve efficient systemic RNAi, both strains were genetically modified for enhanced neuronal RNAi (see Materials and methods).

Thus, we examined whether <italic>dcap-1</italic> depletion affects the translocation of DAF-16 to the nucleus during heat-shock by exposing wt and <italic>dcap-1</italic> young adults that carry a <italic>daf-16::gfp</italic> translational fusion (<italic>muIs71</italic>) at high temperature (35°C). Notably, although <italic>muIs71</italic> control animals started to show an increase in DAF-16::GFP positive nuclei after just 15 min of heat-shock (data not shown), no such response was evident in <italic>dcap-1;muIs71</italic> worms, unless we exposed them for more than 30 min, and the number of DAF-16::GFP nuclei per animal was significantly lower in <italic>dcap-1</italic> mutants compared to wt at all examined time points, including unstressed worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4A—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, <italic>dcap-1</italic> depletion seems to hinder the translocation of DAF-16 to the nucleus, under normal conditions and the early stages of heat-shock; longer exposure times (over 60 min) ultimately surmounted this inhibitory effect, leading to almost complete translocation of DAF-16::GFP to the nucleus in both strains (data not shown). Conversely, neuronal overexpression of DCAP-1 (<italic>synEx293</italic>) in worms carrying a <italic>daf-16a::rfp</italic> translational fusion (<italic>lpIs12</italic>) revealed a significant increase in the number of red fluorescent nuclei per <italic>synEx293;lpIs12</italic> animal, compared to single <italic>lpIs12</italic> worms, even in the absence of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4B—figure supplement 2</xref>). The difference in DAF-16 nuclear accumulation between the two strains remained significant after 5 min heat-shock but started to diminish at 15 min, as nuclear enrichment is enhanced in both backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4B—figure supplement 2</xref>). The different fluorophores combined with variations in transgene copy-number could account for the differential kinetics of DAF-16a::GFP and DAF-16a::RFP translocation in the same background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Given that <italic>dcap-1</italic> depletion affects DAF-16 localization, we postulated that restoring <italic>dcap-1</italic> function in neurons could also rescue the reported mutant’s sensitivity to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rousakis et al., 2014</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that neuronal rescuing of <italic>dcap-1</italic> by either pan-neuronal promoter (<italic>synEx293</italic>/<italic>synEx345</italic>) failed to alleviate the sensitivity of 1 day old <italic>dcap-1</italic> adults in either heat-sock or oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Accordingly, neuronal expression of <italic>dcap-1</italic> (<italic>synEx293</italic>) in wt background did not increase tolerance to heat shock or oxidative stress of young adult worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, the ability of an organism to cope with stress declines with age and mechanisms that preserve cellular homeostasis and genome integrity are of great importance during ageing.

We generated a UAS:DCP1:eGFP strain and crossed it with elav:GAL4 flies to achieve overexpression of DCP1:eGFP transgene in the nervous system. In contrast to our expectations, elav:GAL4 &gt;UAS:DCP1:eGFP flies grown at 25°C or 29°C did not live longer than their parental elav:GAL4 strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). However, given the implication of neuronal DCP1 in development, we argued that abnormally high expression caused by the transgene might be harmful during early life stages, masking or counteracting any potential lifespan-extending effect of DCP1 overexpression during adulthood. For this reason, we used GAL80<sup>ts</sup>, a temperature-sensitive inducible GAL4 inhibitor, to switch on neuronal DCP1:eGFP transgene overexpression after completion of development. elav:GAL4 &gt;UAS:DCP1:eGFP;GAL80<sup>ts</sup> flies were grown at the permissive temperature for GAL80<sup>ts</sup> (18°C) and transferred to the restrictive temperature (29°C) upon the onset of adulthood. Interestingly, these flies that overexpress neuronal DCP1 post-developmentally exhibited a significant increase of both median (~42%) and maximum (~27%) lifespan compared to their parental elav:GAL4 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, high levels of DCP1 in neurons (or neuron precursors) are detrimental during development, but have an opposing lifespan-extending effect during adulthood.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Neuronal DCP1 affects wing imaginal disc and adult wing development</title><p>While studying elav:GAL4 &gt;UAS:IRDCP1 flies we noticed that neuronal DCP1 knockdown causes a characteristic phenotype, defined by malformed/unexpanded wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) in ~50% of the population at 25°C (n = 178 for GD31442 and n = 244 for KK105638). This effect did not correlate with the efficiency of the knockdown, since all flies exhibited the same levels of DCP1 mRNA regardless of their wing phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), neither with their lifespan, which was short in all cases. Nonetheless, penetrance reached a remarkable 95% at 29°C (n = 167). Notably, wing malformations always coincided with the presence of additional morphological aberrations, which include an unexpanded thorax (judged by the crossing of postscutellar bristles) and the lack of cuticle tanning (melanisation and hardening) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Such defects indicate that mRNA decapping in the nervous system can affect development in non-neuronal cells of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Like most external structures of the mature fly, adult wings derive from imaginal discs, which are created during larval development and undergo extreme changes during metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fristrom, 1993</xref>). To examine whether the origins of wing malformation can be traced in early events of their morphogenesis, we dissected wing imaginal discs from third instar larvae with neuronal DCP1 knockdown (elav:GAL4 &gt;UAS:IRDCP1) and examined cell and tissue morphology by visualizing F-actin. Despite the neuronal DCP1 knockdown, 15 out of 23 isolated discs exhibited widespread structural anomalies, associated with abnormal epithelial folding, which were absent in discs from age-matched larvae of parental UAS:IRDCP1 and elav:GAL4 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Neuronal DCP1 affects wing disk morphology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phalloidin staining of wing imaginal discs derived from animals subjected to neuron-specific DCP1 knockdown.

As expected we observed strong fluorescence in the majority of neuronal brain cells but we detected no fluorescent signal in wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Additionally, we used an en:GAL4 driver to examine the effect of DCP1 deficiency in wing disc epithelial cells by knocking down its expression only in the posterior part of the disc. This did not result in any structural differences between the anterior and the posterior part of en:GAL4 &gt;UAS:IRDCP1 wing discs, both of which had normal morphology in 12 out of 13 examined wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results implicate neuronal DCP1 in a cell non-autonomous mechanism that uses neuronally derived signals to orchestrate wing disc development.</p><p>Interestingly, abnormal wing discs and malformed adult wings appeared with a similar frequency of 50–60% in elav:GAL4 &gt;UAS:IRDCP1 flies grown at 25°C, suggesting a cause-and-effect relationship between them. To uncouple these two phenotypes, we performed temperature-shift experiments to temporally control the induction of neuronal DCP1 knockdown. Unsurprisingly, elav:GAL4 &gt;UAS:IRDCP1;tubGAL80<sup>ts</sup> animals were superficially wild type at 18°C (‘DCP1-ON’ state), and exhibited both abnormal wing discs and malformed wings when grown at 29°C (‘DCP1-OFF’ state). Switching between DCP1-ON and OFF states at different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) revealed that restricting neuronal knockdown in embryonic and larval stages leads to the formation of abnormal wing discs (five out of nine examined wing imaginal discs displayed abnormalities in tissue folding and F-actin accumulation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) but does not affect the phenotype of adult wings. Congruently, starting knockdown from the white pupa stage, when wing discs are already formed is sufficient for causing malformed wings. Therefore, abnormalities in wing imaginal discs tissue pattern and aberrant adult wing morphology represent two unconnected outcomes of neuronal DCP1 deficiency, which occur independently at different developmental stages. Of note, we were not able to induce malformation of adult wings by switching to DCP1-OFF state past the 2-day pupa stage, while switching to DCP1-ON after the 3-day pupa stage resulted in adults with malformed wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Taking into account, the potential latency between any temperature shift and the subsequent effect in gene expression, we can safely place the crucial period where neuronal DCP1 activity impacts adult wing development between the white pupa and the 3-day pupa stages. Supporting this notion, switching to DCP1-ON at white pupa and back to DCP1-OFF at pharate pupa stage results in adults with normal wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of thermoinducible DCP1 knock down at different developmental stages.</title><p>The crucial period where DCP1 activity affects adult wing expansion is traced between the 1-day and the 3-day pupa stages.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53757-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig7s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Abnormalities in wing discs of larvae subjected to neuron-specific DCP1 knockdown at 29°C.</title><p>Phalloidin staining of wing imaginal discs derived from 3rd instar larvae subjected to neuron-specific DCP1 knockdown at 29°C.

In this study, we have shown that neuronal activity of DCAP-1/DCP1, which is the regulatory subunit of the core mRNA decapping enzyme, participates in the inter-tissue crosstalk that regulates ageing through neurosecretion. Using appropriate strains designed to express DCAP-1::GFP fusion protein in a tissue-selective manner, we found that neuronal overexpression is sufficient to extend nematode lifespan, in a DCAP-2-dependent manner, regardless of DCAP-1 availability in other tissues. A similar but far weaker effect is evident as a result of intestinal expression, whereas muscle- or hypodermal-specific <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic> transgenes had no impact on longevity. These data suggest that DCAP-1 acts predominantly in neurons to influence lifespan, and infer the involvement of neuroendocrine signaling in the underlying mechanism. Several studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have revealed the cell non-autonomous role of neuroendocrine signaling pathways in the regulation of lifespan, stress resistance, innate immunity and protein homeostasis, with IIS playing a prominent role among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Oosten-Hawle and Morimoto, 2014</xref>). Indeed, we found that the effect of neuronal <italic>dcap-1</italic> overexpression on lifespan is exerted through the action of IIS and the downstream transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. More specifically, DCAP-1 activity in the nervous system controls the expression levels of <italic>ins-7</italic> gene, encoding an insulin-like peptide that is upregulated during ageing and acts as a DAF-2/InsR agonist.</p><p>Loss of <italic>ins-7</italic>, through gene mutations or RNAi, can extend nematode lifespan by lowering IIS and activating DAF-16, whereas intestinally expressed <italic>ins-7</italic> shortens lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>). We found that short-lived <italic>dcap-1</italic> mutant adults show higher mRNA levels of <italic>ins-7</italic>, compared to wt animals, whereas <italic>dcap-1</italic> overexpression in neurons, significantly hampers the age-dependent mRNA upsurge of <italic>ins-7.</italic> Elevated <italic>ins-7</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>dcap-1</italic> mutants coincide with increased transcription of <italic>ins-7</italic> in their intestine, despite the fact that <italic>ins-7</italic> is predominantly expressed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>). Overall, our data strongly implied the involvement of a neuroendocrine mechanism leading to the hypothesis that overexpression of neuronal <italic>dcap-1</italic> extends lifespan through IIS intertissue signaling initiated by lower levels of neuronal INS-7. This hypothesis is supported by the following evidence: a) We demonstrated post-transcriptional stabilization of neuronal <italic>ins-7</italic> mRNA in decapping mutants, b) deletion of <italic>ins-7</italic> gene suppresses the induction of <italic>ins-7p::gfp</italic> in the intestine of <italic>dcap-1</italic> mutants, in a similar way to <italic>unc-31/</italic>CAPS mutants, where neuropeptide secretion is strongly inhibited, c) <italic>ins-7</italic> RNAi in a neuronal RNAi-sensitive background increases lifespan of wt animals but fails to further extend the already long life of worms overexpressing neuronal <italic>dcap-1</italic>.</p><p>Lower neurosecretion of this DAF-2 agonist in <italic>dcap-1</italic> overexpressing animals could subsequently reduce IIS and activate DAF-16 in intestinal cells, ultimately downregulating the expression of intestinal <italic>ins-7</italic>. This feedback regulatory loop has been proposed to guide FOXO-to-FOXO signaling and orchestrate organismal ageing, through the action of DAF-16 in other tissues. Since <italic>ins-7</italic> gene is subjected to negative regulation by DAF-16 in the intestine, but not neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>), we argued that transcriptional induction of intestinal <italic>ins-7</italic> in <italic>dcap-1</italic> mutants could result from alterations of DAF-16 activity. Indeed, we monitored that translocation of DAF-16 to the nucleus, is delayed in all tissues of <italic>dcap-1</italic> worms, during normal conditions and the early stages of heat-shock, while overexpression of neuronal <italic>dcap-1</italic> enhanced the localization of DAF-16 in both cases. Oddly, the longevity effect of neuronal <italic>dcap-1</italic> overexpression correlated with increased stress resistance in mid-aged animals, but not in young adults. This difference probably reflects the greater need of ageing worms for protective mechanisms toward accumulating stress factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walther et al., 2015</xref>). DAF-16 was recently reported to translocate to the nucleus of aged animals in order to stabilize their transcriptome, as a response to age-associated cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, excess neuronal DCAP-1 activity could maintain proper protein translation and homeostasis in aged neurons, preserving nervous system integrity during ageing. A thought-provoking study reported that deficiency of decapping enhancer EDC-3 extends lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by suppressing protein synthesis in neurons, due to sequestration of translation factors into P-bodies, which then triggers stress response through multiple longevity effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rieckher et al., 2018</xref>). Although counterintuitive, this contrasting effect of DCAP-1 and EDC-3 on lifespan is in line with the role of decapping activators that function to provide specificity toward diverse mRNA substrates through particular interactions with them or with other decapping enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the mechanism by which neuronal overexpression of <italic>dcap-1</italic> extends lifespan is completely dependent on DCAP-2 activity, and cannot be attributed to secondary effects emerging from the increased P-body formation that is evident in both wt and <italic>dcap-2</italic> backgrounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The fact that regulation of ageing via neurons appears to be conserved in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tatar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Libert et al., 2007</xref>), combined with the strong evolutionary conservation of the 5’−3’ mRNA decay prompted us to investigate the connection between neuronal decapping and ageing in the fruit fly. We showed that neuron-specific knockdown of the fly <italic>dcap-1</italic> orthologue DCP1 greatly reduces lifespan, while its neuronal overexpression leads to a significant induction of longevity. The latter though applies only when overexpression occurs post-developmentally. This suggests that high levels of neuronal DCP1 are harmful during development but beneficial for lifespan during adult life. The fly genome encodes eight insulin-like peptides (DILP1-8), four of which are expressed in neurons and are linked with lifespan regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kannan and Fridell, 2013</xref>). Moreover, the exoribonuclease Pacman/XRN1, which acts downstream of decapping in the 5’−3’ mRNA decay pathway, has been reported to regulate the levels of secreted molecules in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, including insulin-like peptide DIPL8 and neuropeptide NPLP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2016</xref>). This indicates that mRNA decapping may play an active and extended role in the control of neurosecretion in the fly. This view is in agreement with our finding that neuron-specific knockdown of DCP1 causes structural abnormalities in the epithelium of larval wing imaginal discs and impairs the execution of the post eclosion program that leads to wing expansion in adults.</p><p>Of note, all morphological traits of neuronal DCP1-deficient flies are connected with processes that take place in newly eclosed adults, during the late phases of the last ecdysis. At this stage, release of neuropeptide bursicon (also known as the tanning hormone) from neurons of the subesophageal and abdominal ganglia orchestrates the execution of a posteclosion program, characterized by a combination of behavioral and anatomical changes that act in concert and ultimately lead to wing expansion and cuticle tanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peabody et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">White and Ewer, 2014</xref>). A recent study revealed that rickets, the bursicon receptor, functions in a set of insulin-like peptide ILP7-secreting peptidergic neurons of the ventral nervous system to regulate the tanning of <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flaven-Pouchon et al., 2020</xref>). Mutants defective for bursicon or rickets, fail to induce both behavioral and anatomical aspects of this program and consequently form adults with unexpanded wings, unexpanded thorax and untanned cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dewey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker and Truman, 2002</xref>). The striking similarity to these mutants strongly suggests that flies subjected to neuronal DCP1 knockdown exhibit some kind of impairment in bursicon signaling. In favor of this notion, our initial measurements show a trend for lower bursicon and rickets mRNA levels in heads dissected from newly eclosed adults when neuronal DCP1 is knocked-down (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). However, our data cannot support a direct connection between DCP1 levels and bursicon activity during the last ecdysis, since DCP1 knockdown at that point does not affect wing expansion. It is rather more likely that neuronal DCP1 activity during earlier stages of pupal development is essential for the function of an intermediate factor, which subsequently affects bursicon signaling and hence the corresponding posteclosion program. A similar mechanism could affect the morphology of wing imaginal discs during neuronal DCP1 knockdown, as bursicon expression is also detected during early larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Honegger et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our data have uncovered an evolutionarily conserved role for the regulatory subunit of the mRNA decapping enzyme, DCAP-1/DCP1, in the modulation of neuroendocrine signaling mechanisms that govern developmental processes and ageing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This is in line with previous work that has implicated the decapping enzyme and its regulators in the control of local translation at the synapse, synaptic plasticity and related modifications of neuronal activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hillebrand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zeitelhofer et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together, such findings reestablish our understanding concerning mRNA decapping factors which should no longer be considered as mere housekeeping genes that serve in the indiscriminate degradation of mRNA molecules, but as actual gene expression regulators that have active roles in the control of neuronal function.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Putative model of DCP1-mediated regulation of neuroendocrine signalling that controls lifespan, stress response and development.</title><p>DCP1 activity or availability in neuronal cells controls the equilibrium between translation and storage/degradation of mRNAs encoding for insulin-like peptides (ILPs) or other neuropeptides.

Secreted ILPs/neuropeptides bind to Insulin/IGF-like receptor or their corresponding receptor in distal cells and control the activity of downstream effectors (like FOXO transcription factor), ultimately affecting lifespan, stress response and developmental events.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53757-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>dcap-1</italic></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org">www.wormbase.org</ext-link></td><td>CELE_Y55F3AM.12</td><td>WormBase ID: <break/>WBGene00021929</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>dcap-2</italic></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org">www.wormbase.org</ext-link></td><td>CELE_F52G2.1</td><td>WormBase ID: <break/>WBGene00003582</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>daf-16</italic></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org">www.wormbase.org</ext-link></td><td>CELE_R13H8.1</td><td>WormBase ID: <break/>WBGene00000912</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>ins-7</italic></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org">www.wormbase.org</ext-link></td><td>CELE_ZK1251.2</td><td>WormBase ID: <break/>WBGene00002090</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>DCP1</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flybase.org">www.flybase.org</ext-link></td><td>CG11183</td><td>FlyBase ID: <break/>FBgn0034921</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>OP50</td><td><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (CGC)</td><td>OP50</td><td>For standard NGM plates</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>HT115</td><td><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (CGC)</td><td>HT115(DE3)</td><td>For RNAi plates</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains used in this study</td><td>This study</td><td/><td><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains used in this study</td><td>This study</td><td/><td><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>Primers used in this study</td><td>This study</td><td/><td><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>promoterless <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borbolis et al., 2017</xref> <break/>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.160313">10.1098/rsob.160313</ext-link></td><td>PS#302</td><td>pBluescript KS(+);4181 bp <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>unc-119p::dcap-1::gfp</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borbolis et al., 2017</xref> <break/>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.160313">10.1098/rsob.160313</ext-link></td><td>PS#293</td><td>pBluescript KS(+);2200 bp <italic>unc-119p</italic>;4181 bp <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>rab-3p::dcap-1::gfp</italic></td><td>This study</td><td>PS#345</td><td>pBluescript KS(+); 1200 bp <italic>rab-3p;</italic>4181 bp <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>ges-1p::dcap-1::gfp</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borbolis et al., 2017</xref> <break/>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.160313">10.1098/rsob.160313</ext-link></td><td>PS#328</td><td>pBluescript KS(+);1541 bp <italic>ges-1p</italic>;4181 bp <italic>dcap-1::gfp</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>hlh-1p::dcap-1::gfp</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borbolis et al., 2017</xref> <break/>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.160313">10.1098/rsob.160313</ext-link></td><td>PS#326</td><td>pBluescript KS(+);3100 bp <italic>hlh-1p</italic>;

factor that extends lifespan in both worms and flies. It identifies mRNAs encoding insulin like peptides as the targets of DCAP-1/DCP1 which explain the physiological and the lifespan extension effects of manipulating DCAP-1/DCP1. In summary, the study elucidates DCAP-1/DCP1 as a novel regulator of insulin like peptides to modulate longevity and metabolism.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;mRNA decapping is an evolutionarily conserved modulator of neuroendocrine signaling that controls development and ageing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Brian M Zid (Reviewer #2); Aric Rogers (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Borbolis and colleagues shows that neuronal overexpression of the mRNA decapping factor DCAP-1/DCP1 is a conserved lifespan factor that extends the lifespan of both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> by inhibiting insulin signaling. It follows that the decapping machinery, generally considered to be critical for housekeeping functions, can potentially regulate differentially regulate physiological outcomes based on environmental inputs. The key conceptual advance here is the demonstration that DCP1 regulates insulin signaling (INS-7).</p><p>All three reviewers and the reviewing editor argue for the need to define the mechanism by which DCP-1 regulates insulin signaling for this study to be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Also all three reviewers have requested more data to support the hypothesis that mRNA decapping and not any other function of DCP-1 is critical for insulin signaling and longevity effects.</p><p>This could be achieved in a combination of ways including: use of reporters to measure mRNA stability, quantify mRNA levels and stability through RNA seq or other methods and genetic approaches. I outline the key concerns raised by the reviewers to substantiate this issue.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer 2 states: The authors propose that <italic>dcap-1</italic> overexpression is driving lifespan effects by decreasing neuronal INS-7 levels. The authors show that intestinal INS-7 levels are regulated transcriptionally, but that <italic>dcap-1</italic> does not seem to affect a neuronal INS-7 reporter transcriptionally. Is <italic>dcap-1</italic> affecting mRNA levels through mRNA stability? Is it changing protein levels through translatability? Is it changing INS-7 secretion? I believe differentiating between these three possibilities would significantly clarify the mechanism by which <italic>dcap-1</italic> affects lifespan.</p><p>2) Also reviewer 2 states: It is known that overexpressing P-body proteins such as DCP1, can lead to increased P-body formation, but even that doesn't mean there is more decapping as a number of recent articles have questioned whether mRNA decay is even taking place in P-bodies (Luo, Na and Slavoff, 2018). An alternative explanation for the lifespan extension, similar to what is postulated in Rieckher et al., 2018, is that overexpressing <italic>dcap-1</italic> leads to enhanced P-body formation sequestering specific translation factors into the granules, reducing INS-7 translation in these neurons, without necessitating an effect on mRNA decapping.</p><p>3) Reviewer 3 states: Decapping machinery is associated with processing bodies that are dynamic and important for adaptive responses to different conditions. Furthermore, decapping is not necessarily a death sentence for mRNA. Within P bodies, decapped mRNA may be stored and later re-capped by cytoplasmic factors. Specificity for processing specific mRNAs is made possible with different combinations of RNA binding proteins and microRNAs. Although the factors important for imparting such specificity to influence lifespan are not identified in the current study, authors do identify an important role for ILS and the ILP INS-7 for mediating longevity effects due to <italic>dcap-</italic>1 modulation.</p><p>4) Another issue raised is regarding the lack of mechanism by <italic>ins-7</italic> is regulated. Reviewer 1 states: The authors suggest that changes in promoter activity, based on the <italic>ins-7</italic> promoter driving GFP expression, argues in favor of DCP1 regulating <italic>ins-7</italic> at the level of transcription. Does this assay really distinguish transcription from post-transcriptional processes? For example, if RNA degradation pathways were downregulated with the manipulation, isn't that a post-transcriptional process that would result in the same effect on the assay used? Also, manipulations that abolish the increase in <italic>ins-7p::gfp</italic> fluorescence in dcp1 mutants also have greatly increased fluorescence in the control genotype (Figure 3D and G), suggesting a ceiling effect might hinder the ability to observe any changes caused by dcp1.</p><p>5) Reviewer 1 also suggests extending the genetic approaches which seem &quot;limited without either extending the genetic studies (e.g., do manipulations of XRN1, DCP2, or other decapping components phenocopy DCP1 manipulations) or better validating the link between DCP1 and insulin signaling. Are the aging and neuroendocrine phenotypes dependent on the decapping catalytic subunit DCP2? Does deletion of <italic>dcap-2</italic> completely suppress the lifespan effects of <italic>dcap-1</italic> neuronal overexpression? This would be a way to further test whether mRNA decapping was important for these phenotypes.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53757.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer 2 states: The authors propose that dcap-1 overexpression is driving lifespan effects by decreasing neuronal INS-7 levels.

Based on the <italic>ins-7::gfp</italic> reporter, the increased <italic>ins-7</italic> abundance in decapping mutants seems to emanate from transcriptional induction of intestinal, and not neuronal, <italic>ins-7</italic>. Since this upregulation is rescued by restoring <italic>dcap-1</italic> in neurons and depends on neurosecretion, we suggested that loss of <italic>dcap-1</italic> impacts neuronal <italic>ins-7</italic> levels and its signaling to other tissues. Now, to address whether loss of <italic>dcap-1</italic> affects neuronal <italic>ins-7</italic> levels through mRNA stability, we have evaluated the relative mRNA levels of a neuronally expressed <italic>ins-7</italic> transgene <italic>synEx478</italic> (<italic>unc-119p::ins-7::3’UTR<sub>ins-7</sub></italic>), in <italic>ins-7</italic> and <italic>dcap-1;ins-7</italic> mutant backgrounds (strains BRF792 and BRF793 in Supplementary file 3 of the revised manuscript). In these transgenic worms, where only neuronal INS-7 is produced, we quantified and compared the ratio of mature <italic>ins-7</italic> mRNA levels to its pre-mRNA levels, in order to avoid discrepancies due to chimeric expression of the multicopy extrachromosomal array. We observed a two-fold induction in both day 1 and day 9 adults of <italic>dcap-1</italic> compared to wt (revised Figure 3G). In contrast, the ratio of mature <italic>eft-3</italic> mRNA to its pre-mRNA (produced by the endogenous gene F31E3.5 and encoding the core translation elongation factor eEF1A), was similar in the two genetic backgrounds, excluding differences in pre-mRNA processing (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 7). We included these results in the revised manuscript (Results and Discussion). Collectively, our data support a stabilization of neuronal <italic>ins-7</italic> mRNA in decapping mutants, although we cannot yet exclude the contribution of enhanced translation or secretion of INS-7 in these mutants. We hope that the reviewer will understand the time needed to pursue definitive answers to these questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Also reviewer 2 states: It is known that overexpressing P-body proteins such as DCP1, can lead to increased P-body formation, but even that doesn't mean there is more decapping as a number of recent articles have questioned whether mRNA decay is even taking place in P-bodies (Luo, Na and Slavoff, 2018).

As demonstrated in revised Figure 2E and Figure 2— source data 3, lack of DCAP-2 catalytic subunit failed to extend lifespan of these worms, signifying that mRNA decapping activity is necessary for longevity when <italic>dcap-1</italic> is overexpressed in these tissues. In addition, observation under microscope confirmed that these <italic>dcap-2</italic> transgenic worms formed P-body-like granules similarly to or even to a greater extent than wt transgenic worms (Supplementary file 1), pointing to a different mechanism from those postulated in Rieckher et al., 2018, as we mentioned in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript. We thank the reviewer for the reference of Luo et al., 2018, which was added in the Introduction of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Reviewer 3 states: Decapping machinery is associated with processing bodies that are dynamic and important for adaptive responses to different conditions.

Reviewer 1 states: The authors suggest that changes in promoter activity, based on the ins-7 promoter driving GFP expression, argues in favor of DCP1 regulating ins-7 at the level of transcription.

For example, if RNA degradation pathways were downregulated with the manipulation, isn't that a post-transcriptional process that would result in the same effect on the assay used? Also, manipulations that abolish the increase in ins-7p::gfp fluorescence in dcp1 mutants also have greatly increased fluorescence in the control genotype (Figure 3D and G), suggesting a ceiling effect might hinder the ability to observe any changes caused by dcp1.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer argues that increased GFP expression driven by <italic>ins-7</italic> promoter in intestinal cells of <italic>dcap-1</italic> mutants may have been attained not by transcriptional activation but through post-transcriptional stabilization of the produced mRNA, due to downregulation of the mRNA decay pathway. Since we did not observe an analogous increase in neuronal <italic>ins-7p::gfp</italic> fluorescence (revised Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1), we examined whether such a post-transcriptional process takes place only in intestinal cells of <italic>dcap-1</italic> worms. Thus, we generated a transgene that drives <italic>gfp</italic> expression under the control of the intestine-specific <italic>ges-1</italic> promoter and compared fluorescence in age-matched wt and <italic>dcap-1</italic> animals (lines BRF169 and BRF176, respectively, in revised Supplementary file 3). As shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript, GFP signal in <italic>dcap-1</italic> worms was similar to that of N2 on the first day of adulthood, contrary to <italic>ins-7p::gfp</italic> fluorescence which was significantly higher in <italic>dcap-1</italic> (revised Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Regarding the increased relative fluorescence of <italic>ins-7::gfp</italic> in control worms in revised Figures 3C and F (previously named Figures 3D and G), compared to Figure 3B, which reach a maximum at approximately day 6 of adulthood, we believe that it might be due to a compensatory mechanism, in order to increase <italic>ins-7</italic> transcription in the context of their mutant background (<italic>unc-31</italic> and <italic>ins-7</italic>, respectively). However, in days 1 and 2 of adulthood, before a plateau is reached, the relative fluorescence intensity of control and <italic>dcap-1</italic> strains (in revised Figures 3C and F) increases at an almost identical pace, in contrast to the 2-fold difference in intensity between control and <italic>dcap-1</italic> worms in Figure 3B (graph of total <italic>ins-7p::gfp</italic> fluorescence). In an effort to fully address the reviewer’s concern, and given that reduced <italic>daf-16</italic> activity can increase intestinal expression of <italic>ins-7p::gfp</italic> reporter (Murphy et al., 2007), we also performed <italic>daf-</italic>16 RNAi in <italic>unc-31</italic> and <italic>dcap-1;unc-31</italic> worms expressing <italic>ins-7p::gfp</italic> (wwEx66). As expected, <italic>daf-</italic>16 RNAi treatment further raised the threshold of GFP signal in <italic>unc-31;wwEx66</italic> worms, compared to empty vector RNAi, and this was independently of <italic>dcap-1</italic> gene function (Figure 3—figure supplement 4 in revised manuscript). These data exclude a ceiling effect that could mask the impact of <italic>dcap-1</italic> mutation on total fluorescence in these backgrounds. Thus, we concluded that the effect of <italic>dcap-1</italic> in <italic>ins-7::gfp</italic> fluorescence induction depends on INS-7 neurosecretion through DCVs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Reviewer 1 also suggests extending the genetic approaches which seem &quot;limited without either extending the genetic studies (e.g., do manipulations of XRN1, DCP2, or other decapping components phenocopy DCP1 manipulations) or better validating the link between DCP1 and insulin signaling. Are the aging and neuroendocrine phenotypes dependent on the decapping catalytic subunit Dcp2? Does deletion of dcap-2 completely suppress the lifespan effects of dcap-1 neuronal overexpression? This would be a way to further test whether mRNA decapping was important for these phenotypes.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. We have published the effects of <italic>dcap-2</italic> deletion or RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>dcap-2</italic>, <italic>xrn-1</italic> and <italic>part-1</italic> on wt worms, which all shortened lifespan and affected developmental growth, like <italic>dcap-1</italic> manipulations (Rousakis et al., 2014; Borbolis et al., 2017). To further elaborate on the role of DCAP-2 on the observed longevity phenotype, we have now provided additional data using a <italic>dcap-2</italic> deletion strain overexpressing neuronal and intestinal DCAP-1::GFP transgenes, as deletion of <italic>xrn-1</italic> is lethal for worms (Newbury and Woollard, RNA, 2004). As already mentioned above in response number 2, the lifespan of this strain was indistinguishable from that of control <italic>dcap-2</italic> animals (revised Figure 2E and Figure 2—source data 3). We therefore established that decapping activity is required for lifespan extension of <italic>dcap-1</italic> overexpressing worms.</p></body></sub-article></article>
