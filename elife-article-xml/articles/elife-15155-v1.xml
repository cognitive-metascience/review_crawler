DNA-bound PCNA is also presumed to direct MMR. The MMR capability must be limited to a post-replicative temporal window during which the signals are available. However, both identity of the signal(s) involved in the retention of this temporal window and the mechanism that maintains the MMR capability after DNA synthesis remain unclear. Using <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, we discovered a mechanism that ensures long-term retention of the MMR capability. We show that DNA-bound PCNA induces strand-specific MMR in the absence of strand discontinuities. Strikingly, MutSα inhibited PCNA unloading through its PCNA-interacting motif, thereby extending significantly the temporal window permissive to strand-specific MMR. Our data identify DNA-bound PCNA as the signal that enables strand discrimination after the disappearance of strand discontinuities, and uncover a novel role of MutSα in the retention of the post-replicative MMR capability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15155.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15155.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15155.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To pass on genetic information from one generation to the next, the DNA in a cell must be precisely copied. DNA is made of two strands and genetic information is encoded by sequences of molecules called bases in the strands. The bases from one strand form pairs with complementary bases on the other strand. However, errors in the copying process result in unmatched pairs of bases. Such errors are corrected by a repair system called mismatch repair.</p><p>When DNA is copied, the two strands are separated and used as templates to make new complementary strands. This means that errors only arise on the new strands. Mismatch repair must therefore target the new strands to maintain the original information encoded by the template DNA. The repair needs to happen before the copying process is complete because the template strands and the new strands become indistinguishable afterwards. However, it is not clear how the two processes communicate with each other.</p><p>Previous studies have identified a ring-shaped molecule called the replication clamp – which is essential for the copying process – as a prime candidate for the molecule responsible for this communication. This molecule binds to the DNA to promote the copying process, and afterwards it is removed from the DNA by other molecules. Furthermore, a group of proteins called the MutSα complex, which recognizes unmatched bases in DNA molecules, physically interacts with the replication clamp.</p><p>Kawasoe et al. used eggs from African clawed frogs to study how the replication clamp connects the copying process and mismatch repair in more detail. The experiments show that when the replication clamp is bound to the DNA, it is able to direct mismatch repair to a specific DNA strand. When MutSα recognizes unmatched bases, it prevents the replication clamp from being removed from the DNA. By doing so, MutSα prevents the information about the new DNA strand from being lost until mismatch repair has taken place.</p><p>These findings reveal new interactions between DNA copying and the correction of errors by mismatch repair. The next steps will be to understand how MutSα is able to keep the replication clamp on the DNA and to clarify its role in protecting DNA from gaining mutations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

system corrects replication errors post-replicatively to prevent their being fixed as mutations in the next round of complementary DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiricny, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kunkel and Erie, 2015</xref>). Since erroneously inserted nucleotides are present on newly synthesized DNA strands, identification of the newly synthesized strand is a critical step in MMR. By rectifying replication errors, MMR increases the replication fidelity by ~2 orders of magnitude in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lujan et al., 2014</xref>). In humans, genetic or epigenetic inactivation of MMR genes elevates the risk of tumorigenesis in both hereditary and sporadic manners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiricny, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, MMR distinguishes the parental and daughter strands mainly by using adenine methylation on GATC sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lahue et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iyer et al., 2006</xref>). Mismatches are recognized by the mismatch sensor MutS homodimer. MutS and the MutL homodimer then activate the latent nicking-endonuclease MutH, which cleaves the unmethylated strand at the hemi-methylated GATC sequences. MMR is possible from the time of hemi-methylated GATC generation by DNA synthesis until full methylation of the GATC sites. Maintaining this temporal window is critical for efficient MMR, because over-expression of the Dam methylase, by which full-methylation of the GATC sites is accelerated, significantly elevates the mutation frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herman and Modrich, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marinus et al., 1984</xref>). The <italic>E. coli</italic> MMR system can also correct replication errors through a methylation-independent mechanism, where strand discontinuities can substitute for GATC methylation both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laengle-Rouault et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lahue et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">1989</xref>).</p><p>Eukaryotic MMR is directed by strand discontinuities such as nicks or gaps in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holmes et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thomas et al., 1991</xref>). Two MutS heterodimers, MutSα (Msh2-Msh6) and MutSβ (Msh2-Msh3) recognize replication errors; MutSα has a biased preference for base-base mismatches and small insertion/deletion loops (IDLs), while MutSβ preferentially recognizes large IDLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiricny, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kunkel and Erie, 2015</xref>). After mismatch binding, MutSα/β are converted into closed ‘clamp-like’ forms, by which they can translocate along DNA. They then recruit the latent nicking-endonuclease MutLα (Mlh1-Pms2 in vertebrates and Mlh1-Pms1 in yeast) to initiate the removal of the error-carrying DNA strand. Two other eukaryotic MutL homologs, MutLβ (Mlh1-Pms1 in vertebrates and Mlh1-Mlh2 in yeast) and MutLγ (Mlh1-Mlh3) are suggested to play minor roles in somatic MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiricny, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell et al., 2014</xref>). Successful reconstitutions of eukaryotic MMR have shown that MutSα, or MutSβ, and MutLα, the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) sliding clamp, the clamp loader Replication Factor C (RFC), the Exo1 exonuclease, and the DNA synthesis components promote MMR when a strand discontinuity is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Genschel and Modrich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dzantiev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Constantin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). A strand discontinuity, which can occur on either 5’- or 3’-side of the mismatch, activates MutLα through a MutSα- and PCNA-dependent mechanism to induce successive rounds of nicking on the error-carrying strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kadyrov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pluciennik et al., 2010</xref>). Single-strand DNA termini such as 5’-ends of the Okazaki fragments serve as entry points for Exo1 and strand discrimination signals in vivo as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pavlov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nick McElhinny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liberti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lujan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that ribonucleotides embedded by replicative DNA polymerases serve as strand signals for MMR in vitro and contribute to a sub-fraction of leading strand MMR in vivo, after converted into single-strand gaps through RNaseH2-dependent ribonucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghodgaonkar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lujan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>PCNA has also been presumed to be the strand discrimination marker in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Umar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pavlov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dzantiev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kadyrov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pluciennik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hombauer et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peña-Diaz and Jiricny, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Georgescu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kunkel and Erie, 2015</xref>). PCNA is a ring-shaped homo-trimer that supports various DNA transactions including DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Georgescu et al., 2015</xref>). PCNA is loaded onto DNA from the template-primer junction by RFC, and likely unloaded by an RFC-like complex containing Elg1 after the completion of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kubota et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2015</xref>). Since its DNA binding is asymmetric with respect to polarities of the parental and daughter strands, DNA-bound PCNA can hold information for the newly synthesized strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Georgescu et al., 2015</xref>). PCNA plays an essential role in an early MMR step that precedes degradation of the error-carrying strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Umar et al., 1996</xref>). PCNA loaded from a strand discontinuity induces strand-specific, mismatch- and MutSα-dependent activation of the MutLα endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kadyrov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pluciennik et al., 2010</xref>). When PCNA is loaded onto closed circular DNA without defined orientation, it induces unbiased nicking on both DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pluciennik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2013</xref>). These findings have led to a proposal that orientation of DNA-bound PCNA is a critical determinant for the nicking specificity of MutLα.</p><p>In addition to its proposed role in strand discrimination, PCNA is also involved in multiple steps of MMR. Numbers of PCNA mutants in yeast exhibit mutator phenotypes that are epistatic to MMR mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Umar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goellner et al., 2014</xref>). It interacts with MutSα/β through their PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) motifs, which reside at the N-termini of Msh6 and Msh3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flores-Rozas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kleczkowska et al., 2001</xref>). In both cases, the PIP motifs and the mispair binding domains are connected through long linkers, which are predicted to be disordered in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shell et al., 2007</xref>). Mutants of the PIP motifs in Msh6 and Msh3 show substantial but not complete reduction of the MMR activity, indicating that the PIP motif plays an important, yet assistive, non-essential role in MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flores-Rozas et al., 2000</xref>). The PIP motif has been proposed to tether MutSα to the replication fork to assist its mismatch recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kleczkowska et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hombauer et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haye and Gammie, 2015</xref>). A recent study has shown that this motif in MutSα is important for a late MMR step(s) involving degradation of the error-carrying strand, especially by the Exo1-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goellner et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that PCNA coordinates multiple reactions in MMR, yet the exact role of PCNA in MMR is still not clearly defined.</p><p>An important remaining question in eukaryotic MMR is how (and how long) the strand discrimination signals are retained after DNA synthesis. It has been shown in yeast that MutSα must be present during S-phase to suppress mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hombauer et al., 2011b</xref>). Therefore, the generation and retention of the strand signals for MMR should be intimately coupled with DNA replication. Since PCNA transiently remains on DNA after the completion of DNA synthesis, DNA-bound PCNA could mediate the coupling of MMR with DNA replication. However, because experimental evidence that DNA-bound PCNA induces strand-specific MMR in the absence of strand discontinuities is currently lacking, it is still uncertain whether PCNA by itself can mediate the coupling of MMR with DNA replication. In addition, how functional interaction between the MMR system and DNA-bound PCNA, which should be unloaded from DNA shortly after the completion of DNA synthesis, is ensured remains highly unclear.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that MutSα and PCNA play a critical role in maintenance of the MMR capability after DNA synthesis. We show that nucleoplasmic extract (NPE) of <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs efficiently induces gap-directed, strand-specific MMR, whose capability remains even after sealing of the gap. We further show that DNA-bound PCNA induces strand-specific MMR in the absence of strand discontinuities. Strikingly, we found that MutSα attenuates unloading of PCNA and retains the MMR capability largely through its PIP motif.

A plasmid carrying an A:C mismatch, which is a preferred MMR substrate in crude <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Varlet et al., 1990</xref>), and a 15-nucleotide (nt) single-strand gap was constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This plasmid was synthesized in vitro by second strand DNA synthesis after annealing of a primer carrying a 'C'-mismatch on single-stranded phagemid DNA corresponding to the 'A'-strand. Since NPE contains a high concentration of Geminin, a specific inhibitor for assembly of pre-replicative complexes, no DNA replication initiates when DNA is incubated directly in NPE, while DNA synthesis from existing 3’-termini is active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Walter et al., 1998</xref>). NPE corrected the A:C mismatch by selectively editing the base on the gap-carrying strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>, see 'mock'), more efficiently than conventional crude <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Olivera Harris et al., 2015</xref>), a gap could be placed on either 5’ or 3’ of the mismatch, and repair DNA synthesis occurred preferentially within a fragment containing the shorter path between the gap and the mismatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that NPE supports bidirectional MMR. Depletion of the Msh2-containing (MutSα/β) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) or Mlh1-containing complexes (MutLα/β/γ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) abolished the repair reaction. Unlike other systems, a nick did not efficiently induce MMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results demonstrate that NPE efficiently recapitulates gap-directed, bi-directional MMR that is dependent on both MutSα/β and MutLα/β/γ. Some background repair observed in the absence of a gap could be due to either spontaneous base damages, which elicit base excision repair that in turn direct MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Repmann et al., 2015</xref>), or strand breaks that have occurred during handling of the substrate.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15155.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NPE promotes gap-directed MMR with efficient DNA synthesis at the gap site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DNA substrates used in this study.

To understand the temporal relationship between gap filling and gap-directed MMR, we compared the kinetics of DNA synthesis at the gap site and repair of the mismatch simultaneously on the same substrate. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, DNA synthesis at the gap site (estimated by digestion with <italic>Pac</italic>I placed within the gap) was mostly completed within 30 s.

The A to G MMR gradually progressed until ~30 min, and shortly after the mismatch correction, closed circular molecules were accumulated. These observations suggest that, in this gap-directed MMR model, efficient DNA synthesis at the gap site precedes mismatch correction involving degradation of the error-carrying strand. As suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Varlet et al., 1996</xref>), the 3’-terminus is likely used as a signal for MMR, rather than the initiation point of extensive strand removal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A gap-derived strand memory directs MMR even after gap filling</title><p>If the 3’-terminus generates a signal for strand discrimination, does the signal remain after the sealing of the gap, or is the 3’-terminus essential to initiate MMR? To answer this question, we set up a stepwise incubation assay that separates gap filling and mismatch recognition. We first incubated the MMR substrates in a MutSα/β-depleted (MutS-depleted) NPE, in which the gap should be filled and ligated without mismatch recognition, and then supplied MutSα/β by addition of fresh NPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the MutS-depleted NPE, more than 80% of gap-carrying plasmids were converted into the closed-circular form within 1.5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 9).

From 0.5 to 2 min, the MMR efficiency consistently exceeded the amounts of remaining strand discontinuities.

We therefore examined hPCNA retention and the MMR capability in the presence or absence of MutSα/β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In the MutS-depleted NPE, hPCNA was again quickly unloaded from mismatch-carrying DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In contrast, in the MutL-depleted NPE (containing endogenous MutSα/β but deficient for MMR), even at 30 min, more than one hPCNA trimer on an average still remained on DNA, and ~20% of mismatches were still repairable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 14). The difference in PCNA retention and the kinetics of repair was not due to remaining nicks on the DNA, because neither MutS- nor MutL-depletion significantly affected the level of nick-carrying molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Since DNA replication generates identical copies of parental DNA, the strand discrimination reaction in MMR necessarily requires direct or indirect interplay with the replication complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wagner and Meselson, 1976</xref>). Because of the asymmetric nature of its binding to DNA, its critical roles in an early step of MMR and in the activation of MutLα, PCNA is presumed to be the mediator of the interplay between the replication complex and MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Umar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pavlov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dzantiev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kadyrov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pluciennik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hombauer et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peña-Diaz and Jiricny, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Georgescu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kunkel and Erie, 2015</xref>). In this study, we provided experimental evidence that DNA-loaded PCNA indeed directs strand-specific MMR in the absence of strand discontinuities. We further discovered that MutSα inhibits PCNA unloading using its PIP motif on the N-terminus of Msh6, and that this reaction significantly extends the temporal window during which MMR is possible. Our results thus uncovered a novel mechanism in which interplay between PCNA and MutSα maintains the post-replicative temporal window for MMR.</p><p>NPE has been extensively used as a physiological model system that recapitulates various DNA repair reactions coupled with DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Räschle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Olivera Harris et al., 2015</xref>). As seen in other systems, we observed efficient bidirectional MMR in NPE (frequently &gt;80% efficient). Curiously, we noticed some difference between NPE and other systems. Both in reconstitution systems and in human cell extracts, 5’-nick directed MMR can occur in the absence of MutLα, whereas 3’-nick directed MMR depends on MutLα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drummond et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Genschel and Modrich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dzantiev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Constantin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bowen et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, not only 3’-gap directed but also 5’-gap directed MMR was dependent on MutL complexes in NPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>). Although this could possibly reflect difference in the 5’ to 3’ strand excision mechanism between species, we assume that the difference largely come from highly efficient DNA synthesis and ligation in NPE; quick sealing of a gap would necessitate MutLα-dependent incision for MMR even when a gap was placed on the 5’-side of the mismatch. Interestingly, DNA synthesis at the 3’-gap clearly precedes MMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating that strand degradation does not progressively occur from the 3’-terminus of the gap. PCNA molecules loaded at the 3’ terminus, perhaps more than one trimer, could be used by both MMR and DNA polymerases without significantly interfering with each other (see below). Consistently, a nick is suggested to function as a strand signal rather than an entry point for exonucleases in crude extracts of <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Varlet et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Our stepwise incubation experiments demonstrated that MMR is possible even after the complete sealing of the gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Three lines of evidence indicate that the molecule responsible for memorizing strand information is PCNA. First, directional loading of PCNA efficiently bypassed the need for strand discontinuities in strand-specific MMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Second, the amount of DNA-bound PCNA correlated with the MMR capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Third, MutSα maintained the MMR capability derived from a gap largely through the PIP motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The fact that PCNA was essential for the gap-filling reaction in NPE also supports this conclusion, because at least one PCNA trimer must be involved in DNA synthesis at the gap. It is unlikely that RFC determines the strand specificity of MMR in our experiments, because amounts of RFC remained on DNA were insufficient to explain the efficiency of MMR. Based on the above evidence, we suggest that PCNA would function as the strand discrimination signal for MMR after the disappearance of local strand discontinuities during DNA replication. A series of seminal studies from the Modrich lab has led to the model in which DNA-bound PCNA activates the MutLα nicking endonuclease to initiate strand specific MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kadyrov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pluciennik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2013</xref>). Our data are consistent with this prevailing model, since 1) DNA-bound PCNA induced strand-specific MMR in NPE, and 2) PCNA-directed MMR in NPE was completely dependent on the MutL complexes. As gap-directed MMR in NPE was bidirectional and preferentially degrades the DNA strand through the shortest path from the gap to the mismatch, we assume that the PCNA-directed MMR would function in the same manner. If so, the strand excision complex presumably built upon a specific face of PCNA would catalyze strand degradation in either direction depending on the relative orientation toward a mismatch. How this can be achieved is an important next question, and the system established here will be a useful tool to investigate this mechanism. However, since our plasmid substrates carry multiple PCNA molecules with free sliding ability, we currently do not exclude a possibility that PCNA-directed MMR catalyzes only a specific direction of strand excision, and PCNA molecules localized on a specific side toward a mismatch are preferentially used for MMR.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the 'strand memory' experiments revealed that MutSα/β significantly extend the duration of strand memory. Our data clearly indicate that this retention involves inhibition of PCNA unloading. A recent study showed that DNA polymerase δ captures DNA-bound PCNA which is otherwise quickly unloaded by the clamp-unloading activity of RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hedglin et al., 2013</xref>). It would be possible that MutSα inhibits PCNA unloading in a similar manner; binding of the PIP motif onto PCNA may physically prevent the engagement of PCNA with RFC. Since in vivo PCNA unloading during S-phase largely depends on the Elg1-containing RFC-like complex (Elg1-RLC) both in humans and in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kubota et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shiomi and Nishitani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kubota et al., 2015</xref>), the PIP-motif in MutSα may also limit the access of Elg1-RLC to DNA-bound PCNA. Detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism of this inhibition of PCNA unloading must await reconstitution of this reaction in vitro.</p><p>Interestingly, the PIP motif and the mispair-binding domain are connected by a long (~300 a.a.) linker that is predicted to be disordered in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shell et al., 2007</xref>). Although a significant portion of this linker in human MutSα seems to adopt a globular conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iyer et al., 2008</xref>), MutSα might be able to retain PCNA that is located far from MutSα using this long 'PIP-arm', possibly even over nucleosomes. In this scenario, strand removal would initiate when MutLα reaches to PCNA that is retained by the PIP-arm of MutSα. This could be accomplished either by sliding of MutSα-MutLα complexes along the DNA contour, or through loading of multiple MutLα molecules on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hombauer et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Qiu et al., 2015</xref>). Interaction between PCNA that is retained by MutSα and MutLα may invoke a specific strand degradation pathway, because a recent study in yeast has suggested that recruitment or retention of PCNA by MutSα around mismatches activates a specific strand removal pathway that is independent of Exo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goellner et al., 2014</xref>). As seen for MutSα, we predict that MutSβ may inhibit PCNA unloading as well, since the NTR of yeast Msh6 and Msh3 are inter-exchangeable without significant deleterious effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shell et al., 2007</xref>). However, because NTRs of MutSα and MutSβ likely possess different characteristics such as the PWWP domain found only in vertebrate Msh6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laguri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2013</xref>), this point will need rigorous investigation.</p><p>To our surprise, xMutSα<sup>PIP</sup> and xMutSα<sup>ΔN</sup> retained partial strand memory. A possibility would be that, although our PCNA unloading experiment failed to detect attenuation of PCNA unloading with these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), they might have the ability to maintain DNA-bound PCNA that is below our detection limit. Considering the fact that we quantified PCNA after several washing steps, our quantification almost certainly underestimated the number of PCNA molecules on DNA. Alternatively, PCNA and/or a gap could induce structural alteration of MutSα (and possibly other chromatin binding factors), to maintain the strand information. How MutSα retains strand memory independently of the NTR will be an interesting question for future studies.</p><p>From the data presented in this work, we propose a model wherein two different modes of strand memory contribute to MMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). After the completion of local DNA synthesis, <italic>e.g.</italic> after ligation of Okazaki fragments, PCNA remains on DNA for a certain period until unloaded by an Rfc3-containing complex(es) (<italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic> = ~2 min in NPE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, [2]). The MMR system utilizes such PCNA as strand memory. However, if PCNA is not available closely adjacent to mismatches, MutSα (and possibly MutSβ also) retains available PCNA with its long 'PIP-arm', to maintain strand memory for subsequent MMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, [3]). This mode of memory survives for &gt;30 min in NPE, and perhaps even longer in cells. In addition to the PIP-dependent tethering of MutSα/β to the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kleczkowska et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hombauer et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haye and Gammie, 2015</xref>), we suggest that the PIP motif would contribute to the replication fidelity through this mode of strand memory. Yeast studies have shown that the PIP motif has an assistive but not essential role in MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flores-Rozas et al., 2000</xref>). The PIP-deficient MutSα complexes were proficient in repairing a mismatch in our in vitro MMR system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), and similar observations were already reported both in human cell extracts and in a yeast in vitro reconstitution system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kleczkowska et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bowen et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, a simple MMR reaction involving a mismatch and a closely-placed strand-discrimination signal, either PCNA or a strand discontinuity, would not require retention of PCNA by MutSα. However, when a stepwise incubation, which mimics transient arrest of the MMR reaction, was involved, the PIP motif became important for MMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We speculate that inhibition of PCNA unloading is needed for MMR only under specific situations, <italic>e.g.</italic> when a strand-discrimination signal is buried within chromatin. In such difficult-to-repair situations, successful MMR may rely on the maintenance of the strand signals by MutSα. Since the leading strand seems to have less PCNA than the lagging strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu et al., 2014</xref>), such situations could happen more frequently in the leading strand, in which MMR is less efficient than in the lagging strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pavlov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lujan et al., 2014</xref>). An interesting possibility worth testing in the future would be that MutSα may take over PCNA from other factors such as DNA polymerases. Hijacking PCNA from polymerases may not be overly deleterious to DNA synthesis, because new PCNA loading at the 3’-terminus would quickly restore the PCNA-polymerase complex. Similar hijacking might occur on other PCNA interactors such as CAF-1 and FEN-1, both of which are reported to show complex interplay with MutSα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kadyrova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schöpf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kadyrova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). On the leading strand that has less PCNA, such competition could be important for effective MMR.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15155.030</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Two modes of strand memory maintain the MMR capability.</title><p>Three mechanisms, including two 'strand-memory' mechanisms, may ensure eukaryotic MMR.

Various concentrations of xMutSα<sup>WT</sup>, xMutSα<sup>PIP</sup> and xMutSα<sup>ΔN</sup> complexes were flowed over the sensor chip for 3 min at 20 μl/min in running buffer (20 mM Hepes-NaOH pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 0.005% Tween-20) to analyze the association step, followed by running buffer containing no protein to monitor the dissociation step for 3 min. The signal from an empty flow cell was used for reference subtraction for all experiments. The chip surface was regenerated with 3 M NaCl for 1 min. Dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) were calculated using the BIAevaluation software v4.1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>The GenBank accession numbers

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript describes a series of experiments that analyze the strand-directed mismatch repair reaction in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. This is an interesting and important work that advances our understanding of eukaryotic mismatch repair. However, the following important technical and conceptual issues need to be satisfactorily addressed before the paper can be considered for publication.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) PIP-deficient MutS protein is proficient in MMR. Based on the authors' assumption, MutSα without the PIP box-containing N-termini should be defective in capturing strand discrimination signal from PCNA. Unfortunately, the mutant MutSα is as active as WT MutSα in repair of heteroduplexes bound by PCNA.</p><p>2) PCNA polarity and nick-mismatch orientation. Previous studies using a circular heteroduplex have established that regardless of nick orientation (i.e., 5' or 3') to the mismatch, MMR always occurs along the shorter distance between these two sites. If MutS protein interacts with PCNA through the front face of PCNA, MutSα and other MMR proteins recruited by MutSα to A-gap and C-gap substrates should be lined up in different polarities/orientations, which would suggest that repair in one substrate occurs along the shorter spin and the other in longer spin. These assumptions are not consistent with what is known.</p><p>3) Interaction between PCNA and MutSα. Although MutS protein has been shown to be able to slide along the DNA, increasing evidence (both in vivo and in vitro) suggests that MutS protein does not travel once it binds to a mismatch. The authors suggest that the stand signal carried by PCNA is transmitted to MutSα when the latter interacts with PCNA through its PIP box. Given that the mismatch is ~300 bp away from the gap site, where PCNA is located, it is impossible for MutS protein to reach PCNA. How could this interaction occur?</p><p>4) The authors showed that the presence of PCNA in closed circular heteroduplex is essential for strand-specific repair, and that the DNA bound PCNA could be unloaded within ~5 min. What is the mechanism by which PCNA is released from a closed circular DNA molecule?</p><p>Other specific issues:</p><p>1) The deletion of the PIP motif of MSH6, which the authors have identified as a major determinant involved in the inhibition of PCNA unloading by MutSalpha, decreased the in vivo mismatch repair activity of yeast MutSalpha in MSH3-deficient cells by ~5-20% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> in Clark et al. (2000) JBC, 275, 36498). Thus, it appears that the inhibition of PCNA unloading by MutSalpha is not essential for MMR. Some discussion of this fact would be helpful.</p><p>2) In the Abstract, the authors state that &quot;Our data identify PCNA as the signal that enables strand discrimination after the completion of DNA synthesis…&quot;. I think they should write something like &quot;Our data identify loaded PCNA as the signal that enables strand discrimination after the strand discontinuity is removed…&quot;.</p><p>3) The description of the MMR and gap-filling assays and immunological methods in Materials and methods and figure legends is too vague and lacks many critical experimental details including the final volumes and ionic strength of the reaction mixtures and the amounts of the extracts present in the reaction mixtures. The lack of this information complicates understanding the results. Please provide the relevant information.</p><p>4) It is not clear why the authors do not see the nick-directed MMR in the NPE. In fact, the data shown in panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> suggest that MMR is directed, though not very efficiently, to the covalently closed strand. This is somewhat confusing. Did the authors study whether the rates of ligation of the nicked and gapped DNA substrates differ from each other? Some experimental data would be helpful to explain the failure to see the nick-directed MMR.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>: it appears that the fractions of the nicked form in the ligated DNA samples analyzed in lanes 1-4 of C panel are significantly higher than those in panel B (lanes 5-8). It appears that at least 35% of DNA in lane 4 of panel C is nicked. Please provide the percentages of the closed form present in the samples analyzed in the panel C lanes. Also indicate the percentage of the closed form for each of the substrates used in the reactions in D.</p><p>6) Inspection of the repair data in panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> suggests that in several cases the band intensities do not correspond well to the indicated repair values. Please provide the averages and S.D. for the experiments in this panel.</p><p>In some control reactions (panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) the level of C-to-T repair on the continuous strand is about 25% and about 50% higher than that on the nicked strand. How do the authors explain this result? Is this the strand that was synthesized in vitro?</p><p>7) MMR reactions observed in the NPE display poor strand discrimination. It is evident that the discontinuous strand is repaired only 5-10 times better than the continuous strand. Such weak strand discrimination would cause many mutations in vivo, but in vivo data indicate that the strand discrimination is very efficient. Please discuss potential reasons of the limited strand discrimination in the analyzed reactions.</p><p>8) Did the authors verify in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref> that MutS depletion did not somehow affect the rate of closed circular plasmid accumulation?</p><p>9) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, it would be helpful to indicate which samples were digested with XhoI, which with BamHI. Also, the difference between panels 1D and E is not apparent.</p><p>10) There is a major discrepancy in the kinetics of% closed plasmid accumulation between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> (slow) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> (fast) (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, also fast). Which is correct? It seems that the slow kinetics of closed circular formation (black graph in 1F) is therefore not representative.</p><p>11) &quot;Unlike homoduplex plasmids, the gap-filling DNA synthesis did not covalently close the mismatch-carrying plasmid, suggesting that new strand breaks are introduced on the DNA.&quot; This sentence is unclear. Do the authors mean that the mismatch plasmid was not fully converted to supercoiled, based on the ~20% fraction of gapped/nicked molecules remaining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>? Overall, this paragraph is difficult to follow.</p><p>12) &quot;Although it has not been clear whether the MMR system can correct replication errors after the completion of local DNA synthesis except the ribonucleotide-directed mechanism, since PCNA remains on DNA after the completion of DNA synthesis until unloaded by the PCNA unloader complex, DNA-bound PCNA could mediate the coupling of MMR with DNA replication by generating a post-replicative temporal window permissive to MMR.&quot; This sentence is too long and poorly constructed.</p><p>13) &quot;In the absence of MutSα/β, the strand information was retained for 1-2 min after disappearance of strand discontinuities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)&quot; This is an odd description of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. It would be better to say: &quot;In the absence of MutSα/β, the strand information was gradually lost after the disappearance of strand discontinuities…&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15155.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major issues:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) PIP-deficient MutS protein is proficient in MMR.

On the one hand, the PIP motif in MutSα should be in principle dispensable for MMR. Previous genetic studies in yeast have shown that the PIP motif is important but not essential for MMR. Three previous studies (Kleczkowska et al., <italic>Genes Dev</italic>, 2001, Iyer et al., <italic>J Biol Chem</italic>, 2008, and Bowen et al., <italic>Proc Nat Acad Sci</italic>, 2013) have already shown that PIP-deficient MutSα can promote MMR either in human cell extracts or in a reconstituted system. Although Kleczkowska et al. have seen a partial reduction in the MMR efficiency with PIP deletion, other two studies agree that PIP-deficient MutSα is essentially as active as the wild-type protein for in vitro MMR that uses plasmid substrates. A series of seminal studies from the Modrich lab has shown that it is MutLα that initiates strand removal during MMR. This point is related to Major issue 2, and discussed there in detail (Discussion, third paragraph). Both in vivo data and in vitro analyses indicate that the PIP motif in MutSα is not essential for activation of MutLα.</p><p>On the other hand, since inhibition of PCNA unloading would indirectly assist strand discrimination through the retention of the strand signal, PIP-defective MutSα should have somewhat reduced activity in repair of mismatches. As mentioned already, although not essential, the PIP motif has an important role in MMR, since its deletion shows substantial increment of spontaneous mutation rates in yeast cells. The discrepancy between the in vivo observation and in vitro experiments suggest that (1) the PIP-dependent inhibition of PCNA unloading is important under specific situations that occur in vivo, and (2) plasmid-based in vitro MMR systems may not recapitulate such situations. Interestingly, once stepwise incubation, which mimics transient arrest of the MMR reaction, was involved, the PIP motif became important for the MMR efficiency in an in vitro assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Therefore, it would be reasonable to speculate that the PIP motif becomes important for MMR under a certain “difficult-to-repair” situation, e.g. when PCNA is buried in chromatin. We now included relevant discussion in the revised text (Discussion, seventh paragraph). We feel that addition of above arguments made the paper significantly richer, and appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion.</p><p><italic>2) PCNA polarity and nick-mismatch orientation. Previous studies using a circular heteroduplex have established that regardless of nick orientation (i.e., 5' or 3') to the mismatch, MMR always occurs along the shorter distance between these two sites. If MutS protein interacts with PCNA through the front face of PCNA, MutSα and other MMR proteins recruited by MutSα to A-gap and C-gap substrates should be lined up in different polarities/orientations, which would suggest that repair in one substrate occurs along the shorter spin and the other in longer spin. These assumptions are not consistent with what is known.</italic></p><p>In the original manuscript, we have not traced DNA synthesis during MMR, and therefore it has not been clear whether NPE supports bidirectional strand excision. In response to the reviewers’ criticism, we have carried out this experiment. The result showed that, as widely acknowledged, repair DNA synthesis occurs preferentially along the shorter path between a gap and a mismatch, regardless of relative orientation between them (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The data confirmed that NPE promotes truly bidirectional MMR with the capability of both 5’ to 3’ and 3’ to 5’ strand excision (Results, first paragraph).</p><p>As mentioned in Major issue 1, biochemical reconstitution studies from the Modrich lab (Kadyrov et al., <italic>Cell</italic>, 2006, Kadyrov et al., <italic>J Biol Chem</italic>, 2007, Pluciennik et al., <italic>Proc Natl Acad Sci</italic>, 2010, Pluciennik et al., <italic>Proc Natl Acad Sci</italic>, 2013) have shown that MutLα is the key enzyme to initiate and promote strand excision. Since both gap-directed and PCNA-directed MMR was dependent on the MutL complexes, we assume that, as widely accepted, bidirectional strand excision seen in NPE is initiated by MutLα. As the reviewers pointed out, either or both of MutSα and MutLα should be lined up toward a specific face of PCNA, and it is interesting to understand how this complex degrades the DNA strand in either direction depending on the relative orientation toward a mismatch. Although clarification of this mechanism will require extensive future work such as single-molecule tracing of the MMR machinery and will be beyond the scope of this paper, discussion on this point would be important for interpretation of the data presented in this study. We now included relevant discussion in the revised manuscript (Discussion, third paragraph).</p><p>In addition, previous in vitro studies have shown that the 5’ to 3’ and 3’ to 5’ strand excision reactions employ a slightly different set of proteins, suggesting mechanistic difference between two modes of strand excision; the former does not require MutLα, while the latter requires it. We observed that both 5’-gap-directed and 3’-gap-directed MMR reactions were dependent on the MutL complexes in NPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We thought that this finding is also related to the issue discussed above, and we included discussion on this point as well (Discussion, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Interaction between PCNA and MutSα. Although MutS protein has been shown to be able to slide along the DNA, increasing evidence (both in vivo and in vitro) suggests that MutS protein does not travel once it binds to a mismatch. The authors suggest that the stand signal carried by PCNA is transmitted to MutSα when the latter interacts with PCNA through its PIP box. Given that the mismatch is ~300 bp away from the gap site, where PCNA is located, it is impossible for MutS protein to reach PCNA. How could this interaction occur?</italic></p><p>Since the PIP motif is not essential for MMR, it will not be essential for transmission of the strand information from PCNA to the MMR system. However, we suggested in this paper that MutSα may capture DNA-bound PCNA possibly from a remote place through the PIP-motif. In this case, the mismatch-bound MutSα (and likely MutLα also) and PCNA that is present at a different place would eventually need to interact with each other to initiate MMR. As the reviewers have commented, there is evidence that the MutS/MutL complexes binding to a mismatch do not slide away from the mismatch, and multiple MutL complexes may be responsible for communication between mismatch-bound MMR complexes and nearby PCNA molecules. We apologize for the lack of mention on this point in the original manuscript. We now included discussion on potential mechanisms of how MutSα (and MutLα) and a PCNA molecule that is captured by MutSα can communicate with each other to initiate MMR (Discussion, fifth paragraph). We appreciate the reviewers’ helpful suggestion on this point.</p><p><italic>4) The authors showed that the presence of PCNA in closed circular heteroduplex is essential for strand-specific repair, and that the DNA bound PCNA could be unloaded within ~5 min. What is the mechanism by which PCNA is released from a closed circular DNA molecule?</italic></p><p>Since we used a closed circular DNA substrate for our assay, PCNA unloading should involve the opening of the PCNA ring, a reaction that is catalyzed by the PCNA loader/unloader complex(es). Indeed, we showed that depletion of Rfc3, a common subunit of all four RFC-like complexes, significantly slows down the unloading reaction in NPE. It has been known that canonical RFC can catalyze both loading and unloading of PCNA. In addition, the Elg1-containing RFC like complex is largely responsible for PCNA unloading from post-replicative DNA during S phase. Therefore, we speculate that either or both of them would be involved in the unloading of PCNA from circular DNA substrates in NPE. Unavailability of specific antibodies against <italic>Xenopus</italic> Rfc1 or Elg1 prevented us to distinguish which one is primarily responsible for PCNA unloading. However, the identity of the relevant unloader does not affect our conclusion that MutSα prevents the unloading of PCNA. In the original manuscript, we just briefly mentioned that PCNA unloading is dependent on an unloading complex(es) containing Rfc3. In response to the reviewers’ point, we now included discussion on possible factors and mechanism of PCNA unloading and speculation on the mechanism of the inhibition of PCNA unloading by MutSα (Discussion, fourth paragraph), which we feel significantly improved the paper.</p><p><italic>Other specific issues:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The deletion of the PIP motif of MSH6, which the authors have identified as a major determinant involved in the inhibition of PCNA unloading by MutSalpha, decreased the in vivo mismatch repair activity of yeast MutSalpha in MSH3-deficient cells by ~5-20% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> in Clark et al. (2000) JBC, 275, 36498). Thus, it appears that the inhibition of PCNA unloading by MutSalpha is not essential for MMR. Some discussion of this fact would be helpful.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for the helpful suggestion. As discussed in Major issue 1, we predict that the PIP motif may be needed for MMR under a certain “difficult-to-repair” situation, e.g. when PCNA is buried in chromatin. We included relevant discussion in the revised manuscript (Discussion, seventh paragraph).</p><p> <italic>2) In the Abstract, the authors state that &quot;Our data identify PCNA as the signal that enables strand discrimination after the completion of DNA synthesis…&quot;. I think they should write something like &quot;Our data identify loaded PCNA as the signal that enables strand discrimination after the strand discontinuity is removed…&quot;.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ correction. The sentence in the Abstract was changed as follows: “Our data identify DNA-bound PCNA as the signal that enables strand discrimination after disappearance of strand discontinuities, and uncover a novel role of MutSα in the retention of the post-replicative MMR capability.”</p><p><italic>3) The description of the MMR and gap-filling assays and immunological methods in Materials and methods and figure legends is too vague and lacks many critical experimental details including the final volumes and ionic strength of the reaction mixtures and the amounts of the extracts present in the reaction mixtures. The lack of this information complicates understanding the results. Please provide the relevant information.</italic></p><p>Unlike other in vitro systems that use cell extracts, <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts are prepared essentially devoid of additional buffers, and usually used as is, without addition of any buffers or salts. However, we realized that, in the original version of Materials and methods, this was not very clear for readers, and also we didn’t mention the volumes of the reactions. We now included relevant information in Materials and methods and figure legends. Also we added more information regarding the immunodepletion procedure to describe better what we have carried out. We apologize for the lack of the relevant information in the original manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) It is not clear why the authors do not see the nick-directed MMR in the NPE. In fact, the data shown in panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> suggest that MMR is directed, though not very efficiently, to the covalently closed strand. This is somewhat confusing. Did the authors study whether the rates of ligation of the nicked and gapped DNA substrates differ from each other? Some experimental data would be helpful to explain the failure to see the nick-directed MMR.</italic></p><p>A nick can induce some strand specific MMR but not as efficiently as a gap, and we originally stated “Unlike other systems, a nick did not efficiently induce MMR, possibly because nick ligation is very quick in NPE”. Upon the reviewers’ suggestion, we now showed a direct comparison between nick- and gap-directed MMR (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) and performed a follow-up experiment, in which we found that ligation of a nick is only partially dependent on PCNA (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, panels E and F). Since sealing of a gap is completely dependent on PCNA, this new data provides an explanation as to why nicks do not induce strand-specific MMR as efficiently as gaps. We now included these new data, and modified relevant descriptions accordingly (subsection “The MutS complexes inhibit Rfc3-dependent PCNA unloading”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>: it appears that the fractions of the nicked form in the ligated DNA samples analyzed in lanes 1-4 of C panel are significantly higher than those in panel B (lanes 5-8). It appears that at least 35% of DNA in lane 4 of panel C is nicked. Please provide the percentages of the closed form present in the samples analyzed in the panel C lanes. Also indicate the percentage of the closed form for each of the substrates used in the reactions in D.</italic></p><p>In the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>, we split the samples shown in (B) into two portions. One portion (C) was incubated in the presence or absence of <italic>Xmn</italic>I for 60 min to see if PCNA slides off from DNA by linearization of the plasmid, and the other portion (D) was immediately incubated in NPE to see if MMR occurs. The nicked form plasmids seen in (C), lanes 1-4, was therefore accumulated during incubation in a buffer for 60 min. The percentages of the closed form for substrates used in (D) are exactly those shown in (B). We apologize for this confusion, and modified the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to make this point clear. The percentages of the closed circular molecules for lanes 1-4 are 63, 60, 62, and 59%, respectively. Since we considered that the percentages of the closed form in (C) are not relevant for interpretation of the results, we did not put these values in panel (C) in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) Inspection of the repair data in panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> suggests that in several cases the band intensities do not correspond well to the indicated repair values. Please provide the averages and S.D. for the experiments in this panel.</italic> </p><p>We repeated the quantification of the data in panel (B) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and confirmed that the values presented in the figure are correct. We are ready to provide the original tiff image and/or the raw quantification data upon reviewers’ request. To provide the averages and standard deviation for the experiment, we now also included a graph of the quantification data from three independent experiments with standard deviation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel C).</p><p><italic>In some control reactions (panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) the level of C-to-T repair on the continuous strand is about 25% and about 50% higher than that on the nicked strand. How do the authors explain this result? Is this the strand that was synthesized in vitro?</italic></p><p>We have made the substrates by in vitro synthesis of the second strand using single-stranded phagemid DNA as the templates (corresponding to the “A”-strand). Therefore, the observed C-to-T repair occurred on the strand synthesized in vitro. It is not clear why the level of repair on the continuous strand was higher than that on the nicked strand. However, as shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel C, this tendency was not statistically significant. Perhaps more mechanical or chemical DNA damages have occurred on the substrate in this particular experiment for some reasons.</p><p>Since the substrates were synthesized in vitro, it is likely that the bases in free nucleotides used as substrates for in vitro DNA synthesis and/or on single-stranded DNA templates contain small amount of spontaneous damages (e.g. oxidization of bases). Such damages can elicit base-excision repair (BER), which in turn trigger MMR by providing strand breaks (Repmann et al., <italic>J Biol Chem</italic>, 2015). We predict that such BER may be part of the reason why we see some background repair of mismatches. In some substrates, the background repair showed slight strand bias as pointed out by the reviewers, and this may be because a specific strand contained more damages, although we don’t have evidence for this point. We now included short description of DNA preparation, and relevant arguments in the revised text (Results, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>7) MMR reactions observed in the NPE display poor strand discrimination. It is evident that the discontinuous strand is repaired only 5-10 times better than the continuous strand. Such weak strand discrimination would cause many mutations in vivo, but in vivo data indicate that the strand discrimination is very efficient. Please discuss potential reasons of the limited strand discrimination in the analyzed reactions.</italic></p><p>We agree that the strand bias of MMR seen in NPE was not strong enough to explain the in vivo MMR efficiency. Since gap-directed repair of mismatch is reasonably efficient as an in vitro reaction and sometimes reaches to 80% (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), the major reason for this somewhat modest strand bias is relatively high non-specific repair of mismatches. As discussed in the response to specific point 6, we speculate that such non-specific repair could be due to background BER or physical damages on the DNA substrate. As stated there, we included the relevant argument in the revised text (Results, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>8) Did the authors verify in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref> that MutS depletion did not somehow affect the rate of closed circular plasmid accumulation?</italic></p><p>Although we did not examine whether depletion of MutS or MutL affects the rate of closed plasmid accumulation in this particular experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> shows that these depletions do not significantly affect either the rate of gap filling or the level of the closed circular molecules. In addition, we have repeated the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> to test accumulation of closed circular molecules in MutS- or MutL-depleted NPE (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The results show that neither of depletion conditions largely affects the rate of closed circular plasmid accumulation, and importantly, nicks were not accumulated in MutL-depleted NPE in which we observed longer retention of the MMR capability. Therefore, it is unlikely that difference in the accumulation of closed circular molecules has affected the MMR capability after incubation in MutS- or MutL-depleted NPE.</p><p><italic>9) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, it would be helpful to indicate which samples were digested with XhoI, which with BamHI. Also, the difference between panels 1D and E is not apparent.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for their helpful suggestion. We now included the information of the restriction enzyme in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. For panels 1D and 1E, we changed the order of the panels in a way such that MMR in MutS-depleted NPE (former 1D) immediately follows the western blot (1B), and MMR in MutL-depleted NPE (1E) does so as well.</p><p><italic>10) There is a major discrepancy in the kinetics of% closed plasmid accumulation between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> (slow) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> (fast) (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, also fast). Which is correct? It seems that the slow kinetics of closed circular formation (black graph in 1F) is therefore not representative.</italic></p><p>Both data are actually correct. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> shows the kinetics of sealing of a gap in the absence of a mismatch, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> is the same experiment but in the presence of a mismatch. We agree that the difference was not explicit in the original manuscript, and apologize for this confusion. We now revised the description of the results to make this point clear (Results, second paragraph). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the plasmid substrate was incubated in MutS-depleted NPE. Therefore, although the substrate contained a mismatch, it behaved as if there was no mismatch present on the DNA.</p><p><italic>11) &quot;Unlike homoduplex plasmids, the gap-filling DNA synthesis did not covalently close the mismatch-carrying plasmid, suggesting that new strand breaks are introduced on the DNA.&quot; This sentence is unclear. Do the authors mean that the mismatch plasmid was not fully converted to supercoiled, based on the ~20% fraction of gapped/nicked molecules remaining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>? Overall, this paragraph is difficult to follow.</italic></p><p>This point is related to specific point 10. We apologize for the ambiguous description of the experiments, and revised the text in order to make it clear that we have carried out two independent experiments with a substrate carrying no mismatch and that carrying a mismatch (Results, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>12) &quot;Although it has not been clear whether the MMR system can correct replication errors after the completion of local DNA synthesis except the ribonucleotide-directed mechanism, since PCNA remains on DNA after the completion of DNA synthesis until unloaded by the PCNA unloader complex, DNA-bound PCNA could mediate the coupling of MMR with DNA replication by generating a post-replicative temporal window permissive to MMR.&quot; This sentence is too long and poorly constructed.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers’ criticism. To state only essential points, the sentence was simplified as follows. “Since PCNA transiently remains on DNA after the completion of DNA synthesis, DNA-bound PCNA could mediate the coupling of MMR with DNA replication.”</p><p> <italic>13) &quot;In the absence of MutSα/β, the strand information was retained for 1-2 min after disappearance of strand discontinuities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)&quot; This is an odd description of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. It would be better to say: &quot;In the absence of MutSα/β, the strand information was gradually lost after the disappearance of strand discontinuities…&quot;.</italic></p><p>The reviewers are correct. We changed the expression accordingly (subsection “The MutS complexes inhibit Rfc3-dependent PCNA unloading”, first paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
