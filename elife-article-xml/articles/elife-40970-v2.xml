However, the actual role of leptin during development is not yet fully understood. To uncover the importance of leptin in early life, the present study restored leptin signaling either at the fourth or tenth week of age in mice formerly null for the leptin receptor (LepR) gene. We found that some defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal deficiency of leptin signaling, including the poor development of arcuate nucleus neural projections, were recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood. However, LepR deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure. LepR reactivation in adulthood also led to persistent reduction in hypothalamic <italic>Pomc</italic>, <italic>Cartpt</italic> and <italic>Prlh</italic> mRNA expression and to defects in the reproductive system and brain growth. Our findings revealed that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine and developmental problems.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40970.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Leptin is a hormone that keeps us healthy in many ways. It regulates our body weight by reining in our appetite and fine-tuning the energy we burn, and it helps us establish and maintain our fertility. It also participates in brain development. Leptin performs these roles by attaching to specific receptors in nerve cells and relaying relevant information to the brain.</p><p>Early events can trigger life-long changes in the way our body works, a process called metabolic programming. Leptin is believed to participate in this reprogramming mechanism, but its role remains uncertain. In particular, it is still unclear which leptin-driven changes are permanent, and which ones are reversible. Being able to distinguish between the two types of alterations would help to better grasp the role leptin plays in early development.</p><p>Here, Ramos-Lobo et al. examined genetically engineered mice born without a working leptin receptor. These animals were impervious to the effects of leptin. Then, once the rodents were adults, they were treated with a drug that restored their leptin receptors, making them sensitive to the hormone again. These experiments revealed that mice without leptin receptors during early life developed obesity, were less able to lose weight and burned less energy. Their reproductive success was also compromised. Finally, the lack of leptin during development caused permanent reduction of the animals’ brains, and changes in the activity of certain genes in the organ.</p><p>The work by Ramos-Lobo et al. indicates that in mice, lacking leptin sensibility early in life conditions the body to permanently become ‘thrifty’, burning less energy and making it harder to lose weight. It is rare for humans to be born completely without leptin activity. Yet, having too much or too little food as a baby affects the level of the hormone, or our sensitivity to it: this may permanently change the way our bodies manage energy. Ultimately, learning more about these mechanisms could help us ward off or treat obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolic programming</kwd><kwd>cytokines</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>melanocortin system</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15/10992-6</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donato</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14/11752-6</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramos-Lobo</surname><given-names>Angela M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16/09679-4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furigo</surname><given-names>Isadora C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mouse model that grew without functional leptin receptors until adulthood reveals that early defects in leptin signaling lead to permanent metabolic and developmental problems.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The hormone leptin is best known as a key signal to the brain conveying information about body energy reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maffei et al., 1995</xref>). Consequently, leptin receptor (LepR)-expressing neurons are apt to modulate food intake and energy expenditure according to the amount of energy stored and the current energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramos-Lobo and Donato, 2017</xref>). Hence, null mutations in the genes that encode for leptin or LepR impair the capacity of the hypothalamus to regulate energy homeostasis, leading to profound metabolic dysfunctions in humans and rodents, including severe obesity, hyperphagia, low-energy expenditure, hypoactivity, insulin resistance and infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halaas et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Montague et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farooqi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Licinio et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the role of leptin in energy homeostasis, other studies have shown that leptin can affect developmental processes, especially in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahima et al., 1999</xref>). Regarding this aspect, rodents exhibit a postnatal leptin surge between the first and second week of age that is not associated to changes in fat mass or food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahima et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, 2-week-old mice do not respond to the anorexigenic effects of leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mistry et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, leptin does not seem to be involved in the regulation of energy balance during the first weeks of life in mice. However, synaptic plasticity in the hypothalamus is regulated by leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pinto et al., 2004</xref>). Leptin signaling is also required for the formation of the neural projections from the arcuate nucleus (ARH) to post-synaptic targets, a process that takes place in the first 2 weeks of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouret et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kamitakahara et al., 2018</xref>). In accordance, leptin promotes neurite outgrowth in vitro and leptin-deficient (<italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic>) mice show disruption of ARH neural projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouret et al., 2004b</xref>). Importantly, exogenous leptin rescues the development of ARH projections of <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice only when provided in the neonatal period. Thus, these findings suggest that the lack of leptin signaling in the first weeks of life permanently disrupts these projections in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouret et al., 2004b</xref>).</p><p>Important implications arise from the developmental effects of leptin. For example, changes in leptin signaling during development could then affect the organization of critical neural circuits that regulate energy homeostasis, favoring the incidence of metabolic diseases later in life. Thus, leptin may also be involved in the developmental programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ralevski and Horvath, 2015</xref>). Accordingly, early postnatal leptin blockage in rats leads to long-term leptin resistance and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attig et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, neonatal leptin treatment reverses the developmental programming caused by maternal undernutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vickers et al., 2005</xref>). However, it is worth mentioning that despite the aforementioned evidence about leptin’s developmental effects, exogenous leptin replacement can reverse key metabolic abnormalities exhibited by leptin-deficient mice or humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pelleymounter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ioffe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farooqi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Licinio et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donato et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the actual importance of leptin signaling during development for the long-term energy homeostasis and other aspects regulated by leptin is not yet fully understood. Thus, to uncover the role of leptin during development, we investigated the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life. For this purpose, we studied knockout mice for the <italic>Lepr</italic> gene that grew without leptin’s effects. However, LepR expression was restored either at the fourth or tenth week of life. Our findings revealed that some defects previously considered irreversible due to the lack of leptin signaling in the neonatal period, such as the poor development of ARH neural projections, can be recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood. On the other hand, the absence of leptin signaling in early life permanently impairs energy homeostasis, the melanocortin system, as well as the reproduction and brain development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LepR reactivation in adult mice</title><p>To study the importance of leptin signaling during development, we used the LepRNull mouse model that carries a transcription blocker between exons 16 and 17 of the <italic>Lepr</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berglund et al., 2012</xref>), preventing the expression of the long LepR isoform (<italic>Lepr-b</italic>).

Since the transcription blocker of LepRNull mice is flanked by <italic>LoxP</italic> sites, a temporal Cre expression can permanently remove this cassette. LepRNull mice were bred with animals expressing Cre-ERT2 fusion protein under the human ubiquitin C promoter sequence. Thus, tamoxifen injections were able to induce Cre recombinase activity ubiquitously, restoring LepR expression in Ubi-LepRNull mice. We decided to induce LepR reactivation when mice were 10 weeks old because the vast majority of developmental processes were completed at this age. We observed that tamoxifen injections caused no long-term changes in body weight or food intake in lean controls (Ubi group) and LepRNull mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>).

To further validate our experimental model, we evaluated the leptin responsiveness in key hypothalamic nuclei that contain LepR-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramos-Lobo and Donato, 2017</xref>). For this purpose, we assessed the capacity of leptin to induce the phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3), which depends on the long LepR isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates et al., 2003</xref>). As expected, an i.p. leptin injection induced a robust pSTAT3 immunoreactivity in the ventromedial subdivision of the ARH (ARHvm), lateral subdivision of the ARH (ARHl), dorsomedial nucleus (DMH), ventromedial nucleus (VMH) and ventral premammillary nucleus (PMv) of control Ubi mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,H</xref>). In accordance with the deficiency of the long LepR isoform, LepRNull mice show virtually no pSTAT3 in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,I</xref>). Importantly, tamoxifen injections restored leptin responsiveness in Ubi-LepRNull mice to a similar extent as that found in the Ubi group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,J,K</xref>). To functionally assess leptin sensitivity, we determined the acute anorexigenic effects caused by an i.p. leptin injection. Leptin induced a similar decrease of food intake and body weight in Ubi and Ubi-LepRNull mice, whereas LepRNull mice remained unresponsive to leptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Altogether, these findings demonstrate that although mice were depleted from the effects of leptin until the 10<sup>th</sup> week of life, tamoxifen injections completely restored leptin signaling in adult Ubi-LepRNull mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Absence of leptin signaling in early life alters the energy balance and predisposes the animals to obesity</title><p>We found that body weight and food intake of Ubi-LepRNull mice were stabilized 6 weeks after tamoxifen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>).

Despite the marked weight loss induced by LepR reactivation, Ubi-LepRNull male mice remained heavier and had higher body adiposity and leptinemia, compared to control Ubi mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). These changes occurred despite a complete normalization of food intake in Ubi-LepRNull mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To evaluate how these changes affected their fertility, Ubi and Ubi-LepRNull males were mated with wild-type females for 28 days.

Consequently, GnRH peptide content accumulates in the median eminence/mediobasal hypothalamus of food-deprived or LepR-deficient animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Polkowska et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donato et al., 2011</xref>). We evaluated the density of GnRH fibers reaching the median eminence and observed the expected increase in the integrated optical density of GnRH staining in LepRNull mice, compared to Ubi animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). Remarkably, LepR reactivation did not restore GnRH fiber density in the hypothalamus of Ubi-LepRNull mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>). GnRH release is stimulated by several neurotransmitters, including the kisspeptins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Messager et al., 2005</xref>) and nitric oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellefontaine et al., 2014</xref>).

We only evaluated the testicle weight in mice that had the LepR reactivation before the onset of obesity.

LepR reactivation increased the appearance of cornified cells in the vaginal smear, although the disruption of the estrous cycle was still evident in Ubi-LepRNull mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>).

To initially investigate the projections of ARH neurons to the PVH, we crossed <italic>Lep<sup>ob/+</sup></italic> mice with LepR-Cre::LSL-tdTomato mice, in order to produce leptin deficient mice expressing the tdTomato fluorescent protein only in LepR cells. Thus, we compared the distribution of axons in the PVH between control (LepR-Cre::LSL-tdTomato) and <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic>::LepR-Cre::LSL-tdTomato mice.

This result indicates that the absence of leptin signaling reduces the density of axons from LepR-expressing neurons that innervate the PVH. Next, we evaluated the density of AgRP and POMC fibers in the PVH to determine whether LepR reactivation in adults can restore these neural projections. We confirmed that LepRNull mice had reduced density of AgRP and POMC fibers in the PVH, compared to Ubi mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–M</xref>).

On the other hand, the capacity of leptin to restore the dysfunctions of adult humans and mice previously deficient of this hormone could indicate that the action of leptin during development is not quite necessary, otherwise important sequelae should be observed despite leptin replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pelleymounter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ioffe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farooqi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Licinio et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donato et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the exact importance of leptin signaling during development for the long-term homeostasis has not yet been fully revealed. To uncover the role of leptin during development, we studied a mouse model that grew without leptin’s effects until the fourth or tenth week of life. After LepR reactivation, Ubi-LepRNull mice completely recovered their capacity to respond to leptin by exhibiting the well-known anorexigenic effect of leptin and presenting STAT3 phosphorylation in key hypothalamic nuclei after an acute leptin injection. These results are in contrast to the leptin resistance produced by early postnatal infusion of a leptin antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attig et al., 2008</xref>). However, adult <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice show no indication of leptin resistance since acute or chronic leptin administration produces similar responses compared to lean animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halaas et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pelleymounter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donato et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, our findings support the idea that the lack of leptin signaling during early life does not cause leptin resistance per se in adulthood.</p><p>Despite the functional evidence that leptin responsiveness was restored in Ubi-LepRNull mice, we cannot guarantee that leptin signaling was restored in all cells that normally express LepR. Since an incomplete reactivation of LepR could lead to some defects observed in Ubi-LepRNull mice, this could be a potential issue in our model. In mice that underwent tamoxifen treatment at 10 weeks of age, we observed a tendency towards a lower hypothalamic <italic>Lepr-b</italic> mRNA expression compared to Ubi animals. However, it is important to mention that Ubi-LepRNull mice were hyperleptinemic, compared to lean controls, and several studies have shown that chronic hyperleptinemia can downregulate <italic>Lepr</italic> expression in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ladyman and Grattan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhai et al., 2018</xref>). In accordance with this hypothesis, <italic>Lepr-b</italic> mRNA expression was completely restored in mice that underwent tamoxifen treatment at 4 weeks of age and did not become hyperleptinemic later in life, suggesting that the trend toward a lower <italic>Lepr-b</italic> mRNA expression in adult Ubi-LepRNull mice might be due to hyperleptinemia and not to insufficient reactivation of LepR.</p><p>Even though leptin responsiveness was recovered, Ubi-LepRNull mice still maintained a higher body weight, adiposity and serum leptin levels, compared to lean littermates. The increased body adiposity of Ubi-LepRNull mice was associated with their incapacity to normalize energy expenditure. Of note, weight loss increases energy efficiency and reduces energy expenditure beyond what is expected for the body mass loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leibel et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, to rule out a possible effect of weight loss in the metabolic dysfunctions exhibited by Ubi-LepRNull mice, we also induced the LepR reactivation in young animals, before they became obese. Since a higher body adiposity and suppressed energy expenditure were still present in those mice, our findings provide strong evidence that leptin signaling in early life is indeed required for the long-term energy homeostasis.</p><p>To further evaluate the energy homeostasis, the animals were exposed to opposing conditions of negative- and positive-energy balance. During fasting, both LepRNull and Ubi-LepRNull mice exhibited reduced drop in energy expenditure and lower rate of body weight loss. These results suggest a decreased capacity to lose weight in mice that grew without leptin signaling until adulthood. Thus, our findings are in accordance with the metabolic programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Samuelsson et al., 2008</xref>), in which altered leptin signaling in early life may predispose adult individuals to metabolic diseases, such as obesity. LepRNull and Ubi-LepRNull mice also showed higher HFD intake, compared to lean controls. Since LepR reactivation completely normalized the intake of a low-fat diet, this observation indicates that the absence of leptin signaling in early life favors the consumption of a highly palatable/caloric diets. In fact, previous studies have shown that brain leptin signaling modulates the sensitivity to highly palatable food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hommel et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, our findings provide additional evidence about this effect, suggesting that disruption of leptin signaling during early life is sufficient to change the response in adulthood to palatable diets.</p><p>To uncover possible mechanisms by which the absence of leptin signaling during development caused long-term metabolic consequences, we evaluated the expression of mRNAs for key neuropeptides that regulate the energy balance. While the hypothalamic expression of orexigenic peptides, such as AgRP and NPY, were recovered in Ubi-LepRNull mice, LepR reactivation was unable to restore the mRNA levels of <italic>Pomc</italic>, <italic>Cartpt</italic>and <italic>Prlh</italic>. Of note, leptin signaling in POMC/CART neurons or in hypothalamic Prlh cells influences the energy balance predominantly via changes in energy expenditure and not through food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berglund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dodd et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the mild obesity and lower metabolic rate of Ubi-LepRNull mice are likely associated with defects in POMC or Prlh neurons. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that the absence of hypothalamic POMC expression in early life also causes long-term metabolic imbalances, even though POMC expression is rescued in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bumaschny et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chhabra et al., 2016</xref>). However, differently than Ubi-LepRNull mice, early POMC deficiency leads to increased food intake later in life. In addition, if POMC reactivation was induced in non-obese animals or at the fourth week of life, no metabolic imbalances were observed in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bumaschny et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chhabra et al., 2016</xref>). In the case of LepR reactivation on the fourth week of life, we still observed a higher body adiposity and lower energy expenditure in Ubi-LepRNull mice, compared to lean controls.</p><p>HDAC proteins can produce epigenetic modifications via histone deacetylation and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haberland et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, recent evidence indicates that HDAC5 regulates energy homeostasis via hypothalamic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kabra et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, HDAC5 induces site-specific acetylation changes in POMC neurons and knockdown of hypothalamic <italic>Hdac5</italic> suppresses <italic>Pomc</italic> mRNA levels in adult rats or mice, without affecting <italic>Agrp</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kabra et al., 2016</xref>). Since hypothalamic expression of <italic>Hdac3</italic> and <italic>Hdac5</italic> were not restored after LepR reactivation, histone-mediated epigenetic modifications in POMC neurons could be involved with the energy imbalance caused by the absence of leptin signaling in early life. The lack of leptin signaling during development may also have produced epigenetic changes via DNA methyltransferases, since hypothalamic <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> expression remained suppressed in Ubi-LepRNull mice. Accordingly, <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> ablation in PVH neurons causes obesity and decreased energy expenditure in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kohno et al., 2014</xref>). However, whether epigenetic changes were indeed responsible for the metabolic dysfunctions of Ubi-LepRNull mice will require additional studies.</p><p>Previous reports have shown that metabolic imbalances during development alter insulin signaling in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vogt et al., 2014</xref>). We observed that LepR reactivation in adult animals caused insulin resistance, without impairing glucose tolerance of Ubi-LepRNull mice. Since obesity leads to pancreatic beta cell hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bock et al., 2003</xref>), the normal glucose tolerance of Ubi-LepRNull mice could be explained by an obesity-induced increase in insulin secretory capacity, overcoming their insulin resistance. In contrast, LepR reactivation before the onset of obesity possibly prevented major pancreatic islet changes. Therefore, glucose homeostasis in our experimental animals was predominantly affected by the former obesity rather than by the absence of leptin signaling during development.</p><p>Leptin deficiency causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, low testicle weight, anestrus and infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chehab et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mounzih et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farooqi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Licinio et al., 2004</xref>). LepR reactivation in adult animals was not sufficient to completely recover the reproductive system in both genders. However, leptin treatment rescues the sterility of male and female <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chehab et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mounzih et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donato et al., 2011</xref>). The reasons of these contrasting results are unknown, but may be related to genetic differences between <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> and LepRNull mice or to the age at which the animals were studied. In the present study, the reproductive system was evaluated in 6- to 8-month-old animals, which is an older age to assess fertility than usual. This advanced age may explain why only half of females breeding with Ubi mice got pregnant. The alterations in reproduction observed in Ubi-LepRNull mice probably had a central cause since reductions in <italic>Kiss1</italic> and <italic>Nos1</italic> mRNA levels were observed in their hypothalami. These transcripts produce neurotransmitters that stimulate GnRH release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Messager et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellefontaine et al., 2014</xref>). As a result, hypothalamic GnRH fiber density was not different between LepRNull and Ubi-LepRNull mice, indicating defects in the capacity to release GnRH in the hypophyseal portal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Polkowska et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donato et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, our findings suggest that the absence of leptin signaling during development causes long-term defects in the neurocircuits that regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.</p><p>In adult animals, leptin responsive neurons are mostly confined to hypothalamic and brainstem nuclei involved in feeding and neuroendocrine regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramos-Lobo and Donato, 2017</xref>). However, during early postnatal life, <italic>Lepr</italic> mRNA expression is also detected in other brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and thalamus, suggesting a potential role of leptin in brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caron et al., 2010</xref>). In this sense, we confirmed the results of previous studies indicating that leptin deficiency leads to reduced brain mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahima et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed a sexually dimorphic response when LepR reactivation occurred in 4-week-old mice. In this case, Ubi-LepRNull females completely recovered their brain mass, whereas Ubi-LepRNull males exhibited a partial increase. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahima et al., 1999</xref> studied only female <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice and showed a greater recovery in brain mass when leptin replacement started at 4 weeks of life, compared with a later treatment. Therefore, males and females may present distinct critical postnatal periods, in which leptin acts in order to allow a normal brain development. The remarkable increase in brain mass after LepR reactivation can be explained by an increase in cell number and/or edema. Previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding the causes of the reduced brain mass in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice. While some authors found reduced DNA content in the brain of <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice, indicating lower number of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van der Kroon and Speijers, 1979</xref>), other studies showed decreased soma cross-sectional area in neurons of <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bereiter and Jeanrenaud, 1979</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> and wild-type mice exhibit similar brain protein content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sena et al., 1985</xref>). Therefore, additional experiments are still necessary to investigate the possible mechanisms behind the increase in brain mass after LepR reactivation. Despite the reduction in brain mass, no evidence of behavioral or memory deficit was found in mice that grew without leptin signaling until adulthood. In humans, leptin replacement in a 5-year-old leptin-deficient boy rescued the cognitive development which was slower than expected for his age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paz-Filho et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our results are in accordance with earlier studies indicating that the absence of leptin signaling disrupts the normal developmental pattern of projections from the ARH to the PVH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouret et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouret et al., 2004a</xref>). However, an unexpected finding was the recovery of the density of AgRP and POMC fibers in the PVH of Ubi-LepRNull mice, even though the restoration of leptin signaling was induced several weeks after the previously indicated critical period for the trophic action of leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouret et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kamitakahara et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, these projections were investigated by staining AgRP or POMC-derived peptides, which not necessarily allow the complete visualization of ARH neuron axons. So, it is uncertain whether LepR reactivation promoted axon extension into the PVH or just improved the visualization of processes that were already there. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouret et al. (2004b)</xref> used the anterograde tracer DiI to demonstrate that this neurocircuit does not fully develop without leptin signaling. Additionally, we found a significant reduction in the amount of axons from LepR-expressing neurons in the PVH of <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice compared to control animals. Thus, these findings suggest that the higher density of AgRP and POMC fibers in the PVH after LepR restoration was likely caused by axonal growth.</p><p>The reasons for the divergent findings between our study and previous reports that indicated a critical postnatal period for the trophic action of leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouret et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kamitakahara et al., 2018</xref>) are unknown, but may be related to methodological differences. While previous studies investigated the neurotrophic actions of leptin via repeated injections in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouret et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kamitakahara et al., 2018</xref>), our study allowed the endogenously produced leptin to act in a physiological manner. Thus, the circadian rhythm of serum leptin was present in our mouse model and large variations in leptin concentrations, common in acute injections, were avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahima et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahima et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, chronic injections can produce stress in rodents and are not feasible in the long-term, representing confounders that could have affected leptin’s trophic effect in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouret et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kamitakahara et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, our results indicating that ARH projections can be recovered even in adult animals are consistent with the fact that exogenous leptin treatment is able to induce a robust weight loss and improvements in a variety of neuroendocrine and metabolic dysfunctions of <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maffei et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Montague et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farooqi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellefontaine et al., 2014</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Our findings revealed that the absence of leptin signaling in early life led to permanent changes in energy homeostasis, melanocortin system, reproduction and brain development. The metabolic dysfunctions caused by the lack of leptin signaling during development possibly involved changes in neural populations that regulate the energy expenditure, such as POMC or Prlh neurons in the hypothalamus, as well as epigenetic mechanisms since the hypothalamic expression of several enzymes that modulate DNA methylation or histone acetylation were affected in Ubi-LepRNull mice. Although the complete absence of leptin signaling is rarely found in humans, both undernutrition and overnutrition are able to produce significant changes in serum leptin concentrations, leptin sensitivity or in the development of neurocircuits that regulate energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Samuelsson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vogt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ralevski and Horvath, 2015</xref>). Therefore, intrauterine or early postnatal changes in energy balance have been consistently linked with obesity and other metabolic diseases in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vickers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lillycrop and Burdge, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bumaschny et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chhabra et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, our findings contribute to the understanding of the metabolic programming by indicating which specific metabolic, neuroendocrine and developmental consequences arise from the absence of leptin signaling in early life, especially in the context of the alarming growth of childhood obesity worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cunningham et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

and female mice. To induce reactivation of the <italic>Lepr</italic> gene, a <italic>Lox</italic>-flanked transcription-blocking cassette (<italic>lox</italic>TB) was inserted in the <italic>Lepr</italic> gene to generate mice null for the <italic>Lepr</italic> (STOCK <italic>Lepr</italic><sup>tm1Jke/</sup>J, The Jackson Laboratory). They were bred with animals expressing Cre-ERT2 fusion protein under the human ubiquitin C promoter sequence (B6.Cg-<italic>Ndor1</italic><sup>Tg(UBC-cre/ERT2)1Ejb</sup>/2J, The Jackson Laboratory). As control animals, we used obese mice homozygous for the <italic>lox</italic>TB allele (LepRNull group) and lean control mice carrying only the Cre allele (Ubi group). Mice carrying both the Cre transgene and the <italic>lox</italic>TB allele in homozygosity were considered the conditional knockout mice (Ubi-LepRNull group). Mice in these strains were in the C57BL/6 background and all groups were composed of littermate animals. To visualize LepR-expressing cells, we generated a LepR-reporter mouse by breeding the LepR-Cre mouse (B6.129-Lepr<sup>tm2(cre)Rck</sup>/J, The Jackson Laboratory) with the lox-stop-lox(LSL)-tdTomato reporter mouse (B6;129S6-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup>/J, The Jackson Laboratory). Thus, axons from LepR-expressing cells were visualized without additional staining by the presence of the tdTomato fluorescent protein. We then crossed <italic>Lep<sup>ob/+</sup></italic> mice (B6.Cg-Lep<sup>ob</sup>/J, The Jackson Laboratory) with LepR-Cre::LSL-tdTomato mice, in order to produce leptin deficient mice expressing the tdTomato fluorescent protein only in LepR cells. Mice were weaned at 3–4 weeks of age and their mutations were confirmed by genotyping the DNA that had been previously extracted from the tail tip (REDExtract-N-Amp Tissue PCR Kit, Sigma). The genetically modified mouse models were produced and maintained in standard conditions of light (12 hr light/dark cycle) and temperature (22 ± 1°C). Unless otherwise indicated, mice received a regular rodent low-fat chow diet (2.99 kcal/g; 9.4% calories from fat). All experiments were carried out in compliance with NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were previously approved by our Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (protocol number 137/2013).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Temporal reactivation of the LepR</title><p>All mice received 5 i.p. injections of tamoxifen (0.15 mg/g, Sigma-Aldrich), diluted in sesame oil (Sigma-Aldrich), in alternate days. Mice were treated with tamoxifen at 10 weeks of age (adults; LepRNull and Ubi-LepRNull mice were already obese) or at 4 weeks of age (young; before the onset of obesity). The animals were monitored until stabilization of body weight and food intake. After the stabilization period, the in vivo experiments were carried out.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Evaluation of energy and glucose homeostasis</title><p>At least 6 weeks after the last tamoxifen injection (16 weeks of age in adults or 15 weeks of age for young mice), mice were single housed. Their body weight and food intake were measured for 3 to 4 alternate days. Then, mice were subjected to a glucose tolerance test (2 g glucose/kg b.w.; i.p.) and to an insulin tolerance test (1 IU insulin/kg b.w.; i.p.). To determine O<sub>2</sub> consumption (energy expenditure), CO<sub>2</sub> production, respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and locomotor activity (through infrared beam sensors) mice were placed in the Oxymax/Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS; Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). After an adaptation period of 3 days inside the CLAMS, these metabolic parameters were evaluated for four consecutive days. Therefore, the results presented are the average of this period. Body adiposity was determined by weighting perigonadal (PG), subcutaneous (SC) and retroperitoneal (RP) fat pads in males. For the females, the periovarian (Ov) fat pad was also included.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Brain histology</title><p>To visualize leptin responsive cells in the brain, adult mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3–4/group) received an acute i.p. injection of mouse recombinant leptin (5 µg/g, from Dr. A.F. Parlow, National Hormone and Peptide Program – NHPP, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) and were perfused 90 min later. For the perfusions, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with saline, followed by a 10% buffered formalin solution (150–200 mL per mouse). Brains were collected and post-fixed in the same fixative for 60 min and cryoprotected overnight at 4°C in 0.1 M PBS containing 20% sucrose, pH 7.4. Brains were cut (30 µm thick sections) in the frontal plane using a freezing microtome. To label pSTAT3, brain sections were rinsed in 0.02 M potassium PBS, pH 7.4 (KPBS), followed by pretreatment in an alkaline (pH &gt;13) water solution containing 1% hydrogen peroxide and 1% sodium hydroxide for 20 min. After rinsing in KPBS, sections were incubated in 0.3% glycine and 0.03% lauryl sulfate for 10 min each. Next, sections were blocked in 3% normal donkey serum for 1 hr, followed by incubation in anti-pSTAT3<sup>Tyr705</sup> primary antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling; #9131) for 40 hr. AgRP, β-endorphin, α-MSH or GnRH immunoreactivity was evaluated in brain sections that were rinsed in KPBS and blocked in 3% normal donkey serum for 1 hr, followed incubation in anti-AgRP (1:2000, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; #H-003–53), anti-β-endorphin (1:2000, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; #H-022–33), anti-αMSH (1:2000, Chemicon; #AB5087) or anti-GnRH (1:2000, Immunostar; #AB_572248) primary antibodies. For the immunofluorescence reaction, sections were rinsed in KPBS and incubated for 90 min in AlexaFluor<sup>488</sup> or AlexaFluor<sup>594</sup>-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, Jackson Laboratories). Sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and the slides were coverslipped with Fluoromount G (Electron Microscopic Sciences, Hatfield, PA). For the immunoperoxidase staining, sections were incubated for 1 hr in biotin-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000, Jackson Laboratories) and followed by 1 hr incubation with an avidin-biotin complex (1:500, Vector Labs). The peroxidase reaction was performed using 0.05% 3,3'-diaminobenzidine, 0.25% nickel sulfate and 0.03% hydrogen peroxide resulting in a black nuclear staining. The slides were coverslipped with DPX mounting medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Brightfield and epifluorescence photomicrographs were acquired with a Zeiss Axiocam HRc camera coupled to a Zeiss Axioimager A1 microscope (Zeiss, Munich, Germany). Images were digitized using Axiovision software (Zeiss). Confocal images were captured in a 1024 × 1024 pixel format using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal laser scanning inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Image stacks comprised eight images captured with a LD Plan-Neofluar 40x/0.6 Korr M27 objective (Zeiss). The ImageJ Cell Counter software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) was used to manually count the number of cells in the areas of interest.

During this challenge, metabolic parameters were continuously assessed in the CLAMS, and their body weight was monitored at baseline and after 24 hr of fasting. Changes in metabolic parameters during fasting were reported as percentage of the values obtained from baseline (fed state). Food intake was recorded 4, 12, 24 and 48 hr following the fasting period. After a recovery period (at least 1 week), the animals were exposed to a HFD (5.31 kcal/g, 58% calories from fat) for 48 hr. Metabolic parameters were assessed in the CLAMS, together with their body weight and food intake (normalized by calorie consumption).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Changes in the reproductive system</title><p>To investigate changes in the reproductive system, we weighted the testicles of adult and young males.

All behavioral tests were performed in male mice treated with tamoxifen at 10 weeks of age. For the open-field test, mice were placed in an open field arena (0.3 m (w) x 0.3 m (d) x 0.45 m (h) for 5 min and monitored by the ANY-maze software, which tracks animal’s position and records the distance travelled. To investigate spatial learning/memory, we performed the Barnes maze test. The maze consists of a white circular platform (92 cm of diameter) elevated 105 cm above the floor with 20 equally spaced holes (5 cm diameter and 7.5 cm between holes) along the perimeter with a darkened escape box placed in a constant position under one of the holes at the edge of the platform. Mice are presumed to learn the location of an escape hole using extra-maze visual cues placed on the walls of the room. Mice were initially subjected to one habituation phase in the first day prior to the initial trial. This phase was performed by placing the animal in a cylindrical chamber in the middle of the maze for 10 s. Afterwards, the chamber was removed, and mice were gently guided to the escape box. Animals were allowed to remain in the escape box for 2 min and then were returned to their original cage. The acquisition phase consisted of four trials per day for four days. For each trial, mice were placed in the cylindrical chamber in the middle of the maze for 10 s and then they could explore the maze for 3 min. After trial’s completion (i.e mice either entered the escape box or remained exploring the maze for 3 min) animals were gently guided to and remained inside the escape box for 1 min. Subsequently, mice were returned to their home cages until the next trial, with a 15 min interval between trials. Time (primary latency) and number of errors (primary errors) to reach the escape hole for the first time were recorded by a trained researcher. Errors were considered as the number of head deflections into incorrect holes of the maze and were counted by the experimenter. Test sessions were performed 24 hr and 1 week after the last trial (days 5 and 12, respectively) and consisted of 90 s exploring the maze with the escape box closed. In all experimental steps, the maze was cleaned with 40% ethanol and air-dried before each trial and between mice. The platform was monitored by the ANY-maze software, which recorded the animal’s position and the distance the animal moved (total distance travelled).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>All results were expressed as mean ±s.e.m.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Richard D Palmiter as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors of this paper demonstrate that restoration of leptin signaling at 4 or 10 weeks of age in mice that previously had no leptin signaling is able to restore all metabolic phenotypes and partially restore fertility and neurological phenotypes. These experiments suggest that there is not an absolute critical period early in development when leptin signaling is essential.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There was general agreement among the reviewers that this paper makes an important contribution and should be published after adequate revision. Some issues that the authors should address summarized here and the original reviews are also included below to help delineate the concerns. There are two possibilities to explain lack of full restoration of any parameter in this type of study: (a) incomplete restoration of LepR expression in critical cells, (b) the existence of a critical period after which it is no longer possible to restore function, or (c) a combination of the two.</p><p>1) In the case of fertility, it has previously been shown that restoration of leptin signaling only in AgRP neurons (Anderson) is sufficient to restore fertility. Restoration of leptin signaling is thought to reduce inhibitory signaling to nearby Kiss1 neurons and thereby allow Kiss1 neurons to activate GnRH neurons. Consistent with this view, ablation of AgRP neurons in leptin-deficient mice is also able to restore fertility (Palmiter). Thus, the incomplete restoration of fertility in this paper may be due to incomplete restoration of LepR signaling specifically in AgRP neurons. The authors should quantify the degree of restoration of LepR expression in AgRP neurons.</p><p>2) The ability to partially restore brain weight in adult mice is remarkable, even if it is incomplete. Since it is not known where leptin signaling is important for regulation brain weight, a more thorough analysis of Lepr signaling in specific cells is not feasible. However, it is important to know whether the increase in brain weight is due to an increase in cell number (DNA content) or edema. The former result would suggest that future investigations into what cells proliferate in the adult and where they are located would be warranted.</p><p>3) The long-standing observation that there is a critical period in early development for AgRP and POMC neuron maturation is challenged by the current results. The data in Figure 7 reveal extensive restoration of AgRP and POMC immunofluorescence in one major target (PVN) of AgRP and POMC neurons. The question is whether restoration of LepR signaling in adult mice promoted axon extension into the PVN or whether the axons were there all along, but lacked AgRP and POMC due to inadequate synthesis or trafficking. Ideally, the authors should design an experiment to visualize the AgRP and POMC axons in the PVN independently of these peptides. Alternatively, a cogent discussion of the issue is warranted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper represents a comprehensive study of the consequences of restoring leptin receptor function in mice with a null mutation in that receptor gene on many aspects of physiology, anatomy and behavior. The restoration was either done at 4 weeks (before obesity) or at 10 weeks, when the mice were already quite obese. Virtually all parameters that were measured improved after restoration of the LepR, but in some cases there were still small differences compared to normal littermates. Those differences presumably represent permanent changes that cannot be fully reversed, e.g. brain weight can't be restored in the absence of neurogenesis. Fertility is one parameter that was not fully restored, whereas previous studies have suggested that it can be restored with expression of LepR only in AgRP neurons and ablation of AgRP neurons in Lep <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice also restores fertility. Thus, a more thorough analysis of LepR activity in AgRP neurons is warranted because Ubc-Cre may not be fully functional in those critical neurons. The current results contradict previous studies indicating that leptin signaling is required during a critical period to promote axon outgrowth (or neuropeptide accumulation) in target tissues. The results presented here reveal that neuropeptide immunostaining is fully restored even after 10 weeks without leptin signaling. Bolstering this result with additional approaches would be a valuable addition. It seems unlikely that growth of new axons (fibers) into target tissues actually occurs after restoring leptin signaling. A more likely possibility is that the fibers are there but not visible due to low peptide abundance. Distinguishing between these possibilities would be a welcome addition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Donato et al. describes the detailed analysis of mice in which Lepr expression has been re-established in a Cre-dependent manner at 4 and 10 weeks after birth. In large, while Lepr re-expression restores to large extend altered food intake and body weight gain and hypothalamic melanocortin projections in mice previously deficient for the Lepr, it predisposes for increased fat mass, reduced energy expenditure and impaired reproductive function. Collectively the study defines a subset of phenotypes which depend on developmental leptin action.</p><p>The study seems very carefully performed, and the results overall support the conclusions by the authors. the paper is clearly written and should be of interest to the audience of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>However, one major concern should be addressed experimentally:</p><p>The described restoration of hypothalamic projections appears difficult to comprehend, i.e. that neuron send projections after 10 weeks of neurocircuitry development. This clearly represents a very interesting finding. Nevertheless, currently this is based on staining for endogenous peptides whose expression is altered in the models. Thus, complementary experiments with genetically marking anatomical projections independent of the endogenously expressed peptides should be performed to substantiate this finding.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In their manuscript &quot;Long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life,&quot; Ramos-Lobo and colleagues study the effects of restoring leptin receptor expression in mice with genetic deficiency of LepR. They conclude that some aspects of LepR deficiency are due to developmental consequences of LepR-deficiency early in development. They conclude that reproductive and neuroanatomical phenotypes are especially sensitive to early leptin signaling. The data are of excellent quality. Based on their data, it is fair to state that restoration of leptin receptor signaling at 10 weeks restores gross metabolic function and hypothalamic PVH projections in mice lacking Lepr at conception. However, it is harder to conclude that lack of complete restoration of phenotypes in their model is because of developmental defects. It is also possible, as they point out, that the lack of restoration of phenotypes is due to less than complete efficiency of restoration of Lepr expression.</p><p>What the authors can conclude is that the restoration of Lepr signaling achieved at 10 weeks in their system largely corrects body weight, feeding, energy expenditure phenotypes but has much more modest effects on reproductive and neuroanatomical phenotypes. This qualitative difference in phenotype restoration may be due to a permanent developmental defect or to a greater degree of sensitivity to leptin signaling of certain phenotypes.</p><p>The authors do acknowledge this shortcoming. It might be helpful to quantify the restoration of LepR expression in populations of neurons to determine efficiency. However, there is an inherent challenge of any system in which restoration of genetic mutation is not 100% efficient and one does not achieve a complete restoration of wild-type phenotypes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40970.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the case of fertility, it has previously been shown that restoration of leptin signaling only in AgRP neurons (Anderson) is sufficient to restore fertility.

We understand the concern regarding the possible lack of complete reactivation of leptin receptor (LepR) as the main cause of the defects observed in our mouse model. This limitation was acknowledged in the second paragraph of the Discussion section. Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have quantified the degree of restoration of LepR expression in AgRP neurons by co-localizing pSTAT3 in AgRP cells of leptin-injected Ubi-LepRNull mice using double-labeled immunoperoxidase reaction (Figure below). Using this approach, virtually all AgRP-labeled cells expressed leptin-induced pSTAT3 in Ubi-LepRNull mice (<italic>n</italic> = 2). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, arrows indicate high magnification photomicrographs of representative double-labeled neurons. pSTAT3 appears as a black nucleus and AgRP expression as a brownish cytoplasm.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40970-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>To address the reviewers’ concern, we recognize that the best approach would be to add a AgRP-reporter gene to the background of UbiquitinC<sup>ERT2</sup>::LepR<sup>Null/Null</sup> mice to improve this co-localization, but such approach would require many months until we produce the first Ubi-LepRNull mice carrying a reporter protein under the <italic>Agrp</italic> promoter, in addition to the LepR reactivation procedure, which takes several weeks. This long timeline prevented us from carrying out this approach. Instead, we performed the double-labeled immunoperoxidase approach even though we recognize that the co-localization result presented is not ideal since the soma of AgRP cells is poorly stained (AgRP peptide is mainly present in axons), impairing the visualization of AgRP neurons. To improve our analysis, we also quantified the number of leptin-induced pSTAT3 cells in the ventromedial or lateral arcuate nucleus (ARH), where AgRP and POMC neurons are mainly located, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> demonstrates the distinct distribution of AgRP and POMC neurons in the ARH, as well as the ARH subdivisions). We found an equivalent number of pSTAT3 cells in both ARH sub-regions of Ubi-LepRNull mice, compared to Ubi mice, indicating that the LepR restoration was homogeneous in the whole ARH (new data in Figure 1K).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40970-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>AgRP neurons are also essential for the refeeding response after fasting in mice consuming standard chow (Luquet et al., 2007). In this sense, we measured the food intake 4, 12, 24 and 48 hours after a 24 hours fasting period and observed a similar refeeding response in male and female Ubi and Ubi-LepRNull mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Thus, if LepR expression had not been completely restored in AgRP neurons, the refeeding response may not be normalized as well. Additionally, hypothalamic AgRP and NPY mRNA expression were normalized in Ubi-LepRNull mice (Figure 3G).</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40970-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig><p>Altogether, we feel that these results provide evidence that LepR signaling was restored in AgRP neurons, indicating that the reproductive defects exhibited by Ubi-LepRNull mice were not associated with an incomplete reactivation of LepR in AgRP neurons. We added the refeeding data (as Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, B) and the separate ARH pSTAT3 counting in the revised manuscript (Figure 1K). However, we do not feel comfortable to add the co-localization between pSTAT3 and AgRP due to the limitations mentioned earlier.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The ability to partially restore brain weight in adult mice is remarkable, even if it is incomplete.

Interestingly, we found an increased DNA content in the cerebral cortex of Ubi-LepRNull mice compared to Ubi mice (lean controls), whereas no significant changes were observed in other brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40970-resp-fig4-v2"/></fig><p>This finding suggests that the decreased brain mass of Ubi-LepRNull mice was not caused by a lower number of cells since a higher DNA content per mg of tissue indicates higher cell density. However, this analysis does not allow us to detect changes in different cell types in the brain. It is now well-established that leptin acts not only in neurons but also in glial cells (Ahima et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2014; Djogo et al., 2016) and since these different cells have important differences in their cell body sizes, we cannot rule out that the lack or restoration of LepR could affect the number of neurons or glial cells differently. To further investigate the causes of the lower brain mass of Ubi-LepRNull mice, we also counted the number of cells in a given area of the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and hypothalamus using the nuclear marker DAPI and the neuronal perikarya and dendrite marker Neurotrace. Using DAPI as a marker we did not observe differences in the number of cells among the experimental groups (Author response images 5 and 6).</p><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40970-resp-fig5-v2"/></fig><fig id="respfig6"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40970-resp-fig6-v2"/></fig><p>However, we observed a trend towards a decrease in the number of Neurotrace positive cells (which represents specifically neurons) in the hippocampus and ARH of Ubi-LepRNull mice, compared to Ubi mice (Author response images 7 and 8).

Although the reviewer question was very pertinent and clever, we feel that the data shown here is not conclusive without additional experiments such as stereological analysis or automatic isotropic fractionation for large-scale quantitative cell analysis (Azevedo et al., 2013). However, such measurements would be beyond the scope of the current study. Therefore, we prefer not to include the DNA and cell counting results in the revised version of the manuscript as we consider the data preliminary. Nevertheless, a paragraph discussing whether the increase in brain mass was due to an increase in cell number or edema was added in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“The remarkable increase in brain mass after LepR reactivation can be explained by an increase in cell number and/or edema. […] Therefore, additional experiments are still necessary to investigate the possible mechanisms behind the increase in brain mass after LepR reactivation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The long-standing observation that there is a critical period in early development for AgRP and POMC neuron maturation is challenged by the current results.

We used several approaches to confirm the efficacy of LepR restoration in our model, including: 1) assessment of <italic>Lepr</italic> mRNA expression; 2) counting the number of pSTAT3 immunoreactive cells after an acute leptin injection in critical brain areas that mediate leptin’s effects; 3) evaluation of the anorexigenic effects induced by leptin treatment. In all these measurements, Ubi-LepRNull mice exhibited equivalent values as those found in lean controls (Ubi mice). Additionally, although we observed several defects in the Ubi-LepRNull mice, we also observed a complete normalization in important parameters, such as in food intake, respiratory quotient, AgRP/NPY hypothalamic expression, thyroid and adrenal axes, memory and arcuate neural projections to the paraventricular nucleus. The complete recovery in these outcomes is also indirect evidence that the LepR restoration achieved was sufficient to test our hypothesis. Finally, as pointed out by the reviewer, we also acknowledged in the Discussion section that it is possible that part of phenotype observed was caused by an incomplete reactivation that could not be detected by the methods employed in the present study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
