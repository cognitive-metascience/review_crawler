pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26174.001</object-id><p>Exophilin-8 has been reported to play a role in anchoring secretory granules within the actin cortex, due to its direct binding activities to Rab27 on the granule membrane and to F-actin and its motor protein, myosin-Va. Here, we show that exophilin-8 accumulates granules in the cortical F-actin network not by direct interaction with myosin-Va, but by indirect interaction with a specific form of myosin-VIIa through its previously unknown binding partner, RIM-BP2. RIM-BP2 also associates with exocytic machinery, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3, RIM, and Munc13-1. Disruption of the exophilin-8–RIM-BP2–myosin-VIIa complex by ablation or knockdown of each component markedly decreases both the peripheral accumulation and exocytosis of granules. Furthermore, exophilin-8-null mouse pancreatic islets lose polarized granule localization at the β-cell periphery and exhibit impaired insulin secretion. This newly identified complex acts as a physical and functional scaffold and provides a mechanism supporting a releasable pool of granules within the F-actin network beneath the plasma membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26174.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26174.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26174.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human body contains trillions of cells with hundreds of different jobs that must cooperate with each other. Many cells communicate using hormones and other chemical messengers that they release into the blood or tissues. These messengers are stored in containers called secretory granules, which are held just under the surface of the cell by a web of fibres made from a protein called actin. When a message needs to be sent, the granules fuse with the membrane that surrounds the cell, releasing their contents into the space outside.</p><p>A protein called exophilin-8 helps granules to fuse with the membrane. This protein attaches to both the granules and actin bundles, but its precise role is not clear. Here, Fan et al. generated mutant mice that cannot make exophilin-8 to find out what happens when this protein is missing. The experiments show that the loss of exophilin-8 prevented granules from building up at the edges of cells and releasing their contents. This was accompanied by a decrease in the amount of insulin – a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels – released by cells in the pancreas. As a result, the mutant mice had higher levels of blood sugar than normal mice. Further experiments revealed that exophillin-8 associates with a group of other proteins that work together to catch the secretory granules and anchor them to the actin bundles near to the inner edge of the cell.</p><p>If secretory granules do not fuse with the membrane properly, the chemical messages they contain are not transmitted, which can lead to disease. Since the loss of exophilin-8 affected the release of insulin from the pancreas it is possible that further work could open new avenues for diabetes research. A future challenge is to examine whether exophillin-8 also plays a similar role in the fusion of secretory granules in other cells such as nerve and immune cells, which also release a number of important chemicals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26174.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26174.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>insulin</kwd><kwd>pancreatic β cell</kwd><kwd>Rab27</kwd><kwd>secretion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007716</institution-id><institution>Banyu Life Science Foundation International</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsunaga</surname><given-names>Kohichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP15K08295</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsunaga</surname><given-names>Kohichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP20113005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Izumi</surname><given-names>Tetsuro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP24390068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Izumi</surname><given-names>Tetsuro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP26670133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Izumi</surname><given-names>Tetsuro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP2604104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Izumi</surname><given-names>Tetsuro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP16K15211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Izumi</surname><given-names>Tetsuro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analyses of knockout mice and a biochemical screen of interacting proteins reveal that exophilin-8 forms a large network of protein interactions to efficiently retain secretory granules beneath the plasma membrane for exocytosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells, including professional secretory cells, possess a peripheral microfilament web beneath the plasma membrane, referred to as the actin cortex, which maintains the cell’s shape and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Orci et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aunis and Bader, 1988</xref>). Secretory granules generated at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) must somehow pass through the actin cortex before they fuse with the plasma membrane and, as such, the actin cortex may act as a mechanical barrier to the exocytic site. In fact, pharmacological depolymerization of F-actin has been shown to potentiate granule exocytosis. However, such a massive disruption of the cytoskeleton may obscure physiological steps in the trafficking process. For example, cortical actin and its motor proteins, such as myosin-Va, have been suggested to function as a carrier to capture and/or transport granules to the vicinity of the plasma membrane in support of exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rudolf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ivarsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varadi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Desnos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wollman and Meyer, 2012</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which granules link to the F-actin network and are then processed toward exocytosis is poorly understood. Thus, a fuller understanding of the role of the cortical F-actin network in exocytosis must be established.</p><p>Exophilin-8 (also known as MyRIP and Slac2-c) is a candidate molecule for the anchoring of granules within the actin cortex. It exhibits affinities both to Rab27a/b on granule membrane and to F-actin and its motor proteins, myosin-Va and -VIIa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">El-Amraoui et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fukuda and Kuroda, 2002</xref>). In fact, overexpressed exophilin-8 has been shown to redistribute granules to the actin-rich cell periphery in the pancreatic β-cell line, MIN6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mizuno et al., 2011</xref>), and in the enterochromaffin cell line, BON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huet et al., 2012</xref>). Further, knockdown of exophilin-8 decreases the number of granules beneath the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mizuno et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huet et al., 2012</xref>) and their cargo secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waselle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ivarsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mizuno et al., 2011</xref>). These findings suggest that exophilin-8 potentiates exocytosis by locating granules within the actin cortex beneath the plasma membrane.</p><p>The present study is the first to use exophilin-8-knockout mice to demonstrate its in vivo function in glucose tolerance. Exophilin-8-null pancreatic β-cells lose polarized granule location at the cell periphery and exhibit decreased insulin secretion. We further show that exophilin-8 directly interacts with RIM-BP2, a binding protein to RIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2000</xref>), and that this complex formation is essential for both peripheral accumulation and efficient exocytosis of granules. In contrast to the previous proposal that exophilin-8 captures granules within the F-actin network via its direct interaction with myosin-Va (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Desnos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huet et al., 2012</xref>), we found that exophilin-8 does so via an indirect interaction with a specific form of myosin-VIIa through RIM-BP2. RIM-BP2 also associates with the L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (VDCC) mediating stimulus-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3, and the priming factors, RIM and Munc13-1, in β-cells, as originally observed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hibino et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Südhof, 2013</xref>). Thus, the exophilin-8–RIM-BP2–myosin-VIIa complex not only physically anchors granules to the actin cortex, but may also functionally assemble molecules involved in their exocytosis. These findings reveal a previously unknown molecular mechanism in the secretory processes that efficiently retain granules beneath the plasma membrane for exocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exophilin-8-null β-cells exhibit decreased insulin secretion and a lower number of granules in the cell periphery</title><p>All previous studies of exophilin-8 (encoded by the <italic>Myrip</italic> gene) have been performed at the cellular or molecular levels.

The mutant mice were viable and fertile, with no apparent abnormalities in general appearance or behavior. However, they showed slightly reduced body weight and significantly higher blood glucose levels after a glucose load, although their insulin sensitivity was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Exophilin-8 was expressed in pancreatic islets, as well as in pituitary and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Further, its absence induced decreased insulin secretion in responses to glucose, potassium, or forskolin (an activator of adenylate cyclase) with glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>), but did not change secretion in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA; a protein kinase C activator) with glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

To reveal the exophilin-8-interacting proteins via RIM-BP2, we compared the proteins coimmunoprecipitated with MEF-tagged, wild-type exophilin-8 with those from the PA (ABD) mutant, in the presence of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged RIM-BP2 in INS-1 832/13 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, the wild type, but not the PA (ABD) mutant, coprecipitated RIM-BP2, and concordantly interacted with RIM-BP2-interacting Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 and RIM, and RIM-interacting Munc13-1, as has been observed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Betz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hibino et al., 2002</xref>).

However, myosin-Va was not found in the immunoprecipitate of either wild-type or mutant exophilin-8, but was easily detected in that of exophilin-3 (also known as melanophilin and Slac2a; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), another Rab27 effector that exhibits binding activity to myosin-Va (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fukuda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nagashima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Strom et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2002</xref>). Instead, we identified myosin-VIIa in the immunoprecipitate, the tail domain of which has been reported to interact with exophilin-8 in both heterologous cells and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">El-Amraoui et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fukuda and Kuroda, 2002</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, the PA (ABD) exophilin-8, despite the mutation outside of MBD, failed to interact with myosin-VIIa. This finding indicates that the same proline motif of exophilin-8 is involved in binding with myosin-VIIa as well as with RIM-BP2, or that exophilin-8 indirectly interacts with myosin-VIIa through RIM-BP2. To determine which was the case, we investigated whether the interaction between RIM-BP2 and myosin-VIIa occurs in the absence of exophilin-8. We found that the interaction persists in the exophilin-8-null β-cell line and is preserved by the exogenous expression of wild-type exophilin-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), indicating that RIM-BP2, but not exophilin-8, is primarily involved in the interaction with myosin-VIIa in cells.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26174.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Exophilin-8 indirectly interacts with myosin-VIIa via RIM-BP2 in INS-1 832/13 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) INS-1 832/13 cells were infected with adenoviruses expressing HA-RIM-BP2 and either control GFP, or MEF-tagged, wild-type (WT) or PA (ABD) mutant exophilin-8 (<bold>A, B</bold>), and with that expressing MEF-exophilin-3 (<bold>B</bold>).

The One-STrEP-FLAG (OSF)-tag was attached to wild-type or PA mutant exophilin-8 ABD, and the binding proteins were pulled down using Strept-Tactin beads. As expected, wild-type, but not PA mutant, exophilin-8 ABD bound RIM-BP2, strongly indicating the direct interaction because there were no other specific proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lanes 2 and 5). Unexpectedly, however, both wild-type and PA mutant exophilin-8 ABD bound myosin-VIIa with or without RIM-BP2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lanes 3, 4, 6, and 7), in contrast to the finding in INS-1 832/13 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Therefore, exophilin-8 seems to directly interact with myosin-VIIa at least in heterologous cells, consistent with the previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">El-Amraoui et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fukuda and Kuroda, 2002</xref>), and furthermore, this interaction does not require the MBD or the proline-rich motif in the ABD of exophilin-8. We then expressed OST-tagged RIM-BP2 and the binding proteins were examined. We confirmed that RIM-BP2 bound wild-type, but not PA mutant, exophilin-8 ABD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). However, RIM-BP2 could not bind myosin-VIIa without simultaneous expression of wild-type exophilin8 ABD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, lanes 4–6), indicating that RIM-BP2 cannot directly bind myosin-VIIa. We noticed that, although the approximate molecular mass by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of myosin-VIIa expressed in HEK293A cells is ~260 kDa corresponding to its calculated molecular mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>), that of myosin VIIa interacting with RIM-BP2 in β-cell lines is ~170 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). As described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, myosin-VIIa was identified with RIM-BP2 from exophlin-8-interacting, 150 ~ 190 kDa protein bands in MIN6 cells by LC-MS/MS. Furthermore, in INS-1 832–13 cells, both minor 260 kDa and major 170 kDa protein bands were similarly downregulated by myosin-VIIa siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). To further examine whether the 170 kDa protein represents myosin-VIIa specifically expressed in β-cells, we examined RIM-BP2-binding myosin-VIIa in INS1 832/13 cells expressing OST-tagged RIM-BP2, using another myosin-VIIa antibody we generated. We found that only the 170 kDa protein was pulled down with RIM-BP2, although the 260 kDa protein was also pulled down after exogenous expression of myosin-VIIa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). These findings indicate that the 170 kDa protein is derived from myosin-VIIa endogenously expressed in β-cells. By contrast, the 260 kDa protein is derived from transfected myosin-VIIa cDNA and interacts with RIM-BP2 through exophilin-8, because it can directly interact with exophilin-8 but not with RIM-BP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). Finally, we investigated the endogenous complex formation in INS1 832/13 cells by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Exophilin-8 (130 kDa) and RIM-BP2 (150 kDa) exhibited similarly wide distributions in fractions 3–10, whereas both endogenous 170 kDa and 260 kDa myosin-VIIa showed relatively narrower distributions around fractions 6–10. Judged from the positions of molecular mass markers, these findings are consistent with the ternary complex formation among these proteins in the cells, although each protein also appeared to exist as a monomer.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26174.017</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>The molecular mass of myosin-VIIa interacted with RIM-BP2 in INS-1 832/13 cells is 170 kDa, whereas that directly binds exophilin-8 in HEK293A cells is 260 kDa.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK293A cells were transfected with plasmids expressing RIM-BP2, myosin-VIIa, and/or OSF-tagged, wild-type or PA mutant exophilin-8 ABD.

We further identified a new multiprotein complex, in which exophilin-8 directly interacts with RIM-BP2 and then binds the actin-motor protein, myosin-VIIa, and the exocytic machinery, such as Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 and RIM. Disruption of the interaction by ablation or mutation of either exophilin-8 or RIM-BP2 leads to loss of polarized granule distribution and to a marked decrease in granule exocytosis. RIM-BP2 also has binding activities to the α<sub>1</sub> subunits of L-, N-, and P/Q type VDCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hibino et al., 2002</xref>). On the other hand, RIM, originally identified as an effector of Rab3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 1997</xref>), binds and activates a priming factor, Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deng et al., 2011</xref>), and also has binding activities to N- and P/Q type VDCC, but not to L-type VDCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref>). Because RIM binds Rab3, but not Rab27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukuda, 2003</xref>), and because exophilin-8 binds Rab27, but not Rab3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fukuda and Kuroda, 2002</xref>), the RIM-BP2–myosin-VIIa complex can theoretically associate with granules via either Rab27a–exophilin-8 or Rab3–RIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).</p><p>Although an interaction of exophilin-8 with myosin-Va has been shown in heterologous cells and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fukuda and Kuroda, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Desnos et al., 2003</xref>), we cannot find evidence that the two proteins act together in secretory cells: they do not form a complex and silencing of myosin-Va does not affect peripheral granule accumulation unlike that of exophilin-8, although it is possible that the degree of myosin-Va depletion in our experimental condition is enough to decrease insulin secretion, but not to affect granule localization. Some question remains regarding the physiological and functional interaction between exophilin-8 and myosin-Va. For example, exophilin-8 does not interact with myosin-Va under physiological conditions in MIN6 cells, where only the brain-isoform of myosin-Va is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brozzi et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, these two proteins show negligible physical and functional interactions in the melanocyte cell line, Melan-a, where the melanocyte-isoform of myosin-Va is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuroda and Fukuda, 2005</xref>). We instead show that myosin-VIIa associates with secretory granules and indirectly interacts with exophilin-8 via RIM-BP2. Furthermore, silencing of myosin-VIIa disrupts granule clustering in the actin-rich cell periphery and markedly decreases stimulus-induced granule exocytosis, as does the silencing of exophilin-8. Myosin-VIIa appears to function in the anchoring, rather than in the active transport, of granules within the F-actin network, because exophilin-8-positive granules are markedly immobile in the resting state in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Desnos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mizuno et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huet et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that myosin-VIIa identified in the exophilin-8–RIM-BP2 complex in β-cells shows a molecular mass ~170 kDa in gels, much smaller than its authentic mass ~260 kDa. Because this form does not appear to be generated from transfected myosin-VIIa cDNA in INS1 832/13 cells, it may represent an alternatively spliced form that specifically functions in secretory cells. In fact, such a small myosin-VIIa isoform has been reported in the UCSC Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/">https://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>). It has recently been shown that, among the four alternatively spliced isoforms of the minus-ended motor, myosin-VIa, the small insert isoform specifically tethers secretory granules to the cortical actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tomatis et al., 2013</xref>), although its molecular link to granules, such as Rab and its effector, has not been identified. Although the exact molecular nature of the 170 kDa form of myosin-VIIa and its interaction mode with RIM-BP2 are unknown, our findings that either the PA (ABD) exophilin-8 or the ΔSH3 RIM-BP2 fails to restore the peripheral granule accumulation or to rescue the decreased insulin secretion in knockdown or knockout cells strongly indicate that the exophilin-8–RIM-BP2–170 kDa–myosin-VIIa complex formation is functionally critical for granule exocytosis. Currently, roles for myosin-VIIa are well-documented in actin-rich protrusion, such as stereocilia of cochlear and vestibular hair cells and microvilli in intestine brush borders and photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yan and Liu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2014</xref>), but no such roles have been identified in granule anchoring or trafficking. This may be because of the existence of parallel secretory pathways bypassing the complex formation: all the granules may not be captured within the cortical F-actin network, or some granules may be captured there by other mechanisms. In fact, exophilin-8-null islets preserve approximately half of the normal level insulin secretion in response to glucose or depolarization stimulation. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanism by which secretory cells differentially or redundantly engage multiple motor proteins, such as myosins-Va, -VI, and -VIIa.</p><p>Under electron microscopy, exophilin-8-null pancreatic β-cells exhibit a decrease in the number of granules close to the plasma membrane, but still harbor docked granules whose limiting membrane is directly attached to the membrane. Using the same experimental protocol, we previously demonstrated that β-cells deficient in another Rab27 effector, granuphilin, exhibit a much greater decrease in the number of granules close to the plasma membrane, and almost complete loss of docked granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gomi et al., 2005</xref>). It is notable that the granule number decrease in granuphilin-null β-cells occurs in a more restricted area, with granule centers residing within 200 nm of the plasma membrane, whereas the centers in exophilin-8-null β-cells are within 300 nm. This difference has a significant effect on the number of the granules directly attached to the plasma membrane, given that the diameter of insulin granules is 300 ~ 350 nm. Furthermore, when cultured β-cells overexpressing these proteins are observed under optical microscopy, granuphilin redistributes granules along the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Torii et al., 2004</xref>), whereas exophilin-8 does so in a relatively broad peripheral area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mizuno et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that only a portion of exophilin-8 and its associated granules are linked to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and the exocytic machinery along the plasma membrane. These findings indicate that, compared with granuphilin, exophilin-8 plays a relatively minor role in granule docking, although it may indirectly contribute to the process by recruiting granules close to the plasma membrane.</p><p>What is the physiological relevance of the exophilin-8-induced peripheral granule accumulation found in monolayer β-cells? Although pancreatic β-cells do not display the typical epithelial polarity, they concentrate F-actin and exocytic machinery, including Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3, at cell edges and particularly at cell vertexes facing blood vessels within islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geron et al., 2015</xref>). This polarity seems to be functionally important, because exocytosis in islets preferentially occurs in the vicinity of vessels, around which β-cells form rosettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takahashi et al., 2002</xref>). The exophilin-8–RIM-BP2–myosin-VIIa complex can provide the molecular basis of these observations, because it interacts with both F-actin and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3. In fact, we found that loss of exophilin-8 prevents polarized granule accumulation both in β-cells within islets and in those cultured in a monolayer. Therefore, even monolayer β-cells could display such a polarity in a cell-autonomous manner. Monolayer chromaffin cells have also been shown to cluster L- and P/Q type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and exocytic machinery on the border of cortical F-actin cages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Torregrosa-Hetland et al., 2011</xref>). How, then, do exophilin-8-positive granules captured within the F-actin network fuse upon secretagogue stimulation? It has recently been shown that the cortical actomyosin II network acts like a casting net to drive granules towards the plasma membrane by undergoing relaxation in a secretagogue-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Papadopulos et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the stimulus-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx not only triggers a final fusion reaction but also may help granules within the F-actin network make further access to the exocytic site.</p><p>In summary, the novel exophilin-8–RIM-BP2–myosin-VIIa complex seems to replenish and to maintain a releasable pool of granules beneath the plasma membrane by locating granules both within the peripheral F-actin network and close to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and exocytic machinery. This may be the first to provide the molecular basis correlating the physical location of secretory granules with their functional pool, given that stable docking to the plasma membrane does not necessarily form a releasable granule pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gomi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mizuno et al., 2016</xref>). Genetic or functional alterations of the complex may lead to type 2 diabetes and other secretory disorders in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of exophilin-8-deficient mice</title><p>The exophilin-8 (encoded by the <italic>Myrip</italic> gene) knockout mice (Accession No. CDB1100K: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www2.clst.riken.jp/arg/mutant%20mice%20list.html">http://www2.clst.riken.jp/arg/mutant%20mice%20list.html</ext-link>) were generated as described elsewhere (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www2.clst.riken.jp/arg/Methods.html">http://www2.clst.riken.jp/arg/Methods.html</ext-link>).

The work appears to be carried out to a high standard and will be of broad interest. Although the identification of interaction domains and localizations are standard cell biology, the inclusion of a mouse model and measurement of physiological consequences add in vivo significance to the story. Thus, presentation in <italic>eLife</italic> is recommended if the authors are able to address the following points.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors conclude that the complex is formed by direct interactions (exophilin-8 with RIMBP2 and RIMBP2 with myosinVIIa) but the data do not meet common standards. The data provided are co-immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblotting and with one or both partner transfected. In most cases the signals are strong and appear specific. Also, the involvement of SH3 and polyproline is highly suggestive of direct binding for one of the interactions. Nevertheless, to demonstrate direct interactions requires tests with purified proteins. The novel discovery here is RimBP2 functioning as an adaptor linking exophilin-8 to myosin VIIa – this needs to be shown with the corresponding purified fragments to meet the standard of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>2) By the end of this study the co-IP data provide evidence for an incredibly large network of exophilin8 interactions: Rab27, RimBP2, myosinVIIa, PKA, Sec6, actin, Cav1.3, RIM1/2, synataxin1 and Munc13-1. Are these many separate complexes or one large complex? Are they present for endogenous rather than over-expressed exophilin-8? Is the exophilin8-RIMBP2-myosinVIIa complex present in the cytoplasm as a stable ternary subcomplex? The major finding of this study is the identification of the exophilin8-RIMBP2-myosinVIIa complex.

Cell Sci., 2017). We first tagged wild-type or PA mutant exophilin-8 ABD with One-STrEP-Flag (OSF) and the binding proteins were pulled down using Strep-Tactin beads followed by SDS-PAGE and CBB staining (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). As you see, the exophilin-8 ABD, but not its PA mutant, binds RIM-BP2, and there are no other specific major bands (compare lanes 2 and 5), which strongly suggests the direct binding between exophilin-8 and RIM-BP2 (some other proteins do not mediate the complex formation). We also found that, although the PA mutant does not interact with myosin-VIIa in INS1 832/13 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), both the WT and the PA mutant bind myosin-VIIa even without RIM-BP2 expression in HEK293A cells (lanes 3, 4, 6, and 7). This finding indicates that exophilin-8 seems to directly interact with myosin-VIIa at least in heterologous cells, which is consistent with the previous findings (El-Amraoui et al., 2002; Fukuda and Kuroda, 2002). Furthermore, exophilin-8 binds myosin-VIIa without its whole MBD or the proline-rich motif in its ABD. We next expressed OSF-RIM-BP2 and the binding proteins were examined (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). As expected, RIM-BP2 bound WT exophilin-8 ABD, but not to the PA mutant (lanes 2 and 3). However, RIM-BP2 could not bind myosin-VIIa without simultaneous expression of the wild-type exophilin8 ABD (lanes 4-6), indicating that RIM-BP2 cannot directly bind myosin-VIIa. Please note that we have not claimed the direct interaction between RIM-BP2 and myosin-VIIa, in contrast to that between exophilin-8 and RIM-BP2, in the original manuscript. We, however, noticed that, although the approximate molecular mass by SDS-PAGE of myosin-VIIa expressed in HEK293A cells is ~260 kDa corresponding to its calculated molecular mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A, B</xref>), that of myosin VIIa interacting with RIM-BP2 in β-cell lines is ~190 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B, C</xref>). This 190-kDa protein should be myosin-VIIa, because it was identified with RIM-BP2 from the 150~190 kDA band of exophilin-8-interacting proteins in MIN6 cells by LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and more importantly, because both 260-kDa and 190-kDa proteins were downregulated by siRNA specific to myosin-VIIa (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) and reacted with two different kinds of anti-myosin-VIIa antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B, 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9C</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Therefore, the 190-kDa form of myosin-VIIa appears to be specifically expressed in β-cells. When we performed the pull-down assays in INS1 832/13 cells, we found that only the 190-kDa protein was pulled down with RIM-BP2, although the 260-kDa protein was also pulled down after exogenous expression of myosin-VIIa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). These findings indicate that the 260-kDa protein is derived from transfected myosin-VIIa cDNA and interacts with RIM-BP2 through exophilin-8, because it can directly interact with exophilin-8 but not with RIM-BP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A, B</xref>). Because the amount of 190-kDa myosin-VIIa pulled down with OSF-RIM-BP2 was not markedly increased compared with that of 260-kDa myosin-VIIa, after exogenous expression of myosin-VIIa, it may represent an alternatively spliced form that specifically functions in secretory cells. Although the exact molecular nature of 190-kDa myosin-VIIa and the functional significance of the direct interaction of exophilin-8 and 260-kDa myosin-VIIa in β-cells are not uncovered in this study, we showed that either the PA mutant that disrupts the interaction of exophilin-8 with 190-kDa myosin-VIIa through RIM-BP2, or the ΔSH3 mutant (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) that disrupts the interaction of RIM-BP2 with exophilin-8 and myosin-VIIa and should not affect the direct interaction between exophilin-8 and 260-kDa–myosin-VIIa, does not restore the peripheral granule accumulation or rescue the decreased insulin secretion in knockdown or knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, and see below in the essential revision 3 and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, E</xref>) strongly indicates that the exophilin-8–RIM-BP2–190-kDa myosin-VIIa complex formation is functionally critical for granule exocytosis.</p><p><italic>2) By the end of this study the co-IP data provide evidence for an incredibly large network of exophilin8 interactions: Rab27, RimBP2, myosinVIIa, PKA, Sec6, actin, Cav1.3, RIM1/2, synataxin1 and Munc13-1. Are these many separate complexes or one large complex? Are they present for endogenous rather than over-expressed exophilin-8? Is the exophilin8-RIMBP2-myosinVIIa complex present in the cytoplasm as a stable ternary subcomplex? The major finding of this study is the identification of the exophilin8-RIMBP2-myosinVIIa complex. Its presence as an endogenous complex should be defined and characterized biochemically (e.g. using gradient or column fractionation) – this may be discernible with a western blot across gradient or column fractions.</italic> </p><p>We have investigated the complex formation in INS1 832/13 cells using sucrose density gradient centrifugation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have focused on exophilin-8, RIM-BP2, and myosin-VIIa, because only a portion of exophilin-8 is thought to be linked to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and the exocytic machinery along the plasma membrane as we originally discussed. Endogenous exophilin-8 (130 kDa) and RIM-BP2 (150 kDa) exhibited similarly wide distributions in fractions 3-10, whereas both endogenous 190-kDa and 260-kDa myosin-VIIa showed relatively narrower distributions around fractions 6-10. Judged from the positions of molecular mass markers, these findings are consistent with the ternary complex formation among these proteins in the cells, although each protein also appeared to exist as a monomer. Because multiple forms of complexes can exist among exophilin-8, RIM-BP2, 190 kDa myosin-VIIa, and 260 kDa myosin-VIIa with or without additional proteins, such as Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 and RIM in cells, it is difficult to get further information by this biochemical method.</p><p><italic>3) The RimBP2 knockdown phenotype is a critical aspect of the present study. Please show a blot for the RimBP2 knockdown. More importantly, other than a non-targeting siRNA pool, there is no specificity control. The central conclusion would be considerably strengthened with rescue of the knockdown phenotype by wildtype but not mutated versions that lack either binding to exophilin-8 or binding to myosin-VIIa.</italic> </p><p>We originally showed a blot for RIM-BP2 knockdown in Figure 6-supplement 1E, but have shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and described it clearly on page 11 in the revised manuscript. For rescue experiments, we first mutated mouse wild-type RIM-BP2 cDNA so that it will become resistant to one of the rat RIM-BP2 siRNA whose target sequence is conserved in mouse RIM-BP2. We then generated ΔSH3 mutant that lacks all the SH3 domains, and found that this mutant loses the binding activity to both exophilin-8 and myosin-VIIa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We made this deletion mutant, because there is no known amino acid mutation within the SH3 domain that commonly disrupts interaction with its specific protein ligand, although it binds short proline-rich peptide segments within proteins. Protein ligands of SH3 domain exploit multiple discontiguous interactions to enhance affinity and selectivity, and the amino acid similarity of any two SH3 domains is typically 25% (see Reviews, Dolgarno et al., Biopoly, 1997, Kay, FEBS Letters, 2012). When expressed in RIM-BP2 knockdown cells, only wild-type RIM-BP2, but not the ΔSH3 mutant, rescued the decreased insulin secretion and restored the peripheral accumulation of insulin granules (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">3</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
