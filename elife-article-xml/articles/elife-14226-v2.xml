subunits: Vps3 and Vps8 (CORVET) versus Vps39 and Vps41 (HOPS). CORVET is an early and HOPS is a late endosomal tether. The function of HOPS is well known in animal cells, while CORVET is poorly characterized. Here we show that Drosophila Vps8 is highly expressed in hemocytes and nephrocytes, and localizes to early endosomes despite the lack of a clear Vps3 homolog. We find that Vps8 forms a complex and acts together with Vps16A, Dor/Vps18 and Car/Vps33A, and loss of any of these proteins leads to fragmentation of endosomes. Surprisingly, Vps11 deletion causes enlargement of endosomes, similar to loss of the HOPS-specific subunits Vps39 and Lt/Vps41. We thus identify a 4 subunit-containing miniCORVET complex as an unconventional early endosomal tether in Drosophila.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14226.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14226.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>fusion</kwd><kwd>tether</kwd><kwd>CORVET</kwd><kwd>HOPS</kwd><kwd>Vps8</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>087518/Z/08/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Juhász</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hungarian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Momentum LP-2014/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Juhász</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hungarian National Scientific Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K83509</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Juhász</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hungarian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IF-27/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medzihradszky</surname><given-names>Katalin F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hungarian National Scientific Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NK101730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andó</surname><given-names>István</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hungarian National Scientific Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PD112632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hegedűs</surname><given-names>Krisztina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An unconventional endosomal tether in Drosophila melanogaster only has four of the six subunits found in the yeast complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells take up extracellular material and transmembrane receptors via endocytosis. Endocytic cargo will either be recycled or degraded in lysosomes. Early (also known as sorting) endosomes represent the central hub where this decision is made. This tubulo-vesicular organ can also receive input from the Golgi or other intracellular vesicles. The fate and maturation of endosomes are regulated by several Rab GTPase proteins. Active, GTP-loaded Rabs recruit effectors to the vesicular membranes, which then facilitate the subsequent events, including vesicle targeting and homo- and heterotypic fusions. Intracellular vesicles usually acquire tethering factors and SNARE (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor) proteins that facilitate their fusion. Tethering complexes and proteins cross-link the membranes of the two vesicles/compartments, and may promote SNARE complex assembly and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hong and Lev, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kümmel and Ungermann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wickner and Schekman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zick and Wickner, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The tethering factors are recruited to intracellular membranes by interacting with activated small Rab GTPase (or small Rab GTPase-associated) proteins and phosphoinositides. Four endosomal tethers have been identified to date: the early endosomal tethers Rbsn-5 (Rabenosyn-5), CORVET (Class C core endosome vacuole tethering), the vertebrate-specific EEA1 (Early endosomal antigen 1), and the late endosomal tether HOPS (Homotypic vacuole fusion and protein sorting). The Rbsn-5 protein itself has a tethering function similar to EEA1, whilst CORVET and HOPS are closely related heterohexameric tethering complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kümmel and Ungermann, 2014</xref>). These protein complexes were first identified and characterized in yeast. CORVET binds to Vps21/Rab5 and mediates early endosomal fusions, whereas HOPS binds to Ypt7/Rab7 and mediates late endosomal, autophagosomal and vacuolar fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balderhaar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Markgraf et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peplowska et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plemel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rieder and Emr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seals et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wurmser et al., 2000</xref>). Both share a common core of class C Vps proteins (Vps11, Vps16, Vps18 and Vps33), and the two Rab-binding subunits are located on opposite ends of these complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balderhaar and Ungermann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bröcker et al., 2012</xref>). Vps3 and Vps8 are the CORVET specific subunits that bind to Vps21/Rab5, while Vps39 and Vps41 are present in HOPS and interact with Ypt7/Rab7, respectively.</p><p>All HOPS subunits are conserved in metazoans, and the roles of this complex are very similar in mammals and Drosophila to yeast cells. Interestingly, two of the genes encoding class C proteins (Vps16 and Vps33) have been duplicated in flies and mammals, but Vps16B/VIPAR and Vps33B have been suggested to form a separate endosomal targeting complex with each other, independent of CORVET or HOPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van der Kant et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wartosch et al., 2015</xref> ). Importantly, among the two CORVET-specific subunits only the homologs of Vps8 can be found in higher eukaryotes, as Vps3 seems to be a fungi-specific protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Solinger and Spang, 2013</xref>). It was recently demonstrated that one of the mammalian Vps39 homologs, Vps39-2 (also known as Tgfbrap1 or Trap1), can be found in a Vps8-containing CORVET complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lachmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Perini et al., 2014</xref>). The function of mammalian CORVET is still poorly characterized: the only functional analysis published to date reported that siRNA knockdown of Vps8 in HeLa cells affects the fusion of only a subset of early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Perini et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Drosophila is an excellent model to study vesicular trafficking in multiple tissues of a whole animal. Others and we have shown that HOPS mediates the fusion of lysosomes with endosomes and autophagosomes, and also promotes biosynthetic trafficking to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles such as eye pigment granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akbar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lindmo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pulipparacharuvil et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Richardson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sevrioukov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takáts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warner et al., 1998</xref>). Several HOPS subunits were named based on the defective eye color of hypomorphic mutant animals: Vps18 is called Deep orange (Dor), Vps33A is Carnation (Car), and Vps41 is known as Light (Lt) in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akbar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lloyd et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Patterson, 1932</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sevrioukov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warner et al., 1998</xref>). Regarding the CORVET-specific subunits, only a Vps8 homolog can be found in Drosophila, as no gene products show significant similarity to either yeast Vps3 or mammalian Tgfbrap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li and Blissard, 2015</xref>). This raises the question of how Vps8 can function: is it part of an alternative CORVET complex, or does it have a new role?</p><p>In this work, we show that Drosophila Vps8 (also known as CG10144) is highly expressed in larval hemocytes and nephrocytes, the two cell types that display very high endocytic activity to ensure continuous monitoring and filtration of the blood. Through a series of colocalization, biochemical interaction, mutant and genetic epistasis analyses, we show that Vps8 functions together with Dor/Vps18, Car/Vps33A and Vps16A to promote the fusion of early endosomes independent of Vps11 and the HOPS-specific subunits Vps39 and Lt/Vps41, therefore it is a defining subunit of a novel miniCORVET complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Vps8 is expressed in larval nephrocytes and hemocytes</title><p>To analyze Vps8 function in Drosophila, we first generated a HA-tagged Vps8 reporter line whose expression is controlled by genomic Vps8 promoter sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

These data suggested that Vps11 might not be a component of this CORVET-like complex in Drosophila that we thus named miniCORVET, consistent with the lack of hemocyte tumors in vps11 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14226.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Vps8 forms a miniCORVET complex with the class C Vps proteins Dor/Vps18, Car/Vps33A and Vps16A.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Endogenous Car, Dor and Vps16A proteins coprecipitate with Vps8-HA.

Considering the fragmented endosomal phenotype, we hypothesized that miniCORVET may cooperate with a partner on early endosomes, such as the other early endosomal tether Rbsn-5. First, miniCORVET colocalizes with Rbsn-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Second, yeast data showed that class C Vps proteins, including Vps18p/Pep3p, interact with Vac1p/Pep7p, the yeast homolog of Rbsn-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peterson and Emr, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srivastava et al., 2000</xref>). We therefore analyzed the potential binding of Rbsn-5 to either Dor/Vps18 or Vps8 in yeast two hybrid experiments, and detected its strong direct interaction with Dor/Vps18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Importantly, nephrocytes lacking Rbsn-5 also contained fragmented Rab7-positive endosomes and were devoid of properly sized α-vacuoles based on ultrastructural analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B,C</xref>). These phenotypes are remarkably similar to that of vps8 mutants. Finally, we analyzed the localization of Vps8-HA in cells lacking Rbsn-5. Rab5-positive early endosomes were fragmented and accumulated in the perinuclear region in the absence of Rbsn-5, but these endosomes still contained Vps8-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figurre 10D</xref>). These results indicate that Rbsn-5 also acts as an essential early endosomal tether in garland nephrocytes. As cells lacking Vps8 have a normal Rbsn-5 positive endosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), the endosomal recruitment of Rbsn-5 and miniCORVET appears to be mutually independent of each other. Strikingly, the formation of properly sized late endosomes and endolysosomes in nephrocytes thus requires the function of both Rbsn-5 and miniCORVET, which could be explained by their cooperative interaction.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14226.022</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Rbsn-5 binds to Dor/Vps18 and is also required for early endosomal fusions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rbsn-5 directly binds to Dor, based on prominent growth of yeast colonies on synthetic medium lacking Ade in yeast two hybrid experiments.

The 4 class C Vps proteins (Vps11, 16, 18, 33) form its core that is shared with the HOPS complex, and the 2 specific subunits Vps3 and Vps8 are located on the opposite sides of the complex. Instead of these 2 proteins, the late endosomal tether HOPS contains Vps39 and Vps41. The specific subunits are thought to be important for the bridging of appropriate vesicles, since both complexes act as a tether during vesicle fusions: CORVET is associated with Vps21/Rab5-positive early endosomes, while HOPS localizes to Ypt7/Rab7 containing late endosomes and the vacuole/lysosome, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balderhaar and Ungermann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bröcker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plemel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Solinger and Spang, 2013</xref>). Most of these proteins are conserved in higher eukaryotes, and the composition and function of HOPS is similar to the yeast complex in metazoan cells. CORVET is less well characterized: it contains the specific subunits Vps8 and Tgfbrap1, and associates with a subset of endosomes in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lachmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Perini et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our data clearly show that a CORVET-like complex is a functional and essential early endosomal tether in a subset of cell types in Drosophila, that is, nephrocytes and hemocytes. Importantly, it is these cells that probably display the highest endocytic activity in the larva. The endolysosomal system occupies much of the cytoplasm in garland nephrocytes, and based on ultrastructural studies, their unusually large late endosomes and lysosomes even deserved a name of their own: α-vacuoles and β-vacuoles, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koenig and Ikeda, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kosaka and Ikeda, 1983</xref>). Flies with mutations in genes whose products are required for early endosomal trafficking, such as avl/Syntaxin 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu and Bilder, 2005</xref>), Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wucherpfennig et al., 2003</xref>) and Rbsn-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morrison et al., 2008</xref>), die during embryonic development. In contrast, vps8 mutant flies are semilethal. Importantly, the structure and pigmentation of their compound eye and the endosomal compartment of mutant wing disc cells remains similar to wild type ones. Late endosomes and likely as a consequence endolysosomes are fragmented in vps8 mutant nephrocytes, and bacteria-containing phagosomes fail to mature into acidic phagolysosomes in hemocytes. These results raise the possibility that CORVET activity is most critical in nephrocytes and hemocytes in Drosophila. It remains to be established whether such remarkably strong phenotypes are also seen in the mammalian kidney and white blood cells in the absence of Vps8.</p><p>Rbsn-5 is another early endosomal tether in Drosophila cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morrison et al., 2008</xref>), and we show that it is also required for the generation of properly sized late endosomes and endolysosomes in garland nephrocytes. Based on our vps8 mutant data, the early endosomal tethering activity of Rbsn-5 might be sufficient for endocytic flux in most cells, with the exception of nephrocytes and hemocytes. This is likely due to the very high endocytic activity of these cells, and perhaps also to their unusually large endosomes and phagosomes, as the decreased membrane curvature may require the contribution of a different tether as well. We speculate that in this case, Rbsn-5 may cooperate with a 4-subunit miniCORVET complex through direct binding to Dor, an evolutionarily conserved interaction that was reported earlier between the corresponding yeast homologs, Vac1p/Pep7p and Vps18p/Pep3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srivastava et al., 2000</xref>). This is further supported by the colocalization of Rbsn-5 with Vps8. Our model would also explain how miniCORVET could act as a tether in Drosophila in the absence of Vps3 and Tgfbrap1 homologs. Importantly, the recruitment of Vps8 and Rbsn-5 to Rab5-positive early endosomes is mutually independent of each other, suggesting that they interact after associating to the surface of these vesicles.</p><p>Perhaps the most surprising aspect of our study is that Vps8 appears to act independent of Vps11 in Drosophila. Several lines of evidence support this finding. First of all, the endosomal compartment is fragmented in vps8 mutants as well as in the absence of Vps16A, Dor/Vps18 and Car/Vps33A, whereas loss of the HOPS-specific subunits Vps39 and Lt/Vps41 lead to the enlargement of late endosomes and endolysosomes, a phenotype that is also seen in Vps11 mutant and RNAi cells. A summary of the phenotypes of cells lacking various miniCORVET and HOPS subunits is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>. Second, Vps11 is dispensable for the recruitment of Vps8 to Rab5-positive early endosomes similar to Vps39, while the loss of Rab5, Dor, Car or Vps16A all result in cytoplasmic dispersal of Vps8. Third, our proteomic experiment identified Car, Dor, and Vps16A as interacting partners of Vps8 with 13–21 unique peptides for each one, suggesting that these proteins form a stable complex. In contrast, Vps11 was not identified in this immunoprecipitate. Our data go along with those of a recent pulldown study, which identified Vps8, Car, Dor and Vps16A in a search for Rab5 effectors in Drosophila cells, but not Vps11, Vps39 or Lt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gillingham et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, Vps11 was found in a Rab2 pulldown experiment along with the other 5 HOPS subunits, unlike Vps8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gillingham et al., 2014</xref>). These independent data further support the existence of a full HOPS and the novel, 4-subunit miniCORVET complex in Drosophila.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14226.023</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>A cartoon illustrating garland nephrocytes in wild type, miniCORVET and/or HOPS loss-of-function animals.</title><p>In control cells, fusion of early endosomes leads to formation of large electron lucent late endosomes (α-vacuoles) that contain a single core. These vacuoles mature into degradative endolysosomes (β-vacuoles), possibly by fusing with primary lysosomes. In cells lacking Vps8 (and as a result miniCORVET function), α-vacuoles remain small and fragmented due to insufficient early endosomal fusion events. In cells lacking HOPS function due to loss of Lt, Vps39 or Vps11, late endosomes fail to mature into degradative lysosomes. Note that α-vacuoles enlarge into enormous vacuoles containing multiple dense cores in these cells, likely because of the continuous input from early endosomal fusions that are supported by the tethers miniCORVET and Rbsn-5. Nephrocytes lacking both miniCORVET and HOPS function (due to loss of the shared subunits Vps16A, Car, Dor, or the double mutation of Vps8 and Lt) contain fragmented late endosomes as in the case of Vps8 mutants, and accumulate small dense granules (possibly Golgi-derived vesicles transporting lysosomal cargo).

The tail part contains the class C protein Vps11, and Vps3 or Vps39 for CORVET or HOPS, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bröcker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ostrowicz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van der Kant et al., 2015</xref>). An approximately 200 residue region near the Vps11 C-terminus is necessary and sufficient to hold Vps3 or Vps39 onto the rest of the class C Vps core in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ostrowicz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plemel et al., 2011</xref>). This observation is compatible with our model of Vps11 being dispensable for miniCORVET assembly in the absence of Vps3. We thus propose that unlike a fully formed HOPS complex, a miniCORVET corresponding to the head part of the yeast or mammalian CORVET complexes exist in Drosophila. In addition to its tethering function, recruitment of the SM (Sec1/Munc18) protein Car/Vps33A may also facilitate the fusion of early endosomes by acting as a template for SNARE assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we identify the novel 4-subunit miniCORVET complex as a tether for early endosomes that is essential for endocytic trafficking in nephrocytes and hemocytes in Drosophila, and show that it acts upstream of HOPS, which mediates the fusion of lysosomes with late endosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks, culture and silver uptake experiments</title><p>Flies were raised at 25°C in standard conditions.

For endosome size measurements in the ultrastructural analyses, all endosomes with electron lucent lumen and without a clathrin coat were measured manually using iTEM software (Olympus). All visible endosomes were measured in all cells present in the examined section to avoid the distortion of data.</p><p>In nephrocyte experiments, 3–5 cells per animal were selected for quantification. Only cells that were optically sectioned in the middle part were included in the analysis to avoid distortion of data or undersampling. All phenotypes shown were robust with no obvious variability between cells or animals of the same genotype, and no data have been purposely excluded from the analysis.</p><p>Data were imported into SPSS Statistics 17 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and tested for normality of data distribution. Since in all experiments there were groups with non-normally distributed data, we used nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple comparisons. Simple dot plot and box-and-whisker plot charts were generated using the same software. In box-and-whisker plots, bars show the data lying between the upper and lower quartiles; the median is indicated as a horizontal line within the box, and whisker plots show the smallest and largest observations. Outliers are not shown. In simple dot plots, the red lines represent mean values. A p-value of 0.01 (or less) was considered to be significant. Accordingly, ** means p&lt;0.01 and *** means p&lt;0.001.</p><p>Please see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref> for more details of statistical analyses.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Sarolta Pálfia and Gina Puska for technical assistance, and our colleagues listed in the Methods section for providing reagents.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;MiniCORVET is a Vps8-containing hemocyte- and nephrocyte-specific early endosomal tether in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Randy Schekman as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. Two reviewers, Alexey Merz and Helmut Krämer, have agreed to be identified. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Lorincz and co-workers report thorough and elegant genetic studies on <italic>Drosophila</italic> of Vps8, a substituent of CORVET, one of multiple Vps-C multi-subunit tethering complexes that support membrane docking and fusion within the endolysosomal system. Perhaps as expected from previous work in other systems, they find that Vps8 is needed for the fusion and steady-state maintenance of an early, Rabenosyn-5 positive compartment. A second Vps-C compartment, HOPS, is needed to control docking and steady-state maintenance of a late-endosomal, Rab7-positive compartment. This is also expected. However, Lorincz et al. reveal some surprises as well. First, Vps8 exhibits a strongly tissue-specific localization to nephrocytes and hemocytes, but is doesn't seem to be needed for endosomal function in wing imaginal discs. Second, Vps8 deletion causes expansion of the hemocyte lineage and tumorigenesis. Third, Vps11, long thought to be a core component required for all Vps-C complexes, is dispensable for early endosome function in the hemocyte but still needed (along with HOPS at the late endosome. Interaction studies are consistent with this interpretation and reveal a &quot;mini-CORVET&quot; complex seemingly containing four rather than the expected six subunits.</p><p>The reviewers agree on the importance and rigor of the study, medium to high novelty and the surprises of no vps11 and cell-specific expression.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The first question relates to the specificity of vps8 expression and function. I am not sure specific loss of CORVET function in hemocytes and nephrocytes in larvae alone would cause pharate adult lethality, as the authors observe for the vps8 CRISPR mutant. I am very surprised that the endogenously tagged HA variant is not explained either in Results or in the Materials and methods. Only presenting primer sequences is absolutely insufficient – I did not want to make the effort to BLAST the primers myself to find out how big the region may be – but any PCR amplified region is highly likely to represent only some genomic regulatory elements. How big is the region? Did they use CRISPR or BAC recombineering, and where is the transgene integrated in the genome? It actually seems like the construct does not fully rescue the defects of the vps8/Df in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>. Next, there is no data where else Vps8-HA is expressed in the larva or in the pupa. Why do they die as late pupae? Do I understand correctly that adult escapers are actually perfectly normal? How about the nervous system?</p><p>Minimally the authors should show and discuss: first, exactly how the genomically tagged version was made and where it is expressed in larvae, pupae and adults. Second, a more detailed and thoughtful presentation of rescue is warranted.</p><p>2) There are (presentational?) problems with the vps8 mutant. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> shows that vps8 transcript is still present in the RTPCR result, so it is not convincing that vps8 mutant they generated is really a mutant. There seems to be a decrease in the level of vps8 transcript in vps8/Df compared to the control, but this would even be consistent with just a loss of one copy of vps8 in the deficiency line. How about the homozygous vps8 mutant? Why is there any RTPCR product? Are there any differences between vps8 homozygous CRISPR allele and vps8 over Deficiency? I acknowledge that the Vps8-HA apparently rescues semilethality, making this concern hopefully only one of presentation of full data. Is a homozygous vps8 mutant rescued equally to the transheterozygote?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>: Why does the western blot show no anti-HA band in the Input column when Vps8-HA is present (+ column).</p><p>4) <italic>Drosophila</italic> pigment cells are another cell type that relies on HOPS or a related complex for the biogenesis of a specialized lysosome-related organelle. So it was disappointing that the possible function for Vps8 in pigment granule formation was not assessed, given that it requires only a simple cross in a white+ background. An examination of pigment granule phenotypes is warranted, particularly given the long and rich history of Vps-C studies in that context. Probably the first SM allele ever isolated, even before sec1-1, was fly carnation/Vps33A. And, now that I mention it, that paper should be cited in the present manuscript: J.T. Patterson (1932) Genetics 17:38-59.</p><p>5) The observation of hemocyte and nephrocyte-specificity is not well documented – the genomic (?) HA construct may not reflect the normal expression pattern, is insufficiently explained, and expression in other than the analyzed cell types simply not shown. There is also a potential issue with the mutant. If all data are correct and the reagents good, then this should be easy to revise for the authors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14226.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The first question relates to the specificity of vps8 expression and function.

Second, a more detailed and thoughtful presentation of rescue is warranted.</italic></p><p>Thank you for the suggestion to include more data on our Vps8-HA reporter/rescue transgene. We have included it in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and a detailed description of this construct in its legend as follows:</p><p>“This construct contains 824 base pairs upstream of the Vps8 transcription start site (including part of the first exon of the neighboring gene sfl), the entire Vps8 transcription unit including exons and introns, but lacks the stop codon and 3' UTR of Vps8. […] We show the X chromosomal insertion throughout the paper, because it was easier to carry out genetic rescue experiments with that (note that the Vps8 gene is located on the 3rd chromosome).”</p><p>In the revised version of our manuscript, we have included additional images showing that Vps8-HA (which is highly expressed in nephrocytes and hemocytes, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) shows much lower levels of expression in other tissues in the larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>). Its expression pattern in various adult tissues and pupal wings is similar to larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is perfectly in line with high-throughput expression data available on Flybase, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome homepage: both the FlyAtlas and modENCODE datasets showed that the expression of Vps8 is low in most tissues approximately 20-200-fold lower that of the common autophagy marker Atg8a). Note that hemocytes and nephrocytes were not analyzed in these high-throughput studies, probably because the collection of enough samples from these cells was not feasible.</p><p>We have also included more details for genetic rescue experiments. While Vps8-HA does not revert the Rab7 vesicle/α vacuole size defect of Vps8 mutants completely to wild type (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8C</xref>, respectively), the rescued animals were indistinguishable from wild type in most tests (including vps8 mRNA levels and viability, please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We hypothesize that the presence of the C-terminal 9xHA tag might minimally interfere with the generation of the unusually large Rab7-positive alpha vacuoles in nephrocytes.</p><p>The most likely explanation for the lethality of our Vps8 mutant is, at least in part, spontaneous immune induction. Immune induction is clearly indicated by the disorganization of the sessile hemocyte compartment and en masse appearance of specialized blood cells (lamellocytes and crystal cells, please see Markus et al., 2009, PNAS 106:4805-4809) in mutant larvae. New images showing these phenotypes have been added, please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>. Abnormal immune induction and hemocyte proliferation has previously been shown to cause lethality due to hematopoetic compartment-specific overexpression of PVF2, a PDGF/VEGF-like growth factor (Munier et al. 2002, EMBO reports vol. 3 no.12 pp1195–1200). These two references have also been added to the revised manuscript. Vps8-HA expression is very low in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Since the overall brain morphology of dissected vps8 mutant larvae and adults appears similar to wild type, and we could not find any obvious alterations in various vps8 mutant neuron types compared to wild type animals in ultrastructural analyses (our unpublished observations), we hypothesize that Vps8 might not play a major role in neurons.</p><p><italic>2) There are (presentational?) problems with the vps8 mutant. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> shows that vps8 transcript is still present in the RTPCR result, so it is not convincing that vps8 mutant they generated is really a mutant. There seems to be a decrease in the level of vps8 transcript in vps8/Df compared to the control, but this would even be consistent with just a loss of one copy of vps8 in the deficiency line. How about the homozygous vps8 mutant? Why is there any RTPCR product? Are there any differences between vps8 homozygous CRISPR allele and vps8 over Deficiency? I acknowledge that the Vps8-HA apparently rescues semilethality, making this concern hopefully only one of presentation of full data. Is a homozygous vps8 mutant rescued equally to the transheterozygote?</italic></p><p>Thank you for the suggestion to clarify these. The CRISPR mutagenesis and the resulting mutations in vps8<sup>1</sup> are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. The first mutation causes a 4 base pair deletion, and this frameshift immediately produces a premature stop codon after amino acid 39 (note that Vps8 protein is composed of 1,229 amino acids). We thus think that vps8<sup>1</sup> represents a null allele. In line with this, the phenotypes of homozygous vps8<sup>1</sup> mutants are similar to vps8<sup>1</sup>/Df animals, and both are rescued equally by Vps8-HA. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> for viability data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> for silver and dextran uptake, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> for Rab7 vesicles in homozygous mutants and rescue animals. Quantification of dextran uptake, Rab7 endosome size and Garland cell size in homozygous and Vps8/Df animals as well as in rescued animals is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J, K</xref> respectively.</p><p>We have carried our quantitative real-time PCR experiments to properly assess vps8 transcript levels in the various genotypes. Please note that vps8<sup>1</sup> animals carry a frameshift mutation, which likely does not affect the transcription of this gene but causes a premature stop codon as shown now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> as well as in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. As expected, qPCRs using primers overlapping with the frameshift mutation do not detect wild type vps8 transcript in homozygous and vps8/Df animals, and it is restored to wild type level in the rescued genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We also carried out qPCR analysis using frameshift-independent primers, which show approximately 25% transcript level in homozygous and vps8/Df animals relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is similar to what we have shown by RT-PCR in the original version of our manuscript (note that this is replaced with qPCR data in the revised version). In summary, the frameshift mutation does not prevent the transcription of this locus, but it likely affects mRNA stability.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>: Why does the western blot show no anti-HA band in the Input column when Vps8-HA is present (+ column).</italic></p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have carried out this western blot again using the original input lysates and longer exposure time, and replaced the image with one where the anti-HA band is visible (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Drosophila pigment cells are another cell type that relies on HOPS or a related complex for the biogenesis of a specialized lysosome-related organelle. So it was disappointing that the possible function for Vps8 in pigment granule formation was not assessed, given that it requires only a simple cross in a white+ background. An examination of pigment granule phenotypes is warranted, particularly given the long and rich history of Vps-C studies in that context. Probably the first SM allele ever isolated, even before sec1-1, was fly carnation/Vps33A. And, now that I mention it, that paper should be cited in the present manuscript: J.T. Patterson (1932) Genetics 17:38-59.</italic></p><p>Thank you for the suggestion to analyze eye pigment granule formation. We have replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> (with the eyes shown enlarged in C'), showing that the eye color of Vps8 mutant males and females is indistinguishable from that of wild type flies.</p><p>The first report of carnation mutant flies (Patterson, J.T. (1932). Lethal mutations and deficiencies produced in the X-chromosome of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> by X-radiation. Am. Nat. 66: 193-206) is now cited. Please note that the Genetics paper mentioned by the Reviewer describes two translocations that, to our knowledge, do not affect the carnation gene.</p><p> <italic>5) The observation of hemocyte and nephrocyte-specificity is not well documented – the genomic (?) HA construct may not reflect the normal expression pattern, is insufficiently explained, and expression in other than the analyzed cell types simply not shown. There is also a potential issue with the mutant. If all data are correct and the reagents good, then this should be easy to revise for the authors.</italic></p><p>We have included more data on Vps8-HA expression driven by a genomic promoter region (please see response to Essential revision 1) and on our vps8 mutant (please see response to Essential revision 2), as requested. We suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Vps8 has the most important function in hemocytes and nephrocytes because:</p><p>A) we can detect striking hemocyte and nephrocyte defects in our vps8 mutant flies;</p><p>B) these are the cell types where our genomic Vps8-HA reporter shows high expression;</p><p>C) the mutant phenotypes, including lethality and melanotic tumors, are rescued by our Vps8-HA transgene, indicating that these are caused by the loss of vps8 function and that the Vps8-HA protein is functional.</p><p>Nevertheless, since Vps8 expression can also be detected in other tissues in low levels, we refrain from stating hemocyte- and nephrocyte-specificity in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
