(IP<sub>3</sub>R), whereas the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl2l10, binds to another part of the IP<sub>3</sub>-binding domain. Here we show that Bcl2l10 and IRBIT interact and exert an additive inhibition of IP<sub>3</sub>R in the physiological state. Moreover, we found that these proteins associate in a complex in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) and that their interplay is involved in apoptosis regulation. MAMs are a hotspot for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, and massive Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through IP<sub>3</sub>R in mitochondria induces cell death. We found that upon apoptotic stress, IRBIT is dephosphorylated, becoming an inhibitor of Bcl2l10. Moreover, IRBIT promotes ER mitochondria contact. Our results suggest that by inhibiting Bcl2l10 activity and promoting contact between ER and mitochondria, IRBIT facilitates massive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to mitochondria and promotes apoptosis. This work then describes IRBIT as a new regulator of cell death.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19896.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19896.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>IP3R</kwd><kwd>Bcl-2</kwd><kwd>mitochondria-associated membranes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bonneau</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006264</institution-id><institution>RIKEN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bonneau</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>IRBIT and the Bcl-2 homolog Bcl2l10 form a complex at the endoplasmic reticulum that controls Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, however IRBIT turns into an apoptosis facilitator following stress and inhibits anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl2l10.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration serves as a second messenger for numerous processes, including the cell cycle, fertilization or apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berridge et al., 2003</xref>). At the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are mainly generated by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) in response to IP<sub>3</sub> binding. The cellular response to a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal depends on the amplitude and frequency of this signal. IP<sub>3</sub>R is then tightly regulated by post-translational modifications and interacting partners that modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> release according to cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mikoshiba, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foskett et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In particular, several Bcl-2 family proteins have been reported to regulate IP<sub>3</sub>R activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bonneau et al., 2013</xref>). These proteins are well known for their role in apoptosis through the control of outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c release, and subsequent activation of caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Youle and Strasser, 2008</xref>). However, Bcl-2 family proteins are also involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced apoptosis. The correct functioning of mitochondria requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is supplied by some portions of ER that are in physical contact with the mitochondria (called MAMs for mitochondria-associated ER membranes). In MAMs, IP<sub>3</sub>R associates with the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), allowing a direct transfer of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Szabadkai et al., 2006</xref>). However, if the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transferred is too high, it induces cytochrome c release and apoptosis. MAMs are then acknowledged to be an essential component of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giorgi et al., 2009</xref>). In this regard, some Bcl-2 family proteins localize at ER and modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bonneau et al., 2013</xref>). Several antiapoptotic members notably interact with IP<sub>3</sub>R, each one regulating channel activity by a distinct mechanism. For example, Bcl-2 interacts with the central part of IP<sub>3</sub>R and reduces Ca<sup>2+</sup> release to inhibit proapoptotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rong et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast, Bcl-xL interacts with the most C-terminal domain of IP<sub>3</sub>R and stimulates pro-survival Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">White et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Recently, Nrz, a Bcl-2 homolog in zebrafish, was shown to interact with the N-terminal IP<sub>3</sub>-binding domain of IP<sub>3</sub>R and to decrease ligand binding on the receptor, thus reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonneau et al., 2014</xref>). Only a few regulators of IP<sub>3</sub>R interact with the IP<sub>3</sub>-binding domain (IP<sub>3</sub>BD) or act by interfering with ligand fixation. Among them, IRBIT acts in a manner similar to Nrz. IRBIT directly competes with IP<sub>3</sub> by interacting with the residues of the IP<sub>3 </sub>binding domain (IP<sub>3</sub>BD) that are involved in IP<sub>3</sub> binding (known as the IP<sub>3</sub>-binding pocket). This increases the threshold of IP<sub>3</sub> required for IP<sub>3</sub>R opening and then decreases Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to IP<sub>3</sub>R, IRBIT interacts with various partners, such as ion transporters and exchangers including NBCe1-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shirakabe et al., 2006</xref>), NHE3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2008</xref>), and Slc26a6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2013</xref>), the Cl<sup>−</sup> channel CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2009</xref>), Fip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kiefer et al., 2009</xref>), the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arnaoutov and Dasso, 2014</xref>) and kinases including CaMKIIα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawaai et al., 2015</xref>), PIPKI, and IIα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ando et al., 2015</xref>). All of these interactions involve the N-terminal region of IRBIT, which contains a serine-rich region with several phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devogelaere et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, phosphorylation of Ser68 is required for the subsequent sequential phosphorylation of Ser71, Ser74, and Ser77 by the casein kinase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devogelaere et al., 2007</xref>). This multiple phosphorylation of IRBIT is critical for its interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R and most of its other partners.</p><p>Nrz is the zebrafish ortholog of the mammalian antiapoptotic protein Bcl2l10 (also called Nrh, Bcl-B, or Diva/Boo). To date, little is known about Bcl2l10, particularly regarding its effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. In mammals, Bcl2l10 is mainly expressed in the ovary and testis, but also in the lung and the developing nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aouacheria et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inohara et al., 1998</xref>). Interestingly, IRBIT is also strongly expressed in these organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ando et al., 2003</xref>). Nrz and IRBIT both regulate IP<sub>3</sub>R activity by interacting with the IP<sub>3</sub>BD. However, they do not share a common binding site on the IP<sub>3</sub>BD as Nrz does not interact with the residues required for IP<sub>3</sub> and IRBIT binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonneau et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that Nrz and IRBIT may interact with the IP<sub>3</sub>BD at the same time. In the present study, we showed that, like Nrz, Bcl2l10 interacts with the IP<sub>3</sub>BD of IP<sub>3</sub>R. We then analyzed how IRBIT and Bcl2l10 behave towards each other. We found that IRBIT and Bcl2l10 interacted together independently of IRBIT binding to IP<sub>3</sub>R and that they cooperated to regulate IP<sub>3</sub>R activity. Furthermore, we showed that these two proteins localized in MAMs, where they are part of a protein complex with IP<sub>3</sub>R and VDAC. Unexpectedly, we found that IRBIT promoted cell death through two mechanisms. First during apoptosis, IRBIT was dephosphorylated, and unphosphorylated IRBIT appeared to inhibit the antiapoptotic activity of Bcl2l10. Second, IRBIT appeared to promote contact between ER and mitochondria that may facilitate proapoptotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer. Considered collectively, our results suggested a strong relationship between IRBIT and Bcl2l10 and pointed out, for the first time, the implied involvement of IRBIT in cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bcl2l10 interacts with IP<sub>3</sub>BD and reduces Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from IP<sub>3</sub>R</title><p>The Bcl2l10 orthology group is highly divergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guillemin et al., 2011</xref>) and human Bcl2l10 only shares 28.4% identity with Nrz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We therefore first investigated whether Bcl2l10 behaves like Nrz and interacts with IP<sub>3</sub>R. The three different isoforms of IP<sub>3</sub>R were immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells extract, and we found that endogenous Bcl2l10 interacted with the three isoforms, although the interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R2 appeared weaker than that of IP<sub>3</sub>R1 or IP<sub>3</sub>R3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next evaluated whether Bcl2l10 also interacts with the IP<sub>3</sub>BD (amino acids 224–604 of IP<sub>3</sub>R1) as does Nrz. Extracts of HeLa cells expressing FLAG-Bcl2l10 were subjected to GST-pulldown assay, and we demonstrated that Bcl2l10 interacts with recombinant GST-IP<sub>3</sub>BD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

In these experiments, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were used as they exhibit robust IICR in response to ATP stimulation. Expression of Bcl2l10 significantly reduced IICR following the treatment of cells with 1 µM ATP without affecting basal cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], as measured with the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dye Fura-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). It has been shown that Bcl-2 family proteins can modify Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER by acting on the steady-state concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pinton and Rizzuto, 2006</xref>). To address a possible effect of Bcl2l10 on ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, MEF cells were incubated with Fura-2 and treated with 1 µM thapsigargin, which induced the depletion of ER [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. We found that expression of Bcl2l10 did not alter ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Overexpression of IRBIT in cells expressing the endogenous protein has no effect on IICR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, to avoid the contribution of endogenous IRBIT protein, we used MEF cells derived from IRBIT knockout (KO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawaai et al., 2015</xref>). In these cells, expression of IRBIT or Bcl2l10 alone significantly reduced IICR elicited by ATP treatment compared to the response in the control without affecting basal cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Interestingly, co-expression of IRBIT and Bcl2l10 had a stronger effect on IICR than expression of each protein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

Extracts from cells expressing IRBIT alone or in combination with Bcl2l10 were subjected to GST-pulldown with recombinant GST-IP<sub>3</sub>BD. When expressed with Bcl2l10, IRBIT appeared to interact more with IP<sub>3</sub>BD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In the same way, we performed a GST-pulldown assay with GST-IP<sub>3</sub>BD and a recombinant Bcl2l10 protein in the presence or absence of recombinant IRBIT produced in Sf9 cells. This production allows the phosphorylation of IRBIT, which is essential for the interaction of IRBIT with the IP<sub>3</sub>BD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, our results showed that in the presence of IRBIT, Bcl2l10 interacted more strongly with the IP<sub>3</sub>BD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, IRBIT and Bcl2l10 appeared to strengthen each other's interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R.</p><p>IRBIT was first characterized as a protein released from IP<sub>3</sub>R by IP<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ando et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, as IP<sub>3</sub> and IRBIT share the same binding site, the binding of IP<sub>3</sub> on IP<sub>3</sub>R occurs to the detriment of the interaction of IRBIT with IP<sub>3</sub>R. Thus, reduction of the IRBIT interaction with the IP<sub>3</sub>BD in the presence of an increasing concentration of IP<sub>3</sub> reflected the binding of IP<sub>3</sub> on the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, in the presence of Bcl2l10, we observed that the effect of IP<sub>3</sub> on IRBIT's interaction with the IP<sub>3</sub>BD was attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This result confirmed the fact that Bcl2l10 strengthened the interaction of IRBIT with IP<sub>3</sub>R, and suggested that Bcl2l10 and IRBIT associated to interfere with IP<sub>3</sub> binding on the receptor and then reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>IRBIT and Bcl2l10 interact</title><p>The above results suggest that IRBIT and Bcl2l10 can form a regulatory complex on IP<sub>3</sub>R.

Endogenous IRBIT protein was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells extract, following which we detected an interaction of this protein with endogenous Bcl2l10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To further characterize this interaction, we then searched for the domain with which Bcl2l10 and IRBIT are involved. The BH4 domain of Bcl-2 family members mediates their interaction with proteins outside of the Bcl-2 family, such as Raf-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 1996</xref>), calcineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shibasaki et al., 1997</xref>) and VDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimizu et al., 2000</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation between FLAG-tagged full length Bcl2l10 or ∆BH4Bcl2l10 and HA-IRBIT showed that the BH4 domain of Bcl2l10 was essential for its interaction with IRBIT, as the deletion mutant ∆BH4Bcl2l10 lost its ability to bind IRBIT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19896.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>IRBIT and Bcl2l10 interact together and belong to a protein complex in MAM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of IP between endogenous IRBIT and endogenous Bcl2l10.

In particular, phosphorylation of residues Ser71, Ser74, and Ser77 is essential for IRBIT binding on IP<sub>3</sub>R. This multiple phosphorylation relies on a prime phosphorylation on Ser68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devogelaere et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, deletion of the first 104 amino acids of IRBIT or the mutation S68A abolishes the interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ando et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2006</xref>). Interestingly, these mutations did not affect the ability of IRBIT to be co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl2l10 when co-expressed in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that IRBIT binds Bcl2l10 independently of its interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R. To identify the region of IRBIT involved in the interaction with Bcl2l10, we performed additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments between Bcl2l10 and various C-terminus deletion mutants of IRBIT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As expected, the 104 first amino acids of IRBIT (IRBIT 1–104) were not able to interact with Bcl2l10. Similarly, IRBIT 1–138, which contains a coiled-coil domain, did not interact with Bcl2l10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>). However, we detected a faint interaction between IRBIT 1–169 and Bcl2l10, whereas IRBIT 1–201 and 1–231 interacted strongly with Bcl2l10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>).</p><p>In combination, these results showed that Bcl2l10, through its BH4 domain, interacted with amino acids 138–201 of IRBIT, with residues 169–201 being of particular importance. This portion of IRBIT alone do not bind IP<sub>3</sub>R, indicating that Bcl2l10–IRBIT interaction did not rely on IRBIT binding to IP<sub>3</sub>R. This observation is confirmed by the fact that Bcl2l10 could interact with the non-phosphorylatable mutant IRBIT S68A.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>IRBIT and Bcl2l10 colocalize at ER membranes and belong to the same protein complex in MAM</title><p>As IRBIT and Bcl2l10 interact together and with IP<sub>3</sub>R, we then investigated whether these three proteins can associate to form protein complex in vivo. We first analyzed the subcellular localization of IRBIT and Bcl2l10 to confirm that they colocalize. Subcellular fractionation performed on HeLa cells revealed that IRBIT was present in the cytosol, at the ER, and at the crude mitochondria. This last fraction contains the pure mitochondria and the mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). IRBIT localized only into MAMs and is not found in pure mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Bcl2l10 is found at the ER and in the crude mitochondria. However, unlike other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bcl2l10 was not detectable in the pure mitochondria fraction and was only present in MAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This revealed that Bcl2l10 is an uncommon antiapoptotic protein that exerts its function only at the ER, thereby suggesting that its main mechanism of action may be to regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. In this regard, MAMs play a central role in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent apoptosis because it is in this compartment that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is directly transferred from the ER to the mitochondria via a protein complex containing IP<sub>3</sub>R and VDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Szabadkai et al., 2006</xref>). We then investigated whether Bcl2l10 and IRBIT belong to this protein complex, as both proteins localized into MAMs. For this purpose, we analyzed a crude mitochondrial fraction by 2D blue-native SDS-PAGE. By performing a western blot on the second dimension SDS-PAGE, we identified a protein complex that contains IP<sub>3</sub>R, VDAC, IRBIT, and Bcl2l10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), suggesting that these proteins associate in the native state.</p><p>IRBIT and Bcl2l10 then colocalized at the ER membrane, and in particular in MAMs, where they formed a protein complex with IP<sub>3</sub>R and VDAC.

To address this, we compared the apoptosis sensitivity of wild type (WT) HeLa cells with IRBIT KO HeLa cells generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Given the localization of IRBIT and Bcl2l10, we focused on Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and ER-stress-induced apoptosis. Cells were then treated with either 1 µM staurosporine (STS), a potent apoptosis inducer that notably triggers mitochondrial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prudent et al., 2015</xref>), or with the ER-stress inducer tunicamycin (TUN at 20 µM) , which also mediates apoptosis by inducing a strong elevation of the mitochondrial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deniaud et al., 2008</xref>). Cell death was assessed by active-Caspase-3 staining, and we surprisingly found that IRBIT KO renders cells more resistant to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

In particular, IRBIT interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R requires phosphorylation of the residues Ser68, Ser71, Ser74, and Ser77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2006</xref>). As IP<sub>3</sub>R plays a central role in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jayaraman and Marks, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Szalai et al., 1999</xref>), we then investigated whether the modulation of IRBIT–IP<sub>3</sub>R interaction can account for IRBIT involvement in cell death. To address this question, we analyzed the phosphorylation of IRBIT during apoptosis. The lysate of HeLa cells treated with either 1 µM STS for 6 hr or 20 µM TUN for 24 hr and was analyzed by Western blot using two antibodies specific for phospho-IRBIT (S68p/S71p and S74p/S77p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ando et al., 2009</xref>). The ratio between the intensities of the phospho-IRBIT and IRBIT bands was calculated and compared to the ratio of the control (DMSO treatment) to obtain the relative phosphorylation of S68/S71 and S74/77. Using this approach, we determined that following apoptosis induced by staurosporine or tunicamycin, IRBIT phosphorylation on Ser68, Ser71, Ser74, and S77 was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). This suggests that IRBIT's function, and notably its effect on IP<sub>3</sub>R, may be modified during apoptosis. This result also raises the question of whether dephosphorylation of IRBIT is an early event that may participate in the induction of apoptosis or if it is merely a consequence of cell death. We then analyzed IRBIT phosphorylation after a short treatment with STS (0.5, 1 or 1.5 hr) or TUN (4, 6 or 8 hr). At these incubation times, apoptosis was not achieved, as shown by the absence of cleaved-PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, as early as 30 min after STS treatment or 4 hr after TUN treatment, phosphorylation of Ser68, Ser71, Ser74, and Ser77 was already significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>), suggesting that dephosphorylation of IRBIT may actually participate in the induction of apoptosis.</p><p>Next, we assumed that IRBIT dephosphorylation occurring in apoptosis may reduce its interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R, following which the subcellular localization of IRBIT is modified. We analyzed the subcellular localization of IRBIT as well as of Bcl2l10, following apoptosis induction by 1 µM staurosporine for 4 hr or 20 µM tunicamycin for 24 hr. As expected, in cells treated with these drugs, IRBIT localization at the ER and in MAMs was greatly reduced, whereas total IRBIT expression was constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We could not detect an increased amount of cytosolic IRBIT, probably because IRBIT is mainly a cytosolic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ando et al., 2015</xref>) and because the quantity of protein displaced from ER membranes is not sufficient to modify the amount of IRBIT in the cytosol markedly. Interestingly, we determined that displacement of IRBIT from ER and MAMs was correlated with a reduction of Bcl2l10 in these compartments, particularly in MAMs, and with an elevation of Bcl2l10 in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>As unphosphorylated IRBIT interacts with Bcl2l10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) but not with IP<sub>3</sub>R, these results suggest that after its dephosphorylation at the onset of apoptosis, unphosphorylated IRBIT could remove Bcl2l10 from ER membranes and displace it to the cytosol. Removal of IRBIT and Bcl2l10 from MAMs could consequently facilitate proapoptotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to the mitochondria, thereby explaining how IRBIT could promote cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>IRBIT KO abolishes the effect of apoptosis-inducing drugs on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling</title><p>To validate this hypothesis, we investigated whether apoptotic stresses does indeed promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from ER to mitochondria and whether IRBIT is involved in this process. First, HeLa cells were treated, for a short period, with either 1 µM STS (30 min) or 20 µM TUN (4 hr) and their IICR (induced by 1 µM ATP) was subsequently analyzed. At this early time point, IRBIT is dephosphorylated but apoptosis has not yet occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2009</xref>), STS and TUN treatment of WT cells significantly increased the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> released through IP<sub>3</sub>R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). STS treatment also slightly increased basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, but this cannot account for the drug's effect on IICR. As expected, in the control condition (DMSO), IRBIT KO cells had increased IICR compared to WT cells. However, in IRBIT KO cells, the effect of STS and TUN on the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>from the ER was greatly attenuated; in these cells STS had only a slight effect on IICR whereas TUN did not significantly modify it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>).

We first examined the interaction of Bcl2l10 with IP<sub>3</sub>R in the presence or absence of unphosphorylated IRBIT. For this purpose, extracts of HeLa cells expressing Bcl2l10 and IRBIT S68A alone or in combination were subjected to GST-pulldown with recombinant GST-IP<sub>3</sub>R∆CD. As expected, IRBIT S68A did not interact with IP<sub>3</sub>R whereas Bcl2l10 did. However, coexpression of IRBIT S68A markedly reduced the interaction of Bcl2l10 with IP<sub>3</sub>R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To confirm this result, a GST-pulldown assay was performed using recombinant GST-IP<sub>3</sub>BD incubated with recombinant Bcl2l10 in combination with phosphorylated recombinant IRBIT (produced in Sf9 cells) and/or with unphosphorylated recombinant IRBIT (produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2006</xref>).

As expected, Bcl2l10 alone significantly reduced IICR following treatment with 1 µM ATP, whereas IRBIT S68A alone had no effect on IICR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, when these two proteins were coexpressed, we found that Bcl2l10 lost its effect on IICR, as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak was similar to that observed in the absence of Bcl2l10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). As IRBIT S68A may displace endogenous Bcl2l10 from ER membranes, the fact that its overexpression alone does not affect IICR was surprising. One reason might be that, in the condition used, the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from the ER was high and masked the effect of Bcl2l10 removal from ER membranes. We then overexpressed IRBIT S68A in HeLa IRBIT KO cells , which exhibit weaker Ca<sup>2+</sup> release following treatment with 1 µM ATP. In these conditions, expression of IRBIT S68A increased IICR to the same extent as Bcl2l10 knockdown, while basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Bcl2l10 knockdown using siRNA was confirmed by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results support the idea that dephosphorylation of IRBIT may have an inhibitory effect on Bcl2l10.</p><p>Finally, we examined whether unphosphorylated IRBIT affects the antiapoptotic function of Bcl2l10. HeLa cells expressing Bcl2l10 alone or in combination with IRBIT S68A were treated with 1 µM staurosporine for 6 hr or with 20 µM tunicamycin for 24 hr, and cell death was assessed by staining of active Caspase-3. The overexpression of Bcl2l10 reduced cell death because it is an antiapoptotic protein. However, consistent with our previous results, Bcl2l10 was no longer able to protect cells from apoptosis when coexpressed with IRBIT S68A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that unphosphorylated IRBIT acts as an inhibitor of Bcl2l10.</p><p>Consequently, all of these results strongly reinforce our model in which dephosphorylation of IRBIT during initiation of apoptosis promotes Bcl2l10 displacement from ER membranes by inhibiting the interaction of Bcl2l10 with IP<sub>3</sub>R. As a consequence, as suggested by our results, Bcl2l10 may no longer be able to regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, and to exert its antiapoptotic activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>IRBIT promotes ER-mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer and the formation of contact points</title><p>Our results suggest that, during apoptosis, IRBIT may facilitate the transfer of Ca<sup>2+</sup> between ER and mitochondria in paticular by inhibiting Bcl2l10. This mechanism should notably occur in MAMs because IRBIT and Bcl2l10 are removed from this compartment, where proapoptotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals aiming at mitochondria are usually generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giorgi et al., 2009</xref>), during apoptosis. To further decipher the role of IRBIT in MAMs, we then examined the extent to which this protein can influence Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux between ER and mitochondria by comparing ER-mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between WT and IRBIT KO MEF cells. In these experiments, cells were treated with 20 µM ATP to induce a massive Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, the transfer of which to mitochondria can be easily detected. Under these conditions, as shown by the measurement of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels with Fura-2, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER was greater in IRBIT KO cells than in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which is consistent with the previously described effect of IRBIT on IICR.

We then studied the status of ER-mitochondria contact in IRBIT KO HeLa cells using electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). This analysis revealed that, in IRBIT KO cells, the percentage of mitochondria in contact with ER was less than that in WT cells. Moreover, although the average distance between ER and mitochondria at contact points was similar in the WT and IRBIT KO cells, the average length of contact points was significantly shorter in IRBIT KO cells. Accordingly, in IRBIT KO cells, contact points longer than 600 nm barely existed, whereas those shorter than 200 nm were frequent. By contrast, in WT cells, contact points shorter than 200 nm were rarely found, and those longer than 600 nm were frequent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These results suggest that IRBIT may participate in the formation or stabilization of ER-mitochondria contact points. To further support this observation, we stained the ER and mitochondria of HeLa and MEF cells, and we estimated the colocalization between the two organelles using the Mander’s overlap coefficient and the Pearson coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>). As expected, in HeLa IRBIT KO cells and in MEF IRBIT KO cells, colocalization between ER and mitochondria was reduced compared to that in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Expression of IRBIT in IRBIT KO cells increased colocalization coefficients to levels similar to those of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These results support the idea that IRBIT is involved in the formation or stabilization of ER-mitochondria contact points. As IP<sub>3</sub>R is a key component of MAMs and as IRBIT interacts with it, we next examined whether this interaction may account for the role of IRBIT in contact points. Interestingly, expression of IRBIT S68A (which cannot bind IP<sub>3</sub>R) in IRBIT KO cells failed to restore ER-mitochondria contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), suggesting that the interaction between IRBIT and IP<sub>3</sub>R may be involved in the formation of contact points.</p><p>Considered collectively, these results led us to construct the model described below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). IRBIT promotes ER-mitochondria contact points, thereby facilitating Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to the mitochondria. In the absence of stress, this is counterbalanced by the interaction between IRBIT and Bcl2l10 that controls the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> released through IP<sub>3</sub>R and allows the correct Ca<sup>2+</sup> traffic between ER and mitochondria. However, under a stress condition, dephosphorylation of IRBIT induces the displacement of both this protein and Bcl2l10 from ER membranes. This translocation likely favors proapoptotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from the ER to the mitochondria, which is facilitated by the close proximity between the organelles promoted by IRBIT. By contrast, in IRBIT KO cells, the lack of IRBIT leads to reduced ER-mitochondria contact; Bcl2l10 may also be more abundant in MAMs and no longer displaced during apoptosis. This may avoid proapoptotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between ER and mitochondria, thereby explaining the resistance of these cells to apoptosis.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19896.012</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic model depicting the role of IRBIT-Bcl2l10 interplay in physiological and stress conditions.</title><p>In physiological conditions, in WT cells, IRBIT promotes ER-mitochondria contact rendering Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer easier between the two organelles.

In IRBIT KO cells, the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup>that is released through IP<sub>3</sub>R is increased due to absence of IRBIT, but Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to the mitochondria is reduced because of the great reduction of ER-mitochondria contact. Following an apoptotic stimuli, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER is increased.

These two proteins interact with the same domain of IP<sub>3</sub>R; but while IRBIT interacts with the IP<sub>3</sub>-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2006</xref>), Nrz, the zebrafish ortholog of Bcl2l10, has been shown to interact with different residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonneau et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings confirm that IRBIT and Bcl2l10 have different binding sites in the IP<sub>3</sub>-binding domain, and demonstrate the existence of a Bcl2l10-IRBIT complex on IP<sub>3</sub>R. The BH4 domain of Bcl2l10 is involved in the interaction with IRBIT and IP<sub>3</sub>R, but two distinct portions of IRBIT mediate the interactions with Bcl2l10 and IP<sub>3</sub>R. The IP<sub>3</sub>BD is structured as a cleft at the end of which the IP<sub>3</sub>-binding pocket is found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bosanac et al., 2002)</xref>. The N-terminal part of IRBIT (residues 1–104) is probably buried in the IP<sub>3</sub>BD where it interacts with the IP<sub>3</sub>-binding pocket. We assume that the rest of the protein projects toward the outside of the cleft, where Bcl2l10 is located. This allows residues 169–201 of IRBIT to bind the BH4 domain of Bcl2l10, which is structured in an α-helix; therefore, we can hypothesize that one side of the helix interacts with IP<sub>3</sub>R whereas the other interacts with IRBIT. This association between IRBIT and Bcl2l10 may stabilize their interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R, thus increasing their effect on IICR.</p><p>IRBIT dephosphorylation at the onset of apoptosis appears to participate actively in the execution of cell death. IRBIT possesses a protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) binding site upstream of its serine-rich region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), between residues 40 and 44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devogelaere et al., 2007</xref>). This binding site has been shown to dephosphorylate the Ser68 residue, but not residues Ser71, Ser74, and Ser 77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devogelaere et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, PP1 was shown to mediate apoptosis via dephosphorylation of Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thayyullathil et al., 2011</xref>) and pRb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puntoni and Villa-Moruzzi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, PP1 can dephosphorylate and activate the BH3-only protein Bad to induce apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ayllón et al., 2000</xref>). Finally, the inhibition of PP1 has been reported to protect cardiomyocytes from tunicamycin-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). All of these studies have highlighted the role of PP1 in the induction of apoptosis, and we can then speculate that IRBIT is a target of PP1 at the onset of apoptosis. However, although dephosphorylation of Ser68 by PP1 may prevent further phosphorylation of Ser71, Ser74, and Ser77, it is unlikely that PP1 by itself accounts for the dephosphorylation of these residues observed during apoptosis. Sequence analysis of IRBIT revealed the existence of a LxVP motif between residues 271 and 274, which is a binding site of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rodríguez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Slupe et al., 2013</xref>). Calcineurin plays a role in apoptosis;notably , it participates in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent apoptosis by activating the BH3-only protein Bad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 1999</xref>) and by promoting Drp-1 translocation to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cereghetti et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2010</xref>). Further experiments should be performed to study the ability of calcineurin to dephosphorylate IRBIT, but it is likely that the combined action of PP1 and calcineurin is responsible for IRBIT dephosphorylation during apoptosis.</p><p>During apoptosis, IRBIT appears to function by displacing Bcl2l10 from ER membranes, thus inhibiting its antiapoptotic function. However, given that IRBIT interacts with numerous other partners, we cannot exclude a contribution of one of these interactions in apoptosis. In particular, the interaction of IRBIT with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIα (CamKIIα) may also play a role in apoptosis. Indeed, IRBIT was shown to inhibit CamKIIα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawaai et al., 2015</xref>), which possesses a pro-survival effect, as it notably promotes Bcl-2 expression and inhibits caspase-2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nutt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Song et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wei et al., 2013</xref>). In this regard, inhibition of CamKII was reported to promote apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, as for Bcl2l10, the interaction between CamKII and IRBIT does not depend on IRBIT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawaai et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, in addition to its effect on Bcl2l10, IRBIT dephosphorylation during apoptosis may favor its interaction with CamKII, as it could no longer interact with the majority of its other partners. The increased interaction of IRBIT with CamKII may lead to CamKII inhibition and thus to the promotion of apoptosis.</p><p>IRBIT appears to participate in the formation or the stabilization of the contact points between ER and mitochondria. To date, the mechanisms governing the formation of these structures remain largely unknown. Our results suggest that the interaction between IRBIT and IP<sub>3</sub>R may mediate the effect of IRBIT on ER-mitochondria contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This result was quite unexpected, as IP<sub>3</sub>R does not appear to be required for ER-mitochondria contact. Indeed, KO of the three IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms in DT40 cells was reported to have no effect on the frequency and length of contact points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Csordás et al., 2006</xref>). Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), a GTPase involved in mitochondrial fusion, is acknowledged to be the key player in the establishment of ER-mitochondria contact, as its KO has been reported to greatly affect both the formation of MAMs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between the two organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>). However, this requirement of Mfn2 is now being reconsidered, as two independent studies concluded that Mfn2 KO actually increases contact between ER and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cosson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Filadi et al., 2015</xref>). At the light of this controversy, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the role of IP<sub>3</sub>R in the formation of MAMs has been overlooked, in particular when we take into account the fact that IP<sub>3</sub>R is part, together with Grp75 and VDAC, of a complex which physically links ER and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Szabadkai et al., 2006</xref>). It is highly likely that this complex is the same as that containing IRBIT and Bcl2l10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Although Grp75 knockdown altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer between ER and mitochondria, the role of the IP<sub>3</sub>R-VDAC complex in ER-mitochondria contact has not been clearly investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Szabadkai et al., 2006</xref>). Additional experiments to reassess the role of this complex and of IP<sub>3</sub>R in the formation of MAMs may facilitate further understanding of how IRBIT is involved in ER-mitochondria contact. An additional possibility is that IRBIT interacts with different partners in MAMs. Indeed, numerous proteins, such as the Fis1-Bap31 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iwasawa et al., 2011</xref>), PERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verfaillie et al., 2012</xref>), the VAPB-PTPIP51 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stoica et al., 2014</xref>), and Drp-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prudent et al., 2015</xref>) have been shown to localize in MAMs and to regulate ER-mitochondria contact. IRBIT could then associate with some of these proteins to form a tethering complex between ER and mitochondria.</p><p>The fact that IRBIT S68A failed to promote ER-mitochondria contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) raises the question of the impact of IRBIT dephosphorylation on contact point stability during apoptosis. Indeed, it can be speculated that IRBIT removal from MAM during apoptosis may phenocopy IRBIT KO and reduce ER-mitochondria contact, thereby decreasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to the mitochondria instead of increasing it. However several studies have shown that ER-mitochondria contacts increase during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Csordás et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verfaillie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prudent et al., 2015</xref>). In particular, Drp-1 is recruited in ER-mitochondria contact points during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prudent et al., 2015</xref>) and PERK may also be recruited as its KO abolishes the increase of ER-mitochondria contact points during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verfaillie et al., 2012</xref>). Our hypothesis, therefore, is that prior to apoptosis, phosphorylated IRBIT promotes ER-mitochondria contact and thus sets up a platform for proper apoptosis. Following the induction of apoptosis, IRBIT is dephosphorylated and translocated into the cytosol, but other proteins such as Drp-1 or PERK are also recruited to MAMs to strengthen ER-mitochondria contact and then compensate IRBIT removal. In IRBIT KO cells, these proteins are probably still recruited, but as ER-mitochondria contacts are smaller, increasing these contacts is not sufficient to insure pro-apoptotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer.</p><p>Our present study revealed a new function of IRBIT as a regulator of cell death through its ability to regulate ER-mitochondria contact and Bcl2l10 activity. Interestingly, IRBIT expression was found to be reduced in a human ovarian cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jeong et al., 2012</xref>). As Bcl2l10 is highly expressed in the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guillemin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inohara et al., 1998</xref>), we can assume that the reduction of IRBIT expression in the ovarian cancer cell line leads to an increased activity of Bcl2l10, which may contribute to the usual resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis. Moreover, it was recently shown that IRBIT inhibits ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), an enzyme that provides the dNTP pool for DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arnaoutov and Dasso, 2014</xref>). In cancer cells, high activity of RNR is necessary to supply the dNTPs required for rapid cell proliferation, and increased RNR activity is frequently observed in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aye et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, reduced expression of IRBIT may contribute to resistance to apoptosis due to increased Bcl2l10 activity and reduced ER-mitochondria contact, and additionally to cell proliferation by promoting increased RNR activity. These observations, associated with the fact that IRBIT expression was found to be reduced in cancer cell lines that are resistant to DNA-damging drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wittig et al., 2002</xref>), highlight the key role of IRBIT in tumorigenesis, and may lead to a new definition of IRBIT as a tumor suppressor.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The sequences coding for Bcl2l10 and ∆BH4Bcl2l10 were amplified from pSG5-FLAG-Bcl2l10, a gift from G.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, including Richard S Lewis (Reviewer #1) - who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors – and David Yule (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, Bonneau et al. describe a new role for IRBIT in promoting apoptosis through its interactions with a Bcl2 homolog, Bcl2l10, and the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor. They present evidence that the three proteins form a complex at contact points between the ER and mitochondria, which inhibits IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release more than either Bcl2l10 or IRBIT can do alone. Further results support a proposed model in which apoptotic stimuli lead to dephosphorylation of IRBIT, releasing it and Bcl2l10 from the IP<sub>3</sub>R, and thereby increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from ER to mitochondria and promoting apoptosis. The paper is significant in presenting a mechanism underlying a new role for IRBIT in promoting apoptosis.</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that the paper is of significant interest, the paper is clearly written, and the data are mostly of high quality. However, several of the more important mechanistic conclusions need stronger experimental support. We would be willing to consider a revised version provided it contains new data and analysis that address the following major issues.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Experiments are needed to support the conclusion that dephosphorylated IRBIT controls the effect of endogenous Bcl2l10 on ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and apoptosis. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-E</xref>, overexpression of S68A IRBIT alone fails to affect Ca<sup>2+</sup> release or apoptosis in HeLa cells, which is not consistent with the proposed role of dephosphorylated IRBIT in removing endogenous Bcl2l10 from the IP<sub>3</sub>R. These results raise the possibility that IRBIT only alter the effect of Bcl2l10 when the latter is overexpressed. New data are needed to show that endogenous Bcl2l10 itself affects Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to mitochondria, using Bcl2l10 knockout or knockdown cells. In addition, the lack of effect seen with IRBIT S68A expression on Ca<sup>2+</sup> release needs to be explained; perhaps stimulation with lower [ATP] will help reveal an effect.</p><p>2) The model in which IRBIT promotes apoptosis by removing Bcl2l10 from the IP<sub>3</sub>R and increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from ER to mitochondria cannot easily explain the effects of IRBIT on Tg-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). Tg depletes Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER, preventing prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from ER to mitochondria; therefore, Tg would not be expected to invoke the IRBIT/Bcl2l10/IP<sub>3</sub>R mechanism or be sensitive to ER-mitochondrial contacts. The ability of IRBIT KO to have such a large effect on Tg-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>) suggests critical targets other than the IP<sub>3</sub>R or induction of MAMs are involved. This issue needs to be addressed, as it raises the question of how much of IRBIT's effects on apoptosis are actually due to the Bcl2l10-IP<sub>3</sub>R pathway. To link this mechanism to apoptosis, evidence should be provided that the different stimuli that were used (especially STS and Tun) promote apoptosis specifically by increasing ER-mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer, and that their effects on IRBIT phosphorylation and localization of IRBIT/Bcl2l10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) correlate with apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>3) More data are needed to support a causative rather than correlative link between IRBIT and apoptosis progression. It is important to show that (1) apopotic stimuli enhance ATP-evoked ER-mitochondrial Ca transfer, and that IRBIT KO reduces this effect of apoptotic stimuli; and (2) release of IRBIT/Bcl2l10 is causally connected to enhanced apoptosis. #2 may be achieved using a mutant IRBIT that cannot be dephosphorylated (e.g., a phosphomimetic mutant), which would be predicted to stay associated with IP<sub>3</sub>R and reduce the effect of apoptotic stimuli on Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to mitochondria.</p><p>4) To rigorously justify many of the important conclusions of the paper, changes in protein abundance or location as inferred from western blots need to be quantified. Band densities, number of repetitions, and statistical analyses should be shown. This applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B, 4G</xref>, and 5A-B.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> release experiments were carried out in MEF IRBIT KO cells, which indeed exhibit a strong Ca<sup>2+</sup> release following ATP treatment. We then investigated the effect of IRBIT S68A in HeLa IRBIT KO cells, which show weaker Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Using these cells, we found that overexpression of IRBIT S68A alone increases IICR to the same extent as Bcl2l10 knockdown using siRNA. We believe that these data support the conclusion that dephosphorylated IRBIT controls the effect of endogenous Bcl2l10 on ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. These data have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and 6F</xref>) and text related to these panels has been added to the second paragraph of the subsection “Unphosphorylated IRBIT inhibits Bcl2l10 function at the ER”.</p><p>Regarding the lack of effect of IRBIT S68A on apoptosis, these experiments have been carried out in HeLa cells containing endogenous IRBIT. It was previously proposed that the endogenous level of phosphorylated IRBIT may be high enough to saturate the interaction with IP<sub>3</sub>R as overexpression of IRBIT in cells containing endogenous IRBIT has no effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (see Ando et al., Mol Cell, 2006). So, in a similar manner, it is possible that the pool of endogenous IRBIT, which is dephosphorylated during apoptosis, is sufficient to remove the large majority of Bcl2l10 from ER membranes and then favors apoptosis. Overexpressing IRBIT S68A in these conditions may not have a significant effect on endogenous Bcl2l10 removal and then on apoptosis.</p><p><italic>2) The model in which IRBIT promotes apoptosis by removing Bcl2l10 from the</italic> IP<sub>3</sub>R <italic>and increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from ER to mitochondria cannot easily explain the effects of IRBIT on Tg-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). Tg depletes Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER, preventing prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from ER to mitochondria; therefore, Tg would not be expected to invoke the IRBIT/Bcl2l10/</italic>IP<sub>3</sub>R <italic>mechanism or be sensitive to ER-mitochondrial contacts. The ability of IRBIT KO to have such a large effect on Tg-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>) suggests critical targets other than the</italic> IP<sub>3</sub>R <italic>or induction of MAMs are involved. This issue needs to be addressed, as it raises the question of how much of IRBIT's effects on apoptosis are actually due to the Bcl2l10-</italic>IP<sub>3</sub>R <italic>pathway. To link this mechanism to apoptosis, evidence should be provided that the different stimuli that were used (especially STS and Tun) promote apoptosis specifically by increasing ER-mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer, and that their effects on IRBIT phosphorylation and localization of IRBIT/Bcl2l10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) correlate with apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</italic> </p><p>Reviewers raised here a very important point. We agree that Tg depletes Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER and then we can consider that Tg-dependent apoptosis does not rely on ER-mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer.</p><p>However, it has been shown that inhibiting IP<sub>3</sub>R attenuates Tg-dependent apoptosis whereas IP<sub>3</sub>R stimulation accelerates Tg-dependent apoptosis (Luciani et al., Diabetes 2009 Feb; 58(2): 422-432). Thus, IP<sub>3</sub>R seems to play a role in cell death following Tg treatment a role and releasing Bcl2l10 from IP<sub>3</sub>R may then facilitate it. However, we agree that ER-mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup>transfer is probably not the most important trigger of Tg-dependent apoptosis.</p><p>On the other hand, Bcl2l10 was reported to interact with Bik and Bax (Rautureau et al., Cell Death Dis. 2012 Dec 13;3:e443.). Bik is a BH3-only protein which is localized at the ER thanks to a TM domain (Germain et al., 2002 May 17;277(20):18053-60). Bax can also localize to the ER where it induces apoptosis (Nutt et al., J Biol Chem. 2002 Jun 7;277(23):20301-8; Zong et al., J Cell Biol. 2003 Jul 7;162(1):59-69). Of note, Bik is involved in Bax recruitment to the ER (Mathai et al., J Biol Chem. 2005 Jun 24;280(25):23829-36). Interestingly, Bik is required for Tg-induced cell death (Lopez et al., Cell Death Differ. 2012 Sep;19(9):1459-69) and Tg promotes Bax dimerization at the ER which induces subsequent apoptosis (Zong et al., J Cell Biol. 2003 Jul 7;162(1):59-69).</p><p>Then after Tg treatment IRBIT dephosphorylation and subsequent removal of Bcl2l10 from ER membranes may promote Bik and Bax activity at the ER as Bcl2l10 is no longer present to interact with and inhibit these pro-apoptotic proteins.</p><p>This mechanism could explain the effect of IRBIT KO on Tg-induced cell death and the effect of Tg on IRBIT phosphorylation and IRBIT/Bcl2l10 localization. However, as we have not yet experimental proofs to support this model and for clarity reasons we decided to remove all data related to Thapsigargin from the manuscript and to focus on STS and Tunicamycin. Then as requested, we checked that these stimuli have a similar effect on IRBIT phosphorylation and localization of IRBIT/Bcl2l10. Thus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> has been changed accordingly. Moreover, we correlated this with apoptosis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Finally, we analyzed mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> with Rhod-2 after STS and TUN treatment and we found that these stimuli significantly increase mitochondrial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] whereas this effect is greatly attenuated in IRBIT KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). All together these new results show that STS and TUN acts on IRBIT and Bcl2l10 and promotes Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to mitochondria.</p><p><italic>3) More data are needed to support a causative rather than correlative link between IRBIT and apoptosis progression. It is important to show that (1) apopotic stimuli enhance ATP-evoked ER-mitochondrial Ca transfer, and that IRBIT KO reduces this effect of apoptotic stimuli; and (2) release of IRBIT/Bcl2l10 is causally connected to enhanced apoptosis. #2 may be achieved using a mutant IRBIT that cannot be dephosphorylated (e.g., a phosphomimetic mutant), which would be predicted to stay associated with</italic> IP<sub>3</sub>R <italic>and reduce the effect of apoptotic stimuli on Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to mitochondria.</italic> </p><p>1) Experiments showing that STS and TUN treatment enhance ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in WT cells have been performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B and C</xref>). We also show in these figures that this effect of STS and TUN is significantly reduces in IRBIT KO cells. Moreover, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, we no show that IRBIT KO also greatly decreases elevation of mitochondrial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] consecutive to STS and TUN treatment. These new data indicate that IRBIT play a key role in apoptosis progression by facilitating ER-mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer.</p><p>2) We generated several phosphomimetic mutants (mutations of Ser to Glu or Asp) of IRBIT to address this question. However, all the mutants generated failed to bind to the IP<sub>3</sub>BD of IP<sub>3</sub>R (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>). Phosphorylation of IRBIT required for the binding with IP<sub>3</sub>R occurs in an intrinsically disordered region (Ando et al., PLoS One. 2015 Oct 28;10(10):e0141569) and sequential phosphorylation of IRBIT may then be important to structure this region. Adding negative charge to mimic phosphorylation may then fail to reproduce the effect of phosphorylation. Then despite our effort, we were not able to conduct experiments which can answer this question.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19896.013</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Western blot of GST-pulldown performed with GST-IP<sub>3</sub>BD on lysates of HeLa cells expressing FLAG-IRBIT (WT) or FLAG-tagged mutants of IRBIT.</title><p>Mutations: SDDD: S71D, S74D and S77D; ADDD: S68A, S71D, S74D and S77D; DDDD: S68D, S71D, S74D and S77D; EDDD: S68E, S71D, S74D and S77D.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19896.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19896.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19896-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>4) To rigorously justify many of the important conclusions of the paper, changes in protein abundance or location as inferred from western blots need to be quantified.
