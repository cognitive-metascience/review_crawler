Despite its importance, the temporal control of cMT formation remains poorly understood. Here we show that unlike the best-studied yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, position of pre-anaphase nucleus is not strongly biased toward bud neck in <italic>Ogataea polymorpha</italic> and the regulation of spindle positioning becomes active only shortly before anaphase. This is likely due to the unstable property of cMTs compared to those in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Furthermore, we show that cMT nucleation/anchoring is restricted at the level of recruitment of the γ-tubulin complex receptor, Spc72, to spindle pole body (SPB), which is regulated by the polo-like kinase Cdc5. Additionally, electron microscopy revealed that the cytoplasmic side of SPB is structurally different between G1 and anaphase. Thus, polo-like kinase dependent recruitment of γ-tubulin receptor to SPBs determines the timing of spindle orientation in <italic>O. polymorpha.</italic></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24340.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Before a cell divides, it needs to duplicate its genetic material to provide the new daughter cell with a full set of genetic information. To do so, the cell forms a complex of proteins called the spindle apparatus, which is made up of string-like microtubules that divide the chromosomes evenly. In many organisms, the position of the spindle determines where in the cell this separation happens.</p><p>However, in baker’s yeast, the location where the cell will divide is determined well before the spindle is formed. Unlike many other eukaryotic cells, these yeast cells divide asymmetrically and create buds that will form the new daughter cells. The position of this bud determines where the spindle should be located and where the chromosomes separate.</p><p>The spindle itself is then organised by a structure called the spindle pole body, which connects to microtubules inside the cell nucleus and microtubules in the cell plasma. Several proteins control where and how the spindle forms, including a protein called the spindle pole component 72, or Spc72 for short, and an enzyme called Cdc5. However, until now it was unclear how spindle formation is timed and controlled in other yeast species.</p><p>Now, Maekawa et al. have used fluorescent markers and time lapse microscopy to examine how the spindle forms in the yeast species <italic>Ogataea polymorpha</italic>, an important industrial yeast used to produce medicines and alcohol. The results show that in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>, the positioning and orientation of the spindle only occurred very late in the cell cycle and the microtubules in the cell plasma remained unstable until the chromosomes were about to separate. This was linked to changes in the level of Spc72, which increased at the spindle pole body before the chromosomes separated and then dropped again. This was controlled by Cdc5.</p><p>Understanding when and where microtubules are formed is an important step in understanding how cells divide. This is the first example of a budding yeast that creates new microtubules in the cell plasma every time the cell divides. Unravelling the molecular differences between yeast species could lead to new ways to optimise the use of industrial yeasts like <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>, or to combat disease-causing ones.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd><italic>Ogataea polymorpha</italic></kwd><kwd>cytoplasmic microtubules</kwd><kwd>polo-like kinase</kwd><kwd>spindle pole body</kwd><kwd>Spc72</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP24570214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maekawa</surname><given-names>Hiromi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Schi 295/4-3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schiebel</surname><given-names>Elmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PE1883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>Gislene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>Gislene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>Gislene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007802</institution-id><institution>Institute for Fermentation, Osaka</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>the Endowed Chair Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaneko</surname><given-names>Yoshinobu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cdc5-dependent SPB regulation is linked to delayed cytoplasmic microtubule organization in <italic>Ogataea polymorpha</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Segregation of sister chromatids into two daughter cells is pivotal to the proliferation of eukaryotic cells. Chromosome segregation is followed by cytokinesis, which results in physical separation of two daughter cells. In many organisms, the position of the mitotic spindle dictates the site of cytokinesis, which ensures the inheritance and maintenance of genomic information in the daughter cells. Astral microtubules or cytoplasmic microtubules (cMTs), which emanate from the spindle poles and extend to the cell cortex, have a principle role in positioning and orienting the spindle with respect to the polarity cues of the cell type. Mechanisms governing the spindle positioning/orientation have been studied in a number of systems. However, regulations that determine the timing of establishing the spindle orientation, or the position of the centrosome, the primary MT organizing centre (MTOC), in interphase, are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiyomitsu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Woyke et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Spindle positioning is of particular importance in the budding yeast S<italic>accharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> where the cleavage site is determined at the start of the cell cycle independently of the position of the mitotic spindle. Therefore, cells position the pre-anaphase spindle close to the bud neck and orient it along the mother-bud axis. As the spindle elongates in anaphase, one spindle pole translocates into the bud to accomplish segregation of one set of chromosomes into the daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pereira and Yamashita, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Markus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Winey and Bloom, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the nuclear positioning and spindle orientation are regulated by two redundant pathways acting on cMTs, the Kar9 and dynein pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller and Rose, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Winey and Bloom, 2012</xref>). Concomitant deletions in components of both pathways result in lethality, whereas loss of one pathway can be compensated by the function of the other with moderate spindle orientation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller and Rose, 1998</xref>). Survival of single deletion mutants largely relies on the function of the spindle orientation checkpoint (SPOC) that retains cells in anaphase until the spindle orientation is corrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caydasi and Pereira, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, MTs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are organized exclusively from the spindle pole body (SPB), which is the functional equivalent of animal centrosome. The SPB is a multilayered cylindrical organelle that is embedded in the nuclear envelope (NE) throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byers and Goetsch, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byers and Goetsch, 1975</xref> )The outer plaque faces the cytoplasm and nucleates cMTs, whereas the inner plaque is inside the nucleus and organizes the nuclear MTs. The central plaque anchors and interconnects the outer and inner plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Toole et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaspersen and Winey, 2004</xref>). In G1 phase, some fractions of the cMTs are organized from a modified region of the NE associated with one side of the SPB known as the half-bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byers and Goetsch, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byers and Goetsch, 1975</xref>). Spc72, a γ-tubulin complex (γ-TuSC) receptor, is required for nucleating MTs at both the outer plaque and the half-bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knop and Schiebel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wigge et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Souès and Adams, 1998</xref>). Localisation of Spc72 at the outer plaque is mediated by binding to Nud1, whereas Kar1 serves as a G1 specific binding site of Spc72 at the half-bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pereira et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruneberg et al., 2000</xref>). Spc72 also has a structural role as an integral part of the outer layer and as such localisation of Spc72 to the SPB and the ability to nucleate cMTs persist through the entire cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shaw et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pereira et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kosco et al., 2001</xref>). Importantly, Spc72, and hence cMTs, is not recruited for the formation of the SPB. New SPB acquires Spc72 and cMTs after the formation of a 1 µm long spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shaw et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Segal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the γ-tubulin complexes, Spc72 exerts a role in recruiting several other proteins to SPBs including Stu2, a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) of the XMAP215/Dis1 family, the SPOC kinase Kin4, as well as polo-like kinase Cdc5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Usui et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Snead et al., 2007</xref>). Cdc5 regulates multiple cellular functions including SPB duplication, progression through G2/M phase, promoting mitotic exit, and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shirayama et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Song and Lee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archambault and Glover, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elserafy et al., 2014</xref>). Cdc5 is also involved in the regulation of spindle orientation in pre-anaphase and migration of the anaphase spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Snead et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 2008</xref>). Although Spc72 becomes highly phosphorylated during mitosis in a Cdc5-dependent manner, it is unclear whether this phosphorylation has a regulatory effect on Spc72 and/or cMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Snead et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanisms that control spindle orientation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have been well established. However, other species that employ the budding mode of cell division may have adopted different strategies. In the pathogenic yeast <italic>Candida albicans,</italic> the nucleus is located away from the bud neck in pre-anaphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finley et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>C. albicans</italic> and probably some of other species in Saccharomycotena may therefore have different mechanisms and regulations in this fundamental biological process.</p><p><italic>Ogataea polymorpha</italic> (previously <italic>Hansenula polymorpha</italic>) is extensively used in industrial biotechnology, for the production of various pharmaceuticals in particular for its advantageous characteristics including methylotrophy, nitrate assimilation, availability of strong promoters, and low amount of secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gellissen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stöckmann et al., 2009</xref> ). Another attractive property of <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> is its thermotolerant nature (up to approximately 50°C), which may reduce the cost of cooling in, for instance, bioethanol production that requires the treatment of raw materials at high temperature prior to fermentation. However, despite its importance, cell biology research on this organism remains limited. A better understanding of the molecular physiology of <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> is beneficial towards improving the abilities and characteristics of this yeast for a wide variety of applications.</p><p>Here, we describe cMT organization and its regulation during the cell cycle of the methylotrophic yeast <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>. Unlike <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the pre-anaphase spindle is not readily positioned and oriented in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> owing to the poorly organized cMTs at early cell cycle stages. The bottleneck of cMT nucleation/anchoring at SPBs occurs at the level of Spc72 recruitment to the SPBs, for which the polo-like kinase Cdc5 plays a crucial role. Consistent with the cell cycle dependent activity of cMTs, SPB structure also undergoes cell cycle dependent modification. Thus, our study shed light on the divergent nature of the temporal control of the cMT formation in yeast species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nuclear positioning in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> differs from that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and other budding yeast species</title><p>The nucleus is positioned close to the bud neck in large budded pre-anaphase cells of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The phenotype resembled, but was more exaggerated than, that in <italic>C. albicans</italic> where the nucleus is located with a distance from the bud neck in pre-anaphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finley et al., 2008</xref>). A similar phenotype was observed in species closely related to <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> or <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Close examination of <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> revealed that the nucleus was located in the cell centre in 76.7% of G2/M cells whereas in the remainder of the cells it was off-centred with no bias towards the bud neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that the nuclear position is not determined before anaphase onset in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>. As a consequence, the early stages of anaphase occurred in the mother cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This was further confirmed in cells expressing the α-tubulin gene (Tub1)-GFP and histone H3 gene (Hht1)-mRFP (monomeric red fluorescent protein) to visualize MTs and chromosomal DNA, respectively. Majority of the early anaphase spindles as judged according to their length (&lt;5 µm) as well as a stretched DNA mass were located entirely in the mother cell body (97.4%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, 94.7% of the early anaphase spindles were aligned along the bud-mother axis and almost all of the late anaphase spindles with two segregated DNAs were inserted into the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting immediate and efficient orientation of the spindle during anaphase.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24340.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nuclear positioning in <italic>O. polymorpha.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nucleus is positioned in the cell centre in pre-anaphase cells of <italic>O. polymorpha.

Two SPB signals appeared in some of small/medium budded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, panel c, lower cell), suggesting that SPBs were duplicated at the timing of bud emergence or later, which is similar to that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> although the precise cell cycle stage should be carefully determined. In the rest of small budded cells, one SPB signal was evident until large budded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, panel d). This may be because duplicated SPBs remained in a close proximity and could not be resolved by our fluorescence microscopy. Consistent with this, intensity of Mps3-GFP in medium/large-budded cells with a single SPB was much higher than that in unbudded G1 cells or cells with separated SPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Moreover, SPB in G1 cells as well as small budded cells was not in the defined position within the mother cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Subsequent time lapse analysis revealed that after spindle assembly, ~1 µm long spindles remained at their central positions and loosely oriented toward the bud neck until shortly before anaphase onset (defined by the rapidly increase of pole-to-pole distance) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).

These observation defined cells with 2SPBs in a &lt; 2 µm distance as pre-anaphase cells. Spindle alignment was corrected around the time of (or shortly after) spindle elongation, followed by SPB insertion into the bud. After spindle breakdown, the SPB moved vigorously with no relationship to the polarity axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>O. polymorpha</italic> cells contain only fewer cMTs</title><p>Lack of nuclear positioning and spindle orientation in pre-anaphase cells may indicate a very low number of cMTs at SPBs during this cell cycle window.

To test these possibilities, we performed time lapse experiments with cells expressing <italic>GFP-TUB1</italic>, in which cMTs were observed during 20.6% of the recorded time points although the majority (&gt;80%) did not persist longer than 30 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, cMT persistence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The GFP signal was 2.5 times weaker in cells with a short spindle than in anaphase cells (p&lt;0.001). In contrast, Nud1, which comprises the putative binding site of Spc72 on the outer plaque as suggested by the direct interaction between orthologues of these proteins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, did not show this trend, nor did Sfi1, a half-bridge component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruneberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kilmartin, 2003</xref>). High intensity of Sfi1-GFP signal in S/G2 cells most likely arose from SPBs that were duplicated but not yet separated. These results suggest that Spc72 is cell cycle regulated and the incorporation of Spc72 into SPBs may be the key step to stabilize cMTs. To further confirm this notion, time-lapse microscopy was carried out to determine the timing of Spc72 association with SPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In all cells that progressed into anaphase, an Spc72-GFP signal became detectable &lt;4 min prior to the initiation of anaphase (average 3.68 ± 1.74 min, n = 14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, orange arrowheads). Within 5 min after appearance of the Spc72-GFP signal, spindle orientation was corrected when it had not done already (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, average 3.50 ± 1.61 min, n = 12); therefore, one half part of an anaphase nucleus was successfully inserted into the bud. Thus, Spc72 accumulates at SPB in early mitosis, most likely in metaphase, and remains high during anaphase. As cells exit from mitosis and entre the next cell cycle, Spc72-GFP signal was gradually decreased at SPBs with the timing that varied from cell to cell. This difference of timing may explain the relatively high and variable intensity of Spc72-GFP at SPB in G1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, in all cases, Spc72-GFP levels reached a minimum well before short spindle was formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>If low abundance of Spc72 at the SPB is the reason underlying cMT instability, higher expression of Spc72 might increase the level of Spc72 at the SPB and consequently raise the number of cMTs, and thereby promote positioning the nucleus close to the bud neck at early stages of the cell cycle.

Thus, Spc72 is phosphorylated at multiple sites, only some of which depend on Cdc5.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cdc5 localises to NE and SPB during mitosis</title><p>We next examined the localisation of Cdc5 during the cell cycle. Distinctive localization of Cdc5-GFP became apparent after S phase and was lost prior to or during the following G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nuclear and NE localisation appeared at early stages of the cell cycle and persisted until the end of mitosis. In addition, a fraction of the GFP signals appeared to overlap with those of SPBs during mitosis. Neither NE nor SPB-associated GFP signals were detected in unbudded or small budded cells. Notably, SPB signal may arise from the SPB itself, NE surrounding the SPB, or kinetochores that cluster close to the SPB during interphase and anaphase in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, in order to clarify on which side of SPB the Cdc5-GFP signal resided, we employed structured illumination microscopy (SIM). Localisation was investigated in metaphase-arrested cells with nocodazole where Cdc5-GFP signal was observed at SPB as well as in nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>), and Spc72, and Spc110 were used as references for the cytoplasmic and nuclear side of SPB, respectively. Spc72-GFP and Spc110-tdTomato signals were clearly distinguished in 58% of the cells, which verified that our method could discriminate signals in the cytoplasmic and the nuclear side of SPB in &gt;50% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The resolution of both signals probably depends on the orientation of the SPB (top versus side view). Only the SPB side view will resolve Spc72-GFP and Spc110-tdTomato signals at SPBs. Cdc5-GFP overlapped with Spc110-tdTomato in 53% of cells, which is similar to the degree of co-localisation observed between Spc72 and Spc110. In contrast, the Cdc5-GFP signal overlapped with Spc72-tdTomato in 87% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These results suggest that Cdc5-GFP locates at the position on SPBs closer to Spc72 than to Spc110, indicating that Cdc5-GFP signal arises from the cytoplasmic side of SPB. Thus, Cdc5 likely becomes first localised to the nucleus and the NE in G2, and then in mitosis to the cytoplasmic side of SPBs.

The mechanism to achieve a high-fidelity of chromosome segregation in such a situation has been a focus of interest and has been investigated intensively in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. These process was recently studied in the other ascomycetous yeast <italic>C. albicans</italic> as well as in the yeasts <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> in another phylum of fungi, Basidiomycota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCully and Robinow, 1972a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCully and Robinow, 1972b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kopecká et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Steinberg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Woyke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Straube et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finley et al., 2008</xref>). Although the movement of the nucleus during the cell cycle differs between ascomycetous and basidiomycetous yeasts, it is commonly positioned close to the bud neck in both phyla prior to chromosome segregation. We report here that the ascomycetous yeast <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> does not follow the same strategy. In <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>, the nucleus generally locates centrally within the mother cell body and the spindle is not aligned properly along mother-bud axis until anaphase onset. Consequently, spindle elongation in early anaphase occurs entirely in the mother often with an inappropriate angle against the polarity axis. Despite this potential complication, one nucleus penetrates successfully into the bud during anaphase, which may largely rely on an immediate correction of the orientation of the spindle and on SPOC activity. Those SPB movements are in contrast to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in which spindle is aligned during metaphase and therefore SPB translocation into the bud coincides with spindle elongation. Currently molecular mechanism(s) that regulate spindle orientation is unknown. However, although the timing of spindle orientation relative to cell cycle progression appears to be different from that of other yeasts, two redundant molecular mechanisms of spindle orientation, one requiring dynein and the other Kar9, may be conserved in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>, because putative orthologs of <italic>KAR9</italic> and dynein were identified in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> genome sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller and Rose, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maekawa and Kaneko, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nordberg et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Spc72 is stably incorporated into SPBs once it is recruited and organise cMTs throughout the cell cycle. In <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>, the strong SPB association of OpSpc72 in anaphase becomes weakened as cells enter into the following G1 phase, whereas they re-accumulate later in the cell cycle. The timing of OpSpc72 recruitment to SPBs during early mitosis appears to primarily dictate the organization of cMTs and hence nuclear position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). As the polo-like kinase Cdc5 protein plays an important role in this regulation, a question arises regarding the substrates of Cdc5 kinase in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archambault and Glover, 2009</xref>). Because ScSpc72 binds to and is phosphorylated by Cdc5 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, OpSpc72 represents an obvious candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Snead et al., 2007</xref>). Our electrophoresis analyses indeed detected Cdc5-dependent phosphorylation of Spc72. However, OpCdc5 failed to phosphorylate recombinant Spc72 in vitro. Further analyses are required to verify whether Cdc5 directly phosphorylates Spc72 and the potential effects of such modifications on the regulation of cMT. Additionally, it may also be important to identify other kinase(s) that are responsible for the Cdc5-independent phosphorylation of Spc72 observed in our analyses. Cdc5 may have another important substrates other than Spc72. Notably, a polo box binding site present in ScSpc72 is missing in OpSpc72. Cdc5 might therefore phosphorylate other SPB proteins such as Nud1, which has one site matching the consensus sequences of polo box binding site (S-Sp/Tp-P), and thereby indirectly influence the affinity of Spc72 towards the SPB.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24340.036</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of the SPB cycle in <italic>O. polymorpha.</italic></title><p>See Discussion for details.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-24340-fig9-v2"/></fig><p>It is unclear what brought highly expressed Spc72-GFP to SPBs at early cell cycle stages when Cdc5 activity was low. Weak Spc72-GFP signal in the absence of Cdc5 may be because of low affinity or unstable association to SPBs. Increased Spc72 protein levels may simply result in the increased number of Spc72 protein at SPBs at any given time. Alternatively, overexpression may overcome a negative regulation that normally maintains the low level of Spc72 at SPBs during early stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Such Cdc5-independent regulation is consistent with the observation that Spc72 was gradually lost from SPBs at early stages of the cell cycle. Examining properties of Spc72 protein when overexpressed such as post-translational modifications, protein stability, and molecular dynamics at SPBs would clarify this point.</p><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, SPB duplication initiates in late G1 phase by forming a satellite at the distal end of an extended half-bridge of the pre-existing ‘old’ SPB, which is then inserted into the nuclear envelope. In contrast to the old SPB which maintains cMTs from the previous mitosis, this ‘new’ SPB acquires the MT nucleation activity in the inner plaque prior to spindle assembly while it is still connected to the old SPB (side-by-side SPBs). On the other hand, a recent report suggested that the acquisition of ScSpc72 to the outer plaque, and hence of cMTs, occurs only after SPB separation and spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>O. polymorpha,</italic> the cMTs acquisition is also regulated at the level of Spc72 recruitment to SPBs. OpSpc72 dissociate from SPBs at the end of mitosis and recruited to both old and new SPBs shortly before anaphase of the following cell cycle. This suggests that the cell cycle regulation of Spc72 recruitment may be applied to both old and new SPBs in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>. Even though the Spc72 recruitment is cell cycle regulated in both species, its timing seems to be different: while it occurs in early G2 phase in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, it does in metaphase in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>. Moreover, their regulatory mechanisms are likely different because their acquisition is Cdc5-dependent in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>, but not in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>). Inhibition of Cdc5 kinase in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> causes the misaligned spindle phenotype, which indicates a role of Cdc5 in cMT functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Snead et al., 2007</xref>). However, it is unlikely that Cdc5 acts at the level of Spc72 recruitment since both SPBs of the misaligned spindle caused by Cdc5 inhibition carried cMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Snead et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that the Cdc5-dependent regulation of ScSpc72 function on cMT nucleation/anchoring has been overlooked. Growth suppression of <italic>cnm67∆</italic> cells by <italic>CDC5</italic> overexpression might point towards this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2004</xref>). It might also be because of the redundancy with the SPB-anchored Stu2 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Usui et al., 2003</xref>). The Stu2 binding domain of Spc72 (aa176–230 in ScSpc72, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>) is conserved in ascomycetous yeasts including <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> but it differs somewhat in OpSpc72. In particular, the detached cMTs observed in approximately 14% of <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> pre-anaphase cells are reminiscent of the <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup></italic> phenotype in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Usui et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the potential binding of Stu2 to Spc72 in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> should be investigated.</p><p>In <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>, structure of the cytoplasmic side of SPB, along with cMT nucleation competence, is modified as the cell cycle progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Notably, our BLAST search failed to identify orthologs of several SPB core components identified in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in genomes of outside of Saccharomycetaceae: the central plaque components Spc42 and Spc29, the membrane anchors Nbp1 and Bbp1, and the half-bridge component Kar1. The failure of identification may be due to the highly divergent nature of amino acid sequences of these coiled-coil proteins, or alternatively the function of these SPB components is not required in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>. The absence of these proteins could be one of the reasons underlying the poor appearance of the central plaque and the half-bridge in our electron microscopy anlayses. Our observation that the outer plaque in the cytoplasm was evident in anaphase SPBs but not in G1 SPBs may suggest the outer plaque from the previous mitosis is removed in the following G1 phase. However, given that Nud1, a putative outer plaque component, is present at the SPB in G1, it is more likely that the outer plaque is only partially disassembled. Furthermore, the appearance of the outer plaque in EM analysis proceeded that of Spc72 in fluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Electron microscopy analysis using another fixation method that better preserves the SPB structure might clarify this point. Equally important is the analysis of the half-bridge which organizes cMTs in G1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. If the half-bridge plays the same role in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> SPB as that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the loss of Spc72 from outer plaque alone should not cause the loss of cMTs. In addition, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, SPBs are segregated in a defined mode where the old SPB normally migrates into the daughter cell while the new SPB remains in the mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pereira et al., 2001</xref>). The SPB history in the outer plaque was proposed to primarily determine the destination of SPBs and to bias spindle asymmetry via Nud1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hotz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>). Whether the mode of SPB inheritance is conserved in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> and other yeast species is also worthy of further study.</p><p>It is unlikely that the mode of nuclear positioning in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> is ancestral, given that <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> and <italic>P. pastoris,</italic> who are diverted from the common ancestor earlier than <italic>O. polymorph</italic>, share the same nuclear organization with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

The samples were imaged in the 2D-SIM mode on a Nikon N-SIM system (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a TIRF Apochromat 100x/1.49 NA oil immersion objective and a single photon detection EM-CCD camera (Andor iXon3 DU-897E; Belfast, UK). The 488 nm and 561 nm laser lines were used for excitation of yeGFP and tdTomato, respectively, combined with emission band pass filter 520/45 and 610/60. Images were taken sequentially within a small z-stack and in consideration of imaging SPBs close to the coverslip to minimise spherical aberrations. Subsequently the reconstruction and channel alignment was performed using the NIS imaging and image analysis software (Nikon). For the xyz chromatic shift correction we used in a reference sample tetraspeck beads in a reference sample. All images show a single stack of the z-slices.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. K Richter and the Central Unit Electron Microscopy at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) for their kind support for the electron microscopy (EM) analyses.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Polo-like kinase Cdc5 regulates Spc72 recruitment to spindle pole body in the methylotrophic yeast <italic>Ogataea polymorpha</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a Guest Reviewing Editor for <italic>eLife</italic>, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The orientation of the mitotic spindle axis determines the direction of chromosome segregation in a spatiotemporal manner. In many eukaryotic cells undergoing close mitosis such as yeast, intranuclear spindle positioning is controlled by cytoplasmic microtubules (cMTs). A similar role is played by astral microtubules in open mitosis.</p><p>In their manuscript, Maekawa et al. undertake the first characterisation of spindle positioning in the budding yeast <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>. The work reveals outstanding differences in the sequence of events previously established in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, a well-studied paradigm. These idiosyncrasies are invaluable for dissecting cell cycle controls that are more apparent in one particular system while nevertheless conserved, as they converge on the spindle pole body or SPB, the yeast functional equivalent of the centrosome. Maekawa et al. present evidence for unbiased nuclear position (and the spindle within) in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> at early stages of the cell cycle. However, the elongating spindle aligns along the mother-bud axis and inserts into the bud neck during anaphase. By contrast, the spindle in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> adopts a polarised orientation much earlier via prominent cMTs. Accordingly, Maekawa et al. observed a very low number of cMTs from G1 to anaphase onset in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>. The authors linked this distinction to the late addition of Spc72 (a γ-tubulin complex receptor) to the SPB cytoplasmic face, under the control of the polo-like kinase Cdc5. Supporting this view, depletion or overexpression of Cdc5 abolished or anticipated Spc72 recruitment, respectively. Furthermore, cells overexpressing Cdc5 preempted nuclear migration close to the bud neck, pointing to Spc72 recruitment as a possible trigger for spindle positioning.</p><p>The reviewers have concurred that these correlations constitute important and interesting findings. However, the key claim that cell cycle-dependent recruitment of Spc72 controls cMT organisation and nuclear positioning in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> should be supported by direct evidence and not solely left to be inferred from those correlations.</p><p>Therefore, as detailed below, the reviewers recommend that:</p><p>– direct observation of cMTs should be carried out to verify their active involvement in nuclear/spindle positioning along the cell cycle.</p><p>– conclusive evidence supporting the nature of the link between Cdc5 and Spc72 should be provided.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Since this is a first characterisation, an overview of the spindle pathway should be documented by providing:</p><p>– A set of representative images for an SPB marker and the nucleus at the different stages along the entire cell cycle.</p><p>– Time lapse data of cells expressing an SPB marker to document the kinetics of SPB separation in order to define discrete stages by length along the spindle pathway, as previously done in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Stages such as &quot;large budded preanaphase cells&quot; (e.g. Results section first paragraph) should be correctly defined in quantitative terms.</p><p>2) The authors should report the impact of deleting <italic>SPC72</italic>.</p><p>3) Experiments were performed exclusively in vegetative cells. Are Spc72 recruitment and cMT organisation affected by nutrient conditions that induce mating? Are cMTs expected to have a role during mating?</p><p>There might be key differences regarding the (half)bridge with respect to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This should be stated clearly for its implications in cMT organisation along the cell cycle. Could the authors provide more detailed EM analysis? In particular, does SPB duplication proceed along the lines shown for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>? Is the (half)-bridge visible at any point before or after duplication? Is there a satellite in late G1? Could you provide corresponding images for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> SPBs obtained under identical conditions to appreciate differences in outer plaque appearance?</p><p>4) Nuclear position in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> is described as random in the Abstract and main text. Yet, the nucleus tends to position centrally (Results section first paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Time lapse must be presented to cover the events leading to this central position using cells expressing GFP-Tub1 for the interval between mitotic exit (when nuclei are positioned at opposite ends by the spindle) and the emergence of the bud in the following cell cycle to draw conclusions regarding any relationship between the axis of cell polarity and SPB/nuclear position. Please clarify and amend the text accordingly.</p><p>5) Subsection “<italic>O. polymorpha</italic> cells contain only fewer cMTs”, concerning cMT detachment. It is unclear how cMTs that dissociate from the SPB arise. Are cMTs indeed &quot;unstable&quot;? Time-lapse analysis should be implemented to document in more detail dynamic instability parameters as well as the timeline from cMT emergence to detachment.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. The cMTs in the time-lapse series are very hard to visualize. Arrows pointing at cMTs should be added and the basis for quantification of cMT persistence and cMT re-establishment should be fully described so that the significance of these data is made clear.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. It is unclear when Spc72 level changes along the preanaphase interval. Is label lost after a short spindle forms? Furthermore, there are issues of consistency throughout the manuscript regarding images and quantification of Spc72-GFP signals. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, G1</xref> cells do not show Spc72-GFP signal. Yet, the quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> points to a higher signal in G1 than in S/G2. Again, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> at time 0 signal is absent despite the quantification shown before. Later on, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, quantification of Spc72-GFP at different stages of the cell cycle indicates lower signals than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. It is important to explain this variability and show the quantification of several replicates of the experiments.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the legend describes &quot;signal intensities were background-subtracted&quot;. This may not be a proper method. Instead, Mps3-mRFP signals should be used for internal controls. This is also the case for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>.</p><p>With regards to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, unfortunately the interval of live imaging, i.e. 3 min, is too long to visualise the timing of the increase in Spc72-GFP signals during the cell cycle.</p><p>Time lapse analysis of cells expressing Spc72-GFP should be extended to document how the label is lost at the short spindle stage and regained close to anaphase as hinted by still image data, using suitable temporal resolution (at least 1 min intervals).</p><p>8) On overproduction of Spc72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The authors claim that by overproducing Spc72, SPBs become localised to the vicinity of the bud neck in preanaphase cells. It is critical to observe cMTs. Please show MT structures, possibly by time-lapse live imaging.</p><p>9) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, cells were synchronised using an inducible degron to deplete Cdc5. However, in support of the authors' claims, time course analysis following release from a nocodazole block should be carried out to monitor Spc72 levels, localisation and phosphorylation in the next cell cycle in otherwise wild type cells.</p><p>Regarding phosphorylation of Spc72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The difference between the lanes is too subtle to conclude on the specific contribution of Cdc5. The experiment should be performed using Phos-tag gels or changing the acrylamide/bis ratio to better display Spc72 phosphoisoforms. An alternative mode of synchronisation could be implemented, since nocodazole arrest is likely to further enhance phosphorylation thus masking the specific contribution of Cdc5. Finally, the authors should provide data to address the physical interaction between Cdc5 and Spc72 and in vitro kinase assays to demonstrate whether Spc72 is a Cdc5 substrate.</p><p>10) On Cdc5 localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Using SIM, the authors claim that Cdc5 is localised exclusively to the cytoplasmic side of the SPB during metaphase. Are the authors claiming that Cdc5-polo kinase plays no roles inside the nucleus during mitosis in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>? Please clarify this issue.</p><p>Along the same lines, most SPB markers in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> contribute cytoplasmic label by a free pool, the same holds true for Cdc5. The images in this manuscript virtually lack any whole cell background – this suggests over-processing. Diffuse nuclear label might have been lost as well here. The authors should provide sample raw images to assess whether loss of whole-cell and nuclear signals might be due to processing.</p><p>11) Regarding Cdc5 overproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The impact of manipulating Cdc5 on cMT presence should be assessed directly in cells expressing GFP-Tub1 to score cMTs along the cell cycle. In wild type or Cdc5 overexpressors, when do cMT plus ends access the bud?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> presents an increase in Spc72-GFP signal rather than advanced recruitment of Spc72 along the cell cycle. This rise might be due to increased Spc72 protein level and/or phosphorylation. Controls should be added to report on Spc72 levels and modification upon Cdc5 overexpression. Moreover, Cdc5 localisation upon overexpression should be analysed to determine whether Cdc5 association to the SPB is also affected.</p><p>Finally, it remains unclear whether Cdc5 kinase activity or only Cdc5 association to the SPB is the key determinant for Spc72 recruitment. While SPB tethering experiments might help resolve this point, the authors should at least address whether the ability of Cdc5 to recruit Spc72 to the SPB may involve their physical interaction. To this end, co-immunoprecipitation assays or protein pull downs with recombinant baits should be provided.</p><p>12) Could the authors propose how Spc72 acquisition brings about spindle alignment? At least they should provide time lapse data of cells expressing GFP-Tub1 at sufficient temporal resolution to visualise cMT acquisition and the dynamics of spindle alignment and insertion across the bud neck to judge the involvement of cMTs in response to Spc72 loading.</p><p>13) Figure legends should be edited for clarity and plots should be described in full for what is being scored in every case. Arrows or arrowheads should be added in every image to point at relevant structures that are difficult to discern without this aid as requested above.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Polo-like kinase Cdc5 regulates Spc72 recruitment to spindle pole body in the methylotrophic yeast <italic>Ogataea polymorpha</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior editor), and a Guest Reviewing editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed by editing the text of the manuscript before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>The authors have addressed the bulk of the original review but left some specific points unanswered, mainly on the grounds of technical limitations in the use of <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> as a model. Given this problem, those points should be qualified correctly in the final report.</p><p>Taken together, the manuscript portrays substantial novelty if focused on the behaviour of Spc72, Cdc5 and cMTs. Thus, it would be important to carry out a number of revisions in the text for the narrative in the Results and Discussion to be brought in line with the level of proof. Following is a list of action points and we would like to encourage the authors to revise accordingly so that data are not mis-represented here.</p><p>1) Concerning the path for spindle orientation in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic></p><p>Although nuclear position is not biased toward the bud neck, SPB movement depicted in the time lapse series for SPB localisation is inconsistent with the statement that position is entirely random (e.g. Discussion first paragraph), as it is steadily maintained at the mother cell centre. The temporal resolution used in this study may not reveal the underlying basis for this position but it does not convey proof of random location either. Thus, the text should be amended here to reflect the actual data.</p><p>Without detracting from the key conclusion on the role of Spc72 recruitment, we note that the representative time lapse series presented as supplemental data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> showed the following: a) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, after assembly 1 µm long spindles remain centrally positioned and loosely oriented toward the bud neck b) According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, spindle alignment is apparent at onset of spindle elongation followed later by SPB translocation. Instead, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, SPB translocation (of spindles held aligned during metaphase) coincides with spindle elongation. The analysis and narration of the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> mis-represents this dynamic behaviour. We would recommend moving the time lapse series to be part of the main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and, if space is limiting, move supporting quantitation of still images to the supplemental section of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Furthermore, the narration should be edited to reflect these data faithfully.</p><p>2) On Dyn1 and Kar9 pathways and SPOC function in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> (final paragraph in subsection “Nuclear positioning in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> differs from that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and other budding yeast species” and second paragraph of the Discussion section) the data are not sufficiently developed to make these claims and should be substantially edited for the following reasons:</p><p>– In the new sample image of dyn1∆ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>) it is very difficult to tell the nuclear stain from the cell background and hard to see how the quantitation was possible based on such data. Furthermore the stain is inconsistent with the live image of nuclear label by tagging. These data do not support conclusions regarding nuclear size as a differential factor between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>. Finally, the defect in the dyn1∆ mutant may transcend cMT function per se in line with the severe growth defect. Note that dyn1∆ mutant cells appeared to re-bud inappropriately and accumulate supernumerary nuclei, arguing that the SPOC may not operate as robustly (if at all) compared to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, resulting in low viability of dyn1∆ cells. Furthermore, the interaction between kar9∆ and bub2∆ appears much stronger than what is apparent in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (in which kar9∆ bub2∆ is not lethal at 30<sup>°</sup>C)</p><p>Under the circumstances, the authors are merely inferring cellular defects that they have not proven satisfactorily, for inclusion in this report. The same holds true for their claim that the Kar9 and Dynein pathways are functionally conserved between the two yeasts. cMT images failed to show plus ends reaching the distal bud cell cortex to talk about Kar9-dependent positioning here.</p><p>In conclusion, this section should be deleted from a revised manuscript to maintain the focus on the findings linking cMTs and Spc72. Also note that the authors could not answer here a number of essential queries from the original review on technical grounds.</p><p>– Discussion paragraph two. Please revise to simply mention synthetic lethality between kar9 and dyn1 mutants, with dyn1 alone showing a severe growth defect at best. Whether this is due to the demands of aligning the spindle during anaphase (as opposed to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in which spindle alignment is achieved prior to anaphase) remains highly speculative. The severe growth defect due to dyn1∆ in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> is consistent with weak SPOC-dependent delay. As stated above, the authors report excess of fragmented nuclei and re-budding in dyn1∆ cells, supporting this idea.</p><p>3) The definition of metaphase spindle is not kept consistent throughout. At one point, metaphase is defined by SPB distance &lt; 2 µm but earlier in the text, it was defined as &lt; 1 µm. Please amend accordingly.</p><p>4) The progressive and gradual loss of Spc72 from SPBs at early stages of the cell cycle is inconsistent with Cdc5 acting as the sole switch in Spc72 recruitment (with reversal triggered by mitotic exit). The authors should make this point clearer when discussing Spc72 detection in G1 cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Please revise to bring the narration in line with the data.</p><p>5) In the phosphorylation analysis, the change of tags on Spc72 should be explained in full and justified.</p><p>6) The rational for testing Spc72 upon starvation could be made clearer – mating is triggered by starvation in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>.</p><p>7) Discussion paragraph three, on Nud1 being a possible Cdc5 target – please clarify if you meant that Nud1 contains a consensus site for binding the Cdc5 polo box (rather than a polo box consensus sequence?).</p><p>8) The authors should discuss why Spc72 overexpression is sufficient to force recruitment to SPBs in their model (data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>9) The Introduction is incorrect regarding Spc72 and cMTs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Simply put, cMTs at the new SPB are formed after a 1 µm long spindle has formed (certainly not G1/S!, Shaw et al., 1997). Please revise to state correctly that the new SPB acquires Spc72 and cMTs after onset of spindle assembly (also see Juanes et al., 2013).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24340.044</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Since this is a first characterisation, an overview of the spindle pathway should be documented by providing:</p><p>– A set of representative images for an SPB marker and the nucleus at the different stages along the entire cell cycle.</p><p>– Time lapse data of cells expressing an SPB marker to document the kinetics of SPB separation in order to define discrete stages by length along the spindle pathway, as previously done in S. cerevisiae.

Representative images of cells with SPB marker is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>.

Duplicated and separated SPBs upon the short spindle formation maintain close proximity until anaphase onset, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. Anaphase was initiated in cells with large bud and the event occurred within the mother cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). These results are described in paragraph two of subsection “Nuclear positioning in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> differs from that in S. cerevisiae and other budding yeast species” of the revised manuscript, and “pre-anaphase cells” are now defined at the end of the paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should report the impact of deleting SPC72.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the essentiality of <italic>SPC72</italic> for growth by tetrad analysis using a <italic>SPC72/spc72Δ::natNT2</italic> heterozygous diploid strain. We found that <italic>SPC72</italic> is essential for growth. The result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and described in subsection “Spc72 associates with SPB in a cell cycle-dependent manner”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Experiments were performed exclusively in vegetative cells. Are Spc72 recruitment and cMT organisation affected by nutrient conditions that induce mating? Are cMTs expected to have a role during mating?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point. We now analysed Spc72 localisation in starved conditions. We found that while cMTs were not observed, Spc72-mRFP or Spc72-GFP accumulated at SPBs under starvation conditions (representative images of <italic>SPC72-mRFP GFP-TUB1</italic> cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This may suggest that Spc72 recruited to SPBs does not immediately organize cMTs in such conditions. Although we assume that cMTs are involved in karyogamy, we were unable to analyse cMTs in zygotes because mating frequency was low and zygotes failed to proceed karyogamy once they were placed on a glass-bottom dish. We are now discussing these data in the final paragraph of “Spc72 associates with SPB in a cell cycle-dependent manner”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There might be key differences regarding the (half)bridge with respect to S. cerevisiae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This should be stated clearly for its implications in cMT organisation along the cell cycle. Could the authors provide more detailed EM analysis? In particular, does SPB duplication proceed along the lines shown for S. cerevisiae? Is the (half)-bridge visible at any point before or after duplication? Is there a satellite in late G1? Could you provide corresponding images for S. cerevisiae SPBs obtained under identical conditions to appreciate differences in outer plaque appearance?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that clarifying the structure and cell cycle-dependency of half-bridge and bridge formation is an important issue. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, EM studies of satellite formation at the half-bridge have been facilitated by the use of synchronised cultures. Pheromone induced G1 arrest (similar to α-factor synchronisation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) is not yet established in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>. Thus, we tried alternative strategies. We constructed <italic>cdc28-as</italic> strain in order to observe SPB in late G1. But <italic>cdc28-as</italic> cells did not arrest at the same cell cycle stage as in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We think that this is because the inhibitor cannot completely inhibit Cdc28-as kinase. Nevertheless, we observed a delay in cell cycle progression (accumulation of cells with a single SPB signal by fluorescence microscopy) upon Cdc28-as inhibition. We could show by EM that some of these cells had side-by-side SPBs, which suggested that SPB duplication proceed along the lines shown for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We could detect an electron dense cloud between the two SPBs on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>BE). Therefore, we think that a bridge-like structure is also formed in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>. However, it was not clear whether the half-bridge/bridge like structure was present at other cell cycle stages. These data is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, and the description of the result is in paragraph two of subsection “Organization of the SPB structure on the cytoplasmic side is cell cycle dependent”.</p><p>In subsection “Organization of the SPB structure on the cytoplasmic side is cell cycle dependent”, we also added following sentence “while half-bridge-like structure, which plays an important role in cMT organization in G1 of <italic>S. ccerevisiae</italic>, was not clearly observed”.</p><p>In the Discussion section, possible difference of the half-bridge/bridge is described: “Equally important is the analysis of the half-bridge which, in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> organizes cMTs in G1. If the half-bridge plays the same role in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> SPB as that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the loss of Spc72 from outer plaque alone should not cause the loss of cMTs”.</p><p>Also, earlier timing of outer plaque appearance than Spc72-GFP is stated in the Discussion: “Furthermore, the appearance of the outer plaque in EM analysis proceeded that of Spc72 in fluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Nuclear position in O. polymorpha is described as random in the Abstract and main text. Yet, the nucleus tends to position centrally (Results section first paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Time lapse must be presented to cover the events leading to this central position using cells expressing GFP-Tub1 for the interval between mitotic exit (when nuclei are positioned at opposite ends by the spindle) and the emergence of the bud in the following cell cycle to draw conclusions regarding any relationship between the axis of cell polarity and SPB/nuclear position. Please clarify and amend the text accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that because nucleus is a large structure relative to the cell size, it is more likely to be located near the cell centre than at the periphery in the absence of external forces. Thus, we do not think that there is a specific regulation for positioning the nucleus centrally. To clarify this point, time lapse movies of SPB movement during anaphase to G1 of the next cell cycle are presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>. In these movie series, we could see the rapid and continuous movement of SPBs in the entire cell body. Thus, we concluded that SPB position is random in G1. The result is described in the text: “After spindle breakdown, the SPB moved vigorously in no relationship to the polarity axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “O. polymorpha cells contain only fewer cMTs”, concerning cMT detachment. It is unclear how cMTs that dissociate from the SPB arise. Are cMTs indeed &quot;unstable&quot;? Time-lapse analysis should be implemented to document in more detail dynamic instability parameters as well as the timeline from cMT emergence to detachment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed Time lapse microscopy using cells expressing <italic>GFP-TUB1</italic> and <italic>HHT1-mCherry</italic>. We see that cMTs dettached from SPBs and remained in the cytoplasm for only a short period of time before disappearing. This data thus indicate that detached cMT are short-lived. We could not determine dynamic instability parameters due to fast disappearance of detached cMTs. Therefore, to avoid confusion, we replaced “unstable” with “short-lived”.</p><p>Representative images of time lapse series showing cMT detachment are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, and the result is described in the text: “Time lapse analysis revealed that detached cMTs remained in the cytoplasm only for a short period of time before depolymerized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. The cMTs in the time-lapse series are very hard to visualize. Arrows pointing at cMTs should be added and the basis for quantification of cMT persistence and cMT re-establishment should be fully described so that the significance of these data is made clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. For better visualization of cMTs, we have replaced one of the time lapse sequences with another example in which cMTs are easily visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>. Yellow arrows are added to point cMTs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. It is unclear when Spc72 level changes along the preanaphase interval. Is label lost after a short spindle forms? Furthermore, there are issues of consistency throughout the manuscript regarding images and quantification of Spc72-GFP signals. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, G1</xref> cells do not show Spc72-GFP signal. Yet, the quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> points to a higher signal in G1 than in S/G2. Again, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> at time 0 signal is absent despite the quantification shown before. Later on, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, quantification of Spc72-GFP at different stages of the cell cycle indicates lower signals than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. It is important to explain this variability and show the quantification of several replicates of the experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for this confusion. Decrease of Spc72-GFP SPB signal after mitotic exit is slow and the timing varied from cell to cell. We think this may be the reason why some of G1 cells carry strong Spc72-GFP signal. Time-lapse series from anaphase to the next cell cycle are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, and the results are described in the text: “As cells exit from mitosis and entre into the next cell cycle, Spc72-GFP signal was gradually decreased at SPBs with the timing that varied from cell to cell. However, in all cases, Spc72-GFP levels reached a minimum well before short spindle was formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the legend describes &quot;signal intensities were background-subtracted&quot;. This may not be a proper method. Instead, Mps3-mRFP signals should be used for internal controls. This is also the case for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>In all quantification, signal intensities were background-subtracted. We do not think that Mps3-mRFP is a suitable internal control in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> because Mps3-mRFP signal bleached so fast that its intensity decline even during z-series acquisition. There is no other SPB components that gives stronger RFP signal than Mps3. Therefore we think that the background-subtraction is currently the best method available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regards to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, unfortunately the interval of live imaging, i.e. 3 min, is too long to visualise the timing of the increase in Spc72-GFP signals during the cell cycle.</p><p>Time lapse analysis of cells expressing Spc72-GFP should be extended to document how the label is lost at the short spindle stage and regained close to anaphase as hinted by still image data, using suitable temporal resolution (at least 1 min intervals).</p></disp-quote><p>We now show new time lapse series of Spc72-GFP with 30 sec or 1 min intervals are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>.</p><p>The text is changed to “In all cells that progressed into anaphase, an Spc72-GFP signal became detectable &lt; 4 min prior to the initiation of anaphase (average 3.68 ± 1.74 min, n=14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> yellow arrowhead). Within 5 min after appearance of the Spc72-GFP signal, spindle orientation was corrected when it had not done already (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, average 3.50 ± 1.61 min, n=12); therefore, one half part of an anaphase nucleus was successfully inserted into the bud.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) On overproduction of Spc72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The authors claim that by overproducing Spc72, SPBs become localised to the vicinity of the bud neck in preanaphase cells. It is critical to observe cMTs. Please show MT structures, possibly by time-lapse live imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s comment, we visualized cMTs by introducing <italic>CFP-TUB1</italic> in SPC72-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). cMTs are now observed more frequently and the following sentence was added; “cMTs are more often observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, cells were synchronised using an inducible degron to deplete Cdc5. However, in support of the authors' claims, time course analysis following release from a nocodazole block should be carried out to monitor Spc72 levels, localisation and phosphorylation in the next cell cycle in otherwise wild type cells.</p></disp-quote><p>In our hands, the only synchronization protocol that arrest cells and then allow them to resume the cell cycle was the Cdc5-depletion/re-expression. Other methods did not work. For examples, although <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> cells can be arrested by nocodazole, they cannot be easily released. Even at the lowest concentration that causes cell cycle arrest, cells required more than two hours to resume cell cycle and did so in an unsynchronized fashion. We generated degron strains for <italic>CDC4, MCM4, MCM10</italic> as well as <italic>cdc28-as</italic>, but none of them worked well enough for synchronization.</p><p>In order to address the fluctuation of Spc72 protein level in cell cycle, we have compared Spc72 protein levels in cycling cells, nocodazole arrested cells (metaphase), <italic>cdc28-as</italic> cells (delayed G1/S phase), <italic>CDC5-3mAID</italic> cells (late anaphase). We found that the amount of Spc72 protein was at the comparable levels in all cells. The result is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> and described in the text; “Spc72 protein abundance did not fluctuate as cells entered into anaphase and proceeded into the following cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).”</p><p>As for the localization of Spc72 from anaphase to the next cell cycle, we performed time lapse analysis in asynchronized <italic>SPC72-GFP</italic> cells. Although we could not obtain time lapse series that covers the entire cell cycle due to bleaching of GFP signal, we could show that Spc72-GFP disappeared as cells exit mitosis and before the bud emergence of the following cell cycle. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> (4.5 min and 17 min) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>. Appearance of Spc72-GFP prior to anaphase onset is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C (1</xref> min) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> (5.5 min). The results are described in subsection “Spc72 associates with SPB in a cell cycle-dependent manner”</p><p>We have compared phosphorylation status of Spc72 in asynchronous and nocodazole-arrested cells and found that it migrated slower in nocodazole-arrested cells. This result suggests Spc72 is subjected to cell cycle dependent phosphorylation. The result is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref> and described in the text: “Furthermore, the Spc72 band migrated slower in nocodazole-arrested cells than that in asynchronous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding phosphorylation of Spc72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The difference between the lanes is too subtle to conclude on the specific contribution of Cdc5. The experiment should be performed using Phos-tag gels or changing the acrylamide/bis ratio to better display Spc72 phosphoisoforms. An alternative mode of synchronisation could be implemented, since nocodazole arrest is likely to further enhance phosphorylation thus masking the specific contribution of Cdc5. Finally, the authors should provide data to address the physical interaction between Cdc5 and Spc72 and in vitro kinase assays to demonstrate whether Spc72 is a Cdc5 substrate.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed western blotting analysis to better show Cdc5-dependent phosphorylation of Spc72 using total protein prepared under a denatured condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In our hand, Phos-tag gels did not help resolving Cdc5-dependent phosphorylation.</p><p>As for physical interaction between Cdc5 and Spc72, we did in vitro pull-down assay using recombinant Spc72 as a bait, but the result was inconclusive because of non-specific binding between Cdc5 and sepharose beads (data not shown). We also performed in vitro kinase assay with negative results. However, we cannot completely exclude that Spc72 is not a direct substrate of Cdc5. Previously, we have shown that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Cdc5 can phosphorylate recombinant Spc72, but incorporation of 32P was much stronger for the degradation products of the recombinant Spc72 (Maekawa et al., 2007). This may suggest that a specific conformation or SPB binding is necessary for the reaction. Whether Spc72 is directly phosphorylated by Cdc5, is therefore still an open question. This point is further discussed in the text: “Cdc5 may have another important substrates other than Spc72. Notably, a polo box binding site present in ScSpc72 is missing in OpSpc72. Cdc5 might therefore phosphorylate other SPB proteins such as Nud1, which has one site matching the polo box consensus sequences (S-Sp/Tp-P), and thereby indirectly influence the affinity of Spc72 towards the SPB.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) On Cdc5 localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Using SIM, the authors claim that Cdc5 is localised exclusively to the cytoplasmic side of the SPB during metaphase. Are the authors claiming that Cdc5-polo kinase plays no roles inside the nucleus during mitosis in O. polymorpha? Please clarify this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to point it out. We did observe nuclear signal of Cdc5-GFP and assume that it has nuclear functions during the cell cycle. To clarify this, we added the following sentence: “Nuclear and NE localisation appeared at early stages of the cell cycle and persisted until the end of mitosis”. Also we modified the text; “Thus, Cdc5 likely becomes first localised to the nucleus and the NE in G2, and then in mitosis to the cytoplasmic side of SPBs.”</p><p>The legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> now clearly states the nuclear localization of Cdc5-GFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along the same lines, most SPB markers in S. cerevisiae contribute cytoplasmic label by a free pool, the same holds true for Cdc5. The images in this manuscript virtually lack any whole cell background – this suggests over-processing. Diffuse nuclear label might have been lost as well here. The authors should provide sample raw images to assess whether loss of whole-cell and nuclear signals might be due to processing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to point it out. We prepared the high intensity version of SIM images of Cdc5-GFP, in which diffuse nuclear signal is easily visible. It is present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Regarding Cdc5 overproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The impact of manipulating Cdc5 on cMT presence should be assessed directly in cells expressing GFP-Tub1 to score cMTs along the cell cycle. In wild type or Cdc5 overexpressors, when do cMT plus ends access the bud?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address this point, cMTs were visualized by introducing <italic>CFP-TUB1</italic> in <italic>CDC5</italic>-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and 8F</xref>). CFP-Tub1 signal was not strong enough to unambiguously determine the timing of cMT contact with the bud cortex. However, cMTs were more frequently observed. This is now discussed in the text: “and cMTs were more prevalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and 8F</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> presents an increase in Spc72-GFP signal rather than advanced recruitment of Spc72 along the cell cycle. This rise might be due to increased Spc72 protein level and/or phosphorylation. Controls should be added to report on Spc72 levels and modification upon Cdc5 overexpression. Moreover, Cdc5 localisation upon overexpression should be analysed to determine whether Cdc5 association to the SPB is also affected.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> showing that Spc72-GFP protein levels were not affected by Cdc5 depletion or <italic>CDC5</italic>-overexpression. The result is described in subsection “CDC5 overexpression accelerates the Spc72 recruitment to SPB”; “While Cdc5 expression showed no effect on the protein level of Spc72-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>),”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, it remains unclear whether Cdc5 kinase activity or only Cdc5 association to the SPB is the key determinant for Spc72 recruitment. While SPB tethering experiments might help resolve this point, the authors should at least address whether the ability of Cdc5 to recruit Spc72 to the SPB may involve their physical interaction. To this end, co-immunoprecipitation assays or protein pull downs with recombinant baits should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address this point, we have overexpressed kinase-dead version of <italic>CDC5</italic> to see whether physical presence of the protein stimulate the recruitment of Spc72 to SPB. However, this experiment did not bring a conclusion because overexpressed kinase-dead Cdc5 did not localize to SPB at any stage of the cell cycle.</p><p>We attempted another experiments to address this issue, as previously discussed in comment 9. However, what determines Spc72 recruitment to SPB is still an open question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Could the authors propose how Spc72 acquisition brings about spindle alignment? At least they should provide time lapse data of cells expressing GFP-Tub1 at sufficient temporal resolution to visualise cMT acquisition and the dynamics of spindle alignment and insertion across the bud neck to judge the involvement of cMTs in response to Spc72 loading.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address this point, we performed timelapse analysis of <italic>GFP-TUB1</italic> cells with short intervals. We could show the correlation between cMT acquisition and the spindle orientation. The result is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and described in the text; “Acquired cMTs efficiently corrected the spindle orientation in pre-anaphase cells, suggesting that the spindle orientation is regulated largely at the level of cMT acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).”</p><p>Time lapse data showing the relative timing between Spc72 loading and the spindle orientation is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> and the result is discussed in the text; “Within 5 min after appearance of the Spc72-GFP signal, spindle orientation was corrected when it had not done already (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, average 3.50 ± 1.61 min, n=12); therefore, one half part of an anaphase nucleus was successfully inserted into the bud.”</p><p>Time lapse with double labelling of Spc72 and MTs was technically not feasible in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>. Spc72-RFP signal beached out too quickly for time lapse and mCherry-Tub1 was not efficiently incorporated into microtubule filaments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Figure legends should be edited for clarity and plots should be described in full for what is being scored in every case. Arrows or arrowheads should be added in every image to point at relevant structures that are difficult to discern without this aid as requested above.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure legends are modified to include all required information. Relevant structures and fluorescent signals are now marked with arrows/arrowheads.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Taken together, the manuscript portrays substantial novelty if focused on the behaviour of Spc72, Cdc5 and cMTs. Thus, it would be important to carry out a number of revisions in the text for the narrative in the Results and Discussion to be brought in line with the level of proof. Following is a list of action points and we would like to encourage the authors to revise accordingly so that data are not mis-represented here.</p><p>1) Concerning the path for spindle orientation in O. polymorpha</p><p>Although nuclear position is not biased toward the bud neck, SPB movement depicted in the time lapse series for SPB localisation is inconsistent with the statement that position is entirely random (e.g. Discussion first paragraph), as it is steadily maintained at the mother cell centre. The temporal resolution used in this study may not reveal the underlying basis for this position but it does not convey proof of random location either. Thus, the text should be amended here to reflect the actual data.</p></disp-quote><p>The text is now modified to “the nucleus generally locates centrally”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Without detracting from the key conclusion on the role of Spc72 recruitment, we note that the representative time lapse series presented as supplemental data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> showed the following: a) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, after assembly 1 µm long spindles remain centrally positioned and loosely oriented toward the bud neck b) According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, spindle alignment is apparent at onset of spindle elongation followed later by SPB translocation. Instead, in S. cerevisiae, SPB translocation (of spindles held aligned during metaphase) coincides with spindle elongation. The analysis and narration of the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> mis-represents this dynamic behaviour. We would recommend moving the time lapse series to be part of the main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and, if space is limiting, move supporting quantitation of still images to the supplemental section of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Furthermore, the narration should be edited to reflect these data faithfully.</p></disp-quote><p>One of time lapse series in the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref> is now moved to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. To accommodate the time lapse in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, quantification data (the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>) have been moved to a supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>a) Passage on the still images of SPB marker and the time lapse in Figure 1DE and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref> have been modified in the text; “Moreover, SPB in G1 cells as well as small budded cells was not in the defined position within the mother cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref>). Subsequent time lapse analysis revealed that after spindle assembly, ~ 1 µm long spindles remained at their central positions and loosely oriented toward the bud neck until shortly before anaphase onset.”</p><p>b) Time lapse images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref> represent cells with mis-aligned spindle. However, there are cells with loosely positioned/aligned spindle as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> (wild type category I and II), and it is not possible to narrow down the precise timing of spindle alignment. Therefore, we left the time window for spindle alignment wider than “anaphase onset” as suggested by the reviewer, and added the following passage to the Results; “Spindle alignment was corrected around the time of (or shortly after) spindle elongation, followed by SPB insertion into the bud.”</p><p>We have also added the following texts; “after spindle assembly, ~ 1 µm long spindles remain at their central positions and loosely oriented toward the bud neck”, and “Those SPB movements are in contrast to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in which spindle is aligned during metaphase and therefore SPB translocation into the bud coincides with spindle elongation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) On Dyn1 and Kar9 pathways and SPOC function in O. polymorpha (final paragraph in subsection “Nuclear positioning in O. polymorpha differs from that in S. cerevisiae and other budding yeast species” and second paragraph of the Discussion section) the data are not sufficiently developed to make these claims and should be substantially edited for the following reasons:</p><p>– In the new sample image of dyn1∆ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>) it is very difficult to tell the nuclear stain from the cell background and hard to see how the quantitation was possible based on such data. Furthermore the stain is inconsistent with the live image of nuclear label by tagging. These data do not support conclusions regarding nuclear size as a differential factor between S. cerevisiae and O. polymorpha. Finally, the defect in the dyn1∆ mutant may transcend cMT function per se in line with the severe growth defect. Note that dyn1∆ mutant cells appeared to re-bud inappropriately and accumulate supernumerary nuclei, arguing that the SPOC may not operate as robustly (if at all) compared to S. cerevisiae, resulting in low viability of dyn1∆ cells. Furthermore, the interaction between kar9∆ and bub2∆ appears much stronger than what is apparent in S. cerevisiae (in which kar9∆ bub2∆ is not lethal at 30<sup>°</sup>C)</p><p>Under the circumstances, the authors are merely inferring cellular defects that they have not proven satisfactorily, for inclusion in this report. The same holds true for their claim that the Kar9 and Dynein pathways are functionally conserved between the two yeasts. cMT images failed to show plus ends reaching the distal bud cell cortex to talk about Kar9-dependent positioning here.</p><p>In conclusion, this section should be deleted from a revised manuscript to maintain the focus on the findings linking cMTs and Spc72. Also note that the authors could not answer here a number of essential queries from the original review on technical grounds.</p><p>– Discussion paragraph two. Please revise to simply mention synthetic lethality between kar9 and dyn1 mutants, with dyn1 alone showing a severe growth defect at best. Whether this is due to the demands of aligning the spindle during anaphase (as opposed to S. cerevisiae in which spindle alignment is achieved prior to anaphase) remains highly speculative. The severe growth defect due to dyn1∆ in O polymorpha is consistent with weak SPOC-dependent delay. As stated above, the authors report excess of fragmented nuclei and re-budding in dyn1∆ cells, supporting this idea.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have deleted the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref> that showed data on Kar9 and Dynein pathways as well as SPOC from the Result section. The passage on those in the Introduction has been simplified, and the presence of probable orthologs of Kar9 and Dyn1 is now discussed in the Discussion; “Currently molecular mechanism(s) that regulate spindle orientation is unknown. However, although the timing of spindle orientation relative to cell cycle progression appears to be different from that of other yeasts, two redundant molecular mechanisms of spindle orientation, one requiring dynein and the other Kar9, may be conserved in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic>, because putative orthologs of <italic>KAR9</italic> and dynein were identified in <italic>O. polymorpha</italic> genome sequences (Li et al., 1993; Miller and Rose, 1998; Maekawa and Kaneko, 2014; Nordberg et al., 2014).” The text was also edited; “…which may largely rely on an immediate correction of the orientation of the spindle and on SPOC activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The definition of metaphase spindle is not kept consistent throughout. At one point, metaphase is defined by SPB distance &lt; 2 µm but earlier in the text, it was defined as &lt; 1 µm. Please amend accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to point out this inconsistency. It is now amended to be 2 µm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The progressive and gradual loss of Spc72 from SPBs at early stages of the cell cycle is inconsistent with Cdc5 acting as the sole switch in Spc72 recruitment (with reversal triggered by mitotic exit). The authors should make this point clearer when discussing Spc72 detection in G1 cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Please revise to bring the narration in line with the data.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s comment, Spc72 signal in G1 was narrated in the text; “This difference of timing may explain the relatively high and variable intensity of Spc72-GFP at SPB in G1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the phosphorylation analysis, the change of tags on Spc72 should be explained in full and justified.</p></disp-quote><p>The tag on Spc72 was changed to flag tag for higher efficiency in immunoprecipitation and having less unspecific signals in immunoblotting. These reasons are now described in the figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>; “The flag tag was used for the efficiency of immunoprecipitation and lower unspecific signals in immunoblotting.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The rational for testing Spc72 upon starvation could be made clearer – mating is triggered by starvation in O polymorpha.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to point this out. We have added a passage which explains the rational for testing Spc72 in starved cells; “cMT play important roles in yeast mating and karyogamy, which are initiated in G1. Because mating is triggered by nutrient starvation in <italic>O. olymorpha</italic>, we examined cMTs and Spc72 in nutrient starved cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion paragraph three, on Nud1 being a possible Cdc5 target – please clarify if you meant that Nud1 contains a consensus site for binding the Cdc5 polo box (rather than a polo box consensus sequence?).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to point this out. It meant a polo box binding motif. The text has been modified to state clearer; “Nud1, which has one site matching the consensus sequences of polo box binding site”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors should discuss why Spc72 overexpression is sufficient to force recruitment to SPBs in their model (data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s comment, discussion on how Spc72 was recruitmented to SPB when overexpressed is now added to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The Introduction is incorrect regarding Spc72 and cMTs in S. cerevisiae. Simply put, cMTs at the new SPB are formed after a 1 µm long spindle has formed (certainly not G1/S!, Shaw et al., 1997). Please revise to state correctly that the new SPB acquires Spc72 and cMTs after onset of spindle assembly (also see Juanes et al., 2013).</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s comment, the passage in the Introduction is revised; “New SPB acquires Spc72 and cMTs after the formation of a 1 µm long spindle”</p></body></sub-article></article>
