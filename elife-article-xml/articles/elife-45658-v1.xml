An egress at the wrong moment, a delayed or slow ingress to escape from a predator, or even undue reticence to investigate the world outside all undermine the fitness of the organism. The behavioral motifs displayed at the threshold of the burrow and the circuits that govern them are therefore likely to have been selected over evolutionary time. We have developed a Virtual Burrow Assay (VBA) for head-fixed mice that aims to recapitulate the conditions characteristic of being poised at the threshold of the burrow in order to capture these innate behaviors.</p><p>Behavioral assays for head-fixed mice typically require several sessions of acclimation to head-fixation and task training, even for relatively simple applications such as measuring sensory discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2014</xref>) or obtaining controlled locomotion in a visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dombeck et al., 2010</xref>), or olfactory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Radvansky and Dombeck, 2018</xref>) virtual-reality environment. In training-dependent paradigms, variability in task proficiency can contaminate the measurement of the sensory or cognitive quantities that are inferred from the behavior. Moreover, training unavoidably engages circuits required for signaling reward, regulating satiety/motivation, learning the structure of the task, and learning, planning and executing new motor actions. This interposes additional layers of complexity between the sensory or cognitive operations that are the object of study and the behavior that is observed in order to infer their properties. This added complexity is likely to further challenge the already difficult interpretation of lesion or perturbation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wolff and Ölveczky, 2018</xref>) or of the relationship between neural activity and concomitant behavior.</p><p>We developed the VBA in order to elicit interpretable behavior in head-fixed mice without requiring any training. The motivation for this was twofold: (1) to minimize behavioral noise introduced by variability in task proficiency and (2) to minimize the complexity of the circuit operations necessary to produce meaningful behavior under head fixation. When they are introduced into the VBA mice exhibit an innate tendency to retreat inside an available enclosure—a drive that can be leveraged to measure a diversity of behaviors, ranging from innate avoidance and fear conditioning to stimulus discrimination and exploration. These behaviors, which are observed without training or prior acclimation to handling or head-fixation, are stereotyped and consistent across animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Virtual Burrow Assay and its operation</title><p>The VBA consists of a tube enclosure (virtual burrow), constrained to slide back and forth along the anterior-posterior axis of the body of a head-fixed mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Control inputs and outputs, black. Devices, gray. (<bold>B</bold>) Finite state machine diagram. During the intertrial interval (ITI), a linear actuator retracts the burrow to the egress position (‘Retract actuator to egress position’). The retraction is complete once the position of the servo motor (<italic>P</italic><sub>servo</sub>) is less than the specified retraction position (<italic>θ</italic><sub>s1</sub>). As long as the force against the tether (<italic>F</italic><sub>burrow</sub>) is greater than or equal to a preset threshold (<italic>θ</italic><sub>f</sub>), the linear actuator remains in the retracted position (‘Wait’). Once <italic>F</italic><sub>burrow</sub> &lt; <italic>θ</italic><sub>f</sub>, the linear actuator advances to the ingress position (‘Advance actuator to ingress position’), slackening the tether and freeing the animal to ingress. Once <italic>P</italic><sub>servo</sub> reaches the slackened position (<italic>θ</italic><sub>s2</sub>), the system waits (‘Wait’). If at any point the position of the burrow (<italic>P</italic><sub>burrow</sub>) exceeds a specified threshold (<italic>θ</italic><sub>p</sub>), the burrow is again retracted and the system returns to the initial state. If, however, the animal remains in the egress position and <italic>P</italic><sub>burrow</sub> <italic>&lt; θ</italic><sub>p</sub> for a duration (<italic>t</italic><sub>ITI</sub>) exceeding both the ITI (<italic>T</italic><sub>ITI</sub>) and an enforced delay (<italic>T</italic><sub>w1</sub>) following advance of the linear actuator to the ingress position (<italic>t</italic><sub>w1</sub>), then the ITI concludes and a stimulus is delivered (‘Deliver stimulus’). Throughout the period of stimulus delivery, the linear actuator remains in the advanced position, leaving the animal in complete control of burrow position. Following stimulus delivery (<italic>t</italic><sub>w2</sub>), once a second delay period (<italic>T</italic><sub>w2</sub>) has elapsed, the system returns to the initial state and the linear actuator retracts the burrow.

It is therefore necessary to pull the virtual burrow away from the mouse in order to ask what induces the animal to ingress. When the enclosure is retracted by a motor tethered to the virtual burrow, mice invariably try to get back inside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). After an initial bout of resistance (&lt;30 s), mice voluntarily maintain an ‘egress’ position and thus can be presented test stimuli. Mice quickly adapt to this scenario, exhibiting within one to three minutes periods of &gt;15 s during which they voluntarily hold the virtual burrow in the egress position. This sequence of behaviors has been observed in all mice tested and been found to persist across repeated tests on four separate days over a 16 day interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). No prior acclimation to handling or head fixation is required.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Air puffs elicit rapid and reliable ingress</title><p>We first determined whether an innately aversive stimulus, such as air puff, induces ingress, and if so, the degree to which this response is rapid and stereotyped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Strong air puffs delivered to the snout (80 psi, 2 mm distance) elicited short-latency, rapid ingress in all mice tested on all trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Animals generated this behavior by pulling the burrow up to the ingress position in a coordinated, simultaneous movement of their fore- and hind-limbs. The latency of ingress varied little across animals (μ = 18.5 msec, c<sub>v</sub> = 0.07, N = 5 mice, three trials per mouse) and across trials (c<sub>v</sub> = 0.10). Weak air puffs (2 psi, 15 cm distance) did not elicit ingress but instead a transient movement resulting in no net change in burrow position. This apparent flinch-like startle response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis, 1984</xref>) can be clearly distinguished from the ongoing movement of the burrow caused by the animal’s breathing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45658.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Reliable, short-latency ingress to noxious air puff.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of experimental set up.

First, we compared responses to air puffs delivered to the snout with air puffs delivered to the hindquarters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> top, orange vs. green). As observed previously, all animals ingressed on all trials when air puffs were directed at the snout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> orange and 2F left, N = 4 mice, three trials each). When air puffs were directed at the hindquarters, mice also invariably ingressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> green and 2F second from left, N = 4 mice, three trials each). Thus the drive to ingress into the virtual burrow overcomes the drive to move in the direction opposite the air puff. Second, we replaced the tube with a flat, open platform that was similarly constrained to move along the anterior-posterior axis of the mouse’s body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> bottom). Mice in this configuration exhibited a transient, flinch-like response to air puff delivered to the snout or hindquarters (N = 4 mice each, three trials each) followed, in some cases, by relatively small displacements of the platform with little net preference between the egress or ingress directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> pink and blue, 2F second from right and right, median displacement of 14.9 mm and 17.0 mm in tube vs. 0.2 mm and 2.3 mm on platform, for snout and hindquarters, respectively). These observations, together with the stereotypy, high reproducibility across animals, and low latency of the response to strong air puff, and the fact that these behaviors require no training, suggest that ingress to air puff in the VBA reflects an innate behavioral program to flee to shelter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Looming visual stimuli elicit ingress</title><p>We next asked whether visual stimuli that evoke flight in freely moving animals also evoke a response in the VBA. For this we employed a predator-like visual ‘looming’ stimulus known to trigger flight in freely moving mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Franceschi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, top left). Mice in the VBA ingressed on 80% of trials in response to an expanding black disk displayed above their heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, top left, B, top, C, orange, and D, left; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>).

These stimuli did not reliably elicit ingress, yielding responses on 0% or 13% of trials, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, middle and bottom, C, pink and green, D, middle and right).

We reasoned that granting the animal control over its proximity to the odor port would allow it to select between the drive to explore an odorant stimulus (by exiting the burrow) and the drive to remain inside. In contrast to all other experiments, in which trials were initiated while the animal was in a mandatory egress position, here the animals were granted control over burrow position at all times and almost invariably maintained full ingress prior to stimulus delivery. We observed that under this configuration mice exited the virtual burrow for brief (~1 s) bouts before resuming a fully ingressed position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>).

These features can be measured without the animal having been trained in the sensorimotor contingencies of the instrument, or even been previously acclimated to head-fixation. The assay captures flight-like behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), exploration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), as well as the detection of the precise onset of conditioned responses to aversively conditioned odor stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>)—measurements that have otherwise not been possible in head-fixed mice. In contrast to standard training-based assays for head-fixed mice, this training-free approach may reduce variability due to differences in task proficiency across animals and minimize the complexity of the circuit operations necessary to produce meaningful behavior under head fixation. The apparatus is compatible with standard electrophysiological and optical methods for measuring neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Because it measures behavior at a timescale comparable to that of neuronal dynamics, the assay permits direct comparison between these two quantities.</p><p>Four observations suggest that ingress in the VBA reflects an innate behavioral program to seek the safety of an enclosure. (1) Mice exhibit consistent and reliable ingress without training or even acclimation to head-fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and invariably resist being pulled out of the burrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). (2) Ingress responses to air puff are characterized by markedly low latency and low variability across trials and across animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>), indicative of a highly conserved behavior. (3) Ingress does not depend upon the location of the source of the air puff but does require the availability of an enclosure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). (4) Mice ingress selectively to looming stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that evoke flight in freely moving mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Franceschi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>). We speculate that by simulating key features of the mouse <italic>Umwelt</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">von Uexküll, 1957</xref>), the contingencies of the assay permit expression of these innate behavioral programs in spite of the contrivance of the apparatus and of head-fixation.</p><p>We have observed four stimulus-induced behaviors in this assay: flinch, ingress, egress bout, and trembling. We interpret flinch in response to mild air puff as a startle response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis, 1984</xref>); ingress in response to puff and looming stimuli as a flight-like response; egress bout as exploration; and trembling as a component of what is commonly referred to as ‘freezing’. Indeed, while mice typically ingressed in response to CS+ presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), on some trials animals also exhibited a selective trembling response to the aversive cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We made this same observation in high-speed video taken of freely moving animals during training in the conditioning chamber (data not shown), confirming previous reports of high-frequency trembling in wild rodents following the presentation fear-inducing stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Griffith, 1920</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofer, 1970</xref>). We also observed two distinct responses to unanticipated stimuli, which depend on the context in which the stimulus was presented. When unanticipated stimuli were presented to mice in the exposed, egress position, they reliably ingressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). In contrast, mice briefly egressed in order to sample unanticipated stimuli if these were presented while the animals were ingressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>). This parallels the behavior of unconstrained animals, which exhibit either exploration (neophilia), avoidance (neophobia), or both in sequence, in a manner that depends on context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berlyne, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gershman and Niv, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Many standard assays of rodent behavior in the laboratory measure events that unfold over seconds or minutes. These include time spent freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouton and Bolles, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Griffith, 1920</xref>), conditioned suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Estes and Skinner, 1941</xref>), habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groves and Thompson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thompson and Spencer, 1966</xref>), approach versus avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Young, 1959</xref>), conditioned place preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia et al., 1957</xref>), and exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988</xref>). The VBA measures the onset of ingress and egress with millisecond precision, thus permitting fine alignment of behavior with neural dynamics. Such alignment to sharp transitions in behavioral state has proven fruitful in primate neurophysiology: for instance, alignment to the precise time of eye saccades indicating a perceptual decision permits the investigation of the neuronal events underlying a decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The VBA can exploit stimulus-selective habituation to implement a discrimination assay without training. This strategy has been employed across many experimental systems, ranging from the olfactory system of freely moving rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cleland et al., 2002</xref>) to the visual system of human infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friedman, 1972</xref>), and can be exploited to construct psychometric curves for detection or discrimination. Many head-fixed assays are capable of measuring detection and discrimination (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2014</xref>), but these typically depend upon instrumental conditioning, requiring acclimation to head-fixation and training in the sensorimotor contingencies of the task; moreover, these are likely to result in perceptual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fahle and Poggio, 2002</xref>), causing overestimation of default perceptual performance.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we demonstrate that the VBA can be employed to measure fear conditioning. Previously-described paradigms (such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lovett-Barron et al., 2014</xref>) have successfully translated conditioned lick-suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouton and Bolles, 1980</xref>) to a head-fixed preparation, but this measurement is characterized by relatively low temporal resolution both in freely moving and in head-fixed mice. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> we leverage the VBA’s fine temporal resolution to measure the precise latency of ingress in response to CS+ presentation. We observed a median latency of 709 msec, with over one quarter of responses initiating after longer than 1 s. These latencies cannot be explained in terms of delays in sensory detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Resulaj and Rinberg, 2015</xref>) or ingress motor pattern generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A circuit centered around the amygdala has been proposed to orchestrate Pavlovian learning and the resultant expression of conditioned responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansen et al., 2011</xref>), but these results suggest that the expression of Pavlovian fear conditioning engages additional processing not accounted for in this model. Furthermore, it does not explain how the probability of long (&gt;1 s) latencies might increase over the course of extinction.</p><p>The wide range of responses measurable by the VBA yields sensitive indicators of sensory detection and discrimination thresholds, exploration, neophobia, memory, and motor function—behavioral features that may be affected in models of psychiatric and neurological diseases. For example, in preliminary experiments we have found that animals habituate to odorant stimuli more rapidly when administered anxiolytics; and moreover, we have observed that the rate at which chronically stressed mice acclimate to the closed loop contingencies is diminished by the administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Moreover, key features of motor function—including balance, tremor, chorea, limb and core strength, movement initiation, and movement velocity—can be precisely measured by tracking the position of the burrow and the force exerted against the tether.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and surgery</title><p>All procedures were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocols AC-AAAI8650 and AC-AAAT5466). 8–17 week old, male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were fitted with a titanium head plate (27.4 mm x 9.0 mm x 0.8 mm, G.

The headplate was centered about the body’s anterior-posterior axis and equally spaced between bregma and lambda. For mice exposed to visual stimuli, however, head plate position was sufficiently posterior to prevent occlusion of the visual stimuli by the head plate. Mice were allowed at least one full week and typically greater than 4 weeks to recover before any testing was performed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). All animals were singly housed on a 12 hr/12 hr light/dark cycle and were tested during their dark phase.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id

The Virtual Burrow Assay (VBA) consists of a tube enclosure (virtual burrow) constructed out of a cardboard tube (looming experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and aversive learning experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) or a 3D-printed polylactic acid tube (all other experiments, 45.5 mm inner diameter, 49 mm outer diameter, 7 cm long). In 3D-printed variants, the back of the tube is sealed and a trimmed absorbent underpad (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) is affixed to the bottom. For the air puff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), habituation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and aversive learning experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) the tube included a 1 cm wide extension spanning approximately 1/3 of the tube’s bottom circumference. In all designs, a 4 cm long, 0.5 mm diameter wooden rod is adhered to the front tip of the tube, 1 cm from the bottom, in order for animals to grip and rest their forelimbs. The diversity in tube material and geometry reflects the fact that assay design evolved concurrent with the sequence of experiments described in this manuscript. The final design of the tube (mark 21) can be consulted in the CAD folder on the GitHub repository: 3D-printed, including 1 cm extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fink and Schoonover, 2018</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/VBAcmd">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/VBAcmd</ext-link>).</p><p>The virtual burrow is coupled to near-frictionless air bushings at 14 psi input pressure (New Way Air Bearings, Aston, PA), which slide along two rails in order to constrain movement to one dimension (rail design and assembly: T. Tabachnik, ZMBBI Advanced Instrumentation, Columbia University: fabrication: Ronal Tool Company, Inc., York, PA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The animal is head-fixed via custom-machined stainless steel headplate holders (G. Johnson, Columbia University) that secure the titanium headplate. The entire VBA apparatus rests atop an adjustable platform (Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) to permit precise translation of the position of the tube with respect to the head. With t head thus secured, the animal’s body rests freely inside the virtual burrow, its forepaws resting on the horizontal bar placed at the burrow’s threshold, its hind limbs gripping the burrow’s interior</p><p>A linear actuator (Part number: L12-30-50-12-I, Firgelli Automations, Ferndale, WA), tethered to the virtual burrow with fishing line (0.15 mm diameter nylon tippet, 4.75 pound test, Orvis, Sunderland, VT) constrains how far the animal may ingress into the burrow at any given time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This parameter can be manually or programmatically varied over the course of the experiment. A force sensor (Futek FSH02664 load cell with Futek QSH00602 signal conditioner, Futek, Irvine, CA) reports whether, and how strongly, the animal is pulling against the linear actuator in its effort to ingress. Upon head-fixation in the VBA, mice invariably ingress as far as the linear actuator command position permits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). When the linear actuator retracts the burrow away from the ingress position (egress position, 10–20 mm posterior to ingress position), mice resist the translation, pulling against the tether in an effort to move the burrow back up around their body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This effort typically generates between 0.4 and 1 N of force, corresponding in some cases to more than three times animal’s own body weight (in grams-force). We have not observed any mice that fail to resist retraction of the virtual burrow.</p><p>A laser displacement sensor (Part number: ILD1302-50, Micro-Epsilon, Dorfbach, Germany) is aimed at a flag affixed to the horizontal bar that joins the air bearings in order to measure the linear displacement of the tube along its axis of motion. The readout of the laser displacement sensor yields a continuous, time-dependent, one-dimensional variable. It is this quantity – how far the animal has pulled the virtual burrow around its body – that tracks ingress in response to a given cue.</p><p>For all experiments reported here the analog voltage signals from the laser displacement sensor and the force meter were acquired and digitized at 10 kHz using a Cerebus Neural Signal Processor (Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, UT).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Trial structure and closed loop control</title><p>Before each trial the control system pulls the virtual burrow back to the egress position and waits until the force measured by the force meter drops below a user-specified threshold, indicating that the animal has ceased to resist burrow retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The linear actuator is then advanced to the ingress position, slackening the tether and permitting free movement of the burrow. If the animal spontaneously ingresses prior to stimulus onset, as measured by the laser displacement sensor, the trial is aborted, the burrow is again retracted to the egress position, and the sequence repeats. Once the mouse has maintained the free, egress position without attempting to ingress within a specified duration, and has maintained the standard deviation of the tube position below a user-specified threshold for a specified delay period, the stimulus is delivered. During stimulus presentation, and a set duration following stimulus offset, the control system is switched to open loop, permitting the mouse to pull the burrow up to the ingress position if it wishes.</p><p>The burrow position (measured by the laser displacement sensor), burrow force (measured by the force sensor), and the servo position (state of the linear actuator) are analog inputs to a National Instruments card with analog and digital in/out (USB-6008, National Instruments, Austin, TX). The servo position is controlled by the same National Instruments card. (The position and force signals are simultaneously acquired on a separate DAQ, as described in the previous section.)</p><p>Prior to testing, naïve mice are head-fixed in the VBA and given 2–10 mn to acclimate to the contingencies in open loop (free movement of the burrow). Without exception, mice maintain the burrow in the ingress position throughout this acclimation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Then they are acclimated to the closed loop mode; after an initial period of sustained struggle to maintain the burrow in the ingress position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), mice cease resisting and eventually consent to holding the burrow in the egress position even after the linear actuator has advanced, slackening the tether and granting the mouse control over the burrow. The duration of the closed-loop acclimation period varied across mice in these experiments (1–20 mn) as the experimenters improved upon and acquired experience withthe assay; presently mice do not require more than ~5 mn total acclimation time (typically two mn for open loop and ~3 mn for closed loop). Trial blocks begin once the animal reliably holds the burrow in the egress position for &gt;30 s between spontaneous ingresses. Trial initiation is delayed until after the mouse has held the burrow in the egress position with minimal movement for several seconds so as to ensure that the animal is in a comparable behavioral state prior to each trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Air puff stimulus</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Characterization of ingress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>)</title><p>Animals were head-fixed in the VBA and permitted to acclimate to head fixation for 2–4 mn with the VBA on open loop, after which the VBA was switched to the closed loop configuration; stimuli were administered once the animal readily gave trials (after approximately 1–2 mn). An 18-gauge, blunt syringe needle delivered air puff stimuli to elicit either ingress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, needle tip 2 mm from snout, air pressure 80 psi, puff duration 200 msec, ITI 180 s, 15 trials per animal), or flinch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, needle tip 150 mm from nose, air pressure 2 psi, puff duration 20 msec). The example traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref> depict responses to 15 consecutive strong air puff stimuli (2B) and one weak air puff stimulus (2C) delivered to a single, representative animal. The population statistics reported in the results section were measured in a separate cohort of 5 mice (three trials each) that had previously been exposed to odor stimuli in the course of an unrelated experiment in which they were administered a saline vehicle subcutaneously approximately 45mn prior to data acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Tube/platform variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>)</title><p>We employed the same protocol as above, except using 250 msec puff duration and &gt;90 s ITI, four animals per condition, three trials per animal; because mice occasionally bumped the tip of the blunt syringe needle when it was positioned close to their hindquarters, a distance of 10 mm was employed when puffing both the hindquarters and the snout. In order to deliver air puffs to the hindquarters a variant of the 3D-printed tube was designed such that the top portion (10 mm) of the tube’s back ‘wall’ was left open. We note that it took great effort and time for animals to maintain a stable position on the open platform as they initially tended to thrash around and occasionally rotate their bodies at a &gt; 45 degree angle with respect to the axis of their heads; this contrasts sharply with the apparently calm demeanor and stable posture characteristic of animals standing inside of tubes. Puffs were administered to the snout after animals had maintained a stable posture in which the body axis was aligned with the head’s for &gt;5 s.</p><p>To determine latency of the air puff, we measured the time between the TTL pulse controlling valve opening and the displacement of a small polystyrene weighing boat placed 2 mm distant from the blunt syringe needle (data not shown). We then subtracted the time between TTL pulse and measured displacement to determine the latency between TTL command and air puff stimulus at the nose. To account for variability in the position of the nose of the mouse with respect to the needle tip, we varied the precise location of the syringe needle over a range of distances similar to variability in distance between the syringe needle and the animal’s nose across experiments. We observed negligible variability in latencies across this distance range.</p><p>For this and all experiments, a background of bandpass-filtered acoustic white noise (1000–45000 Hz; approximately 7 dB) was played throughout. The VBA apparatus was placed inside a custom-made sound attenuating chamber resting on an air table (TMC, Peabody, MA). All experiments were conducted under conditions of darkness, except when visual stimuli were presented, in which case the visual stimuli themselves provided the only source of visible illumination. The VBA was illuminated with infrared light to permit simultaneous video recording. For the experiments studying responses to visual stimuli, the chamber was open to accommodate the display screen but the lights in the room were off and the door was closed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Visual stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>)</title><p>For experiments examining responses to visual stimuli, nine mice (three per condition) were acclimated to head fixation in the VBA for 3 mn in the open loop configuration. Following a subsequent 10-mn acclimation period with the VBA in the closed loop configuration, the animal was again permitted to freely ingress in open loop for 3–5 mn. The VBA was then returned to the closed loop configuration and once the animal did not spontaneously ingress for periods greater than 30 s (typically after approximately 1–3 mn) visual stimuli were delivered.</p><p>The visual stimuli employed were based on those described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Franceschi et al. (2016)</xref>. Briefly, the stimuli were presented on a Dell 1707FP 17’ LCD monitor, 1280 × 1024, 60 Hz, elevated 30 cm and centered above the animal’s head. The three stimuli, generated using the Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA), consisted of a black disk presented against a gray background: expanding disk (‘loom’), widening from 2° to 50° over 250 msec, holding the 50° disk for 500 msec; contracting disk (‘recede’), diminishing from 50° to 2° over 250 msec, holding the 2° disk for 500 msec; and sweeping disk (‘sweep’), a 5° disk sweeping smoothly across the diagonal of the screen at a rate of 21°/sec. In order to permit synchronization of stimulus timing with burrow position measurement, the software controlling the visual stimulus also controlled a PWM signal (generated by an Arduino Uno, Adafruit, New York, NY; acquired as an analog voltage input digitized at 10 KHz simultaneous to the position and force signals) that encoded the identity and timing of the visual stimuli.</p><p>We divided nine mice into three groups of three animals, one group per stimulus type, and presented each mouse only one of the stimulus types in a single session of five stimulus presentations separated by a 10-mn ITI. The data for each stimulus type are pooled across animals for each group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Odorant stimuli </title><p>In all experiments involving odorant stimuli we avoided using molecules known to elicit systematic attraction or aversion in freely moving animals, such as trimethyl-thiazoline, a volatile cue secreted from the anal gland of fox that elicits avoidance and fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hebb et al., 2004</xref>) or 2-phenylethanol, a component of rose oil that elicits attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Root et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We used a custom-built olfactometer to deliver odorant stimuli. Briefly, a nose port constructed of polyether ether ketone (PEEK) was placed approximately 1 mm away from the animal’s nose. When no odorant stimulus was given, the port delivered a steady stream of air (one liter per minute, controlled by a mass flow controller, GFCS-010201 from Aalborg, Orangeburg, New York) that had bubbled through a 50 ml glass bottle containing 15 ml dipropylene glycol (DPG, Part number: D215554, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). To deliver an odorant stimulus, a four-way valve (Part number: LSH360T041, NResearch Inc., West Caldwell, NJ) routed the air stream to exhaust, replacing it with a stream of odorized air; the odorant stimulus was switched off by the four-way valve routing the odorized air back to exhaust. Monomolecular odorants (cis-3-Hexen-1-ol, catalog number W256307; (R)-(+)-Limonene, catalog number 183164; Octanal, catalog number O5608; Ethyl trans-3-hexenoate, catalog number W334200, all from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were dissolved in 15 ml DPG at a concentration of 2% volume/volume for Hexenol, Limonene, and Octanal and 4% volume/volume for Ethyl trans-3-hexenoate in separate 50 ml glass bottles. After passing through the nose port all gas was routed to a photo-ionization detector (miniPID, Aurora Scientific, Aurora, ON, Canada) to permit constant monitoring of odorant concentration. To avoid contamination, all material in contact with the odorized air stream was constructed in either Teflon, Tefzel, or PEEK. The flow of the air and odor streams were equalized before each experiment (using mass flow meter GFMS-010786 from Aalborg, Orangeburg, NY) and the tubing carrying the two streams from the four way valve was set to equal length and impedance to minimize variation in flow rate upon switching between the air and odor streams.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Odor habituation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>)</title><p>For odor habituation experiments, five mice were head-fixed in the VBA and allowed to acclimate in the open loop configuration for 5 mn. In order to promote all-or-nothing behavioral responses, we reduced the input pressure to the air bushings from the customary 14 psi to 2 psi, thereby requiring the animal to generate greater force to initiate an ingress than under near-frictionless conditions. After acclimation the VBA was set to closed loop for 10–15 mn. Following acclimation to the closed-loop mode, the animal was then presented with odorant stimuli with the VBA in the closed loop mode. A single odorant, Odor 1 was presented 15 times. Then, a second odorant, Odor 2, was introduced and the two odorants were presented 15 times each, pseudo-randomly interleaved within blocks in which each of the two odorants was presented in every block. Finally, a third odorant, Odor 3, was added and all three odorants were presented in 15 final blocks of three trials each. Each odorant stimulus was presented once per block. All odorant stimuli were 8 s in duration and the ITI was 40 s. Limonene, Octanal, and Hexenol were used as odorant stimuli with different animals receiving different odorants for the Odor 1, Odor 2, and Odor three stimuli (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Because we refrained from using odors known to elicit innate attraction or aversion such as trimethyl-thiazoline, or 2-phenylethanol, it is unlikely that the egress and ingress responses we observed in early trials were due to the odorants having an innately attractive or aversive quality beyond their novelty.</p><p>We noted that we did not observe renewed ingress to familiar odorants following presentation of unexpected ones. This absence of dishabituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groves and Thompson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thompson and Spencer, 1966</xref>) may reflect the use of lower input pressure to the air bushings in this experiment, which promotes all-or-nothing responses by increasing friction between the bearings and the rails but also dramatically decreases the sensitivity of the assay.</p><p>For the exploration experiments, the VBA control software was set to open loop mode and the fixed odor port was replaced with an odor port coupled to the virtual burrow, such that the animal was required to egress approximately 30 mm from the fully ingressed position to touch the port with its nose. The odorant stimuli (Ethyl trans-3-hexenoate) were 8 s in duration and the ITI was 60–120 s. In the rare instances during which the animal was not ingressed at the conclusion of the ITI, stimulus delivery was delayed until the animal had resumed a fully ingressed position.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Odor-shock conditioning and testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>)</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>1: Pre-test</title><p>The nine mice used in odor-conditioning experiments were first habituated to the three odorant stimuli employed (CS+: Limonene, CS-: Hexenol, Odor3: Octanal). Animals were placed in the VBA and acclimated to head fixation for 5 mn with the VBA in open loop, after which the VBA was switched to closed loop for 10 mn. Following the 10-mn closed loop acclimation period, the VBA was restored to the open loop configuration for 5 mn to permit the animal to freely ingress before testing, and then returned to closed loop immediately before commencing odorant stimulus delivery. Odorant stimuli (8 s duration) were presented in 10 blocks of three pseudo-randomly interleaved trials (60 s ITI) such that each stimulus was presented once per block. Following completion of the 10 stimulus blocks, animals were immediately removed from the VBA and returned to their home cage. Air pressure in the air bearings was set to 3 psi during habituation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Day 2: Conditioning</title><p>Conditioning was performed one day after odor habituation. A fear conditioning chamber (14.2 mm wide, 16.2 mm long, 12.6 mm high, Med Associates, Fairfax, VT) was employed. Under conditions of darkness with an acoustic background of white noise, mice were placed inside the fear conditioning chamber on the open, gloved hand of the experimenter. Once the animal had freely entered the fear conditioning chamber, the door was closed and the animal was allowed to acclimate for 5 mn. Eight blocks of CS+ and CS- odorant stimuli were presented in pairs of pseudo-randomly interleaved trials. The odorant stimuli were 10 s in duration with a 5-mn ITI. During the final 2 s of presentation of the CS+ stimulus only, the floor of the fear conditioning chamber was electrified (intensity 0.70–0.73 mAmp). Upon completion of all eight trials, the mouse was permitted to recover for 5 mn in the fear conditioning chamber and then returned to its home cage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Day 3: Test</title><p>One day after conditioning animals were returned to the VBA to test responses to all odorant stimuli. Test was identical to pre-test except that eleven stimulus blocks were presented and air pressure in the VBA air bearings was set to 15 psi.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Neurophysiological recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>)</title><p>Electrophysiology was performed using silicon probes (A1 × 32-Poly3-5mm-25s-177-H32_21 mm, NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI) chronically implanted into anterior piriform cortex (APC). At least one week following headplate attachment, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylezine and a craniotomy centered 1,150 µm posterior to the rostral confluence of the dorsal sinuses and 2,250 µm lateral to the midline was performed using a dental drill (Osada Success 40, Osada Electric Company, Tokyo, Japan). The probe was lowered until the dense spiking characteristic of layer 2 of APC was detected, at which point it was cemented in place. Animals were allowed to recover for at least four weeks before any recording took place to allow for the tissue to fully settle around the implanted probe.</p><p>Neural signals were acquired simultaneous to behavior using a Cerebus Neural Signal Processor (Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, UT). Custom written scripts in Matlab were then used to filter and preprocess the data, which were then automatically spike sorted using Kilosort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>) and manually curated using phy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kwikteam/phy">https://github.com/kwikteam/phy</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>To determine whether responses in the VBA differed across experimental conditions, we asked whether the likelihood of ingress was larger in one condition than another.

For each condition we pooled all ingress responses across mice and used a two-proportion z-test with the null hypothesis that the probability of ingress in the tested condition was less than or equal to the probability of ingress in the other condition. In figures, one star (*) indicates p&lt;0.05, two stars (**) indicate p&lt;0.01, and three stars (***) indicate p&lt;0.001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to Tanya Tabachnik for the design and fabrication of the frictionless rail; Hopi E Hoekstra and Caroline K Hu for helpful conversations regarding burrowing behavior, as well as for providing unpublished video of mice in the wild; Ya-tang Li, Markus Meister and Samuel G Solomon for advice on flight-inducing visual stimuli; John P Cunningham for advice on statistical analyses; Gary W Johnson for precision machining; J Andrew Miri for suggesting the use of a frictionless rail; Paul R Stegall and Damiano Zanatto for advice on mechanical engineering; Alberto Hernandez for supplying cardboard tubes; Annegret L Falkner for Friday night science; D Caroline Blanchard, Rui M Costa, Walter M Fischler, John W Krakauer, Eve Marder, and Catherine H Rankin for critical comments on the manuscript; Ethan S Bromberg-Martin, Michael E Goldberg, and Alla Y Karpova for insightful comments; and the 2016 Janelia Junior Scientist Workshop on Neural Circuits and Behavior.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing; This paper is the result of a close collaboration between AJPF and CES, who made equal contributions to the project</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All of the animals were handled according to approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocols AC-AAAI8650 and AC-AAAT5466 of Columbia University Medical Center.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Peggy Mason as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Venkatesh N Murthy (Reviewer #2); Michael Brecht (Reviewer #4).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the setup could be useful but they also remained unconvinced that the behavior exhibited by the mice represents burrow ingress and egress. One simple alternative explanation is that the mouse is backing away from a noxious or aversive stimulus and approaching to explore a novel stimulus.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a clever method to look at ethologically relevant behavior in a setup highly conducive to neurophysiological recordings. The setup is simple, the mice perform easily and without training and the timing is amenable to synaptic circuit analysis.</p><p>Two suggestions for short (1-3 sentence) discussions that could add value to the reader. 1) Is there a reason why an extension of the top of the tube was not used that would cover the head? Put another way, the natural behavior is diagonally oriented and involves head covering in the axis of the body whereas this setup is horizontal and does not cover the head. 2) The latency to ingress to puff 18-19 ms compared to that of CS+ presentation ~700 ms is fascinating. A comment or two on the supporting circuits would be helpful. Is this latency compatible with the amygdala-involving circuits that have been sketched out? It would seem a bit long. In any case, this latency difference constrains the conditioning circuits to something beyond oligosynaptic.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper Fink et al. describe a novel apparatus which allows mice to exhibit burrowing-like behavior while head-fixed. The authors demonstrate that mice quickly learn to push or pull in order to cause a tube surrounding their body to come forward to more fully cover their body or to go backward to expose their body. They demonstrate that the mice do this movement very quickly and in a stereotyped manner. They also show that mice tend to treat the tube as if it was a naturalistic burrow (although the mice themselves are not moving), by &quot;burrowing&quot; in response to airpuff and in response to a looming visual stimulus of increasing size. They then demonstrate that when the position in the tube is coupled with odor intensity to imitate the action of exiting the burrow to explore an odor source or retreating back away from the odor source, that the mice tend to exhibit exploratory behavior by occasionally &quot;exiting&quot; to explore new odors, but quickly becoming habituated to them. Finally, the authors also condition the mice to associate one odor with a foot shock and demonstrate that the mice tend to &quot;retreat&quot; from this odor as compared to an odor which was not coupled with foot shock. Overall, this behavioral assay seems to work well and is a nice addition to the behavioral assays that can be performed on head-fixed mice. However, I'm not convinced that this method in itself is an advance significant enough to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>It's unclear how much of the behavior that the authors demonstrate is a result of the tube/burrow. For example, head-fixed mice tend to attempt to retreat from aversive stimuli like an airpuff even in the absence of the tube (easily seen and quantified from videos, for example). If the authors could compare with tube and without tube conditions and demonstrate that the tube makes a difference this would be more convincing. It seems important to add controls experiments to prove that the mouse's behavior is indeed a burrowing behavior, and not just a retreat response. This could be implemented, for example, by removing the top half of the tube and keeping everything else the same.</p><p>In general, while I agree that the time resolution of measuring the behavior readout could be an advantage over other behaviors such as freezing. But I fail to see its advantage over the measurement of other fast readouts, such as measuring blinking and limb motions with a high-speed camera, or measuring retreating movement on a moving belt.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Fink et al. develop a head fixed apparatus for measuring mouse response to a variety of stimuli such as air puff, looming stimulus and odor presentations. Depending on whether the animals move forward or backward, they will either push or pull a tube (the &quot;burrow&quot;) away from or around their body. The authors demonstrate that many of the behaviors probed do not require extensive training or acclimation. The apparatus allows for millisecond precision measurements of innate animal responses to stimuli in a way that is compatible with &quot;standard electrophysiological and optical methods&quot;. While there are some novel aspects to the study, some major points limit my enthusiasm.</p><p>1) It is unclear if the &quot;burrow&quot; is at all required for the behaviors and animal responses probed here. Without a comparison to a situation without a burrow, how can the authors argue that this is a virtual burrowing assay? For example, if the authors simply placed a mouse on a platform (without a cover) or on a treadmill, could they have measured the same responses to stimuli? To put it another way, how do the authors argue against the idea that mice are not displaying ingress to a burrow, but are instead just backing up away from an aversive stimulus?</p><p>2) Sharp transitions in behavioral state will likely lead to significant brain motion that could preclude measurements with &quot;standard electrophysiological and optical methods&quot;. The authors do not provide references for the methods to which they are referring. Assuming they are referring to high resolution imaging, single unit recording, and intracellular recording (among other methods), then these movements could substantially limit recording compatibility. This needs to be explicitly addressed.</p><p>3) A large suite of head-fixed behaviors already exist and it is not clear in the current manuscript how the &quot;burrowing&quot; assay compares and contrasts to these. For example, head-fixed odor assays (see for example research from the Rinberg or Bozza labs), numerous head-fixed airpuff response assays, and even head-fixed olfactory virtual reality behaviors measuring odor valence already exist (Radvansky et al).</p><p>4) The following requires quantification: &quot;When placed inside the virtual burrow, mice invariably pull the tube up around themselves as far as possible-a behavior we define as &quot;ingress&quot; (Figure 1A, right). When granted full control over the virtual burrow, mice prefer to remain ingressed…&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>In their paper 'A naturalistic assay of habituation, discrimination, explorationand avoidance at millisecond precision in head-fixed mice' Fink et al. describe a virtual burrow set up for neuroscientific experiments. The authors convincingly argue that the virtual burrow system is a simple arrangement that exploits natural response tendencies of mice. The authors describe the system and then demonstrate that air puffs and looming visual stimuli trigger 'ingress' responses as such stimuli would in natural burrows. They also demonstrate olfactory behaviors and conditioning effects. The apparatus the authors describe is rather simple and I initially wondered if the findings constitute enough novelty for an <italic>eLife</italic> paper. Because so many investigators work with head-fixed mice, the potential usefulness of the technique and observations wins out over these other concerns, however. Thus, I am in principle supportive of this study. The presentation needs to be improved along the lines specified below.</p><p>Improving the presentation:</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>Figure 1B is most important panel of all figures and the paper. It looks good, but is not very helpful and far from ideal. It does not become clear here, which parts slide and how the mouse can egress and ingress. Equally disturbing is that other parts that are specified in the rather complex schematic in Figure 1C, i.e. the odor delivery, cannot be found here. I suggest enlarging panel 1B and adding explanations etc. Figure 1C, D should be decomplexified, we are not talking about Hodgkin and Huxley here, but about a rather simple behavioral control system.</p><p>Figure 2</p><p>Figure 2B, what exactly is plotted on the Y-axis? I did not get panel 2C from the figure or reading the legend, what exactly is plotted on the Y-axis? Please clarify.</p><p>Figure 3</p><p>Figure 3 is nice. It might be helpful to repeat the terms loom, recede, sweep also in panel A.</p><p>Figure 4</p><p>Figure 4E: The visual impression I get from Figure 4E is that the animals is egressing much more than it is ingressing. If I got the rest of the figure correctly the opposite is true, so the schematic is not ideal.</p><p>Figure 4F: Along the same line, maybe it would be good to indicate a 'zero/starting position' as a dashed line.</p><p>Figure 5</p><p>Figure 5 is rather busy, yet the findings are straightforward. Simplify.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Virtual burrow assay for headfixed mice measures habituation, discrimination, exploration and avoidance without training&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Peggy Mason as Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Venkatesh N Murthy (Reviewer #2); Michael Brecht (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Thank you for the responsive revisions. I would ask that you consider reviewer 1's concerns and add text to address these issues, particularly the issues of repeated use of the paradigm over multiple days and a comparison to previous head fixed olfaction methods. Reviewer 1 also suggests that adding in a platform condition with a back puff would make the control more complete. Please address this with either more experiments or a brief reason why more experiments would not enlighten.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In their revision, Fink et al. present a substantially improved manuscript through the addition of data demonstrating that the burrow itself is actually needed for the VBA (Figure 2D-F). The addition of silicon probe single unit recording data during sharp movements is also a major improvement (Figure 7). These improvements address my previous main concerns. After reading the new manuscript, I have a few more concerns that I feel should be addressed before publication:</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate that no training is required for the VBA, however, in order for the apparatus to be of maximal use in the community, the behaviors probed with the VBA should persist for many sessions/days. Figure 5 begins to get at this question (same mice over 2 different days), but I feel that this point should be addressed more directly; this could be accomplished with some added discussion, or with data that the authors may already have showing other VBA behavioral responses over days with the same mice.</p><p>2) Figure 2E, F: for completeness, the puff back condition should be included for the platform case.</p><p>3) Introduction, second paragraph: Since one major application of the VBA appears to be to olfactory responses (Figures 4 and 5), it seems appropriate to cite and discuss some previous methods using olfactory stimuli in head-fixed mice here: Lovett-Barron, 2014; Radvansky, 2018; Resulaj, 2015.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I don't have any technical comment for this revision because I think the behavior and setup are now well characterized.</p><p>The control experiments the authors performed definitely help to support the claim that the mice are performing a burrowing-like behavior rather than just backing away from the aversive stimulus. With the other advantages of this behavior (no need for pre-training, reliable responses, fast latency) which the authors describe, we can conclude that this behavioral setup is likely a useful tool addition to many other behavioral measures already in use (eye blink conditioning, freezing, licking, sniffing, virtual reality navigation, and so on). I continue to wonder whether developing a behavioral paradigm, with little by way of new neural or behavioral insight, is a significant advance in itself for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> – but I will be glad to leave the decision to the editors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper improved substantially.

However, I'm not convinced that this method in itself is an advance significant enough to warrant publication in eLife.</p><p>It's unclear how much of the behavior that the authors demonstrate is a result of the tube/burrow. For example, head-fixed mice tend to attempt to retreat from aversive stimuli like an airpuff even in the absence of the tube (easily seen and quantified from videos, for example). If the authors could compare with tube and without tube conditions and demonstrate that the tube makes a difference this would be more convincing. It seems important to add controls experiments to prove that the mouse's behavior is indeed a burrowing behavior, and not just a retreat response. This could be implemented, for example, by removing the top half of the tube and keeping everything else the same.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed two control experiments to address this concern (Figure 2D-F).

Without a comparison to a situation without a burrow, how can the authors argue that this is a virtual burrowing assay? For example, if the authors simply placed a mouse on a platform (without a cover) or on a treadmill, could they have measured the same responses to stimuli? To put it another way, how do the authors argue against the idea that mice are not displaying ingress to a burrow, but are instead just backing up away from an aversive stimulus?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed two control experiments to address this concern (Figure 2D-F).

The authors do not provide references for the methods to which they are referring. Assuming they are referring to high resolution imaging, single unit recording, and intracellular recording (among other methods), then these movements could substantially limit recording compatibility. This needs to be explicitly addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a figure (Figure 7) showing stability of neurophysiological recording of single units using silicon probes taken simultaneous to sharp transitions in behavioral state in the VBA. We have also included in the main text a personal communication from a colleague reporting similar success with measurement of Calcium transients using 2photon microscopy through a GRIN lens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A large suite of head-fixed behaviors already exist and it is not clear in the current manuscript how the &quot;burrowing&quot; assay compares and contrasts to these. For example, head-fixed odor assays (see for example research from the Rinberg or Bozza labs), numerous head-fixed airpuff response assays, and even head-fixed olfactory virtual reality behaviors measuring odor valence already exist (Radvansky et al).</p></disp-quote><p>The vast majority of currently employed behavioral assays for head-fixed mice require prior training in the sensorimotor contingencies of the instrument (for a simple case, see for e.g. Guo et al., 2014); even learning how to locomote on a virtual-reality treadmill while head-fixed (Dombeck et al., 2010) requires several days of acclimation and training; in practice it is not uncommon to discard animals that are not able to perform adequately given the contingencies (for e.g. in the Radvansky et al. study that cited, the authors attempted to train 18 mice but only 9 showed &quot;acceptable behavior&quot;). Given that current head-fixed assays depend upon learned behaviors to report sensory or cognitive quantities, and given that task proficiency is highly variable across animals, it is reasonable to expect that this variability would contaminate the measurement of even simple quantities such as sensory detection thresholds.</p><p>Furthermore, training engages circuitry that may be unrelated to the sensory or cognitive faculty under study, such as: modules that signal satiation, reward, or punishment; modules that implement the learning of the task's structure; and modules that implement the learning, planning, and execution of motor skills. Thus training introduces several layers of complexity in between the sensory or cognitive operations that are the object of study and the behavior that is observed in order to infer their properties. These additional layers are likely to further muddy the already challenging interpretation of lesion or perturbation studies (Wolff and Ölveczky, 2018), or of the relationship between neural activity and concomitant behavior.</p><p>In contrast, we have demonstrated that the VBA can measure a diversity of behaviors, ranging from innate avoidance and fear conditioning to stimulus discrimination and exploration, without the need for any training, or even prior acclimation to head-fixation. Indeed most of the data reported in this manuscript was acquired within minutes of the animals being head-fixed for the first time in their lives (while awake), and the fact that no animals were excluded from analysis speaks to the behavioral stereotypy we encountered. Naturally, we are not claiming that this device affords direct observation of the function of sensory and cognitive modules--but by tapping into behaviors that all animals produce &quot;out of the box&quot; instead of relying on training the VBA stands to dramatically reduce the complexity of the system necessary to produce meaningful behavior under head fixation.</p><p>In addition there are several other key ways in which the VBA represents an advance over existing behavioral assays for head-fixed mice.</p><p>- As an assay of Pavlovian fear conditioning, the VBA provides a precise time stamp of the onset of the conditioned response. To date, the most successful measurement of fear conditioning in head-fixed mice has resulted from the translation of conditioned lick-suppression paradigms (Bouton and Bolles, 1980, Lovett-Barron et al., 2014). However, in both freely moving and head-fixed mice, this method lacks fine temporal resolution, and moreover the behavioral readout is significantly more complex—the result of an interaction between an operant behavior (licking, which has to be trained) and a conditioned response.</p><p>- The VBA’s sensitive readout of motor output permits isolation of distinct, subtle behavioral motifs. This is exemplified, for example, in the resolution of “tremble” responses to conditioned odor stimuli (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) or the precise measurement of core and limb strength exerted by the mice (such as the force they exert in their attempts to resist the action of the linear actuator)—neither of which have been reported in head-fixed mice, to our knowledge.</p><p>- The selective ingress responses to looming visual stimuli we report in Figure 3 illustrate how ingress in the VBA can be used to study innate flight-like behavior. We are not aware of any head-fixed assay for responses to looming visual stimuli in head-fixed mice—or, for that matter, flight-like responses in general. You highlighted a recently published assay (Radvansky et al., 2018) that measures avoidance of innately aversive odorant stimuli; this approach contrasts with ours in that (1) it appears to measure avoidance rather than flight and (2) requires training in the sensorimotor contingencies of the assay.</p><p>- The VBA provides a sensitive assay of habituation to olfactory stimuli (Figure 4). While there exist head-fixed assays for habituation to novel odors (e.g. Verhagen et al., 2007), these rely on measurement of the sniff rate. However in our hands this paradigm has proven unreliable and noisy; in fact, part of the motivation for developing the VBA was our dissatisfaction with this method. Using ingress (4BC) rather than sniff rate has yielded results that are substantially cleaner and consistent across animals. Selective ingress to novel odors (Figure 4B-C) can be used as a sensory detection/discrimination assay without requiring the extensive training typically required for these kinds of measurements (cf. Guo et al., 2014). We note that here training introduces an additional complexity: as the animals gain proficiency in the task, this is likely to result in perceptual learning (Fahle and Poggio, 2002), causing overestimation of default perceptual performance.</p><p>- The configuration of the assay described in Figure 4E-H, in which the odor source is coupled to the tube itself, requires the animal to override its strong drive to stay inside the enclosure in order to better sample the stimulus outside. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of the measurement of exploration in headfixed mice.</p><p>A summary of this response to your concern has now been included in the text. In particular, the Introduction has been rewritten so that the focus is on the principal difference between the VBA and the large suite of already existing head-fixed behavioral assays (training) and the discussion compares and contrasts the VBA with other existing assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The following requires quantification: &quot;When placed inside the virtual burrow, mice invariably pull the tube up around themselves as far as possible-a behavior we define as &quot;ingress&quot; (Figure 1A, right). When granted full control over the virtual burrow, mice prefer to remain ingressed…&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a panel (Figure 1C) that plots example traces and quantifies position during open-loop mode (habituation). This comment prompted us to also add a second panel (Figure 1D) that quantifies measurements of the resistance animals exhibit when they are pulled out of the tube.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>[…] The presentation needs to be improved along the lines specified below.</p><p>Improving the presentation:</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>Figure 1B is most important panel of all figures and the paper. It looks good, but is not very helpful and far from ideal. It does not become clear here, which parts slide and how the mouse can egress and ingress. Equally disturbing is that other parts that are specified in the rather complex schematic in Figure 1C, i.e. the odor delivery, cannot be found here. I suggest enlarging panel 1B and adding explanations etc. Figure 1C, D should be decomplexified, we are not talking about Hodgkin and Huxley here, but about a rather simple behavioral control system.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reworked Figure 1 and the associated text to present the assay more clearly; we have cut 1C and 1D, moving them to a figure supplement, in order to focus on the core features of the assay; and we have added two videos (Figure 1—videos 1 and 2) to illustrate its operation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2</p><p>Figure 2B, what exactly is plotted on the Y-axis?

Legend for 2C reads: “Example of flinch in response to weak air puff. Downward going, approximately 2-Hz oscillations correspond to the animal’s breathing cycle. Upward going low-amplitude, transient deflection corresponds to startle in response to air puff (grey box, 20 msec, 2 psi).” Text for 2C reads: “It was also possible on occasion to induce a flinch, rather than ingress, by delivering a very weak air puff (2 psi, 15 cm distance). This apparent startle response (Davis, 1984) is characterized by a transient change in burrow position clearly distinct from the ongoing movement of the burrow caused by the animal’s breathing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3</p><p>Figure 3 is nice.

I would ask that you consider reviewer 1's concerns and add text to address these issues, particularly the issues of repeated use of the paradigm over multiple days and a comparison to previous head fixed olfaction methods. Reviewer 1 also suggests that adding in a platform condition with a back puff would make the control more complete. Please address this with either more experiments or a brief reason why more experiments would not enlighten.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In their revision, Fink et al. present a substantially improved manuscript through the addition of data demonstrating that the burrow itself is actually needed for the VBA (Figure 2D-F). The addition of silicon probe single unit recording data during sharp movements is also a major improvement (Figure 7). These improvements address my previous main concerns. After reading the new manuscript, I have a few more concerns that I feel should be addressed before publication:</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate that no training is required for the VBA, however, in order for the apparatus to be of maximal use in the community, the behaviors probed with the VBA should persist for many sessions/days. Figure 5 begins to get at this question (same mice over 2 different days), but I feel that this point should be addressed more directly; this could be accomplished with some added discussion, or with data that the authors may already have showing other VBA behavioral responses over days with the same mice.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript now includes a new figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) that describes the behavior of a cohort of mice tested in the VBA on four separate days over a 16-day interval. We find that repeated introduction into the VBA does not affect the animals’ behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2E, F: for completeness, the puff back condition should be included for the platform case.</p></disp-quote><p>The puff back condition is now included for the platform case in Figure 2D-F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Introduction, second paragraph: Since one major application of the VBA appears to be to olfactory responses (Figures 4 and 5), it seems appropriate to cite and discuss some previous methods using olfactory stimuli in head-fixed mice here: Lovett-Barron, 2014; Radvansky, 2018; Resulaj, 2015.</p></disp-quote><p>Radvansky, 2018, is now cited in the Introduction as an example of an olfactory behavioral paradigm that requires acclimation to head fixation and training, in contrast with the VBA.</p><p>We note that Lovett-Baron, 2014, was already given more detailed treatment in the Discussion regarding Figure 5 (with respect to the low temporal resolution of conditioned lick suppression) so we feel it is unnecessary to also cite it in the Introduction--especially since the focus of the second paragraph is on the challenges imposed by reliance on training-based paradigms, not on the temporal resolution of the assay. Since Guo, 2014, describes training animals to discriminate both somatosensory and olfactory stimuli, it seems redundant to also include a second reference (Resulaj, 2015) about olfaction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
