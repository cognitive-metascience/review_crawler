ways: it either engages ACVR1B to activate Smad2/3 signaling or binds ACVR1 to form a non-signaling complex (NSC). Although the former property has been studied extensively, the roles of the NSC remain unexplored. The genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) provides a unique window into ACVR1/Activin A signaling because in that disease Activin can either signal through FOP-mutant ACVR1 or form NSCs with wild-type ACVR1. To explore the role of the NSC, we generated âagonist-onlyâ Activin A muteins that activate ACVR1B but cannot form the NSC with ACVR1. Using one of these muteins, we demonstrate that failure to form the NSC in FOP results in more severe disease pathology. These results provide the first evidence for a biological role for the NSC in vivo and pave the way for further exploration of the NSCâs physiological role in corresponding knock-in mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>activin A</kwd><kwd>ACVR1</kwd><kwd>fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>bone morphogenetic proteins</kwd><kwd>ACVR1B</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors declare that there was no funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The non-signaling complex formed by Activin A and ACVR1 is operant in vivo and is required to temper the degree of heterotopic ossification in the genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Activin A is a protein that belongs to the TGFÃ/BMP family of ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hinck et al., 2016</xref>). These ligands initiate signaling by driving the formation of heterotetrameric complexes of their cognate type I and type II receptors, and where a dimeric ligand brings together two type I and two type II receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yadin et al., 2016</xref>). There are seven type I and five type II receptors that mediate signaling for this family of ligands. The choice of type I receptor in the signaling complex is the main determinant of which of two signaling pathways is activated: Smad1/5/8, when the type I receptors are ACVRL1, ACVR1, BMPR1A, or BMPR1B; and Smad2/3, when the type I receptors are ACVR1B, TGFBR1, or ACVR1C. Activin A utilizes ACVR1B as its type I receptor in conjunction with the type II receptors ACVR2A, ACVR2B, and, to a lesser extent, BMPR2 to signal through Smad2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aykul et al., 2017</xref>). The biological functions of Activin A have been investigated widely using multiple approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makanji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Namwanje and Brown, 2016</xref>) including reverse genetics experiments wherein the gene encoding for Activin A â <italic>Inhba</italic> â has been âknocked outâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archambeault and Yao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matzuk et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pangas et al., 2007</xref>). The results of those experiments have been largely interpreted in the context of Activin A acting as an agonist of ACVR1B to induce Smad2/3 or other signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archambeault and Yao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makanji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Namwanje and Brown, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pangas et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, ACVR1 was originally cloned as the type I receptor for Activin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attisano et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsuchida et al., 1993</xref>), but the inability of Activin A to activate ACVR1, followed by the discovery that BMP7 activates it, led to a ârelabelingâ of ACVR1 as a BMP receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacÃ­as-Silva et al., 1998</xref>). However, recent studies pinpoint a previously unrecognized property of Activin A: that it can engage the type I receptor ACVR1, to form an ACVR1â¢Activin Aâ¢type II receptor non-signaling complex (NSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olsen et al., 2015</xref>). This NSC is unique in that its stoichiometry is identical to that of corresponding signaling complexes formed between the same receptors and BMPs, but also in that it is converted into a signaling complex in the ACVR1-driven genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). Excluding the special situation of FOP (see below), the NSC functions to tie down Activin A and render it unavailable for signaling, but also to tie down the type II receptors and ACVR1 and render them unavailable for engagement with BMPs, hence resulting in an apparent inhibition of ACVR1-mediated BMP signaling; in cells where ACVR1 is the main type I receptor, Activin A inhibits BMP6- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>) and BMP7-induced signaling (this work).</p><p>The picture is more complex in FOP. FOP is a rare autosomal-dominant genetic disorder that arises from missense mutations in the sequence encoding the intracellular domain of ACVR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katagiri et al., 2018</xref>). The most clinically important feature of FOP is the episodic, yet progressive and cumulative, formation of heterotopic bone in connective tissue, a process referred to as heterotopic ossification (HO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">HÃ¼ning and Gillessen-Kaesbach, 2014</xref>). FOP-mutant variants of ACVR1 display the neomorphic property of recognizing Activin A (as well as other Activins) as an agonistic ligand, much like a BMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hino et al., 2015</xref>). In mouse FOP, activation of FOP-mutant ACVR1 by Activin A is required for HO, as demonstrated by experiments where inhibition of Activin A, using highly specific monoclonal antibodies, halts both the occurrence and the progression of HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Upadhyay et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, in FOP, the ACVR1[FOP mutant]â¢Activin Aâ¢type II receptor complex, which is stoichiometrically identical to the NSC, acts as a signaling complex. However, since FOP is autosomal-dominant, one wild-type copy of ACVR1 remains operational and hence capable of sequestering Activin A in NSCs. In mouse FOP, removal of the wild-type copy of <italic>Acvr1</italic> exacerbates the degree of HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018b</xref>). These data are consistent with a model where loss of wild-type ACVR1 results in loss of the NSC and concomitant increase in the number of active complexes between Activin A and FOP-mutant ACVR1. Whereas these results indicate that the NSC is operant in vivo, they do not provide direct evidence for the NSC, and also do not inform whether there are other biological roles for the NSC.</p><p>To date, there has been no systematic exploration of the biological roles of the NSC either within or outside of FOP. Outside of FOP, exploration of the NSC has been limited to myeloma cells in culture, wherein Activin A protects them from BMP9-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olsen et al., 2015</xref>); whether a similar phenomenon takes place in vivo is currently unknown. In order to begin to address such knowledge gaps, we engineered a set of âagonist-onlyâ Activin A muteins that retain their ability to activate ACVR1B but fail to form the NSC with ACVR1. Using these muteins, we show that the finger two tip loop (F2TL) region of Activin A is critical for the formation of the NSC, and we obtain conclusive in vivo evidence that the NSC is required for tempering the degree of HO in mouse FOP. Our successful engineering and in vivo application of agonist-only Activin A to explore the role of the NSC in FOP sets the stage for further exploration of the wider physiological roles of the NSC using the corresponding knock-in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The ACVR1â¢Activin Aâ¢type II receptor complex does not transduce signal</title><p>Before exploring the NSC in detail, we first revisited our initial finding that Activin A can form a complex with ACVR1 and Type II receptor but cannot stimulate signaling by wild-type ACVR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>). In that initial report, we focused on Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation or a reporter-based surrogate readout of that event. Therefore, in order to exclude the possibility that the ACVR1â¢Activin Aâ¢type II receptor may transduce signal by utilizing signaling proteins other than Smad1/5/8, we examined whether treatment of ACVR1-expressing cells with Activin A would result in phosphorylation of a set of proteins that represent major signaling pathways activated by receptor kinases.</p><p>To set the stage for these experiments, we first established conditions that bias the readout of signaling to that mediated by ACVR1 while minimizing potential contributions from the other two type I receptors that transduce signal in response to Activin A, ACVR1B and TGFBR1. To achieve this, we utilized cells that overexpress ACVR1 and also employed two inhibitors: an anti-ACVR1B blocking antibody (MAB222) and the TGFBR1 kinase-selective inhibitor SD208. We fist validated these two inhibitors, demonstrating that SD208 inhibits Smad2/3 signaling induced by either Activin A or TGFB1, while leaving BMP6-induced signaling (via ACVR1 and Smad1/5/8) unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, upper panel). Similarly, MAB222 inhibits Smad2/3 signaling induced by Activin A while leaving signaling induced by either TGFB1 or BMP6 unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lower panel). In this manner, we established conditions that guard against contributions to signaling by ACVR1B and TGFBR1 in response to Activin A, yet do not interfere with signaling mediated by ACVR1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Activin Aâ¢ACVR1â¢type II receptor complex does not transduce signal.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK293 cells harboring either a Smad2/3 or Smad1/5/8 reporter were treated with Activin A (1 nM), TGFÎ²1 (1 nM), or BMP6 (10 nM) in the presence of varying concentrations of SD208 or MAB222.

This time frame is sufficient to induce phosphorylation of Smad2/3 by Activin A or Smad1/5/8 by BMP6, while 3 hr of pretreatment with MAB222 and SD208 is efficient at inhibiting signaling with ACVR1B and TGFBR1, leaving Smad1/5/8 signaling unperturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and reducing the possibility of picking up secondary effects that usually arise at later time points. Comparison of the 37 proteins whose phosphorylation state can be interrogated using this array reveals of that there is no induction of phosphorylation by Activin A. The only significant differences detected were minor reductions in the phosphorylation level of STAT3 (S727) and STAT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These results are consistent with the idea that the ACVR1â¢Activin Aâ¢type II receptor complex acts as an NSC: it does not transduce signal either through the Smads or any of the other proteins interrogated here â if anything, engagement of ACVR1 by Activin A suppresses signaling.</p><p>Effectively identical results were obtained when we repeated this assay using a different cell line, mouse ES cells, where ACVR1 is not overexpressed, and that are also homozygous-null for <italic>Acvr1b</italic>. (This alleviates the need for utilizing MAB222 to block interaction of Activin A with ACVR1B.) Consistent with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, treatment of mES cells with Activin A in the presence of SD208 does not result in any increases in phosphorylation in the proteins interrogated by this array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

(<bold>B</bold>) As a result of a loss of ACVR1 binding, Activin A muteins should be less effective inhibitors of BMP-mediated signaling to the Smad1/5/8 pathway. Therefore, we expect that the agonist only muteins should have reduced antagonism of Smad1/5/8 signaling compared to wild-type Activin A. However, antagonism will not be entirely lost, as the agonist-only mutein must still bind to type II receptors for activation of Smad2/3 signaling via ACVR1B (and, to a lesser extent, TGFBR1).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54582-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As a first step to engineer Activin A muteins with such properties, we searched for BMP-TGFÃ family members that engage the same type II receptors as Activin A, utilize ACVR1B as their type I receptor, and do not engage ACVR1. Three ligands fulfill these requirements: Nodal, MSTN, and GDF11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yadin et al., 2016</xref>). Given that of these three, MSTN and GDF11 can also utilize TGFBR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rebbapragada et al., 2003</xref>), we focused on Nodal as the main donor of type I receptor-binding regions to substitute into the corresponding regions of Activin A, while also exploring the outcomes of substituting the same regions from other ligands. To define the specific regions of Activin to replace with their Nodal-derived counterparts, we initially relied on previously engineered artificial ligands where one region of Activin A had been replaced by the corresponding region from other BMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cash et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harrison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korupolu et al., 2008</xref>). Based on the premise that the regions that are most likely to define receptor utilization preferences are also those that are more evolutionarily divergent, we chose regions where the sequence diversity of TGFÃ ligands was significant.</p><p>More specifically, several studies have demonstrated that the pre-helix and post-helix regions make critical contacts with type I receptors. Substitution of the region encompassed by the pre-helix and post-helix region (amino acids 355 to 391 of mature Activin A) with the corresponding region from BMP2, switched type I (but not type II) receptor utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korupolu et al., 2008</xref>), whereas swapping the pre-helix region of Activin A with that of MSTN switched the preference of Activin A from ACVR1B to TGFBR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cash et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, the recently solved structure of GDF11 (an Activin family ligand) in complex with TGFBR1 and ACVR2B (PDB:6MAC), shows that the finger two region is particularly important for determining type I receptor specificity for the Activin class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goebel et al., 2019</xref>). Superimposition of Activin A into this ternary complex predicts that Activin Aâs finger two tip loop (F2TL; amino acids 406â409) also participates in binding to type I receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To further explore potential interactions of Activin A with ACVR1, we generated predictions of specific molecular interactions through structural modeling. We started with the structure of Activin A bound to Fs288 (PDB:2B0U) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thompson et al., 2005</xref>), as Fs288 engages Activin A using the same interface as the type I receptor. This fixed the structure of Activin A as would be expected when bound to receptor. We then generated several models of ACVR1 based on closely related receptors and found BMPR1A to provide the best structural prediction. Superimposition of these models to the complex structure of TGFBR1â¢GDF11â¢ACVR2B followed by energy minimization of amino acid side chains suggested a key interaction at the fingertip. Specifically, D406 extends into the type I binding site (seen in several Activin A structures â PDB: 1S4Y,2B0U, 2ARV, 3B4V) and is flanked by two lysine residues from ACVR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenwald et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harrington et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stamler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thompson et al., 2005</xref>). This observation supports a key role for D406 in binding ACVR1. Our model is further supported by the fact that there is a conserved hydrophobic residue (M79 in ACVR1) that rests in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the Activin A dimer, forming a âknob-in-holeâ motif, which is alsoÂ present in the BMP2:BMPR1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allendorph et al., 2006</xref>) and GDF11â¢TGFBR1 complexes (PDB:2GOO, 6MAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goebel et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Along with the F2TL region, the pre- and post-helix regions also exhibit significant sequence diversity between ligands, hence making them attractive candidates for type I receptor selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, other regions that are known to be involved in engaging the type I receptors, such as finger one and H3 helix, were excluded as donors for substitution analysis; finger one was excluded because it displays a high level of sequence conservation between ligands, whereas the H3 helix was not utilized because it appears to play a structural role and not to be a major determinant of type I receptor choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allendorph et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, we chose to focus on these three regions â F2TL, pre-helix, and post-helix â as sources of sequences to transfer from Nodal (and other Activin class ligands) into Activin A.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Activin A with Nodal F2TL activates ACVR1B</title><p>Based on the design criteria and biochemical and structural information summarized above, we engineered Activin A muteins in which their pre-helix, post-helix, and F2TL regions were replaced with the corresponding regions of Nodal, generating Activin A.Nod.pre, Activin A.Nod.post, and Activin A.Nod.F2TL, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

In this binding assay, Activin A.Nod.F2TL and ActivinA.âD406 bound with affinity that is very similar to wild-type Activin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>), confirming that the corresponding finger two tip loop substitutions in these two muteins do not affect type II receptor binding, and consistent with the fact that the F2TL region of this family of ligands is not involved in type II receptor binding, but rather is a key determinant of type I receptor choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goebel et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, REGN2476, an anti-Activin A monoclonal antibody that neutralizes Activin A by blocking its binding to its type II receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5âfigure supplement 5</xref>), completely alleviates inhibition of BMP7 signaling by Activin A.Nod.F2TL further indicating that the remaining inhibition is a result of binding of this mutein to type II receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similar results were obtained for ActivinA.âD406 in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>); however, its reduced effectiveness in inhibiting BMP7-initiated activation of ACVR1 indicates that ActivinA.âD406 can still interact with ACVR1 to form a functional NSC, albeit not as well as wild-type Activin A.</p><p>To demonstrate that it is indeed the inability of Activin A.Nod.F2TL to form the NSC that accounts for its reduced ability to antagonize BMP7-initiated signaling by ACVR1, we used a neutralizing anti-Activin A antibody, H4H10442, that inhibits the interaction of Activin A with its type I receptors by binding to the finger two tip loop region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5âfigure supplement 6</xref>). We hypothesized that binding of H4H10442 to Activin A will mimic the effect of the Nod.F2TL substitution, and hence result in a BMP7 signaling inhibition profile identical to that of Activin A.Nod.F2TL. Indeed, H4H10442 shifts the dose response of the inhibition brought about by wild-type Activin A on BMP7-initiated signaling to that obtained by Activin A.Nod.F2TL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), hence verifying that the reduced inhibition obtained with Activin A.Nod.F2TL is a direct consequence of the inability of Activin A.Nod.F2TLâs F2TL region (which is that of Nodal) to bind ACVR1. Using the same criteria, our data shows that Activin A.âD406 has partially retained the ability to antagonize BMP7 signaling via ACVR1, making it a less desirable âagonist-onlyâ Activin A mutein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that the remaining ability of Activin A.Nod.F2TL to antagonize BMP7-initiated signaling is indeed through engagement of the type II receptors, whereas its reduced ability to antagonize BMP7 is a property of its inability to engage ACVR1 to form the NSC.</p><p>Incidentally, in contrast to what is seen with Activin A.Nod.F2TL and Activin A.âD406, inhibition of binding of wild-type Activin A to the type II receptor (via REGN2476) does not âflat-lineâ the ability of wild-type Activin A to inhibit BMP7-initiated signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

Both isoforms of FST, differing in the absence (Fs288, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) or presence (Fs315, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) of C-terminal acidic tail, inhibit Activin A signaling to baseline in Smad2/3 reporter assays. Activin A.Nod.F2TL displays nearly identical inhibition profile compared to wild type, whereas Activin A.âD406 shows a slightly decreased ability to be inhibited by both FST isoforms but still can be fully inhibited to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Contrasting this, both F2TL muteins display decreased ability to be inhibited by FSTL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We attribute this to a key difference in the way FSTL3 engages Activin A compared to FST. Although both FST and FSTL3 engage the Activins and other TGFÃ ligands in a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio with two Follistatin molecules per one dimeric ligand, when FST engages Activin A, the FSD3 domain reaches around the ligand to non-covalently contact the N-terminal domain of the other FST molecule, essentially fully wrapping around the ligand. (There are relatively few specific contacts between FST and the ligands that it interacts with; this makes FST a quite promiscuous modulator of multiple BMP/TGFÃ family members.) In contrast, FSTL3 lacks the FSD3 domain and engages Activin A using several specific contacts, which include direct contacts with the finger two tip loop. Specifically, the ring nitrogen of His91 in FSTL3 makes a charge contact with D406 of Activin A, and both Ser221 and Arg225 directly interact electrostatically with Activin A Q408 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cash et al., 2012</xref>).

As would be expected for any Activin mutein that escapes recruitment into the NSC (yet still activates ACVR1[R206H]), we observed significantly more HO in collagen sponges containing Activin A.Nod.F2TL compared to wild-type Activin A, in fact approximately six times greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>).

These results are consistent with a model where Activin A.Nod.F2TL escapes recruitment into the NSC (with wild type Acvr1) and hence is free to engage the FOP-causing Acvr1[R206H] receptor more frequently than wild-type Activin A, simply because the latter can be trapped in the NSC, whereas Activin A.Nod.F2TL cannot. This increased frequency in engagement of Acvr1[R206H] by Activin A.Nod.F2TL results in increased signaling in the FAPs, and increased HO.

Even more surprising was the finding that the FOP-causing missense mutations of ACVR1 (which localize in the intracellular domain of this receptor) convert the NSC into a signaling complex, much like that formed by BMPs. The molecular mechanism that underlies this conversion is a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hino et al., 2015</xref>). That aside, the realization that the NSC effectively reduces the availability of all the partners involved in that complex (Activin A, ACVR1, and the type II receptors) and hence inhibits or reduces signaling by BMPs via the same receptors, propelled us to ask whether the NSC has biological roles. This question has, thus far, been largely unexplored as the majority of studies on Activin A have focused on its role as a signal-inducing ligand via ACVR1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makanji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Namwanje and Brown, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In order to explore the biological role(s) of the NSC in vivo, we engineered agonist-only variants of Activin A (i.e. variants that retain their ability to signal through ACVR1B but fail to form the NSC with ACVR1). To design such muteins, we made use of biochemical information regarding receptor utilization by Activin family ligands, prior mutagenesis studies, and structural modeling. We chose Nodal as the main donor for replacements of type I-binding regions of Activin A, a choice driven by the fact that Nodal utilizes the same type II receptors as Activin A along with ACVR1B but does not engage ACVR1. We then focused on three regions for engineering the different chimeric ligands: the pre-helix, the post-helix, and the finger two tip loop (F2TL) (see Results section). Of the resulting Activin A-Nodal chimeras, Activin A.Nod.F2TL â a mutein where the finger two tip loop was substituted with that of Nodal â displayed the desired properties: it activates ACVR1B nearly to the same degree as wild-type Activin A, does not switch to other type I receptors, and escapes engagement into the NSC. In addition, guided by structural models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>), we engineered a single amino acid deletion variant, Activin A.âD406. This variant also displayed reduced ability to form the NSC, indicating the importance of D406 as a determinant of the interaction of Activin A with ACVR1.</p><p>In parallel with our finding that the F2TL region is required for the formation of the NSC, the importance of the F2TL as a major determinant of type I receptor choice was concurrently demonstrated for GDF11âs interaction with TGFBR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goebel et al., 2019</xref>). Both findings are further supported by an additional chimeric ligand that we engineered using GDF8 as the âdonorâ to generate the corresponding F2TL variant â Activin A.GDF8.F2TL. This variant utilizes TGFBR1 as the type I receptor to a greater degree than Activin A, while retaining its ability to engage ACVR1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, our results lend further credence to the concept that the finger two tip loop is a key determinant of type I receptor choice in the Activin class.</p><p>Our findings show that the NSC is mediated through very specific contacts between Activin A and ACVR1. Nonetheless, we note that we did not attempt an exhaustive search to define all possible Activin A muteins with the desired properties, and hence it is possible that other such muteins can be engineered. Along these lines, since Activin B and Activin AB are also capable of forming NSCs with ACVR1 and the corresponding type II receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5âfigure supplement 7</xref>), our findings should enable exploration of the formation of the respective complexes by following similar methodology.</p><p>Both of the two muteins that we study in detail here deviate from our initial design specifications in that they display a small increase in resistance to inhibition by one of Activinâs natural antagonists, FSTL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This property is unavoidable for Activin A variants that bear changes in the finger two tip loop, as that region is involved in one of the main contacts between Activin A and FSTL3. Whether this deviation will have physiological consequences, remains to be seen. It should be noted, however, that FSTL3 knockout mice have a relatively benign phenotype that has been well characterized and that has been attributed to an increase in Activin A activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mukherjee et al., 2007</xref>). Given the relatively small reduction in the ability of Activin A.Nod.F2TL to be inhibited by FSTL3 (compared to what would be expected from a complete loss of FSTL3), it is unlikely that this difference will have phenotypic consequences. Nonetheless, the availability of phenotypic data on FSTL3 knockout mice should facilitate the assessment of any differences that might arise in the physiology of mice bearing Activin A.Nod.F2TL as a knock-in into <italic>Inhba</italic>.</p><p>The development of an agonist-only Activin A mutein, Activin A.Nod.F2TL, enabled us to directly query the role of the NSC in FOP, and hence build upon the prior discovery of the role of Activin A in this disease. Because of the ability of Activin A.Nod.F2TL to escape recruitment into NSCs, and hence not allow sequestration of both itself and the type II receptors into inactive complexes that render them inaccessible to participate in signaling, we predicted that Activin A.Nod.F2TL should precipitate more HO compared to wild type Activin A. We demonstrate this to be the case in two different yet complimentary settings. These results provide the first evidence for a role of the NSC in vivo. Specifically for FOP, they also provide the first direct evidence that the NSC tempers HO in FOP, effectively reducing the amount of heterotopic bone that forms (presumably by reducing the availability of Activin A and type II receptors to form signaling complexes with FOP-mutant ACVR1). Our data is in agreement with the observation that deletion of wild type <italic>Acvr1</italic> in a mouse FOP setting results in massively increased heterotopic bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018b</xref>). The fact that Activin A.Nod.F2TL was successfully employed to query a pathophysiological process in vivo sets the stage for future experimentation with the corresponding knock-in mouse line outside of FOP. Given the level of evolutionary conservation in this receptor-ligand system, our data opens the field of investigating whether the ability of forming the NSC was an early or a late event during evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and protein reagents</title><p>Activin A antibodies H4H10442 and REGN2476 are human monoclonal antibodies specific to Activin A and utilizing an IgG4 constant region.

demonstrates the importance of Activin A interactions with the type I BMP receptor ACVR1. Most studies have focused on the role of Activin A as an agonist for the type I receptor ACVR1B. The work in this paper uses elegant biochemical approaches and in vivo validation to demonstrate that Activin A binding to ACVR1 leads to a non-signaling complex that antagonizes signaling by BMP7, a well-characterized ligand for ACVR1. The discovery that some ligands exert important functions via formation of non-signaling complexes may extend to other members of the TGFÎ²/BMP superfamily.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The finger 2 tip loop of Activin A is required for the formation of its non-signaling complex with ACVR1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The rationale for the study arises from the fact that ACVR1 was initially cloned as an Activin-binding receptor, but Activins do not activate ACVR1. Subsequently, it was found that ACVR1 binds specific BMPs and activates BMP pathways rather than Activin/TGFÎ² pathways. Interest in the role of the Activin/ACVR1 interaction was re-ignited upon the discovery by the authors and confirmed by others that Activin A acts as an antagonist of BMP binding to WT ACVR1, but has agonist activity through ACVR1R[206H], the mutation underlying most cases of FOP. The underlying mechanisms for this change in responsiveness to Activin A are still not understood. This paper generates mutant activins (muteins) of Activin A, specifically, &quot;agonist only&quot; muteins, as an approach to tease apart the role of Activin A as an agonist for Activin/TGFÎ² signaling via its canonical receptor ACVR1B from its role as an antagonist of BMP signaling through ACVR1. Two such muteins are described, and one, based on replacement of the F2TL region of Activin A with the corresponding region of Nodal, retained binding to and activation of ACVR1B, but had greatly impaired binding to ACVR1, hence losing its ability to antagonize signaling by other BMPs. The authors present a range of biochemical and in vitro assays to characterize the function of these muteins. The authors also test the function of one of the muteins in vivo as an agonist for ACVR1[R206H], and find that it leads to enhanced heterotopic ossification compared to WT Activin A. From these results, they make inferences about the existence and impact of an Activin A/ACVR1/type II receptor non-signaling complex (NSC). There is general consensus that the authors have achieved the goal of generating muteins that show greatly impaired binding to ACVR1 while retaining binding to and signaling through ACVR1B. The in vivo data are intriguing and will set the stage for more detailed mechanistic studies. In summary, this work highlights the importance of interactions of activin with ACVR1 for BMP signaling.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are some points for which all reviewers agreed additional data are needed:</p><p>1) The authors should present direct biochemical data demonstrating reduced binding of ACVRI ectodomain to the muteins (compared to WT Activin A).</p><p>2) The split Î²-gal assays should be done comparing the binding of Activin A and the muteins on ACVR1 and ACVR1B in combination with one of the ACVR2 receptors (most logically, ACVR2A since that was used throughout the figures).</p><p>3) More information is needed about the generation and properties of the Regeneron antibodies in order for reviewers to assess the solidity of the conclusions.

However, after several attempts we have failed to demonstrate binding to ACVR1 of even wild type Activin A (or Activin B) either alone or in complex with the ectodomain of ACVR2A, ACVR2B, or BMPR2. In contrast, we were able to show binding of BMP6, 7, and 9 to ACVR1, as well as binding of Activin A to ALK4 (indicating that the reagents that we are using are active). This data is in agreement with unpublished attempts by other groups to visualize an Activin Aâ¢ACVR1 complex. The inability to measure binding of even wild type Activin A to ACVR1 consequently precludes interrogation of any differences in affinity that any of the Activin muteins that we have generated may have. We have added this negative (but well controlled) evidence in Figure 5âfigure supplement 2 and have commented accordingly in the main text. Nonetheless, the data that we have already procured with the DiscovRx lines (split Î²-gal assays) clearly demonstrate that Activin A is very effective in heterodimerizing ACVR1 with ACVR2A, whereas Activin A.Nod.F2TL has largely lost that ability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The split Î²-gal assays should be done comparing the binding of Activin A and the muteins on ACVR1 and ACVR1B in combination with one of the ACVR2 receptors (most logically, ACVR2A since that was used throughout the figures).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this would have been the preferred format. However, the split Î²-gal assay that combines ACVR1B with ACVR2A has not been generated by the company that engineers these assays. Therefore, in as much as we would like to, we cannot generate that data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More information is needed about the generation and properties of the Regeneron antibodies in order for reviewers to assess the solidity of the conclusions.

That technology has been described in the corresponding references, also supplied in the original text (Macdonald et al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2014). The plasmon resonance data for the two antibodies has now been added to the Figure 5âfigure supplement 5D. We have also added a description of the statistical tests and any additional methods for the supplementary material.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There were also some points to address in the text:</p><p>4) The authors need to address why Activin A did not induce heterotopic ossification (HO) in the FOP model (Figure 6) given their previously published data showing that Activin A induces HO.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand this query to be about the apparent lack of a great difference between the collagen sponge implantations and specifically the comparison between Saline and Activin A. This is due to the fact that occasionally just the injury associated with the performing these implantations can cause HO at the site of implantation. Although this occurrence is rare, its incidence is not zero and in this particular experiment the two FOP mice implanted with collagen sponge without Activin A did form some heterotopic bone. We did not observe this in the cohort where Geltrex was used as the carrier, but we opted to include all of the data that we have procured from this line of experimentation. The data demonstrates that there is a very clear difference between Activin A and Activin A.Nod.F2TL, with the latter being much more effective at inducing HO than its wild type counterpart.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) With respect to the Discussion, please address the points raised by reviewer 3 regarding the presence of D406 in other BMP ligands, and relate this to their ability to engage ACVR1.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unclear as to what we are being asked to address here, as no specific comments have been provided in this review with respect to D406âs presence in other ligands. Nonetheless, we note that D405 seems to be more highly conserved across multiple BMPs, whereas the identity of amino acid at the position corresponding to D406 in Activin A is more variable. However, we have not explored this further as the focus of our work has not been to explore the role of D406 across different BMPs; we have only focused on generating Activin A muteins that have âagonist-onlyâ properties.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There was a discussion but not consensus over the definition of &quot;non-signaling complex&quot; and the extent to which this manuscript can make conclusions about this complex. There was good agreement that the paper focuses on the properties of the Activin A muteins. Therefore, a change in title to remove &quot;non-signaling complex&quot; is appropriate. Instead, consider something like &quot;The F2TL is required for interaction of Activin A with ACVR1â.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewers assessment. Our manuscript is very much about the Non-Signaling Complex (NSC) formed between Activin A and ACVR1 (along with the corresponding type II receptors) and this is what we are setting out to explore. We have shown here as well as in our previously published work (Hatsell et al., 2015) that when Activin A engages ACVR1 in the context of the corresponding type II receptors, the resulting complex does not induce phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, and that it also antagonizes BMP6-induced signaling. However, in order to provide additional evidence that the ACVR1â¢Activin Aâ¢type IIR complex does not transduce any other signal, we have utilized a phosphoarray panel that captures the activation of the main non-canonical pathways that have been observed for BMPs in the literature as well as a wider array of signaling proteins not yet implicated as direct transducers of BMP-induced signaling. We have included this additional data at the beginning of the Results section. As shown on what is now a new Figure 1 and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1, there are no significant changes in the phosphorylation state of the signal transducing proteins that we can interrogated using a Human Phosphokinase Array â if anything, the only differences are consistent with inhibition of signaling. Therefore, we propose that these results, combined with other data shown here as well as the evidence present in our prior manuscript (Hatsell et al., 2015), demonstrate that the ACVR1â¢Activin Aâ¢type IIR complex does not transduce signal, and hence is appropriately labeled as a NSC. Given the centrality of this idea to our paper, we would like to retain the current Title and Abstract, and not dilute the main thesis of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Along the same lines as the previous comment, please take out references to the NSC in the Abstract. It is appropriate to discuss how the data relate to the existence and function of the NSC elsewhere in the text, but the above changes to the title and Abstract will more closely reflect the bulk of the work in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully submit that we have already addressed this point in our reply to query #6, above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It is unclear how the mutein enhances heterotopic ossification in vivo, when Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 states that the muteins lose binding to ACVR1. Figure 7âfigure supplement 1 indicates that the muteins can signal through ACVR1[R206H]. A more thorough discussion of the interpretation of the relationship between Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 7âfigure supplement 1, along with a discussion of other possible interpretations is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this point is far from obvious. However, it should be clear that we state in the text that neither one of the two muteins we have generated has completely lost the ability to engage ACVR1: âThe finger two tip loop muteins have reduced ability to dimerize ACVR1 with ACVR2Aâ¦â as stated in the figure legend and âboth Activin A.Nod.F2TL (Figure 3B) and Activin A.âD406 (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1) display greatly reduced ability to induce dimerization of ACVR1 with ACVR2Aâ, as stated in the main text. (We have now revised the title of Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 to make this point clear.) In light of the fact that we do not completely abrogate formation of an ACVR1â¢Activin Aâ¢Type II receptor complex, it is not surprising, that both of Activin A.â406 and Activin A.Nod.F2TL can activate signaling of ACVR1[R206H], as shown on Figure 7âfigure supplement 1. We think that the results we show here reinforce each other, and we are unable to come up with alternative explanations that can be supported by the data that we have generated and presented here.</p></body></sub-article></article>
