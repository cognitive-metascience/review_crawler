mediating sodium-dependent uptake of neurotransmitters from the extracellular space. The substrate binding stoichiometry of the bacterial NSS protein, LeuT, and thus the principal transport mechanism, has been heavily debated. Here we used solid state NMR to specifically characterize the bound leucine ligand and probe the number of binding sites in LeuT. We were able to produce high-quality NMR spectra of substrate bound to microcrystalline LeuT samples and identify one set of sodium-dependent substrate-specific chemical shifts. Furthermore, our data show that the binding site mutants F253A and L400S, which probe the major S1 binding site and the proposed S2 binding site, respectively, retain sodium-dependent substrate binding in the S1 site similar to the wild-type protein. We conclude that under our experimental conditions there is only one detectable leucine molecule bound to LeuT.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19314.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19314.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19314.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All living cells need amino acids – the building blocks of proteins – in order to survive, yet few cells can make all the amino acids that they need. Instead, transporter proteins in cell membranes must take these molecules from the outside of the cell and release them to the inside. Some cells, including those in the brain, also release amino acids and molecules derived from them into the spaces outside of the cell to send signals to other nearby cells. Again, transporter proteins must move these signaling molecules back inside cells, to stop the signaling and to allow the molecules to be recycled. Importantly, problems with these uptake mechanisms have been linked to disorders such as depression, epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>One family of transporters involved in the uptake of amino acids are the “Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporters”. Though these proteins are involved in processes that are fundamental to life, it remains unclear exactly how they work. Specifically, it has been heavily debated whether this family of transporters require one or two amino acid molecules to bind at the same time in order to help transport them across the membrane.</p><p>Now Erlendsson, Gotfryd et al. have analyzed a bacterial protein in the Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporter family. This transporter takes up an amino acid called leucine into cells, and is commonly used as a model to understand this family of transporter proteins more generally. Using a technique called solid state nuclear magnetic resonance, Erlendsson, Gotfryd et al. could detect a single molecule of leucine bound to each transporter, but not a second one. This technique could also pinpoint that the leucine was located at the transporter’s central binding site. Leucine was never found at the proposed secondary binding site. Together these findings suggest that only one molecule of leucine binds to the transporter at any one time, and that it binds to the transporter’s central binding site.</p><p>Erlendsson, Gotfryd et al. have shown now how solid state nuclear magnetic resonance can be used to explore in detail how Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporters move molecules across cell membranes. The next challenge is to use the same experimental setup to characterize other Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporters. Doing so could potentially lay the groundwork for designing more specific and improved drugs to treat disorders like depression and Parkinson’s disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19314.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19314.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>aquifex aeolicus</kwd><kwd>substrate binding site</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter transporters</kwd><kwd>solid state NMR</kwd><kwd>LeuT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>BioNMR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIO-NMR-00232</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erlendsson</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Teilum</surname><given-names>Kaare</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>iNEXT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID 1597</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erlendsson</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Teilum</surname><given-names>Kaare</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R151-2013-14302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teilum</surname><given-names>Kaare</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R221-2016-847</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teilum</surname><given-names>Kaare</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R108-A10755</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loland</surname><given-names>Claus J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004836</institution-id><institution>Det Frie Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sapere Aude, 0602-02100B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loland</surname><given-names>Claus J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004836</institution-id><institution>Det Frie Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFF-4183-00581</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loland</surname><given-names>Claus J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>bioSYNergy, University of Copenhagen's Excellence Program for Interdisciplinary Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loland</surname><given-names>Claus J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Solid state NMR is unable to detect any association of substrate to the second binding site, S2, in the extracellular vestibule of the Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporter LeuT.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporters (NSSs) are responsible for clearing neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, glycine and GABA from the synaptic cleft. The transporters are thereby crucial for the regulation of synaptic transmission in the CNS and alterations in their function have been linked to several psychiatric and neurological disorders such as depression, bipolar disorders, attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Broer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>). The understanding of the molecular mechanisms and structural (re)arrangements underlying NSS function has advanced significantly in recent years. The most detailed insight into structure-function relationships of NSSs comes from studies of the amino acid transporter, LeuT, from <italic>Aquifex</italic> aeolicus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Kantcheva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Kazmier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Malinauskaite et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Piscitelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Quick et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Shi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Singh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Wang et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). Recent structures of the drosophila dopamine transporter (dDAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Penmatsa et al., 2013</xref>) and the human serotonin transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Coleman et al., 2016</xref>), which are eukaryotic members of the NSS family, confirm that LeuT is a reliable model protein and proves its value in understanding the molecular function of this class of transporters.</p><p>Functional studies of LeuT have suggested the existence of a secondary substrate binding site (S2) located in the extracellular vestibule of LeuT approximately 10 Å from the primary substrate binding site (S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Khelashvili et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Quick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Shi et al., 2008</xref>). The S2 site is suggested to be an allosteric trigger, essential for coupling the energy from the electrochemical gradient to the transport of the solute. The binding of leucine to the S2 site has been measured to have the same affinity (in nM range) as binding to the S1 but does not, as the S1 bound substrate, directly coordinate sodium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Quick et al., 2012</xref>). However, attempts to crystallize LeuT with substrate bound to the S2 site have so far been unsuccessful, and therefore the existence of the S2 site is supported primarily by radioligand binding assays and guided MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Quick et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). Due to the lack of structural evidence, the existence of a high-affinity S2 site has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Piscitelli et al., 2010</xref>), supporting the need for employing new techniques for investigating ligand binding in NSS proteins.</p><p>Here we investigate the leucine binding properties of LeuT by magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR, aiming at a characterization of the proposed S2 binding site. Our approach offers several advantages: (i) We use microcrystalline samples of LeuT prepared under experimental conditions allowing for conformations capable of ligand binding to both S1 and S2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Quick et al., 2012</xref>). (ii) NMR offers information on the full structural ensemble which is unlikely not to include conformers (even lowly populated) prone to bind leucine in S2. (iii) Leucine binding to S1 and S2 may be distinguished by characteristic chemical shifts that are expected to be different due to different chemical environments, i.e. interacting residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Reyes et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Prior to crystallization and NMR experiments we verified the functionality of the produced LeuT wild-type (WT) samples. We initially performed [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine saturation binding experiments and subsequently assessed Na<sup>+</sup>-dependency of [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine binding. All experiments were done at a DDM concentration commonly used in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays (i.e., 0.05% corresponding to 5.7x CMC). At this detergent concentration, LeuT was reported to retain binding to both S1 and the putative S2 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Quick et al., 2012</xref>). In scintillation proximity binding assays LeuT WT bound [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine with a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of 12 ± 1 nM in the presence of 200 mM sodium. The EC<sub>50</sub> value calculated for the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent binding was 47 ± 4 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

In all other preparations tested (frozen, lyophilized and proteoliposomes) the signal from the unspecific or unbound leucine completely dominated the spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). Using the microcrystalline preparations, we were able to produce the high quality CP-based <sup>15</sup>N detected spectra showing one significant (above 2σ – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) peak at 38.2 ppm that could be assigned to the amine of protein bound leucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition to the sharp signal from leucine, much broader signals between 110 and 130 ppm were also observed, which originate from the <sup>15</sup>N natural abundance of the LeuT amides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To further assess whether the intense signal at 38.2 ppm reflects sodium specific leucine binding to LeuT, we performed a parallel experiment substituting Na<sup>+</sup> with K<sup>+</sup>. Sodium is required for leucine binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). By the use of <sup>23</sup>Na-NMR we confirmed the presence of only a negligible amount of residual NaCl (at 7.1 ppm), and that no detectable Na<sup>+</sup> was coordinated in the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>, the signal at 38.2 ppm in the <sup>15</sup>N 1D spectrum disappeared as expected for a signal originating from <sup>15</sup>N-leucine bound to LeuT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Worth of note, the amine NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group of free leucine has a chemical shift of approximately 41 ppm at pH 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A–B</xref>), demonstrating that the bound substrate resides in a not fully solvent accessible environment. Importantly, we were unable to detect any signal from any additionally bound leucine. Similarly, the <sup>13</sup>C CP/MAS spectra from the same samples clearly displayed only one single set of sodium dependent leucine signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether the origin of the substrate peak at 38.2 ppm was due to leucine binding either to the S1 or the S2 site, we recorded solid state NMR spectra of two variants with compromised leucine binding, F253A (S1) and L400S (S2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). For these experiments we lowered the final concentration of the added enriched substrate to 5 μM to ensure proper detimental effect by the mutations. This concentration has previously been reported not to provide any detectable [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine occupancy in the S2 site of LeuT L400S, but saturated S1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Quick et al., 2012</xref>). For LeuT WT the specific leucine peak was unaffected by lowering the free leucine concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The F253A mutant has previously been shown to impair binding to the S1 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Billesbølle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Wang et al., 2012b</xref>). Thus, F253A serves as a S1 disturbing mutant at low substrate concentrations. In the F253A 1D <sup>15</sup>N spectrum, we observed sodium dependent substrate binding with a chemical shift of 38.4 ppm and a slightly lower signal intensity, when compared to the WT spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The shift in F253A was consistent for both high (1 mM) and low (5 µM) leucine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Most importantly, the chemical shift difference of ~0.2 ppm for the observed bound leucine peak, demonstrates that the ligand is affected by the local environment of the S1 binding site. The L400S mutation was previously suggested to abolish S2 leucine binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Quick et al., 2012</xref>). The <sup>15</sup>N spectrum obtained for leucine bound to L400S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, blue) completely resembled the spectrum obtained with WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, red). We were not able to detect any change in intensity or chemical shift. This argues against the possibility that the substrate signal we observe in LeuT WT samples is reporting on a combination of S1 and S2 binding. Also, we reason that it would be highly unlikely for an S1 bound substrate and a putative S2 site-bound substrate to have the same chemical shift as the environment of the putative S2 binding site markedly differs from the S1 binding site. As a major difference, the proposed S2 binding site does not involve direct sodium binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Shi et al., 2008</xref>)<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19314.010</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effects of S1 and S2 site mutations on the L-leucine chemical shift .</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Cartoon representation displaying the location of F253 in the S1 site and L400 in the proposed S2 site based on PDB: 3USG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Wang et al., 2012a</xref>).

We note, however, that at our current signal-to-noise ratio (~20), we would not be able to detect species populated less than 5% of the structural ensemble. Based on the minor change in chemical shift in the F253A (S1) mutant, and the completely unaltered signal for the L400S (S2) mutant we reason that the observable bound leucine is located at the S1 binding site, thus supporting the idea that LeuT exhibit one single central binding site. We cannot exclude that the detection of S2 binding may only be possible upon the complete transition of the transporter towards a specific (yet unknown) conformation or that unfavourable crystal contacts might complicate S2 binding. However, several crystal structures have shown the binding of antidepressants, which overlaps with the putative S2 site, using these exact conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Singh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). As previously proposed for LeuT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Piscitelli et al., 2010</xref>) we speculate that the S2 substrate binding site, if present, is rather a transient site, responsible for optimal functionality of the transporter.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Expression of LeuT WT from <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> was performed according to the protocol described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Billesbølle et al., 2015</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Direct assessment of substrate binding to the Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporter LeuT by solid state NMR&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Baruch Kanner (Reviewer #2), and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper analyzes NMR data on (micro)crystalline preparations of LeuT and two mutants in reference to previous structural and functional studies that led to conflicting views on the number of leucine binding sites: a central site (S1) on which there is general agreement and a potential additional site (S2) located in the external vestibule of the transporter. This S2 site has been proposed to play an important role in the transport mechanism. Clearly, a detailed study of ligand binding to membrane proteins is a central aspect for understanding their workings in cell membranes. The LeuT system has served as a powerful bacterial model system to understand the details of ligand and ion concentrations as well as the role of lipids and detergents. The crystal structures of the bacterial amino acid transporter LeuT have been determined in various conformations. It has been established that LeuT is a very useful model for Neurotransmitter:Sodium:Symporters. For these reasons, this work addresses an important, so far unresolved issue.</p><p>In this manuscript, the issue is addressed using a novel approach with solid state NMR to study leucine binding in the wild type and two mutant transporters. The latter are expected to perturb either of the proposed sites. The authors describe a single sodium dependent signal in the wild type with similar chemical shifts and magnitudes at high (1mM) or low (5μM) substrate concentrations. At the low concentration, an identical signal was observed with the S2 site mutant, whereas the amplitude of the signal of the S1 mutant was lowered and the shift was different. The reviewers were interested in the topic and approach, but raised several issues that will need to be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reliability of the NMR data interpretation.</p><p>The main conclusion of this work, i.e., the presence of only one bound Leucine site, is largely based on one-dimensional NMR spectra of rather limited signal to noise. This is especially true for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> where, considering the base line, the signal to noise S/N is roughly 4:1 (and not as claimed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, 21:1). Although the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> seem to have been recorded with similar acquisition times, the signal to noise seems to vary significantly with the best S/N for the L400S mutant.</p><p>As a result, the &quot;tentative normalization&quot; of the 38 ppm peak to the NH backbone signals relative to the 38.2 ppm peak is questionable and the signal modulation at the 38 ppm resonance for the 3 samples is comparable to the noise level. Why did the authors not conduct longer experiments to obtain a better signal to noise ratio? In addition, the 15N signal of the F253A mutant refers to the spectrum with the lowest signal to noise and the claimed 0.2 ppm peak shift could easily disappear with a slight change in phase correction. Even if this shift is really present, it is probably smaller than the intrinsic NMR line width.</p><p>2) General relevance and implications in reference to previous work.</p><p>MAS-NMR has been used to study proteins embedded in proteoliposomes for decades and it remains unclear why such experiments were not conducted here. Because the substrate remains labeled, they should be readily possible. To the reviewer, such data would greatly improve the general relevance of this study because they would allow to ultimately compare detergent and lipid bilayer data on the atomic level (see Quick et al., 2012).</p><p>3) Because in the literature the S1 mutant has been described as capable of binding the substrate, but with lower affinity, the authors attribute the lowered amplitude to the lowered substrate affinity but do not substantiate this claim by measuring the signal at the high substrate concentration. It is essential to do this measurement and it will be important to see if the chemical shift changes or not.</p><p>4) In the last sentence the authors unnecessarily soften up their conclusion, probably to try to be &quot;politically correct&quot;. Assuming that the suggested experiment strengthens their conclusion, the sentence could read something like &quot;Our data, using a novel approach to determine substrate binding, support the idea that LeuT exhibits a single central binding site&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19314.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Reliability of the NMR data interpretation.</italic></p><p><italic>The main conclusion of this work, i.e., the presence of only one bound Leucine site, is largely based on one-dimensional NMR spectra of rather limited signal to noise.

Although it would be very nice with better signal-to-noise, we have already pushed the amount of NMR time used for recording a single 1D spectrum to the limit. The spectra presented in the paper were signal averaged in 6 blocks of 60K scans. The magnet was re-tuned before each block of scans, which resulted in just about 64 hours for each 1D experiment. Consequently, increasing the signal to noise by a factor of two would require at least 256 hours of experiment time, which in our opinion would be too much. It could risk a significant destabilization of the sample.</p><p>The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> clearly demonstrate the absence of additional Leucine binding sites that are populated more than 5% relative to the S1 site and that have a chemical shift difference of more than 30Hz (0.04ppm) compared to the S1 site.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, spectra of the variants F253A and L400S are shown. We did not obtain as much crystallized protein for these variants as for LeuT WT and the signal-to-noise for the S1 peaks in these spectra are indeed lower than for the WT spectrum (4:1 and 11:1, respectively). However, the peaks are sharp and their positions are well defined (intrinsic line widths of ~30 Hz). We agree with the reviewers that our presentation of the data can be improved. In the original figure we had processed the data with a line broadening of 100 Hz, hiding the resolution. To accommodate this issue, we have presented the data in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> with only 1 Hz line broadening. In addition, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> we have produced power spectra, and aligned the intensities of the three constructs to demonstrate that the 0.2 ppm difference cannot be accounted for by minor phasing errors.</p><p><italic>2) General relevance and implications in reference to previous work.</italic></p><p><italic>MAS-NMR has been used to study proteins embedded in proteoliposomes for decades and it remains unclear why such experiments were not conducted here. Because the substrate remains labeled, they should be readily possible. To the reviewer, such data would greatly improve the general relevance of this study because they would allow to ultimately compare detergent and lipid bilayer data on the atomic level (see Quick et al., 2012).</italic> </p><p>Proteoliposome preparations are very suitable for most MAS-NMR membrane protein studies, and we did indeed try this approach for the substrate binding but without any luck. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, having either frozen or completely solid samples will cause the free leucine to dominate the spectrum completely. When recording proteoliposome data at room temperature we do not see any signal in the CP based experiments from substrate, which might be an effect of large flexibility or too low sensitivity (lipids will constitute most of the material in the ssNMR rotor in order to preserve the functionality of the transporter).</p><p>In the microcrystalline samples we have no unbound Leucine present as no signals are observed in the potassium purified protein, which serves as our negative control. Finally, microcrystalline samples have greatly improved resolution (more order) compared to fluid detergent/lipid preparations, which is crucial for our conclusions. To clarify these points, we have rephrased the text which now reads:</p><p>“To achieve sufficiently narrow line widths of the NMR signals and to avoid any signal from unbound leucine, we produced microcrystalline samples of LeuT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and performed cross polarization (CP)-based NMR experiments at temperatures above the freezing point. In all other preparations tested (frozen, lyophilized and frozen proteoliposomes) the signal from the unbound leucine completely dominated the spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A-B</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) Because in the literature the S1 mutant has been described as capable of binding the substrate, but with lower affinity, the authors attribute the lowered amplitude to the lowered substrate affinity but do not substantiate this claim by measuring the signal at the high substrate concentration. It is essential to do this measurement and it will be important to see if the chemical shift changes or not.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this insightful suggestion. As proposed we have performed the experiment for F253A at 1 mM free substrate concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). To this end, we realize that the fourth paragraph of the Results and Discussion puts unnecessary emphasis on the slight change in intensity. Our conclusion that the bound leucine senses changes in the S1 local environment (caused by the F253A mutation) and therefore are bound in S1, rests primarily on the differences in chemical shift of the leucine signals between LeuT WT and F253A. The comparison of the signal intensities relies on tentative normalization based on the natural abundance resonances, which are not suitable for making conclusions on subtle differences in the affinity, as also noted above.</p><p>Taken together, we have changed the paragraph to read:</p><p>“In the F253A 1D <sup>15</sup>N spectrum, we observed sodium dependent substrate binding with a chemical shift of 38.4 ppm and a slightly lower signal intensity, when compared to the WT spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The shift in F253A was consistent for both high (1 mM) and low (5 µM) leucine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Most importantly, the chemical shift difference of ~0.2 ppm for the observed bound leucine peak, demonstrates that the ligand is affected by the local environment of the S1 binding site.”</p><p><italic>4) In the last sentence the authors unnecessarily soften up their conclusion, probably to try to be &quot;politically correct&quot;. Assuming that the suggested experiment strengthens their conclusion, the sentence could read something like &quot;Our data, using a novel approach to determine substrate binding, support the idea that LeuT exhibits a single central binding site&quot;.</italic> </p><p>The last paragraph of the Results and Discussion now reads,</p><p>“Based on the minor change in chemical shift in the F253A (S1) mutant, and the completely unaltered signal for the L400S (S2) mutant we reason that the observable bound leucine is located at the S1 binding site, thus supporting the idea that LeuT exhibit one single central binding site.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
