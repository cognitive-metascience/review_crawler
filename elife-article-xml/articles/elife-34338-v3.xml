shared at presynaptic terminals. Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) stabilizes neurotransmission at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction, where a retrograde enhancement of presynaptic neurotransmitter release compensates for diminished postsynaptic receptor functionality. To test the specificity of PHP induction and expression, we have developed a genetic manipulation to reduce postsynaptic receptor expression at one of the two muscles innervated by a single motor neuron. We find that PHP can be induced and expressed at a subset of synapses, over both acute and chronic time scales, without influencing transmission at adjacent release sites. Further, homeostatic modulations to CaMKII, vesicle pools, and functional release sites are compartmentalized and do not spread to neighboring pre- or post-synaptic structures. Thus, both PHP induction and expression mechanisms are locally transmitted and restricted to specific synaptic compartments.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34338.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Everything we think and do is the result of communication between neurons. This communication takes place at junctions called synapses. When two nerve cells or neurons communicate at a synapse, the output terminal of the first cell releases a chemical called a neurotransmitter. This binds to receiver proteins, or receptors, on the second cell. When this communication is interrupted, synapses can adapt to maintain a stable dialogue between them. This can occur in two ways. Either the first neuron starts to release more neurotransmitter from its output terminal, or the second neuron produces extra receptors with which to detect the neurotransmitter.</p><p>But how specific are these changes? The brain contains far more synapses than neurons because each neuron can form synapses with many other cells. Can a neuron adjust how much of the neurotransmitter it releases at some of its synapses while leaving the others unchanged?</p><p>Li et al. have now addressed this question by studying a special type of synapse that forms between neurons and muscles, known as a neuromuscular junction. At one particular neuromuscular junction in fruit flies, a single neuron splits into two output terminals, each of which forms a synapse with a different muscle. Li et al. show that when the number of neurotransmitter receptors in one of the muscles is artificially reduced, the associated output terminal compensates by increasing its neurotransmitter release. By contrast, the other output terminal remains unaffected.</p><p>This suggests that a neuron can induce remarkably specific changes in a subset of its synapses. This discovery paves the way towards identifying the smallest possible unit of change that can occur in the neurons’ ability to communicate. This unit may in turn be the smallest change that can support learning. Such knowledge will help us understand how the nervous system processes and stabilizes information transfer, both in health and after injury or disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>homeostatic</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular junction</kwd><kwd>synaptic terminals</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS091546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickman</surname><given-names>Dion K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickman</surname><given-names>Dion K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001207</institution-id><institution>Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Klingenstein-Simons Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickman</surname><given-names>Dion K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Klingenstein-Simons Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickman</surname><given-names>Dion K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Such plasticity mechanisms require compartmentalized trafficking and insertion of glutamate receptors (GluRs) into postsynaptic densities at specific locations in response to correlated activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herring and Nicoll, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Malinow, 2003</xref>). However, these processes of Hebbian plasticity are inherently destabilizing, and homeostatic mechanisms have been proposed to adaptively counteract such forces to maintain synaptic strength within physiologically stable levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pozo and Goda, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>). Although the induction and expression of various forms of plasticity can clearly be restricted to individual postsynaptic compartments, it is less certain that such plasticity can be similarly compartmentalized at the presynaptic terminals of a single neuron. There is evidence for heterogeneity in presynaptic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Branco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holderith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trommershäuser et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vitureira et al., 2011</xref>), and release probability can vary considerably along a single axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Murthy et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Paul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peled and Isacoff, 2011</xref>). Further, target-specific differences in presynaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frank, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Katz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scanziani et al., 1998</xref>) and homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis and Goodman, 1998</xref>) have been demonstrated. However, how presynaptic terminals are modulated by Hebbian and homeostatic forces and whether these adaptations can occur without ‘spreading’ to adjacent synapses remains enigmatic.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a powerful model system to interrogate the mechanisms governing homeostatic synaptic plasticity. At this glutamatergic synapse, genetic and pharmacological perturbations to postsynaptic receptors initiates a retrograde, trans-synaptic signaling system that homeostatically increases presynaptic neurotransmitter release to maintain stable levels of synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frank, 2014</xref>). This form of plasticity is achieved through an increase in presynaptic efficacy and is therefore referred to as presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). Parallel forms of homeostatic regulation are conserved at NMJs of rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cull-Candy et al., 1980</xref>). PHP initiates a single retrograde signaling system that triggers two key expression mechanisms to enhance presynaptic glutamate release: increases in both presynaptic calcium influx and the number of synaptic vesicles participating in the readily releasable pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kiragasi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Müller and Davis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Weyhersmüller et al., 2011</xref>). Several genes necessary for PHP expression have been identified that function as putative retrograde signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Orr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) and presynaptic effectors in the motor neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruckner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dickman and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dickman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kiragasi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Müller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tsurudome et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Younger et al., 2013</xref>), but the postsynaptic induction mechanisms that initiate PHP signaling remain enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Dickman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goel et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, PHP induction and expression at a subset of synapses within a single motor neuron has never been demonstrated at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ.</p><p>PHP is expressed exclusively at one of two motor neuron subtypes that innervate most muscles at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ, Type Is and Type Ib. Type Is motor inputs exhibit smaller boutons, less subsynaptic reticulum (SSR), higher basal release probability, and do not participate in PHP adaptation over chronic time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lnenicka and Keshishian, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newman et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, Type Ib motor neurons have larger boutons, more elaborate SSR, and lower basal release probability, which is enhanced after loss of postsynaptic GluRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newman et al., 2017</xref>), demonstrating that PHP is expressed exclusively at Type Ib synapses. Further, a reduction in phosphorylated (active) levels of CaMKII, presumably related to PHP inductive signaling, occurs specifically in the postsynaptic density of Ib boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newman et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting a possible mechanism for the specificity of retrograde PHP signaling to the Ib motor neuron. Despite these insights, it is not known whether PHP can be expressed at a subset of Type Ib boutons within a single motor terminal, nor whether PHP modulations at individual boutons influence neighboring synapses.</p><p>We have developed a genetic manipulation that enables the reduction of postsynaptic GluR expression on one of the two muscles innervated by a single Type Ib motor neuron at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ. We have used this system to test whether PHP signaling is synapse specific and to determine to what extent the postsynaptic induction and presynaptic expression of PHP is compartmentalized. This analysis has revealed highly specific and compartmentalized PHP adaptations that are restricted and target specific without influencing neurotransmission at neighboring synapses within the same motor neuron.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reduced expression of the glutamate receptor subunit <italic>GluRIIA</italic> specifically on muscle six at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ</title><p>The postsynaptic response to glutamate release at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ is mediated by two types of GluRs. Both types contain the essential subunits GluRIIC, GluRIID, and GluRIIE, but differ in containing either GluRIIA or GluRIIB subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DiAntonio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Featherstone et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marrus et al., 2004</xref>). Although null mutations in the <italic>GluRIIA</italic> subunit have been studied for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Petersen et al., 1997</xref>), RNAi knock-down of this receptor has not been reported or characterized. We obtained an RNAi transgene targeting the <italic>GluRIIA</italic> subunit (see Mateials and methods) and compared the impact of postsynaptic knock-down of <italic>GluRIIA</italic> by the muscle driver <italic>G14-Gal4</italic> (G14 &gt;GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup>) to <italic>GluRIIA</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). First, we immunostained the NMJ of wild type, <italic>GluRIIA</italic> mutants, and G14 &gt;GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup> with antibodies against the GluRIIA subunit as well as the common subunits GluRIIC and GluRIID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This revealed an absence of GluRIIA signals from <italic>GluRIIA</italic> mutants, as expected, with signals from GluRIIC and GluRIID persisting due to the remaining GluRIIB-containing receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Similarly, GluRIIA expression is almost completely absent in G14 &gt;GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup>, with no significant difference in fluorescence intensity compared to <italic>GluRIIA</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Indeed, quantitative PCR analysis revealed a dramatic reduction in the level of transcripts encoding the GluRIIA subunit in G14 &gt;GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup>, while levels of the other four subunits were not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, we quantified synaptic growth in these genotypes, finding a small reduction in bouton number in both <italic>GluRIIA</italic> mutants and G14 &gt;GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup> compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schmid et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sigrist et al., 2002</xref>).

We considered three possibilities for how presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites may be modulated within the single Ib terminal in response to <italic>GluRIIA</italic> knock down exclusively on muscle 6. First, if PHP signaling is communicated to synapses in the Ib motor neuron innervating muscle 6, but the entire motor neuron undergoes PHP adaptations, then quantal content would be enhanced on both muscles 6 and 7. Second, PHP signaling may be communicated to synapses innervating only muscle 6, but PHP expression may be occluded without simultaneous signaling also received from muscle 7, leading to no change in quantal content on either muscle. Finally, if PHP signaling is target-specific and compartmentalized, then quantal content should be selectively enhanced on synapses innervating muscle 6 in response to reduced <italic>GluRIIA</italic> expression, while synaptic function at synapses innervating the adjacent muscle seven would be unchanged.

One possibility is that PHP adaptations are induced throughout the entire motor neuron innervating both muscles 6 and 7, but that negative regulators are active that repress or occlude the expression of PHP on synapses innervating muscle 7. Indeed, such a model has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Müller et al., 2011</xref>). In this case, PHP should not be capable of being induced or expressed at the synapses innervating muscle seven in M6 &gt; GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup>. PHP can be acutely induced and expressed through a pharmacological blockade of the postsynaptic GluRs using a 10-min incubation in the presence of the antagonist philanthotoxin-433 (PhTx; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frank et al., 2006</xref>]). This results in an acute reduction in mEPSP amplitude due to blockade of GluRIIA-containing receptors in the postsynaptic muscle, but EPSP amplitudes are maintained because of PHP expression. We reasoned that acute application of PhTx to M6 &gt; GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup> NMJs would enable us to determine whether PHP could be induced and expressed at synapses innervating muscle 7 following chronic expression of PHP on the adjacent synapses innervating muscle 6.</p><p>We therefore applied PhTx to wild type and M6 &gt; GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup> synapses.

The RRP is defined as the pool of vesicles that are primed and available for immediate release upon strong synaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>). Although PHP expression appears to be compartmentalized, it is unknown whether conventional homeostatic modulations to the presynaptic terminal are similarly compartmentalized, or rather whether novel mechanisms are utilized in M6 &gt; GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup>. In particular, synaptic vesicles are highly mobile and can rapidly traffic between adjacent boutons at presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darcy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kahms and Klingauf, 2018</xref>), and vesicle pools can span multiple presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Staras et al., 2010</xref>).

We therefore measured the size of RRP in wild type and M6 &gt; GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup> synapses separately innervating muscles 6 and 7. To determine RRP size, we performed two electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) measurements using high-frequency stimulation (60 Hz) in elevated external calcium concentrations (3 mM) and measured the cumulative EPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kiragasi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Weyhersmüller et al., 2011</xref>).

The variance in the amplitude of repeated evoked responses fluctuates across different calcium concentrations in relation to the proportion of total release sites that participate in these responses. At low-calcium concentrations, the number of release sites that participate in the evoked response is low, and the variance is therefore small in this condition. As the extracellular calcium concentration is elevated, the variance then increases with increasing release during repeated evoked responses due to an increase in the number of release sites that participate in synaptic transmission.

In particular, if PHP signaling is induced at Ib postsynaptic densities through diminished pCaMKII levels, as suggested by immunostaining, then postsynaptic overexpression of a constitutively active, phospho-mimetic form of CaMKII, CaMKII<sup>T287D</sup>, should inhibit or occlude PHP induction and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haghighi et al., 2003</xref>). We first expressed CaMKII<sup>T287D</sup> alone on muscle 6 (M6&gt;CaMKII<sup>T287D</sup>) to determine if baseline synaptic function was influenced by constitutively active CaMKII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

Next, we expressed constitutively active CaMKII in combination with <italic>GluRIIA</italic> knock down on muscle 6 (M6 &gt; GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup> + CaMKII<sup>T287D</sup>). If reduced CaMKII activity were functionally required for retrograde PHP signaling, and not just a compartmentalized biomarker of GluRIIA levels and/or activity at Ib boutons, then constitutively active CaMKII should disrupt PHP expression at M6 &gt;GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup> synapses. Indeed, EPSP amplitude was not maintained at baseline levels due to a failure to homeostatically increase quantal content in M6 &gt; GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup> + CaMKII<sup>T287D</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–H</xref>).

In contrast, homeostatic plasticity at the human, mouse, and fly NMJ is expressed through a presynaptic enhancement in neurotransmitter release, but is induced through a diminishment of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cull-Candy et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frank et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Petersen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>). Using biased expression of <italic>Gal4</italic> to reduce GluR levels on only one of the two muscle targets innervated by a single motor neuron, we demonstrate that the inductive signaling underlying PHP is compartmentalized at the postsynaptic density, and does not influence activity at synapses innervating the adjacent muscle. Postsynaptic changes in CaMKII function and activity have been associated with PHP retrograde signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haghighi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newman et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this compartmentalized inductive signaling, we observed pCaMKII levels to be specifically reduced at postsynaptic densities of Ib boutons in which GluR expression is perturbed, while pCaMKII was unchanged at postsynaptic compartments opposite to Is boutons and at NMJs in the adjacent muscle with normal GluR expression. Further, postsynaptic overexpression of the constitutively active CaMKII occludes the expression of PHP. Similar synapse-specific control of postsynaptic CaMKII phosphorylation, modulated by activity, has been previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hodge et al., 2006</xref>). As noted in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newman et al., 2017</xref>), this localized reduction in pCaMKII provides a plausible mechanism for the inductive PHP signaling restricted to and compartmentalized at Ib synapses.</p><p>How does a perturbation to GluR function lead to a reduction in CaMKII activity that is restricted to postsynaptic densities opposing Type Ib boutons? Recent evidence suggests that distinct mechanisms regulate pCaMKII levels during retrograde PHP signaling depending on pharmacologic or genetic perturbation to glutamate receptors and the role of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goel et al., 2017</xref>). Scaffolds at postsynaptic densities are associated in complexes with GluRs and CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gillespie and Hodge, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hodge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mullasseril et al., 2007</xref>). Intriguingly, the scaffold dCASK is capable of modulating CaMKII activity at specific densities in an activity-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hodge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Malik et al., 2013</xref>). Further, CaMKII activity can regulate plasticity with specificity at subsets of synapses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Griffith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hodge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Merrill et al., 2005</xref>). Although we cannot rule out intra-cellular cross talk between Is and Ib boutons, as GluRIIA is reduced at postsynaptic sites of both neuronal subtypes, it is striking that reductions in pCaMKII are restricted to Ib postsynaptic compartments. An attractive model, therefore, is that the postsynaptic density isolates calcium signaling over chronic time scales to compartmentalize PHP induction. The membranous complexity and geometry of the SSR at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ may be the key to restricting calcium signaling at these sites, as this structure can have major impacts on ionic signaling during synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nguyen and Stewart, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Teodoro et al., 2013</xref>). These properties, in turn, may lead to local modulation of CaMKII function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Griffith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haghighi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newman et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants with defective SSR elaboration and complexity have been associated with defects in PHP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koles et al., 2015</xref>). In the mammalian central nervous system, it is well established that dendritic spines function as biochemical compartments that isolate calcium signaling while enabling propagation of voltage changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Svoboda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yuste and Denk, 1995</xref>), and it is tempting to speculate that the SSR may subserve similar functions at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ to enable synapse-specific retrograde signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Compartmentalization of presynaptic PHP expression</title><p>The homeostatic modulation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release is compartmentalized at the terminals of Type Ib motor neurons. It was previously known that PHP can be acutely induced and expressed without any information from the cell body of motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frank et al., 2006</xref>). Our data suggests that the signaling necessary for PHP expression is even further restricted to specific postsynaptic densities and presynaptic boutons, demonstrated through several lines of evidence. First, quantal content is specifically enhanced at boutons innervating muscle 6 in M6 &gt; GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup> without measurably impacting transmission on the neighboring boutons innervating muscle 7. In addition, PHP can be acutely induced at synapses innervating muscle 7 despite PHP having been chronically expressed at muscle 6. Finally, the homeostatic modulation of the RRP and enhancement of the functional number of release sites is fully expressed regardless of whether PHP is induced at all Type Ib boutons or only a subset. Thus, PHP signaling is orchestrated at specific boutons according to the state of GluR functionality of their synaptic partners and does not influence neighboring boutons within the same motor neuron.</p><p>Although the compartmentalized expression of PHP was not unexpected, there was precedent to suspect inter-bouton crosstalk during homeostatic signaling. In the dynamic propagation of action potentials along the axon, the waveform could, in principle, change following PHP expression to globally modulate neurotransmission at all release sites in the same neuron. However, voltage imaging did not identify any change in the action potential waveform at individual boutons following PHP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ford and Davis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaviño et al., 2015</xref>), and we did not observe any impact on neighboring boutons despite PHP being induced at a subset of synapses in the same motor neuron. Further, mobilization of an enhanced readily releasable synaptic vesicle pool is necessary for the expression of PHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kiragasi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Weyhersmüller et al., 2011</xref>), and synaptic vesicles and pools are highly mobile within and between presynaptic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darcy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kahms and Klingauf, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Staras et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, it was conceivable that a mobilized RRP, induced at some presynaptic compartments, may be promiscuously shared between other boutons. However, while we observed a large enhancement in the RRP at synapses innervating muscle 6 in M6 &gt; GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup>, this adaptation had no impact on the RRP at adjacent presynaptic compartments innervating muscle 7. Thus, PHP signaling is constrained to boutons innervating one of two postsynaptic targets and does not ‘spread’ to synapses innervating the adjacent target despite sharing common cytosol, voltage, and synaptic vesicles.</p><p>What molecular mechanisms mediate the remarkable specificity of PHP expression at presynaptic compartments? One attractive possibility is that active zones themselves are fundamental units and act as substrates for the homeostatic modulation of presynaptic function. The active zone scaffold BRP remodels during both acute and chronic PHP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Weyhersmüller et al., 2011</xref>), and other active zone proteins are likely to participate in this remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gratz et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, many genes encoding active zone components are required for PHP expression, including the calcium channel <italic>cac</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frank et al., 2006</xref>) and auxiliary subunit <italic>α2-δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>), the <italic>piccolo</italic> homolog <italic>fife</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruckner et al., 2017</xref>), the scaffolds <italic>RIM</italic> (<italic>Rab3-interacting Molecule</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Müller et al., 2012</xref>]) and <italic>RIM-binding protein</italic> (<italic>RBP</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Müller et al., 2015</xref>]), and the kainite receptor <italic>DKaiR1D</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kiragasi et al., 2017</xref>). If individual active zones can undergo the adaptations necessary and sufficient for PHP expression, this would imply that PHP can be induced and expressed with specificity at individual active zones. Indeed, the BRP cytomatrix stabilizes calcium channel levels at the active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>), and also controls the size of the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matkovic et al., 2013</xref>), two key presynaptic expression mechanisms that drive PHP. Further, we and others have observed the recruitment of new functional release sites following both chronic and acute PHP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Weyhersmüller et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that previously silent active zones become ‘awakened’ and utilized to potentiate presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Interestingly, presynaptic GluRs, localized near active zones, are necessary for PHP expression and have the capacity to modulate release with specificity at individual active zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kiragasi et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, active zones can remodel with both the specificity and precision necessary and sufficient for compartmentalized PHP expression.</p><p>If each active zone operates as an independent homeostat to adjust release efficacy in response to target-specific changes, how is information transfer at individual sites integrated to ensure stable and stereotypic global levels of neurotransmission? One speculative possibility is that active zones at terminals of each neuron are endowed with a total abundance of material that is tightly controlled and sets stable global levels of presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Such active zone material may be sculpted with considerable heterogeneity within presynaptic terminals, varying in number, size, and density. Consistent with such a possibility, mutations in the synaptic vesicle component Rab3 exhibit extreme changes in active zone size, number, and density, but stable global levels of neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graf et al., 2009</xref>). Within this global context, plasticity mechanisms may operate at individual active zones, superimposed as independent homeostats to adaptively modulate synaptic strength. In addition, there is intriguing evidence for the existence of ‘nanocolumns’ between presynaptic active zones and postsynaptic GluRs that form structural and functional signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biederer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). One particularly appealing possibility, therefore, is that a dialogue traversing synaptic nanocolumns functions to convey the retrograde signaling and active zone remodeling necessary for PHP expression at individual release sites. Studies in mammalian neurons have revealed parallel links between the functional plasticity of active zones, including their structure and size, and the homeostatic modulation of neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glebov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Murthy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schikorski and Stevens, 2001</xref>). Such intercellular signaling systems are likely to modify synaptic structure and function to not only establish precise pre- and post-synaptic apposition during development, but also to maintain the plasticity necessary for synapses to persist with the flexibility and stability to last a lifetime.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and genetics</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks were raised at 25°C on standard molasses food.

EPSC amplitudes were monitored during the exchange, and 30 EPSC (0.5 Hz stimulation rate) recordings were performed in each calcium condition. To obtain the variance-mean plot, the variance (squared standard deviation) and mean (averaged evoked amplitude) were calculated from the 30 EPSCs at each individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. The variance was then plotted against the mean for each specific calcium condition using MATLAB software (MathWorks, USA). One additional data point, in which variance and mean are both theoretically at 0, was used for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free saline. Data from these five conditions were fit with a standard parabola (variance = Q*Ī -Ī<sup>2</sup>/N), where Q is the quantal size, Ī is the mean evoked amplitude (x-axis), and N is the functional number of release sites. N, as a parameter of the standard parabola, was directly calculated for each cell by best parabolic fit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are presented as mean ± SEM.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Baines (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Here the authors report elegant experiments that show that different terminals of the same motor neuron can undergo Presynaptic Homeostatic Plasticity (PHP) independently in response to knockdown of GluRIIA subunit on one muscle but not another also innervated by the same motor neuron. They present strong physiological evidence that the terminal of the motor neuron on the affected muscle undergo PHP do so by increasing the number of release sites and the readily releasable pool of vesicles specifically at boutons on the affected muscle. They also show that pCaMKII is down regulated opposite to Ib boutons on the affected muscle but not opposite Ib boutons on the other muscle. The experiments are very well controlled and supplementary data are germane, useful and well integrated. They argue that although the compartmentalized expression of PHP was not unexpected, given such early work as that by Hodge et al. 2006 on terminal specific pCaMKII expression, there was precedent to suspect inter-terminal crosstalk during homeostatic signaling and they have carefully ruled this out. The Discussion is informative and provocative suggesting how bouton specific postsynaptic retrograde signaling necessary to give the new results might occur.</p><p>The wider appeal of this work derives from how it fits with existing literature on synaptic plasticity and synaptic scaling in the vertebrate CNS providing an intriguing presynaptic alternative bouton specific mechanism of synaptic homeostatic scaling.</p><p>The writing is very clear and the figures nicely illustrative of the methods and the results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There was a concern brought up vis a vis significance in that this study does not really extend current mechanistic understanding. If there is any place in this paper where this concern can be overcome, it would be to extend the result in Figure 5 (localized CaMKII de-phosphorylation as an instructive mechanism to induce PHP). This point is centered around the fact that the evidence is not air tight that CaMKII de-phosphorylation is actually driving a retrograde signal downstream of GluRIIA loss. In fact the authors appear to recognize this point and use qualified language, leaving open the possibility that CaMKII de-phosphorylation is just a sentinel for GluRIIA loss (&quot;plausible mechanism&quot; and &quot;presumably related to PHP inductive signaling&quot;).</p><p>There are a few different ways this could be tested electrophysiologically. We would like you to consider whether one of these experiments is feasible within a short time-frame and whether you agree that it would strengthen the paper. If so, we would encourage you to do the experiment.</p><p>There are several possible experiments. Each would require a control electrophysiology data set and an experimental set. We think you have the expertise and resources to do one of these quickly.</p><p>a) M6 &gt; UAS-CaMKII-ala vs. M6 &gt; UAS-CaMKII-ala + &gt; UAS-GluRIIA-RNAi. Record from both muscle 6 and muscle 7 as before. The expectation in muscle 6 would be that non-phosphorylatable CaMKII-ala instructively induces increased transmitter release in a way that is not additive with the addition of GluRIIA loss.</p><p>b) M6 &gt; UAS-CaMKII-T287D vs. M6 &gt; UAS-CaMKII-T287D + &gt; UAS-GluRIIA RNAi. Record from both muscle 6 and muscle 7 as before. The expectation in muscle 6 would be that muscle expression of the constitutively phospho-mimetic version of CaMKII would block homeostatic potentiation of function. This is the experiment that the current manuscript says was done in Haghighi et al., 2003, but it was not really done because that paper does not check for baseline neurotransmission defects in T287D.</p><p>c) M6 &gt; UAS-CamKII-ala vs. M6 &gt; UAS-Tor vs. M6 &gt; UAS-CaMKII-ala + &gt; UAS-Tor. Record from both muscle 6 and 7. The expectation here is the same as in #1 above, non-additivity with muscle-driven UAS-Tor, which has been shown by multiple groups to induce presynaptic potentiation. The Dickman lab has the UAS-Tor line.</p><p>d) Show some evidence (any evidence) for the PSD/SSR model in the Discussion. With the M6 &gt; UAS-GluRIIA-RNAi manipulation, it is a conundrum that GluRIIA is diminished at both Is and Ib boutons in muscle 6, but it is only at the Ib boutons where p-CaMKII is down. It is speculated that the PSD/SSR has something to do with this. At the Is boutons, Dlg is naturally diminished. So maybe the solution is to look at this problem in the context of globally diminished Dlg? We are less sure about what to expect here. The model is speculative.</p><p>There are several other points that should be addressed in the expert review but the Ca-imaging experiments suggested are not required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>1) Driver Controls. The study relies on RNAi-mediated genetic knockdown of the GluRIIA subunit gene, using various muscle Gal4 manipulations to drive a UAS-GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup> line. All of the electrophysiology and immunostaining and statistical analyses reported in the main figures utilize <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> as a control, as opposed to Gal4 (or RNAi line/+) alone. Driver controls would be better than <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> alone.</p><p>On the one hand, this does not pose a problem for the authors' main conclusions – one could view the Gal4/RNAi combination as a single, collective genetic perturbation that serves to reduce quantal size (or reduce CaMKII phosphorylation) versus <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>. On the other hand, since several of these reagents are being utilized and reported in the context of homeostatic plasticity for the first time (especially &quot;M6-Gal4&quot;, which is comprised of multiple genetic manipulations), it would be better to report contributions of proper genetic controls in the main figures. It seems like the authors already have a better control already reported in the supplemental figure (M6-Gal4/mCherryRNAi). A G14/+ control would be also appropriate elsewhere.</p><p>2) CaMKII and mechanism. The authors follow up on prior work from their lab (Goel et al., 2017) and other labs (Newman et al., 2017; Hodge et al., 2006; Haghighi et al., 2003) to suggest that dephosphorylation of CaMKII in the muscle &quot;mediates PHP induction&quot;. In the Discussion, much is offered about how this induction could potentially be working via CaMKII and the PSD (subsection “Compartmentalization of postsynaptic PHP signaling”, first paragraph).</p><p>It might be a nitpicky point, but the prior literature is not airtight on p-CaMKII's role in opposing retrograde signaling during PHP. The authors reference the T287D data from the Goodman lab (Haghighi et al., 2003). Those data were collected in a GluRIIA<sup>SP16</sup> (or UAS-GluRIIAM/R) background, and baseline neurotransmission was not documented. Similarly, for studies utilizing the non-phospho UAS-CaMKIIala (T287A) reagent (Haghighi, Newman), it is not tested if the gains in neurotransmission are additive or non-additive in a GluRIIA null background. Muddying matters, there is other published work (e.g. Morimoto et al., Neuroscience 2010) that seems to suggest an opposite type of role for these gain- and loss-of-function alleles. That work invokes the opposite idea that CaMKII itself might be regulating GluR levels.</p><p>To be clear, the authors' demonstration that GluRIIA subunit loss promotes local CaMKII de-phosphorylation is solid data. It is a demonstration of a localized, visible response. That speaks to the main finding of the paper. However, it could still be the case that the CaMKII phenotype is reflective of muscle GluRIIA loss – and not actually an instructive part of homeostatic retrograde signaling itself. With their current data, the authors could qualify their discussion about CaMKII.</p><p>If the authors wished to extend the point about dephosphorylation of T287 CaMKII playing an instructive role in homeostatic potentiation, they could pursue other experiments. One idea would be to combine the Ala reagent with GluRIIA loss (or with Target of Rapamycin overexpression). For those genetic combinations, one might expect non-additivity in potentiation – as the Dickman lab recently demonstrated when combining GluRIIA loss and TOR overexpression (Goel et al., 2017).</p><p>3) Postsynaptic GluRIIA loss is muscle-specific, but not Ib-specific. The local versus global experiments in this paper provide compelling evidence that homeostatic potentiation signals do not &quot;spread&quot; (Introduction, end of first paragraph) from one presynaptic site Ib bouton to others presynaptic sites innervating the adjacent muscle. But the presynapse is not the only locus from which signals may spread. The GluRIIA loss perturbations are global (in a muscle-specific way). In theory, &quot;homeostatic signals&quot; (of any sort) could spread from postsynaptic Is sites to Ib sites within a given muscle, downstream of GluRIIA-containing receptor loss. Even though PHP is not expressed via the presynaptic Is boutons (Newman), and postsynaptic CaMKII phosphorylation is not dampened at Is loci, this idea could still be discussed.</p><p>4) Novelty of studying local presynaptic plasticity mechanisms. The Abstract and Introduction (first paragraph) state that it is uncertain whether plasticity mechanisms can be locally compartmentalized in a single presynaptic neuron's terminals. This is not quite correct.</p><p>The authors are correct that the question addressing PHP in this way has not been done before. But In the realm of synaptic plasticity (and NMJs in particular), there are many studies reaching back four decades or more that demonstrate target-specific presynaptic plasticity (see for example Frank, 1973; as well as Katz et al., 1993) at the lobster NMJ, terminals from a single neuron facilitate to varying degrees depending on the muscle contacted). Most relevant for the present study, the study cited for the H94 driver (Davis and Goodman, 1998) shows that forcing altered innervation between muscles 6 and 7 results in site-specific changes in neurotransmission. A broader plasticity context for the present work would be appropriate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>My specific concerns are:</p><p>1) The GluRIIA RNAi would appear to be very effective. It would be a useful addition to quantitate this by QRT-PCR: perhaps using a pan-muscle GAL4 driver. Based on the IHC shown in Figure 2, one might predict KD to be &gt;90% (which would be unusual, but not unheard of, for an RNAi).</p><p>2) Figure 6 reports the RRP and shows ejps elicited at 60Hz. The RRP is calculated, presumably, by dividing the cumulative ejp by mini size? One must presume, therefore, that minis were measured under voltage clamp? Mini data should be added to the figure to allow the reader to appreciate how the RRP was calculated. Alternatively, the precise manner in which RRP was calculated (in addition to relevant values) should be described.</p><p>3) With regard the theoretical calculation of N shown in Figure 7. Theory is one thing, but validation through experiment would be a welcome addition. Can the authors provide experimental validation – perhaps through use of GCaMP signalling (e.g. as per the Littleton lab) – to observe increased N?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34338.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There was a concern brought up vis a vis significance in that this study does not really extend current mechanistic understanding.

In fact the authors appear to recognize this point and use qualified language, leaving open the possibility that CaMKII de-phosphorylation is just a sentinel for GluRIIA loss (&quot;plausible mechanism&quot; and &quot;presumably related to PHP inductive signaling&quot;).</p><p>There are a few different ways this could be tested electrophysiologically. We would like you to consider whether one of these experiments is feasible within a short time-frame and whether you agree that it would strengthen the paper. If so, we would encourage you to do the experiment.</p><p>There are several possible experiments. Each would require a control electrophysiology data set and an experimental set. We think you have the expertise and resources to do one of these quickly.</p><p>a) M6 &gt; UAS-CaMKII-ala vs. M6 &gt; UAS-CaMKII-ala + &gt; UAS-GluRIIA-RNAi. Record from both muscle 6 and muscle 7 as before. The expectation in muscle 6 would be that non-phosphorylatable CaMKII-ala instructively induces increased transmitter release in a way that is not additive with the addition of GluRIIA loss.</p><p>b) M6 &gt; UAS-CaMKII-T287D vs. M6 &gt; UAS-CaMKII-T287D + &gt; UAS-GluRIIA RNAi. Record from both muscle 6 and muscle 7 as before. The expectation in muscle 6 would be that muscle expression of the constitutively phospho-mimetic version of CaMKII would block homeostatic potentiation of function. This is the experiment that the current manuscript says was done in Haghighi et al., 2003, but it was not really done because that paper does not check for baseline neurotransmission defects in T287D.</p><p>c) M6 &gt; UAS-CamKII-ala vs. M6 &gt; UAS-Tor vs. M6 &gt; UAS-CaMKII-ala + &gt; UAS-Tor. Record from both muscle 6 and 7. The expectation here is the same as in #1 above, non-additivity with muscle-driven UAS-Tor, which has been shown by multiple groups to induce presynaptic potentiation. The Dickman lab has the UAS-Tor line.</p><p>d) Show some evidence (any evidence) for the PSD/SSR model in the Discussion. With the M6 &gt; UAS-GluRIIA-RNAi manipulation, it is a conundrum that GluRIIA is diminished at both Is and Ib boutons in muscle 6, but it is only at the Ib boutons where p-CaMKII is down. It is speculated that the PSD/SSR has something to do with this. At the Is boutons, Dlg is naturally diminished. So maybe the solution is to look at this problem in the context of globally diminished Dlg? We are less sure about what to expect here. The model is speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers request that we consider several possible experiments to provide mechanistic insight into the role of postsynaptic CaMKII and/or the subsynaptic reticulum opposite Ib bouton compartments in retrograde PHP signaling. In response, we have made attempts at all four proposed experiments. Although three of these experiments led to inconclusive results that require substantial additional work to properly interpret, one gave clear and conclusive insights regarding the requirement of CaMKII activity in driving PHP signaling following <italic>GluRIIA</italic> knock down. Details of this approach are discussed below.</p><p>M6&gt;CaMKII-T287D +/- GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup>: As suggested by the reviewers, we overexpressed a transgene in the muscle, UAS-CaMKII-T287D, that constitutes a phospho-mimetic (constitutively active) version of CaMKII. Strong evidence for a required role of CaMKII in chronic PHP signaling was described in Haghighi et al., 2003, in which postsynaptic expression of this transgene was used to disrupt PHP expression in <italic>GluRIIA</italic> mutants. We expressed this transgene using the M6&gt;Gal4 manipulation. While baseline function was not significantly impacted by M6&gt;CaMKII-T287D, PHP failed to be expressed in M6&gt;CaMKII-T287D+GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup> (New Figure 8). This suggests that a reduction in postsynaptic CaMKII activity is necessary to induce retrograde PHP signaling, at least in the case of chronic genetic loss of the <italic>GluRIIA</italic> subunit.</p><p>These results are now detailed in an entirely new Figure 8, which we agree helps to extend mechanistic insight into the compartmentalized induction and expression of PHP. Given these new findings, we have altered the order of the figures in the revised manuscript to first describe the M6-Gal4 manipulation (Figures 1-2), then focus on compartmentalized presynaptic PHP expression mechanisms (Figures 3-6), and finally provide evidence for postsynaptic compartmentalized PHP induction via modulation of CaMKII activity (Figures 7-8). We thank the reviewers for pushing us to more fully consider and test the role of CaMKII in PHP signaling, which has substantially improved the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several other points that should be addressed in the expert review but the Ca-imaging experiments suggested are not required.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) Driver Controls. The study relies on RNAi-mediated genetic knockdown of the GluRIIA subunit gene, using various muscle Gal4 manipulations to drive a UAS-GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup> line. All of the electrophysiology and immunostaining and statistical analyses reported in the main figures utilize w1118 as a control, as opposed to Gal4 (or RNAi line/+) alone. Driver controls would be better than w1118 alone. On the one hand, this does not pose a problem for the authors' main conclusions – one could view the Gal4/RNAi combination as a single, collective genetic perturbation that serves to reduce quantal size (or reduce CaMKII phosphorylation) versus w1118. On the other hand, since several of these reagents are being utilized and reported in the context of homeostatic plasticity for the first time (especially &quot;M6-Gal4&quot;, which is comprised of multiple genetic manipulations), it would be better to report contributions of proper genetic controls in the main figures. It seems like the authors already have a better control already reported in the supplemental figure (M6-Gal4/mCherryRNAi). A G14/+ control would be also appropriate elsewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2—figure supplement 1, we demonstrate that <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>, used throughout the manuscript as our “wild type” control, is not significantly different from an important genetic control for the M6-Gal4 manipulation: M6-Gal4&gt;mCherry<sup>RNAi</sup>. This genotype controls for expression of an unrelated RNAi transgene (targeting mCherry), but otherwise includes the same genetic background and manipulations included in the M6&gt;GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup> used throughout the manuscript. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1, we show that muscle size, bouton number, active zone number, mEPSP amplitude, EPSP amplitude, and quantal content do not significantly differ in M6&gt;mCherry<sup>RNAi</sup> from <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>. We then use <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> as our control for the remainder of the manuscript. However, for additional thoroughness, we have also directly compared the results of M6&gt;GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup> shown in Figures 2, 3, and 4to M6&gt;mCherry<sup>RNAi</sup>, which found the same statistically significant or insignificant differences as reported when compared to <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>. This is now discussed in the Materials and methods subsection “Statistical analysis”.</p><p>In addition, as suggested by the reviewer, we performed additional electrophysiological experiments using the driver only control (<italic>G14-Gal4/+</italic>). We found no significant difference in mEPSP amplitude, EPSP amplitude, or quantal content in <italic>G14-Gal4/+</italic> compared to <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>, but a significant difference was observed when compared to <italic>GluRIIA</italic> mutants and G14&gt;GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup>, as expected. This is now discussed in the first paragraph of the subsection “Reduced expression of the glutamate receptor subunit <italic>GluRIIA</italic> specifically on muscle 6 at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ”and shown in Supplementary file 1. We thank the reviewer for these suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) CaMKII and mechanism. The authors follow up on prior work from their lab (Goel et al., 2017) and other labs (Newman et al., 2017; Hodge et al., 2006; Haghighi et al., 2003) to suggest that dephosphorylation of CaMKII in the muscle &quot;mediates PHP induction&quot;. In the Discussion, much is offered about how this induction could potentially be working via CaMKII and the PSD (subsection “Compartmentalization of postsynaptic PHP signaling”, first paragraph).</p><p>It might be a nitpicky point, but the prior literature is not airtight on p-CaMKII's role in opposing retrograde signaling during PHP. The authors reference the T287D data from the Goodman lab (Haghighi et al., 2003). Those data were collected in a GluRIIA<sup>SP16</sup> (or UAS-GluRIIAM/R) background, and baseline neurotransmission was not documented. Similarly, for studies utilizing the non-phospho UAS-CaMKIIala (T287A) reagent (Haghighi, Newman), it is not tested if the gains in neurotransmission are additive or non-additive in a GluRIIA null background. Muddying matters, there is other published work (e.g. Morimoto et al., Neuroscience 2010) that seems to suggest an opposite type of role for these gain- and loss-of-function alleles. That work invokes the opposite idea that CaMKII itself might be regulating GluR levels.</p><p>To be clear, the authors' demonstration that GluRIIA subunit loss promotes local CaMKII de-phosphorylation is solid data. It is a demonstration of a localized, visible response. That speaks to the main finding of the paper. However, it could still be the case that the CaMKII phenotype is reflective of muscle GluRIIA loss – and not actually an instructive part of homeostatic retrograde signaling itself. With their current data, the authors could qualify their discussion about CaMKII.</p><p>If the authors wished to extend the point about dephosphorylation of T287 CaMKII playing an instructive role in homeostatic potentiation, they could pursue other experiments. One idea would be to combine the Ala reagent with GluRIIA loss (or with Target of Rapamycin overexpression). For those genetic combinations, one might expect non-additivity in potentiation – as the Dickman lab recently demonstrated when combining GluRIIA loss and TOR overexpression (Goel et al., 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions and agree this would be of interest. We have responded in detail to these points in the “Essential revisions” section above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Postsynaptic GluRIIA loss is muscle-specific, but not Ib-specific. The local versus global experiments in this paper provide compelling evidence that homeostatic potentiation signals do not &quot;spread&quot; (Introduction, end of first paragraph) from one presynaptic site Ib bouton to others presynaptic sites innervating the adjacent muscle. But the presynapse is not the only locus from which signals may spread. The GluRIIA loss perturbations are global (in a muscle-specific way). In theory, &quot;homeostatic signals&quot; (of any sort) could spread from postsynaptic Is sites to Ib sites within a given muscle, downstream of GluRIIA-containing receptor loss. Even though PHP is not expressed via the presynaptic Is boutons (Newman), and postsynaptic CaMKII phosphorylation is not dampened at Is loci, this idea could still be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for raising this valid point. We have now discussed this interesting idea in the revised Discussion (subsection “Compartmentalization of postsynaptic PHP signaling”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Novelty of studying local presynaptic plasticity mechanisms. The Abstract and Introduction (first paragraph) state that it is uncertain whether plasticity mechanisms can be locally compartmentalized in a single presynaptic neuron's terminals. This is not quite correct.</p><p>The authors are correct that the question addressing PHP in this way has not been done before. But In the realm of synaptic plasticity (and NMJs in particular), there are many studies reaching back four decades or more that demonstrate target-specific presynaptic plasticity (see for example Frank, 1973; as well as Katz et al., 1993) at the lobster NMJ, terminals from a single neuron facilitate to varying degrees depending on the muscle contacted). Most relevant for the present study, the study cited for the H94 driver (Davis and Goodman, 1998) shows that forcing altered innervation between muscles 6 and 7 results in site-specific changes in neurotransmission. A broader plasticity context for the present work would be appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing these important studies to our attention. We agree they should be discussed as part of the framing of our manuscript. We have now revised the Introduction (first paragraph) to integrate these important studies and give credit for contributing insights into target-specific presynaptic plasticity mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>My specific concerns are:</p><p>1) The GluRIIA RNAi would appear to be very effective. It would be a useful addition to quantitate this by QRT-PCR: perhaps using a pan-muscle GAL4 driver. Based on the IHC shown in Figure 2, one might predict KD to be &gt;90% (which would be unusual, but not unheard of, for an RNAi).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the immunostaining results suggest a very effective <italic>GluRIIA</italic> knock down, and that quantification of this would be of interest. We utilized the newest generation of RNAi transgenes (TRiP lines) to target the <italic>GluRIIA</italic> subunit for knock down, and performed qPCR to measure levels of all 5 GluR subunits. This analysis revealed an 84% reduction of <italic>GluRIIA</italic> transcript levels in G14&gt;GluRIIA<sup>RNAi</sup>, while transcripts encoding the other 4 GluR subunits were not significantly impacted. This data is now included in a new Figure 1 panel (Figure 1C) in the revised manuscript and discussed in the first paragraph of the subsection “Reduced expression of the glutamate receptor subunit <italic>GluRIIA</italic> specifically on muscle 6 at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ”. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 6 reports the RRP and shows ejps elicited at 60Hz. The RRP is calculated, presumably, by dividing the cumulative ejp by mini size? One must presume, therefore, that minis were measured under voltage clamp? Mini data should be added to the figure to allow the reader to appreciate how the RRP was calculated. Alternatively, the precise manner in which RRP was calculated (in addition to relevant values) should be described.</p></disp-quote><p>This concern was shared by reviewer 2. We have added the mEPSC values as a new panel in Figure 5 (Figure 5C), and thank the reviewer for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) With regard the theoretical calculation of N shown in Figure 7. Theory is one thing, but validation through experiment would be a welcome addition. Can the authors provide experimental validation – perhaps through use of GCaMP signalling (e.g. as per the Littleton lab) – to observe increased N?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this approach would be of interest. We have initiated calcium imaging studies in our lab using the SynaptoGCaMP6f reporter recently described in Newmann et al., 2017. Although the results are too preliminary to include in the present manuscript, we hope to include the outcomes of this approach in a future study. That being said, there is direct evidence for additional functional release sites recruited to participate in transmission at Ib boutons of <italic>GluRIIA</italic> mutants. This was reported in Newmann et al., 2017, in which they used calcium imaging to reveal what they referred to as “awakening” of release site number at Ib boutons during PHP. These imaging results are consistent with the mean/variance electrophysiological analysis reported in our manuscript (revised Figure 6).</p></body></sub-article></article>
