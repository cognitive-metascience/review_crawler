Their maturation requires the cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly (CIA) machinery. To identify new CIA proteins we employed systematic protein interaction approaches and discovered the essential proteins Yae1 and Lto1 as binding partners of the CIA targeting complex. Depletion of Yae1 or Lto1 results in defective Fe-S maturation of the ribosome-associated ABC protein Rli1, but surprisingly no other tested targets. Yae1 and Lto1 facilitate Fe-S cluster assembly on Rli1 in a chain of binding events. Lto1 uses its conserved C-terminal tryptophan for binding the CIA targeting complex, the deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motifs in both Yae1 and Lto1 facilitate their complex formation, and Yae1 recruits Rli1. Human YAE1D1 and the cancer-related ORAOV1 can replace their yeast counterparts demonstrating evolutionary conservation. Collectively, the Yae1-Lto1 complex functions as a target-specific adaptor that recruits apo-Rli1 to the generic CIA machinery.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08231.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08231.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08231.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many proteins depend on small molecules called cofactors to be able to perform their roles in cells. One class of proteins—the iron-sulfur proteins—contain cofactors that are made of clusters of iron and sulfide ions. In yeast, humans and other eukaryotes, the clusters are assembled and incorporated into their target proteins by a group of assembly factors called the CIA machinery.</p><p>Several components of the CIA machinery have previously been identified and most of them appear to be core components that are needed to assemble many different proteins in cells. Since these iron-sulfur proteins are involved in important processes such as the production of proteins and the maintenance of DNA, losing of any of these CIA proteins tends to be lethal to the organism.</p><p>Paul et al. used several ‘proteomic’ techniques to study the assembly of iron-sulfur proteins in yeast and identified two new proteins called Yae1 and Lto1 that are involved in this process. Unlike other CIA proteins, Yae1 and Lto1 are only required for the assembly of just one particular iron-sulfur protein called Rli1, which is essential for the production of proteins. Most newly made iron-sulfur proteins can bind directly to a group of CIA proteins called the CIA targeting complex, but Rli1 cannot. The experiments show that Lto1 binds to both the CIA targeting complex and to Yae1, which in turn recruits the Rli1 to the CIA complex.</p><p>Paul et al. also show that humans have proteins that are very similar to Yae1 and Lto1. Inserting the human counterparts of Yae1 and Lto1 into yeast lacking these proteins could fully restore the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters into Rli1. This suggests that Yae1 and Lto1 proteins evolved in the common ancestors of fungi and humans and have changed little since. Taken together, Paul et al.'s findings reveal that Yae1 and Lto1 act as adaptors that link the rest of the CIA machinery to their specific target protein Rli1 in yeast and humans. A future challenge is to find out the three-dimensional structures of Yae1 and Lto1 to better understand how these proteins work and interact.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08231.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08231.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd><kwd>metal biology</kwd><kwd>iron-sulfur protein biogenesis</kwd><kwd>CIA machinery</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 593, GRK1216, SPP 1710</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lill</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellow</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lill</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LOEWE Zentrum Synmikro Marburg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lill</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01GS0865</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gavin</surname><given-names>Anne-Claude</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK1216, TA320-3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taxis</surname><given-names>Christof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two newly identified assembly factors for the ribosome-associated iron-sulfur protein Rli1 reveal a general mechanism for how the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) machinery recruits apoproteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maturation of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins in (non-plant) eukaryotes depends on the coordinated action of complex proteinaceous machineries in mitochondria and cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lill, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stehling and Lill, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lukes and Basu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maio and Rouault, 2015</xref>). The mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery not only generates the organellar Fe-S proteins but is also essential for the biogenesis of cytosolic and nuclear Fe-S proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kispal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biederbick et al., 2006</xref>). The core part of the mitochondrial ISC machinery generates a sulfur-containing compound that is exported to the cytosol via the ABC transporter Atm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kispal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lill et al., 2014</xref>). Maturation of cytosolic and nuclear Fe-S proteins is further assisted by the cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly (CIA) machinery that is conserved in virtually all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Netz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paul and Lill, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cell biological and biochemical investigations have revealed nine CIA proteins, and an initial mechanistic model of their function has been generated mainly from work in the model organism <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and in human cell culture. The first known step of this biosynthetic process involves the de novo assembly of a [4Fe-4S] cluster on the scaffold protein complex consisting of the two related P-loop NTPases Cfd1 and Nbp35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hausmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Netz et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Basu et al., 2014</xref>). Cluster assembly additionally depends on the electron transfer chain composed of NADPH, the diflavin reductase Tah18 and the Fe-S protein Dre2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Netz et al., 2010</xref>). The second step includes the release of the [4Fe-4S] cluster from the scaffold complex, cluster transfer and subsequent insertion into apoproteins. These reactions are assisted by the iron-only hydrogenase-like protein Nar1 (human IOP1) which fulfils an intermediary, so far not well-defined function, by binding to both Nbp35 and the CIA targeting complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Song and Lee, 2008</xref>). The latter is composed of the WD40-repeat protein Cia1, the DUF59 domain protein Cia2 and the HEAT-repeat protein Mms19. All three proteins are conserved from yeast to man, and physically associate with multiple Fe-S target proteins suggesting a direct function in cluster transfer and/or insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weerapana et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stehling et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2013</xref>).</p><p>Impairment of either the ISC or CIA components leads to a maturation defect of numerous Fe-S proteins with a function in genome maintenance including DNA polymerases and DNA helicases. In turn, ISC or CIA depletion causes severe defects in DNA metabolism including DNA synthesis and repair, chromosome segregation and telomere length regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Veatch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thierbach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stehling et al., 2012</xref>). As a result, the DNA damage response pathway is activated. Another interesting target of the CIA machinery is the essential ABC protein Rli1 (RNase L inhibitor; human ABCE1). It belongs to the most conserved proteins in Eukarya and Archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barthelme et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becker et al., 2012</xref>), and harbors an N-terminal ferredoxin-like domain with eight conserved cysteine residues that coordinate two [4Fe-4S] clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karcher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kispal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barthelme et al., 2007</xref>). Depletion of Rli1 or disruption of Fe-S cofactor binding leads to nuclear export defects of both ribosomal subunits and consequently to translational arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kispal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yarunin et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, Rli1 directly influences protein synthesis via different roles in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2006</xref>), termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khoshnevis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shoemaker and Green, 2011</xref>), and splitting of ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barthelme et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shoemaker and Green, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becker et al., 2012</xref>). Maintenance of Rli1 function was recently suggested to be the ‘Achilles' heel’ of aerobic organisms, because Fe-S cofactor supply to Rli1 is sensitive to diverse pro-oxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alhebshi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that additional CIA factors may exist. These may include target-specific biogenesis factors that, similar to the mitochondrial ISC proteins Ind1, Nfu1, and BOLA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stehling and Lill, 2013</xref>), assist the maturation of selected apoproteins. Such dedicated CIA proteins are expected to bind to both the late-acting CIA components and specific target Fe-S proteins. Here, we performed systematic protein interaction screens in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to identify new CIA interaction partners. We describe the essential proteins Yae1 and Lto1 as binding partners of the CIA targeting complex. Previously, both proteins were shown to be associated with each other and to interact with the ribosome-associated Fe-S protein Rli1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krogan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhai et al., 2014</xref>). While the role of Yae1 is unknown, Lto1 (‘required for biogenesis of the <bold>l</bold>arge ribosomal subunit and initiation of <bold>t</bold>ranslation in <bold>o</bold>xygen’) was linked to the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit and translation initiation under aerobic conditions, yet its precise task remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhai et al., 2014</xref>). In this work, we functionally characterized the yeast and human Yae1-Lto1 complexes as novel target-specific CIA maturation factors for Fe-S cluster assembly on Rli1. Newly developed biochemical approaches and mutagenesis of important structural domains of these proteins elucidated a unique molecular mechanism of how these CIA proteins assist the Fe-S maturation process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Yae1 and Lto1 interact with the CIA targeting complex, in particular if Fe-S protein biogenesis is impaired</title><p>To systematically investigate the interaction network of the CIA proteins and to identify new interaction partners of the CIA machinery, we performed tandem affinity purifications (TAPs) in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rigaut et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Puig et al., 2001</xref>) using the known CIA factors with a C-terminal TAP-tag as bait. Co-purified proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The procedure yielded numerous interactions between the various CIA components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). For instance, complex formation between Tah18 and Dre2 as well as between Cfd1 and Nbp35 were detected. Moreover, tight interactions were observed within the CIA targeting complex (Cia1-Cia2-Mms19). In keeping with functional observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hausmann et al., 2005</xref>), Nar1 was found to undergo interactions with both the early- and late-acting CIA components. Overall, this interaction pattern fully confirms previous findings on the CIA interactome, thus verifying our experimental strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Netz et al., 2014</xref>). Three additional protein interactions caught our attention. First, all three components of the CIA targeting complex showed an interaction with the Fe-S protein Rli1, a known target of the CIA machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stehling et al., 2012</xref>). Second, by using several interaction analysis criteria these CIA factors were also found to associate with the essential proteins Yae1 and Lto1. Previous work had provided evidence that Yae1 and Lto1 interact with each other and form a complex with the essential ribosome-associated Fe-S protein Rli1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krogan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhai et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To verify the CIA protein interactions with Yae1 and Lto1, we expressed Myc- and HA-tagged versions of Yae1 and Lto1 in wild-type (WT) yeast for affinity purifications. Isolated proteins and their associated partners were analyzed by immunostaining. In addition to the tight interaction between Yae1 and Lto1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 1 and 2), complex formation of these two proteins with any of the CIA targeting complex partners was observed when Lto1 and Yae1 were co-expressed. Affinity purification of the Yae1-Lto1 complex with the late-acting CIA proteins was significantly enhanced, when the analysis was performed in cells depleted of the early-acting CIA factor Nbp35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 6–9). This indicated that the interactions of Yae1-Lto1 with CIA components are strengthened, when cytosolic Fe-S protein maturation is impaired. Nevertheless, the efficiency of Yae1-Lto1-Rli1 complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhai et al., 2014</xref>) was not enhanced by Nbp35 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), demonstrating that inactivation of the CIA activity affects the association of Yae1-Lto1 with the CIA targeting complex more efficiently than with Rli1. These findings verify our systematic interaction analyses and raise the question whether Yae1 and Lto1 are Fe-S protein targets or perform a function in cytosolic-nuclear Fe-S protein biogenesis.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08231.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Yae1 and Lto1 interact with the cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly (CIA) targeting complex and the Fe-S protein Rli1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type (WT) and Gal-NBP35 yeast cells were co-transformed with 2µ vectors containing either no insert or genes encoding HA-Yae1, HA-Lto1, Yae1-Myc and Lto1-Myc as indicated.

While depletion of Nbp35 strongly diminished the Leu1 activity, depletion of Yae1 or Lto1 had hardly any effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Likewise, Yae1 and Lto1 were not required for sulfite reductase activity as estimated by an in vivo color assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Further, we analyzed Fe-S cluster assembly on the early-acting CIA proteins Nbp35 and Nar1 in order to explore whether Yae1 or Lto1 deficiency affects the function of the CIA system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). As estimated by <sup>55</sup>Fe radiolabeling, neither Yae1 nor Lto1 were involved in the maturation of these two Fe-S cluster-containing CIA components. In contrast, depletion of the mitochondrial ISC component Yah1 strongly diminished Fe-S cluster assembly on Nbp35 and Nar1. These findings indicate that Yae1-Lto1 operate downstream of these CIA factors in Rli1 Fe-S cluster association. Finally, activities of the non-Fe-S protein alcohol dehydrogenase and the mitochondrial Fe-S protein aconitase were unchanged upon depletion of both Yae1 and Lto1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these results, combined with the tight association of Yae1 and Lto1 to the CIA targeting complex, suggest that both proteins are specific for Fe-S cluster formation on Rli1, and thus act late in the CIA pathway.

Interestingly, assembly of Rli1 was previously shown to be sensitive to oxidative stress-inducing agents such as paraquat, which may destroy the ROS-labile Fe-S cofactors of Rli1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alhebshi et al., 2012</xref>). Further, Yae1 and Lto1 were found to be essential under aerobic but not under anaerobic growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Snoek and Steensma, 2006</xref>). These findings may indicate a function of these proteins in oxidative stress protection of the Rli1 Fe-S clusters.</p><p>To discriminate between a maturation or stabilization function of Yae1 or Lto1 for Rli1's Fe-S clusters, we established a method which allowed us to rapidly degrade Yae1 or Lto1 and then follow the fate of Rli1's <sup>55</sup>Fe-S clusters. Targeted degradation of Yae1 and Lto1 was achieved by fusing a photosensitive degron (psd) to their C-termini. This degron is composed of the light-reactive LOV2 domain of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> phot1 and the murine ornithine decarboxylase-like degradation sequence cODC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Renicke et al., 2013</xref>). Exposure to blue light triggers proteasomal degradation of the psd-fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Induced degradation of Yae1-psd and Lto1-psd was maximal after 2 hr of blue light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The extent of Yae1 and Lto1 depletion affected the growth rate of the mutant cells only weakly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To further increase the depletion efficiency, cells were treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide during light exposure to fully inhibit synthesis of Yae1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Renicke et al., 2013</xref>). This trick further decreased the amount of Yae1 (compare immunoblots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then investigated the effect of light-induced Yae1 or Lto1 depletion on the de novo assembly of Rli1's Fe-S clusters by employing our <sup>55</sup>Fe radiolabeling procedure. Light-induced depletion of Yae1 caused a strong reduction of <sup>55</sup>Fe-S cluster insertion into Rli1 in comparison to the non-exposed sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, the amount of <sup>55</sup>Fe associated with Leu1 was unchanged upon exposure to blue light. The latter result showed that cycloheximide had no general negative effect on <sup>55</sup>Fe-S cluster insertion into apoproteins. The Lto1-psd mutant strain could not be used in this approach because Rli1 incorporated only little <sup>55</sup>Fe suggesting that the C-terminal psd module interfered with normal function of Lto1. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the light-induced degradation of Yae1 leads to a similar diminution of Fe-S clusters on Rli1 as that observed for Gal-YAE1 cells (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08231.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Yae1 is a Fe-S cluster maturation rather than stabilization factor for Rli1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the light-induced rapid degradation of the Yae1-3Myc-AtLOV2-cODC1 fusion protein (psd; photosensitive degron).

A clue how to explain the non-essentiality of Yae1-Lto1 in the absence of oxygen came from the inspection of Rli1 mutant proteins in which cysteine residues 25 and 61 were exchanged either alone or simultaneously to serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kispal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhai et al., 2014</xref>).

Under aerobic conditions, and even more so in the presence of oxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alhebshi et al., 2012</xref>), the Rli1 cluster binding stability is too low to sustain growth. The observed higher stability of the Rli1 Fe-S clusters in the absence of oxygen may readily explain the non-essentiality of Yae1 and Lto1, also indicating that their requirement in Fe-S cluster insertion into Rli1 can be bypassed to some extent under anaerobic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Lto1 interacts with Yae1 via its unique deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motif and with the CIA targeting complex via its C-terminal tryptophan residue</title><p>We next investigated the functional importance of characteristic structural features of Yae1 and Lto1.

Their function is unique, because, unlike the previously identified CIA proteins, these components do not act as general Fe-S maturation factors. Rather, they function downstream of the known CIA proteins by specifically assembling the essential Fe-S protein Rli1. Our findings allowed us to expand the current model of CIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paul and Lill, 2014</xref>). Yae1 and Lto1 form a complex that acts as a dedicated adaptor to recruit Rli1 to the late-acting part of the CIA machinery. This model was derived from the interaction of Yae1-Lto1 with both the CIA targeting complex (Cia1-Cia2-Mms19) and the Rli1 client. The high target specificity of Yae1-Lto1 is further documented by the fact that the complex is also dispensable for the maturation of Fe-S cluster-containing CIA proteins such as Nbp35 and Nar1. Yae1 and Lto1 perform non-overlapping, individual functions, since even upon overexpression they cannot mutually complement each other, despite some relationship in amino acid sequence (see below). Nevertheless, their function is conserved in higher eukaryotes as the human proteins YAE1D1 and ORAOV1 can substitute their yeast counterparts, but only when co-expressed, again documenting the function as a complex. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the Yae1-Lto1 complex acts as a conserved specificity factor for Fe-S cluster maturation of the highly conserved eukaryotic protein Rli1 (human ABCE1).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08231.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Working model for the specific function of the CIA proteins Yae1 and Lto1 in the maturation of the cytosolic Fe-S protein Rli1.</title><p>Maturation of cytosolic and nuclear Fe-S proteins is a multi-step process conducted by different CIA protein subcomplexes. First, a [4Fe-4S] cluster is assembled on the scaffold protein complex composed of Cfd1-Nbp35. This reaction depends on a yet unknown sulfur-containing compound (X-S) which is produced by the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery and is exported by the mitochondrial ABC transporter Atm1 to the cytosol. Further, the electron transfer chain NADPH-Tah18-Dre2 is required. The Grx3-Grx4 complex mediates a yet undefined function, possibly in delivering iron, for cytosolic-nuclear Fe-S protein biogenesis. Second, the newly assembled [4Fe-4S] cluster is released from Cfd1-Nbp35 and inserted into target apoproteins via Nar1 and the CIA targeting complex (Cia1-Cia2-Mms19). The precise mechanism of the latter steps in still unclear. As reported in this study, maturation of the essential Fe-S protein Rli1 additionally depends on the function of the two specific adaptor proteins Yae1 and Lto1. The Yae1-Lto1 complex uses a unique binding cascade to recruit Rli1 to the CIA targeting complex for Fe-S cluster insertion. The CIA targeting complex interacts with the conserved C-terminal tryptophan residue (W) of Lto1; the conserved deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motifs (yellow boxes) of Yae1-Lto1 are crucial for their complex formation; and Yae1 associates with Rli1. Such an adaptor function is dispensable in the maturation pathway of the virus-induced Fe-S protein viperin because it directly binds to the CIA targeting complex via its conserved C-terminal tryptophan residue.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08231.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08231.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08231-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>The amino acid sequences of Yae1 and Lto1 do not contain any characteristic similarities to other eukaryotic proteins, yet both proteins share the short deca-GX<sub>3</sub> sequence motif that is unique for these proteins in eukaryotes. A similar, but shorter ‘GX<sub>3</sub>G’ motif has been recognized in a number of membrane proteins, where the GX<sub>3</sub>G motif forms trans-membrane helix dimerization by inter-helical hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Senes et al., 2004</xref>). The function of the deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motif has not been explored until now, but we speculate that it serves a role in Yae1-Lto1 heterodimer formation as in membrane proteins. The deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motif is also found in bacterial FliH, a protein involved in the assembly and substrate export of flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2014</xref>). FliH forms a dimer and transiently binds to the ATPase FliI. Bacterial FliI is similar in structure to the αβ-subunits of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> ATPase and hence not related to the ABC-type ATPase Rli1, leaving open any functional relevance of the deca-GX<sub>3</sub> protein—ATPase interaction. Our Lto1 mutational studies demonstrated that the deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motif is functionally important for Yae1-Lto1 complex formation, and consequently for complex interaction with the CIA machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Exchanges of conserved glycine residues of Lto1, for instance in the middle and C-terminal parts of the deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motif, strongly affected its association with both Yae1 and the CIA targeting complex, thus explaining the strongly impaired efficiency of these Lto1 variants to support Fe-S cluster assembly on Rli1. In contrast, mutation of two N-terminal glycine residues caused only moderate effects on complex formation and Rli1 maturation suggesting some residual function of this disrupted deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motif.</p><p>A strikingly different result was obtained for mutation of the conserved C-terminal tryptophan residue of Lto1. Exchange to alanine had no detectable effect on complex formation with Yae1, yet the association of the Yae1-Lto1 complex with the CIA targeting complex was severely disrupted. The decreased Fe-S cluster assembly of Rli1 observed for this Lto1 W → A mutation is therefore best explained by the weakened contact of Lto1 to the CIA machinery thus limiting the recruitment of the Rli1 client (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In summary, our mutational studies strongly suggest a model for Yae1-Lto1 acting as a dedicated adaptor complex mediating the contacts between the CIA targeting complex and Rli1. The CIA targeting complex binds Lto1 via its C-terminal W, the two deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motifs are crucial for Yae1-Lto1 complex formation, and, as shown earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhai et al., 2014</xref>), Yae1 mediates the contact to Rli1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This chain of binding events facilitates efficient Rli1 maturation. Interestingly, a characteristically different but related maturation strategy is followed by the radical SAM Fe-S protein viperin, an interferon-induced antiviral defense component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Upadhyay et al., 2014</xref>). This protein uses its conserved C-terminal tryptophan to directly associate with the CIA targeting complex. Removal of this residue abolishes complex formation with the CIA targeting complex, assembly of viperin's Fe-S cluster, and consequently antiviral function. The presence of a tryptophan at the viperin C-terminus thus renders an adaptor function like that of Yae1-Lto1 dispensable.</p><p>Lto1 has recently been characterized as a protein involved in the biogenesis of the large ribosomal subunit and in the initiation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhai et al., 2014</xref>). Based on our current results this suggested role of Lto1 in protein synthesis seems to be indirect, and rather is mediated via its (primary) function in Rli1 maturation. As noted above, this Fe-S protein performs key functions in ribosomal subunit biogenesis as well as translation initiation, termination, and recycling. For all these functions, its two Fe-S clusters are essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kispal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khoshnevis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barthelme et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becker et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with the (indirect) roles of Lto1 and also Yae1 in ribosomal protein translation, we found protein synthesis defects in cells deficient in these proteins, similar to what we previously described for a deficiency in Rli1 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kispal et al., 2005</xref>] and this study).</p><p>The Fe-S clusters of Rli1 were reported to be particularly sensitive to added oxidants suggesting that the clusters may need stabilization, in particular under oxidative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alhebshi et al., 2012</xref>). We designed an experimental approach that allowed us to test the potential stabilizing function of Yae1-Lto1 for the Rli1 Fe-S clusters. This involved the combination of blue light-induced rapid degradation of Yae1 and the estimation of the Fe-S cluster stability of radiolabeled Rli1. Depletion of Yae1 by blue light exposure diminished de novo Fe-S cluster assembly of Rli1, yet did not affect the stability of the clusters, clearly documenting that Yae1 (and presumably Lto1) function as maturation rather than stabilization factors for Rli1. This maturation function is particularly needed under oxidative conditions to generate enough functional Rli1 to support normal growth. In contrast, under anaerobic conditions both <italic>YAE1</italic> and <italic>LTO1</italic> are dispensable for normal growth ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Snoek and Steensma, 2006</xref>]; this work), indicating that their function can be bypassed to some extent in the absence of oxidative stress. Nevertheless, as documented by our radiolabeling assay these proteins are still beneficial for Rli1 maturation under anaerobic conditions. The decreased need to (re-)generate damaged Fe-S clusters of Rli1 may render them dispensable. These findings are fully consistent with a recent study concluding that the oxygen sensitivity of Rli1 is best explained by affecting Fe-S cluster synthesis and/or transfer steps rather than the Rli1 Fe-S cluster stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alhebshi et al., 2012</xref>). This view nicely fits to the observation that <italic>RLI1</italic> functions as a high copy suppressor of <italic>LTO1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhai et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, the sum of these studies suggest that Yae1-Lto1 largely increase the efficiency of Rli1 maturation, in particular under aerobic conditions, yet in the absence of oxygen these factors can be bypassed to some extent without losing cell viability.</p><p>The sensitivity of Fe-S protein biogenesis pathways towards oxygen and/or oxidative stress has also been noted for members of the bacterial ISC assembly system. For instance, <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> IscA was required for the maturation of [4Fe-4S] proteins only under high oxygen concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>), and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> IscA-SufA paralogs are needed for Fe-S protein assembly especially under aerobic growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tan et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, <italic>E. coli</italic> ErpA is essential for Fe-S cluster maturation of isoprenoid biosynthesis enzymes under aerobic conditions, but can be replaced by IscA under anaerobiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vinella et al., 2009</xref>). As a second example, the bacterial NfuA protein functions as a Fe-S cluster transfer protein that is essential for maturation of dedicated Fe-S proteins such as aconitase particularly in the presence of oxygen or oxidative stress conditions, yet can be bypassed under low oxygen conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Py et al., 2012</xref>). In comparison and on the contrary, the mitochondrial ISC assembly pathway is crucial under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Deletion of <italic>S. cerevisiae GRX5</italic> encoding the mitochondrial monothiol glutaredoxin largely impairs growth rates on minimal medium even under anaerobiosis, and functional inactivation of the Isa1-Isa2 proteins involved in [4Fe-4S] protein biogenesis does not allow cell growth and mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] protein maturation in the presence or absence of oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodriguez-Manzaneque et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muhlenhoff et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The characterization of Yae1-Lto1 as a dedicated adaptor complex of the CIA machinery for recruitment of specific Fe-S proteins such as Rli1 may be a paradigm for other Fe-S clients and may suggest the existence of additional devoted CIA maturation factors. In mitochondria, several specific ISC assembly factors have been described including the P-loop NTPase IND1 involved in complex I maturation, NFU1 and BOLA3 required for assembly of complex Fe-S proteins such as respiratory complexes I and II and lipoic acid synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stehling and Lill, 2013</xref>). Their molecular mode of action in the assembly process is still unclear, but an adaptor role similar to Yae1-Lto1 can now be tested. Future elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of these specificity factors will clarify whether they follow common or distinct strategies for Fe-S cluster insertion. Solving their 3D structure will certainly be helpful for understanding how these proteins perform their adaptor role between the late parts of the ISC or CIA machineries and their dedicated Fe-S clients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain W303-1A was used as WT strain.

This algorithm assigns a confidence score to the probability of observing a true interaction using Poisson distributions. In order to assess the dependency of the observed interactions to changes in the SAINT parameters, we applied the SAINT algorithm by using a range of different parameters, for example, the average confidence score threshold (0.8–0.95 in steps of 0.01, range taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al. (2011)</xref>), Mascot scores (10–50 in steps of 10), with or without taking extremely high counts into account, and with or without normalization for spectral counts. In total, we had 320 parameter combinations. By varying these parameters we then counted the number of times that we observed an interaction against the number of variations, thus giving a fraction between 0 and 1 for each bait-prey pair. We only considered interactions that have been assigned an average SAINT score above 0.8 in at least one of the parameter sets. We then built a network with interactions of high (≥0.5) and low (&lt;0.5) robustness, that is, resistance or sensitivity to variations in SAINT parameters. To support our findings and to expand our network of observed bait-prey interactions, we integrated data from the STRING database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Szklarczyk et al., 2011</xref>). For interactions observed in our screen, we kept all experimental STRING data without a confidence score threshold. For additional STRING interactions, we only considered experimentally observed interactions with the highest predefined STRING confidence score (0.9).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Protein–protein interaction in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></title><p>For (co-) IP cells were cultivated for 40 hr in glucose-containing minimal medium and 0.5 g cells were resuspended in 0.55 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5% [vol/vol] glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2% [vol/vol] NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF) with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche).

This is in contrast to the findings for the Gal-YAE1 strain, and the fact that both genes are essential for cell viability. Upon examination of the reason for the lack of a growth defect, we suspected that the Gal-LTO1<sup>long</sup> strain did not allow a critical reduction of the Lto1 protein. A combination of bioinformatic, cell biological and biochemical analyses provided clear information that the reason for this observation was an erroneous translation start site for <italic>LTO1</italic>. As summarized in detail below the correct physiological start site of the <italic>LTO1</italic> gene is located 108 bp downstream of the annotated start codon (ATG3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>The first hint for an annotation error of the <italic>LTO1</italic> gene was provided by a multi-sequence alignment of Lto1 homologs. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Lto1 contained an unusual N-terminal extension of 36 amino acid residues (highlighted in cyan in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) that was not present in any other Lto1 homolog. Inspection of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Lto1 protein sequence suggested another putative translation start site for Lto1 (residue Met37 corresponding to codon ATG3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>) which roughly matches the N-termini of the other Lto1 homologs. Ribosome foot-printing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>) supported that the actively translated region of the <italic>LTO1</italic> mRNA does not encompass the N-terminal extension of 36 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). To directly test the importance of the N-terminal 36 residues, we created a <italic>LTO1</italic> mutant in which the <italic>GALL</italic> promoter was inserted right in front of ATG3. This mutant strain (termed Gal-LTO1) showed normal growth on galactose-containing medium demonstrating that the N-terminal 36 residue extension of Lto1 is not critical for cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Conspicuously, the Gal-LTO1 cells were unable to grow on glucose-containing medium suggesting efficient depletion of Lto1, unlike that seen for Gal-LTO1<sup>long</sup> cells.</p><p>To investigate the role of the N-terminal Lto1 segment, we exchanged the coding information for methionine 1 (ATG1) and an additional methionine (residue 10, ATG2) within the 36 residue segment for a stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These proteins and the non-mutated Lto1 were expressed from a centromeric plasmid under control of the endogenous promoter in Gal-LTO1 cells grown with galactose or glucose. Both <italic>LTO1</italic> mutations did not affect cell growth. This result clearly documented that the N-terminal segment of Lto1 including its previously proposed start methionine is not essential suggesting that ATG3 rather than ATG1 is the physiologically correct translation start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). To further support this conclusion, we analyzed the importance of the DNA region between codon ATG1 and ATG3 for <italic>LTO1</italic> expression efficiency. To this end, we fused different DNA segments of the <italic>LTO1</italic> gene in front of the luciferase reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The fusion constructs were transformed in WT yeast cells and the luciferase-based luminescence was recorded as a measure of <italic>LTO1</italic> promoter efficiency. Any truncation within the ATG1-ATG3 segment strongly impaired the transcriptional activity suggesting that this region has gene regulatory rather than coding function. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the physiological start site of <italic>LTO1</italic> is located 108 bp downstream of the previously annotated start codon.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Miscellaneous methods</title><p>The following published methods were used: manipulation of DNA and PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sambrook and Russell, 2001</xref>), transformation of yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gietz and Woods, 2002</xref>), immunostaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harlow and Lane, 1998</xref>), in vivo labeling of yeast cells with <sup>55</sup>FeCl<sub>3</sub> and measurement of <sup>55</sup>Fe incorporation into Fe-S proteins by IP and scintillation counting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pierik et al., 2009</xref>), pulse labeling of yeast cells with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kispal et al., 2005</xref>), TAP tag affinity purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Puig et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gavin et al., 2002</xref>), determination of promoter strength using luciferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Molik et al., 2007</xref>), light-induced degradation of psd-fused target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Renicke et al., 2013</xref>) and enzyme activity measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Molik et al., 2007</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Dennis R Dean, served as a guest Reviewing editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Iron-sulfur clusters are simple inorganic structures that are essential prosthetic groups contained in a variety of proteins. The maturation of proteins that contain Fe-S clusters is complicated, probably because free forms of both iron and sulfur are toxic, and Fe-S clusters contained in many proteins are highly sensitive to oxygen. Fundamental aspects of Fe-S protein maturation involve the separate formation of Fe-S clusters on an assembly scaffold and the subsequent delivery of clusters to a variety of “client” proteins. The manuscript by Paul et al. describes the functional analysis of two cytosolic iron sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) factors, Lto1 and Yae1 that are involved in the specialized delivery of Fe-S clusters to a specific client. Namely, these proteins are shown to be dedicated specificity factors for assembly of the Fe-S clusters contained in Rli1, a protein essential for ribosome function in yeast. The authors provide evidence that depletion of either Lto1 or Yae1 causes a specific loss in maturation of Rli1 but not in maturation of other cytosolic or nuclear Fe-S proteins. It is shown that Lto1/Yae1 form a complex that interacts with the CIA targeting complex. It is also demonstrated that Lto1/Yae1 are involved in cluster delivery for maturation of Rli1, rather than stability of the nascent clusters post maturation. The unique (for eukaryotes) deca-GX3 motif in both Lto1 and Yae1 is shown to facilitate their interaction while a conserved tryptophan in Yae1 is needed for recruitment of the target Rli1. Evolutionary conservation of the function of Yae1 and Lto1 is shown via the demonstration that their function in yeast can be replaced by the human orthologues YAED1 and ORAOV1. It is not yet fully understood why there is a dedicated system for the terminal stage in Rli1 maturation, but this could be related to a particular oxygen sensitivity of its associated clusters.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the case of certain bacteria, at least, loss of [Fe-S] cluster transfer proteins (for example, NfuA and IscA) exhibit an inability to grow under conditions of excess oxygen but have no growth phenotype when grown under low oxygen tension. This aspect should be discussed.</p><p>2) Some of the Discussion is not necessary as various aspects that are presented in the Discussion recapitulates what has already been presented in experimental rationale and interpretation of the key findings has already been clearly articulated in the Results section. A somewhat abbreviated Discussion that only presents the main conclusion, or perhaps, better, the implications of the work would be sufficient.</p><p>3) The investigators make use of a C25S Rli1 mutant to address the oxygen-dependency of Rli1. This experiment was reported by Zhai et al., in 2013 and should be cited.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) In the fourth paragraph of the Introduction the authors refer to Yae1 and Lto1 as “new” binding partners. They might be newly discovered but they are by no means new.</p><p>2) The authors consistently refer to “mutant” proteins when they are actually characterizing proteins that have amino acid substitutions, not mutations.</p><p>3) The role of Yae1 and Lto1 in iron-sulfur maturation of Rli1 is shown to be partially by-passed in anaerobic cells. The efficiency of the GAL shutdown in the anaerobic cells is not shown, so it is not clear whether a bypass exists or Rli1 maturation occurs via residual Yae1 and Lto1. Is glucose repression of YAE1 and LTO1 blunted in anaerobic cells?</p><p>4) In the Yae1-psd study shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref> panel B, the experimental details are not easy to understand. Clearly, the depletion of Yae1 impairs 55Fe incorporation into Rli1, but this does not correlate with growth impairment. Obviously, growth impairment will only occur with turnover of holo-Rli1 in the Yae1 attenuated cells.</p><p>Enhanced binding of Lto1 and Yae1 with CIA components is shown with depletion of Nbp35. Does depletion of Cia1 or Cia2 result in enhanced binding of Lto1/Yae1 with Rli1?</p><p>5) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Yae1 and Lto1 specifically mature the Fe-S protein Rli1”: For the less informed reader it would be helpful to say “canonical nuclear Fe-S target proteins...”</p><p>6) In the last paragraph of the subsection “Why are YAE1 and LTO1 non-essential under anaerobic conditions?”. The Cys to Ser mutations in Rli1 and the impact of these mutants in relation to oxygen level is interesting. The authors comment that loss of one ligand in other Fe-S proteins still can allow cluster assembly, true but rather speculative here it seems.</p><p>7) In the last sentence of the subsection “Why are YAE1 and LTO1 non-essential under anaerobic conditions?” Perhaps it is better to say the requirement for Yae1 and Lto1 may be lower in anaerobic environments – not the function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08231.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) In the case of certain bacteria, at least, loss of [Fe-S] cluster transfer proteins (for example, NfuA and IscA) exhibit an inability to grow under conditions of excess oxygen but have no growth phenotype when grown under low oxygen tension.

We have added a paragraph to Discussion in which we compare the oxygen sensitivity of Yae1-Lto1-depleted cells with previous findings for the growth and functional behavior of various bacteria deficient in NfuA or A-type ISC proteins in the presence and absence of oxygen. We then compare these results with those for depletion of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Isa1/2 and Grx5 proteins since in these cases no such behavior was described.

This paper drew a misleading conclusion from the analysis of just this one Rli1 mutant protein, namely that the Rli1 Fe-S clusters are no longer essential under anaerobic conditions. We wanted to avoid this criticism of the (otherwise very nice) Zhai paper. We now have cited this paper again as suggested.</p><p><italic>Minor points</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) In the fourth paragraph of the Introduction the authors refer to Yae1 and Lto1 as “new” binding partners.

We are afraid that the use of other terms such as “altered protein” or “protein carrying amino acid substitutions” might be more confusing to readers than the term “mutant protein” which is generally used by many other authors. We are certainly open to suggestions for better diction.</p><p><italic>3) The role of Yae1 and Lto1 in iron-sulfur maturation of Rli1 is shown to be partially by-passed in anaerobic cells. The efficiency of the GAL shutdown in the anaerobic cells is not shown, so it is not clear whether a bypass exists or Rli1 maturation occurs via residual Yae1 and Lto1. Is glucose repression of YAE1 and LTO1 blunted in anaerobic cells?</italic></p><p>The GAL promoter shutdown under anaerobic conditions is effective as shown by immunoblotting (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>), and, on the functional side, by the substantial decrease of <sup>55</sup>Fe bound to Rli1 in Yae1- and Lto1- (or Nbp35)-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The analysis of this aspect by immunoblotting was restricted to the detection of Yae1 because we did not succeed in creating an efficient Lto1 antibody. This may be due to the relatively low abundance of both Yae1 and Lto1 in yeast cells (cf. Ghaemmaghami et al. (2003) Nature 425, 737). As published previously (by systematic yeast strain analyses described in Steensma 2006, and reproduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhai et al. 2014</xref>), the <italic>YAE1</italic> and <italic>LTO1</italic> genes can be deleted without the loss of cell viability under anaerobic conditions. This finding is mimicked by using the GAL promoter strains, and clearly indicates that a low efficiency bypass of the newly identified adapter function of Yae1-Lto1 must exist (even under gene deletion situations), yet only under anaerobic conditions where the maturation process is not negatively influenced by oxygen toxicity.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08231.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Yae1 depletion is efficient under anaerobic conditions.

Clearly, the depletion of Yae1 impairs 55Fe incorporation into Rli1, but this does not correlate with growth impairment. Obviously, growth impairment will only occur with turnover of holo-Rli1 in the Yae1 attenuated cells</italic>.</p><p>We know that the light-induced diminution of Yae1 (and Lto1) is less efficient than the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter-mediated protein depletion. The resulting slightly higher residual amount of protein still allows some growth of depleted cells (as opposed to the <italic>GAL</italic> situation). We therefore have added cycloheximide to block the re-synthesis of Yae1 during the light exposure period. This trick (introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Renicke et al., 2013</xref>) enhanced the defects of protein depletion (compare immunoblots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> with ) and <sup>55</sup>Fe association with Rli1. This issue is now better mentioned in revised text. In the growth plates, such a trick cannot be used, of course. We have tried to improve our text to make this complex issue clear.</p><p><italic>Enhanced binding of Lto1 and Yae1 with CIA components is shown with depletion of Nbp35</italic>. <italic>Does depletion of Cia1 or Cia2 result in enhanced binding of Lto1/Yae1 with Rli1?</italic></p><p>The use of Nbp35 in this experiment was intentional. When we deplete CIA proteins in general, we observe that the amount of immediate partner(s) of the depleted CIA protein is also decreased. This is very much the case for the components of the CIA targeting complex, i.e. Cia1, Cia2, and Mms19 which act as a platform for Fe-S cluster insertion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref>). Since the entire late-acting CIA targeting complex is falling apart when one constituent is absent, we expected that this instability may render the interpretation of such experiments difficult or impossible. Nevertheless, we now have performed the suggested Cia1-depletion experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 3</xref>). The outcome of the experiment (to our surprise) confirmed the results of the Nbp35 depletion. However, the amount of Rli1 co-precipitating with Yae1 and Lto1 was reduced, and the interaction analysis was much less specific. This likely is the consequence of the dissociation of the CIA targeting complex as discussed above.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08231.021</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>Depletion of individual CIA targeting complex components affects the levels of its other members.

Cell lysates were prepared, and a HA-tag immunoprecipitation (IP) performed. The immunoprecipitate was analyzed for the indicated proteins or tags by immunoblotting. The lower band in HA-Lto1-containing lanes is a HA-Lto1 degradation product.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08231.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08231.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08231-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Based on all this new information, we have performed the requested analysis of the interaction between Yae1-Lto1 and Rli1 under Nbp35 depletion conditions. We have added this immunoprecipitation experiment as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. On the one hand, the results confirm co-immunoprecipitation of Yae1-Lto1 with Rli1 as shown earlier by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhai et al., 2014</xref> for wild-type cells. On the other hand and a new finding, the efficiency of Yae1- Lto1-Rli1 complex formation is not changed by Nbp35 depletion indicating that inactivation of the Fe/S cluster synthesis activity affects CIA targeting complex formation with Yae1-Lto1 more efficiently than Yae1-Lto1 adapter interaction with Rli1.</p><p><italic>5) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Yae1 and Lto1 specifically mature the Fe-S protein Rli1”</italic>: <italic>For the less informed reader it would be helpful to say “canonical nuclear Fe-S target proteins...”</italic></p><p>We have added the term “nuclear” as suggested.</p><p><italic>6) In the last paragraph of the subsection “Why are YAE1 and LTO1 non-essential under anaerobic conditions?”. The Cys to Ser mutations in Rli1 and the impact of these mutants in relation to oxygen level is interesting. The authors comment that loss of one ligand in other Fe-S proteins still can allow cluster assembly, true but rather speculative here it seems</italic>.</p><p>We had already supported this statement by two references from our own work. We now have added another reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Urzica et al. 2009</xref>) to make clear that such a behavior is not rare.</p><p><italic>7) In the last sentence of the subsection “Why are YAE1 and LTO1 non-essential under anaerobic conditions?” Perhaps it is better to say the requirement for Yae1 and Lto1 may be lower in anaerobic environments – not the function</italic>.</p><p>We have replaced the term “function” with “requirement” as suggested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
