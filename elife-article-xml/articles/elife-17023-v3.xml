contrast to the situation in most animals, plant stem cells remain quiescent until the postembryonic phase of development. Here, we dissect how light and metabolic signals are integrated to overcome stem cell dormancy at the shoot apical meristem. We show on the one hand that light is able to activate expression of the stem cell inducer <italic>WUSCHEL</italic> independently of photosynthesis and that this likely involves inter-regional cytokinin signaling. Metabolic signals, on the other hand, are transduced to the meristem through activation of the TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) kinase. Surprisingly, TOR is also required for light signal dependent stem cell activation. Thus, the TOR kinase acts as a central integrator of light and metabolic signals and a key regulator of stem cell activation at the shoot apex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17023.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17023.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17023.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants are able to grow and develop throughout their lives thanks to groups of stem cells at the tips of their shoots and roots, which can constantly divide to produce new cells. Energy captured from sunlight during a process called photosynthesis is the main source of energy for most plants. Therefore, the amount and quality of light in the environment has a big influence on how plants grow and develop. An enzyme called TOR kinase can sense energy levels in animal cells and regulate many processes including growth and cell division. Plants also have a TOR kinase, but it is less clear if it plays the same role in plants, and whether it can respond to light.</p><p>Plant stem cells only start to divide after the seed germinates. In shoots, a protein called WUSCHEL is required to maintain stem cells in an active state. Here, Pfeiffer et al. studied how shoot stem cells are activated in response to environmental signals in a plant known as <italic>Arabidopsis.</italic> The experiments show that light is able to activate the production of WUSCHEL independently of photosynthesis via a signal pathway that depends on TOR kinase. The stem cells do not directly sense light; instead other cells detect the light and relay the information to the stem cells with the help of a hormone called cytokinin.</p><p>Further experiments show that information about energy levels in cells is relayed via another signal pathway that also involves the TOR kinase. Therefore, Pfeiffer et al.’s findings suggest that the activation of TOR by light allows plant cells to anticipate how much energy will be available and efficiently tune their growth and development to cope with the environmental conditions. Future challenges are to understand how TOR kinase is regulated by light signals and how this enzyme is able to act on WUSCHEL to trigger stem cell division.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17023.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17023.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>TOR kinase</kwd><kwd>light signaling</kwd><kwd>WUSCHEL</kwd><kwd>stem cell activation</kwd><kwd>metabolic signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008316</institution-id><institution>Baden-Württemberg Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Eliteprogramme for Postdocs</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfeiffer</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CellNetworks Cluster of Excellence</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfeiffer</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HE 1848/15-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wirtz</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><name><surname>Hell</surname><given-names>Rüdiger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WI 3560/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wirtz</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><name><surname>Hell</surname><given-names>Rüdiger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wirtz</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><name><surname>Hell</surname><given-names>Rüdiger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starting Grant 282139, StemCellAdapt</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lohmann</surname><given-names>Jan U</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lohmann</surname><given-names>Jan U</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TOR kinase guides the transition of plant stem cells from the dormant embryonic state to the active adult state by integrating light and metabolic signals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Light is the sole energy source of plants and therefore one of the most important environmental factors influencing their development and physiology. Consequently, several of the core developmental decisions during the lifecycle of a plant from germination to seedling development and flowering are strongly influenced by light conditions. After germination, higher plants undergo two distinct developmental programs depending on the availability of light, termed skotomorphogenesis and photomorphogenesis. Skotomorphogenesis, the dark adaptation program, is characterized by an etiolated phenotype, including an elongated hypocotyl, closed cotyledons, the formation of an apical hook and etioplast development. Importantly, stem cells at the shoot and root tip remain dormant and thus growth in etiolated seedlings is mainly dependent on cell elongation rather than cell division. In contrast, photomorphogenesis, the developmental program triggered in light, leads to seedlings with short hypocotyls, unfolded cotyledons and development of chloroplasts. In the light, shoot and root meristems are activated, leading to root growth and development of the first leaves by cell division and expansion (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nemhauser and Chory 2002</xref>).</p><p>Based on evolutionary evidence, photomorphogenesis is the default pathway, since gymnosperms for example do not follow a strict skotomorphogenic development in darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wei, 1994</xref>). With the advance of land plants and resulting new environmental challenges, such as growth in dense canopy and germination in soil, the evolution of the dark-adapted skotomorphogenesis program ensued an advantage: It allowed plants to allocate the limited energy sources supplied by the seed to maximally grow by elongation, in order to reach favorable light conditions that will provide energy for further growth and development. To faithfully execute these opposing developmental programs, plants have evolved complex mechanisms to perceive light quality and quantity through a whole range of photoreceptors that are mainly absorbing in the blue, red and far-red range of the spectrum. Activation of the blue absorbing CRYPTOCHROMES (crys) and/or the red and far-red absorbing PHYTOCHROMES (phys) overrides the skotomorphogenic program and plants undergo photomorphogenesis within minutes after perception of a light stimulus (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chory, 2010</xref>). On the molecular level, activated light receptors inhibit the function of the core repressor of photomorphogenesis, CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 (COP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets positive regulators of photomorphogenesis for degradation in darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yi and Deng, 2005</xref>). At the same time, a group of potent transcription factors, the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs), which promote skotomorphogenesis in darkness, are degraded upon light perception through the PHYTOCHROMES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leivar and Quail, 2010</xref>). The activities of these pathways converge on the differential regulation of thousands of genes resulting in a massive reprogramming of the transcriptome in response to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tepperman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peschke and Kretsch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfeiffer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Light not only activates photoreceptors, it also fuels photosynthesis and therefore leads to the production of a number of energy rich metabolites including sugars. Plants are able to monitor their metabolic state with several signaling systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lastdrager et al., 2014</xref>) and recent studies have focused on the evolutionary conserved TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) kinase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dobrenel et al., 2016</xref>). In other eukaryotes, TOR functions as a central integrator of nutrient, energy, and stress signaling networks and consistently, TOR regulates cell growth and proliferation, ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, cell wall integrity and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Díaz-Troya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henriques et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lastdragere et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xiong and Sheen, 2014</xref>). While other eukaryotes possess two TOR complexes, so far only a single complex has been identified in plants. It is comprised of TOR, FKBP12, LST8 and RAPTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mahfouz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moreau et al., 2012</xref>) and thus resembles the mammalian TOR complex 1 (mTORC1). AtTOR is expressed in the embryo and endosperm and in meristematic regions of the adult plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menand et al., 2002</xref>). While <italic>tor</italic> null mutants show premature arrest of embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menand et al., 2002</xref>), knock down of TOR leads to growth reduction and affects the carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caldana et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the presence of sugars in general promotes TOR kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dobrenel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). So far, the only known direct downstream targets of AtTOR kinase are S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schepetilnikov et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>), TAP46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2014</xref>) and E2 promoter binding factor a (E2Fa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). S6K1 plays an important role in reinitiating translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schepetilnikov et al., 2011</xref>) as well as in the regulation of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henriques et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shin et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, E2Fa is associated with cell cycle control through the expression of S-phase genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Polyn et al., 2015</xref>). Though little is known about how TOR is activated on a molecular level in plants, reports from the past decade suggest that TOR functions as a central regulator of protein synthesis, cell proliferation and metabolism in response to metabolic signals.</p><p>Several photomorphogenic responses, like the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, unfolding of the hypocotyl hook and cotyledons, as well as chloroplast development can be triggered by a light signal alone, as displayed in dark-grown <italic>cop1</italic> and <italic>pif1/pif3/pif4/pif5</italic> quadruple mutants (<italic>pifq)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng and Quail, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leivar et al., 2009</xref>). However, root growth is not induced in <italic>cop1</italic> mutants unless sucrose is supplied with the growth medium. Photosynthetic assimilates dominantly promote growth in the root where they can synergistically interact with photoreceptor-triggered light signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kircher and Schopfer, 2012</xref>). Recently, Xiong et al. showed that this photosynthesis-driven growth and proliferation in the root is mediated by the TOR kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we analyzed the role of light and nutrients for post-germination stem cell activation in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of young seedlings. Stem cell control in the SAM of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> is based on the activity of the homeodomain transcription factor <italic>WUSCHEL (WUS</italic>), which is expressed in the organizing centre and necessary and sufficient to non-cell- autonomously induce stem cell fate by protein movement. Stem cells in turn express CLAVATA3 (CLV3), a short secreted peptide, that acts via the CLV / CORYNE receptor system to limit the expression of WUS in the organizing center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schoof et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daum et al., 2014</xref>). The use of a reporter system based on the regulatory regions of <italic>WUS</italic> and <italic>CLV3</italic> allowed us to quantitatively trace behavior of stem cells (<italic>pCLV3:mCHERRY-NLS</italic>) as well as cells of the underlying organizing center (<italic>pWUS:3xVENUS-NLS</italic>). With the help of these tools, we were able to genetically dissect the individual contribution of light signaling and photosynthesis-driven nutrient sensing on the stem cell system of the SAM. We show that both pathways ultimately converge at the level of TOR kinase activation, revealing a role for TOR as a central regulator of stem cell activation in response to environmental cues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Organogenic development is dependent on light and energy metabolites</title><p>The SAM of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings remains dormant during skotomorphogenesis and therefore, plants are unable to advance to the organogenic stage in the absence of light. However, since light acts as signal and energy source alike, we first asked which of the two roles is dominant for SAM development. While supplementation of sugar to wild-type seedlings grown in the dark is known to be inefficient to trigger development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), activation of the light pathway alone, either physiologically by low level illumination, or genetically by introduction of the <italic>cop1</italic> mutation, was shown to induce photomorphogenic development of the hypocotyl and cotyledons in darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng and Quail, 1991</xref>). Despite this stark developmental transition, SAMs of <italic>cop1</italic> mutants were unable to produce organs when grown in the dark. However, the SAM was activated and organogenesis initiated in 100% of the dark-grown <italic>cop1</italic> mutants when supplemented with sucrose as external energy source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McNellis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakagawa and Komeda, 2004</xref>). Conversely, the SAM of light-grown wild-type seedlings remained dormant when photosynthesis was compromised by the carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor norflurazon. In line with our observation of <italic>cop1</italic> mutants, supplementing the growth medium of these plants with sucrose rescued the dormant phenotype in approximately every third seedling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, neither the availability of energy metabolites, nor light perception alone was sufficient for SAM activation. In contrast, light and energy, likely in the form of photosynthetic products, seemed to be sensed independently, and both factors need to act cooperatively to trigger SAM development.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17023.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SAM development depends on light and sugar.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Five week old plants grown on media with (+) or without (-) sucrose.

By using transcriptional reporters for stem cells (<italic>pCLV3:mCherry-NLS</italic>) and niche cells (<italic>pWUS:3xVENUS-NLS</italic>) we found that stem cell identity was actively maintained independently of growth conditions and was even observed in the dormant state mediated by germination in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, expression of the reporter for the stem cell inducing WUS transcription factor was critically dependent on environmental signals and preceded meristem activity and the initiation of organogenic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To test if our <italic>WUS</italic> reporter faithfully recapitulated the behavior of the endogenous gene, we used in situ hybridization and were able to confirm strong light dependent induction of <italic>WUS</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Since WUS protein exhibits complex movement and a short lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daum et al., 2014</xref>), we furthermore analyzed the behavior of WUS-GFP protein in vivo by recording the GFP signal in our rescue line (<italic>pWUS:WUS-linker-GFP</italic> in <italic>wus</italic> mutant background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daum et al., 2014</xref>]). Again, we observed a strong light- and sucrose-dependency of the WUS-GFP signal in line with the observed activation of the <italic>WUS</italic> promoter and accumulation of the endogenous <italic>WUS</italic> mRNA under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>) confirming that the simple <italic>pWUS:3xVenus-NLS</italic> reporter represents a faithful and quantitative readout for WUS activity. Taken together, these findings on the one hand suggested that <italic>CLV3</italic> expression is at least partially independent of WUS and on the other hand that the environmentally dependent transcriptional activation of <italic>WUS</italic> is the trigger to overcome stem cell dormancy.</p><p>Using seedlings carrying both reporters grown under wave-length specific LED illumination and image quantification we found that the <italic>WUS</italic> reporter (<italic>pWUS:3xVENUS-NLS</italic>) was below detection level in dark-grown seedlings. In contrast, GFP signals were readily detectable in light-grown plants from three days after germination onwards with the signal steadily increasing over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>WUS</italic> expression was also induced in the absence of light, when plants were grown on sucrose-supplemented medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,J</xref>) and when sucrose was supplied to light-grown seedlings, the effect of light and sucrose on <italic>WUS</italic> expression was additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Light and sucrose also had a similar effect on the regulation of <italic>CLV3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–I, K</xref>), however, since the <italic>CLV3</italic> reporter was already detectable in dark-grown seedlings, the induction of expression by light and sucrose was less pronounced and mainly due to an enlargement of the <italic>CLV3</italic> domain rather than an increase of signal intensity in individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). In sum, development of the SAM required both, light signal transduction and the availability of photosynthetic products, whereas <italic>WUS</italic> expression was induced also by each signal individually.

First, we wanted to elucidate the molecular players involved in stem cell activation by light. To this end, we irradiated seedlings with monochromatic light of low intensities (30 µmol*m<sup>−2</sup>*s<sup>−1</sup>) to analyze the effect of light signaling with minimal influence of photosynthesis-derived metabolites.

Interestingly, <italic>phyA</italic> mutants showed similar <italic>WUS</italic> promoter activity under far-red light and in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, when we supplemented the growth media with 1% sucrose we observed a clear induction of <italic>WUS</italic> expression in response to far-red light, which was dependent on a functional copy of <italic>PHYA</italic>. Still, <italic>phyA</italic> mutants displayed a basal level of <italic>WUS</italic> promoter activity already in darkness even when grown on plates containing sucrose, suggesting a complex and so far unknown regulatory role for phyA under these conditions.</p><p>The fact that plants grown in far-red light are photosynthetically inactive and required an exogenous energy source for <italic>WUS</italic> activation, while plants under blue and red light did not, raised the question whether minimal levels of photosynthetically derived sugars might contribute to <italic>WUS</italic> expression in blue and red light, despite the low fluence. Therefore, we tested whether the availability of photosynthetic products is a prerequisite for light-induced <italic>WUS</italic> expression by chemical interference. However, the inhibition of photosynthesis by either norflurazon or lincomycin, did not affect <italic>WUS</italic> promoter activity in red or in blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the presence of lincomycin, <italic>WUS</italic> expression was even slightly increased under both light conditions. To avoid potential side effects of the pharmacological treatments we also tested the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> withdrawal on seedling development and <italic>WUS</italic> expression. Preventing photosynthetic assimilation in a CO<sub>2</sub>-deficient atmosphere inhibited development of seedlings even when grown in light. This phenotype could be rescued in one third of the plants by adding 1% sucrose to the media, similar to what we observed using norflurazon treatment (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, <italic>WUS</italic> induction by red light was unaffected by CO<sub>2</sub> reduction in the atmosphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, photosynthetically derived metabolites produced in a low light environment were not required for activation of stem cells, confirming that light signaling alone was sufficient for <italic>WUS</italic> expression.</p><p>We next asked how the light signal perceived by PHYTOCHROMES and CRYPTOCHROMES is relayed to the nucleus by testing the contribution of known downstream signaling components, such as COP1 and HY5. The E3-ubiquitin ligase COP1, which targets HY5 but also other factors for degradation in darkness, showed robust inhibitory effects on <italic>WUS</italic> expression. <italic>Cop1-4</italic> mutants displayed photomorphogenic development in darkness, which was accompanied by <italic>WUS</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, the repressive function of COP1 was prominent under all conditions tested and <italic>cop1-4</italic> seedlings displayed strongly elevated <italic>WUS</italic> promoter activity compared to wild-type when grown in dark with or without sugar, and also under low light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To confirm that these effects were not caused by second site mutations present in the <italic>cop1-4</italic> background or specific to the allele tested, we used qRT-PCR to assay <italic>WUS</italic> expression in seedlings carrying other <italic>cop1</italic> loss-of-function alleles. However, since this approach lacked the spatial resolution provided by microscopic quantification of the <italic>WUS</italic> reporter, it proofed to be much less sensitive. Still, we were able to detect accumulation of endogenous <italic>WUS</italic> mRNA in response to light in 7d old wild-type seedlings, as well as in <italic>cop1-4</italic> mutants in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Importantly, all three <italic>cop1</italic> mutant alleles tested showed robust elevation of <italic>WUS</italic> mRNA levels when grown in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), demonstrating that loss of COP1 function leads to activation of WUS.</p><p>One of the main functions of COP1 is to target the transcription factor HY5, a positive master regulator of photomorphogenesis, for degradation. Thus, we analyzed the role of HY5 working under the hypothesis that in contrast to <italic>cop1</italic> mutants, which had shown elevated <italic>WUS</italic> reporter expression, <italic>hy5</italic> mutants should suffer from a much reduced meristem activity due to the absence of an important photomorphogenesis stimulating activity. However, <italic>hy5</italic> mutants were unaffected in activation of <italic>WUS</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), suggesting that SAM stem cell activation is dependent on another COP1-targeted transcriptional transducer, such as HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH), or a so far unknown regulator.</p><p>Since the SAM is shielded from the environment especially in etiolated seedlings, where it is buried between the closed cotyledons and protected by the apical hook of the hypocotyl, it seemed questionable that the meristem itself is the site of light perception. We therefore tested the competence of different tissues to perceive light signals and translate them into a stem cell activating output. To this end, we expressed a constitutive active form of phyB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Su and Lagarias, 2007</xref>) under different tissue specific promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Expression of phyB Y276H under an ubiquitous promoter (<italic>pUBI10</italic>) caused strong <italic>cop1</italic>-like phenotypes and a substantial activation of the <italic>WUS</italic> promoter in the SAM showing that transgenic activation of light signaling is sufficient to trigger stem cell activation in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G,H,J</xref>). In line with our hypothesis that light is likely perceived by cells outside the SAM, vascular specific expression of phyB Y276H by the <italic>pSUC2</italic>, or mesophyll specific expression by <italic>pCAB3</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ranjan et al., 2011</xref>) initiated constitutive photomorphogenic phenotypes and <italic>WUS</italic> expression in dark-grown seedlings. Similar results were also obtained for the epidermal <italic>pML1</italic> promoter, in lines showing high expression levels of phyB Y276H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G–J</xref>). These results suggested that the stimulus downstream of light perception can be transmitted between tissues by a mobile signal and raised the question whether the SAM itself even has the ability to respond to light. To explore this, we expressed phyB Y276H specifically in the SAM under the promoter of <italic>At3g59270</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yadav et al., 2009</xref>), but in contrast to expression outside of the SAM, we observed fully etiolated seedlings without detectable <italic>WUS</italic> expression when these plants were grown in the dark. Even when we drove <italic>PHYB Y276H</italic> expression in cells surrounding the organizing center by the promoter of <italic>At1g26680</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yadav et al., 2009</xref>), we only observed a minor reduction in hypocotyl elongation in darkness compared to wild-type and marginal <italic>WUS</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G,H,J</xref>). We therefore concluded that light is perceived by cells outside of the SAM, likely in the cotyledons or the hypocotyl and that this stimulus is transmitted to the SAM by a so far unidentified mobile signal. Amazingly, the SAM does not possess the competence to perceive and/or translate the light stimulus into stem cell activation, but rather is limited to responding to the signals that are transmitted from distant plant organs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mechanisms of hormonal stem cell activation</title><p>Since we had shown that light is perceived at a distance from the SAM, which also for energy rich metabolites is not a source, but a sink tissue, we next asked how the information for both environmental inputs is relayed to the stem cell system. Obvious candidates for inter-regional signaling components are plant hormones and there are a number of studies demonstrating their importance in regulating the shoot stem cell niche, especially for cytokinin (CK) and auxin (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray et al., 2012</xref>). A previous study had analyzed the environmental influence on organ initiation at the SAM using transfer of light grown tomato plants to darkness as a model and found that light is required for CK signaling and polarized membrane localization of the auxin export carrier PIN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoshida et al.,2011</xref>). However, these studies could not distinguish whether light was perceived as informational cue or energy source. We therefore analyzed CK signaling activity using the <italic>pTCSn:GUS</italic> cytokinin output sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zürcher et al., 2013</xref>) as well as auxin flux directionality using polarization of <italic>pPIN1:PIN1-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benková et al., 2003</xref>) as a proxy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–K</xref>). In line with the findings of Yoshida et al., CK signaling was strongly activated by light when compared to etiolated seedlings (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,G</xref>). Furthermore, we also found that PIN1 polarly localized to the plasma membrane in a light dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

While PIN1 localization was still light responsive, no activity of the <italic>TCS</italic> reporter was detectable under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,J</xref>). We also observed a reduction of <italic>TCS</italic> signal when plants were grown in a CO<sub>2</sub>-deficient environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

However, light signaling and photosynthesis together had a much stronger effect on CK output than nutrient availability alone, suggesting that both signals synergize to stimulate CK signaling at the SAM. In contrast, PIN1 localization to the plasma membrane was fully dependent on light perception and could not even be restored by the <italic>cop1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).</p><p>If CK signaling indeed integrates energy status and light perception, it may be sufficient to activate SAM development. In line with this idea, the importance of CK in light dependent SAM activation had already been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chory et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Skylar et al., 2010</xref>) and Yoshida et al. had shown that the application of CK to tomato apices can induce organogenesis in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoshida et al.,2011</xref>). Consistently, etiolated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings treated with CK produced leaf like structures even in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chory et al. 1994</xref>). However, this developmental transition was strictly dependent on the presence of an external energy source, similar to the behavior of <italic>cop1</italic> mutants and in the absence of sucrose, CK treated seedlings failed to develop leaves in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). Thus, our experiments were consistent with CK being an important component of, but not the sole signal for environmental stem cell activation.</p><p>Since we had found <italic>WUS</italic> expression to be a much more sensitive readout for SAM activation than organ development, we made use of our reporter system to dissect the role of CK for overcoming stem cell dormancy. Using hormone treatment assays we found that CK alone was sufficient to induce low levels of <italic>WUS</italic> expression even in darkness in line with its known role in SAM regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buechel et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, we observed the strongest stimulation of reporter activity in plants on sucrose medium, whereas the light response was largely unaffected by CK treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These results suggested that application of CK can at least partially replace the perception of light and thus supported a role for CK as a mobile transducer for light signals upstream of <italic>WUS</italic> expression. However, as demonstrated by our results using the <italic>TCS</italic> reporter, in the absence of energy metabolites downstream CK signaling cannot be fully activated, resulting in a lack of organ development. Having established an environment specific role for CK in the initial steps leading up to stem cell activation, we wondered about the mechanism of regulating endogenous hormone levels. We therefore mined the literature for light responsive genes, expressed in the meristem and functionally related to CK metabolism, perception, or signaling. Only <italic>CYTOKININ OXIDASE 5 (CKX5</italic>), which codes for one of seven homologous cytokinin dehydrogenases involved in CK catabolism in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> met all criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frebort et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>CKX5</italic> is a direct transcriptional target of several PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) and is highly expressed in etiolated seedlings as well as under shade conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hornitschek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfeiffer et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to <italic>cop1</italic> mutants, also <italic>pifq</italic> mutants form leaves in darkness when supplied with sugars externally, therefore the PIFs are likely to play an important role in suppressing SAM activation in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). <italic>CKX6,</italic> a close homologue of <italic>CKX5,</italic> had already been described to limit primordia growth in response to shade treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carabelli et al., 2007</xref>) and both <italic>CKX5</italic> and <italic>CKX6</italic> had been shown to be expressed around the shoot apex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Motyka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartrina et al., 2011</xref>). When we tested the contribution of <italic>CKX5</italic> and <italic>CKX6</italic> to SAM activation by crossing the single mutants to our reporter line, we found that loss of either did not promote <italic>WUS</italic> activity in the dark as CK treatment. In contrast, the responses to sucrose and light were robustly enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), revealing that genetically removing etiolation specific antagonists of CK accumulation is sufficient to replace one of the essential environmental signals, but not both. Because <italic>CKX</italic> genes act partially redundantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartrina et al., 2011</xref>), we decided to remove <italic>CKX6</italic> in the <italic>ckx5</italic> mutant reporter background by CRISPR/Cas9. Of 27 plants tested in T1, three were homozygous <italic>ckx6</italic> mutants, with either insertions or deletions at the 5´end of the <italic>CKX6</italic> locus leading to a shift in the reading frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Seedlings of all three independent <italic>ckx5/ckx6</italic> mutant reporter lines were analyzed in the T2 generation and showed comparable effects on <italic>WUS</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> includes data from one representative <italic>ckx5/ckx6</italic> line, AP101.9). In contrast to either single <italic>ckx</italic> mutant, <italic>ckx5/ckx6</italic> double mutants showed basal <italic>WUS</italic> reporter activity in darkness, similar to its behavior under CK treatment. Furthermore, we observed a dramatic enhancement of the effect of sucrose on <italic>WUS</italic> activity and also light dependent reporter induction was increased two-fold over either single mutant, which was also detectable by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on these results we concluded that CKX5 and CKX6 repress activation of the SAM by degradation of the plant hormone CK in darkness. Interestingly, the level of <italic>WUS</italic> expression in the <italic>ckx5/ckx6</italic> double mutant background was almost comparable to one found in <italic>cop1</italic> mutant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, in striking contrast to <italic>cop1</italic>, the <italic>ckx5/ckx6</italic> double mutant displayed a fully etiolated phenotype in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), demonstrating that stem cell activation was fully uncoupled from photomorphogenesis in these plants. Thus, CK can act as an interregional transmitter of light signals specifically for <italic>WUS</italic> expression, but not for general regulators of photomorphogenic growth, suggesting that the developmental integration of light and metabolic signals might occur downstream of CK and locally at the SAM.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17023.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Role of cytokinin signaling in <italic>WUS</italic> activation.</title><p>Quantification of <italic>pWUS:3xVENUS-NLS</italic> expression in four day old seedlings.

To this end, plants were grown on plates supplemented with equimolar amounts (15 mM) of different sugars with diverse energy content for four days in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). While mannitol, a non-metabolizable sugar, did not affect <italic>WUS</italic> activity, <italic>WUS</italic> expression could be observed in etiolated seedlings in the presence of glucose and sucrose, with sucrose being approximately twice as effective as glucose.

Characteristic expression changes that were described in response to glucose-TOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>) and E2Fa overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vandepoele et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">López-Juez et al., 2008</xref>), namely affecting genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, protein translation and cell proliferation have also been identified in microarray analyses of shoot apex tissue derived from young seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">López-Juez et al., 2008</xref>). These genes were rapidly and synchronously induced by photosynthetically active light preceding organ growth, which lead us to hypothesize that stem cell activation in the SAM might also be under control of the TOR kinase.</p><p>Since mutations in TOR are lethal, we used chemical interference to functionally test its contribution to SAM activation. To efficiently inhibit TOR activity, we applied the ATP-competitive TOR kinase inhibitor AZD-8055 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montané and Menand, 2013</xref>) on seedlings grown in liquid culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). After an initial germination and growth phase of three days in darkness, sugar, light and inhibitor treatments were applied for another three days followed by microscopic analysis of the seedlings. In line with our hypothesis that TOR is required for energy sensing in the SAM, AZD-8055 inhibited glucose-induced <italic>WUS</italic> expression in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Already 2–5 µM of AZD-8055 resulted in a considerable repression of <italic>WUS</italic> promoter activity when compared to mock controls, and almost completely suppressed the positive effect of glucose.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>TOR acts as an integrator of light and metabolic signals for stem cell activation</title><p>Since TOR kinase has such a central function in the regulation of growth and development, we wondered whether besides the well documented nutrient availability pathway other stimuli, such as light signaling, might also depend on TOR activity. Using the same experimental setup as described above for glucose we indeed found that light-induced <italic>WUS</italic> expression was efficiently inhibited by AZD-8055 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This suggested that TOR kinase might play a specific role in light signaling independent of energy production, since the plants were exposed to a rather low light intensity of 30 µmol*m<sup>−2</sup>*s<sup>−1</sup>. To further test this, we analyzed TOR dependency in the absence of photosynthesis and found that light dependent <italic>WUS</italic> expression was repressed by the TOR inhibitor even under norflurazon treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistently, even genetic activation of the light signaling pathway through the <italic>cop1</italic> mutation in the absence of a physiological stimulus was sensitive to TOR inhibition by AZD-8055 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Since we could not exclude that our observations were caused by unspecific side effects of the AZD-8055 inhibitor, we wanted to monitor TOR activity in response to sugars and light directly. Working under the hypothesis that TOR activity should correlate with energy and light signals if the inhibitor results were meaningful, we quantified the phosphorylation level of the direct TOR target S6K by a phospho-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). After transfer of three-day-old etiolated seedlings to either light (60 µmol*m<sup>−2</sup>*s<sup>−1</sup> of blue and red light each) or 15 mM glucose for 24 hr, we detected a substantial increase in phosphorylation of S6K compared to seedlings that were kept in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Surprisingly, light treatment was even more efficient in activating TOR kinase than supplying plants with external glucose. Consistently, <italic>cop1-4</italic> mutant seedlings displayed high S6K phosphorylation levels under all conditions, including the dark-grown control. Also in this case we were able to detect a similar activation of the TOR pathway in other <italic>cop1</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), supporting our previous observation that the TOR pathway is repressed by the negative light signaling component COP1 in darkness. Taken together, TOR kinase seems to play a central and so far underestimated role not only for metabolic, but also for light dependent activation of <italic>WUS</italic> and ultimately stem cells in the SAM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Environment dependent metabolic reprogramming</title><p>After having shown that light and energy status converge to activate stem cells, we wondered about the underlying metabolic changes in response to these environmental cues. We were most interested to analyze metabolic re-programming in response to light signaling because we hypothesized that TOR could be indirectly activated following at least two scenarios: First, since in the wild light signaling and photosynthesis usually go hand in hand, we were wondering whether signaling alone would trigger a metabolic shift in expectation of photosynthesis derived energy metabolites. And second, since <italic>COP1</italic> regulates more than 20% of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2002</xref>), we speculated that this could also extend to the activity of metabolic enzymes. In both cases the metabolic state of the seedlings, especially with respect to glucose levels, could be affected by light signaling and this in turn could indirectly trigger TOR. We therefore analyzed metabolites in seedlings that were subjected to the same experimental workflow as for studying TOR activity described above, namely wild-type and <italic>cop1-4</italic> seedlings grown in darkness compared to seedlings treated with either 15 mM glucose or light for 24 hr before harvest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plot clearly identified light signaling triggered by the <italic>cop1</italic> mutation (PC1) and energy availability caused by glucose supplementation (PC2) as the two major components in our sample set, with light treated samples being influenced by both components. Interestingly, glucose treatment only had a mild effect on seedling metabolism. We detected slight increases of glucose, fructose and sucrose as well as a clear increase of mannose levels in glucose treated seedlings, while raffinose levels were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,H</xref>). The fact that under these conditions TOR activity is markedly increased and <italic>WUS</italic> expression is robustly detectable demonstrates that the energy sensing machinery must be exquisitely sensitive to small changes in metabolite content, most likely glucose. To our surprise, <italic>cop1</italic> and light treated seedlings showed similar metabolic profiles that were clearly different from the glucose treated samples. Since <italic>cop1</italic> seedlings were grown in darkness, the metabolic re-programming in <italic>cop1</italic> and light treated seedlings is likely caused by light signaling dependent transcriptional regulation of metabolic enzymes, rather than simple photosynthesis dependent accumulation of sugars. We detected a clear reduction of fructose and sucrose levels and a decrease in the cell wall monosaccharides fucose, arabinose and galactose in both samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). In addition, ADP and ATP levels were slightly increased by light and <italic>cop1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). <italic>Cop1</italic> seedlings also displayed an accumulation of glyoxylate, an intermediate of the glyoxylate cycle that allows plants to use lipids as carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Another noteworthy exception from the similarity between <italic>cop1</italic> and light treated seedlings was glucose. Importantly, only the light- and glucose-treated samples, but not <italic>cop1</italic> seedlings showed an increase in glucose levels that might be responsible for the observed activation of TOR kinase. However, since it is not known how the TOR complex is activated in plants, we cannot exclude that the obvious metabolic re-programming indirectly triggered TOR kinase activity in <italic>cop1</italic> seedlings. Nevertheless, since <italic>cop1</italic> seedlings showed an overall reduction of energy rich metabolites, it seemed unlikely that the nutrient state was exclusively responsible for activation of the TOR pathway in the <italic>cop1</italic> background.</p><p>Interestingly, we saw a significant increase in the levels of specific amino acids and their derivatives especially in <italic>cop1</italic> (Glu, Gln, His, Arg, ornithin, spermidine and citrulline) that were all previously described to be reduced in <italic>amiR-tor</italic> seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Conversely, time amino acids whose levels were reported to be increased upon TOR repression (Thr, Tyr, Val, Ile and Leu) were unchanged or reduced in <italic>cop1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caldana et al., 2013</xref>). The inverse correlation of amino acid levels in <italic>cop1</italic> and <italic>amiR-tor</italic> lines was not apparent in the other samples, suggesting that the permanent de-regulation of the TOR pathway during either <italic>cop1</italic> or <italic>amiR-tor</italic> seedling development strongly affected the metabolome while the short term nature of the glucose or light treatments was insufficient for such a profound change.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The life of a plant begins in many cases with skotomorphogenesis, which is characterized by the elongation of the hypocotyl, formation of an apical hook, unfolded cotyledons and the dormancy of the SAM. While most characteristics of skotomorphogenesis can be revoked by the perception of light through the photoreceptors alone, we showed that activation of the SAM in addition requires the presence of energy metabolites. Thus, for stem cell activation, light not only acts as a signal, but also needs to fuel the photosynthetic apparatus to produce sugars and despite the dual role of a single environmental factor, both inputs are sensed independently. Amazingly, it is not stem cell fate that is dependent on these signals, but rather the expression of <italic>WUS</italic>, which defines the niche and at the same time acts as a mobile stem cell activator. Thus, stem cell fate as defined by <italic>CLV3</italic> promoter activity can exist without WUS in a physiologically and developmentally relevant setting, strongly suggesting that WUS is not the primary stimulating input for <italic>CLV3</italic> expression.</p><p>For the sensing, transmission and integration of light and metabolic signals by the stem cell system, evolution seems to have co-opted well studied regulators into a novel and so far unsuspected regulatory network. On the one hand, the roles of the phyB and cry photoreceptors for stem cell activation are fully in line with text book photomorphogenesis, on the other hand phyA exhibits novel positive and negative functions in far-red light regulation of <italic>WUS</italic> expression, which point to a re-wiring of this core component of light signaling. Similarly, in light signal transduction, the etiolation regulator COP1 plays a prominent part and <italic>cop1</italic> mutations can substitute for light in essentially all experiments, apart from PIN1 membrane localization. In contrast, HY5, another core component of the photomorphogenesis network, does not seem to have any apparent role in light dependent stem cell activation. This is even more striking when taking into account the recently discovered role in shoot-to-root signaling of HY5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), and our observation that the meristem region itself does not possess the competence to perceive and process light signals. However, we cannot exclude that the HY5 homolog HYH with partially overlapping function but higher expression level in the shoot might mask the effect of <italic>hy5</italic> on <italic>WUS</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holm et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sibout et al., 2006</xref>). Since <italic>hy5/hyh</italic> mutants showed deficiencies in development of the first leaves future experiments analyzing such a double mutant in the context of our double reporter are required.</p><p>Interregional transmission of the light signal seems to depend on CK and with the cytokinin dehydrogenases <italic>CKX5</italic> and <italic>CKX6</italic>, we identified two potent regulators of meristem activity that are highly responsive to environmental light conditions. Both are direct targets of PIFs and have already been shown to accumulate in etiolated seedlings (<italic>CKX5</italic>) and shade conditions (<italic>CKX6</italic>), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carabelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfeiffer et al., 2014</xref>), which ultimately leads to an inactivation of cytokinin under unfavorable light conditions. Under open sun light PIFs are degraded, thus liberating cytokinin from CKX mediated degradation, which in turn results in the activation of stem cells. <italic>CKX5</italic> is expressed in the rib zone below the stem cell niche and <italic>CKX6</italic> additionally in the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Motyka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartrina et al., 2011</xref>), which might explain the surprisingly high efficiency of our <italic>pSUC2:PHYB Y276H</italic> line in activating <italic>WUS</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). We did not specifically activate light signaling in the rib zone below the stem cell niche in our experiments and thus the possibility remains that light perception in the immediate vicinity to the meristem affects stem cell activity by short range CK signaling.</p><p>In parallel to light signals, <italic>WUS</italic> expression was strongly responsive to energy availability. The effect of sucrose on <italic>cop1</italic> and <italic>ckx5/ckx6</italic> double mutants was much stronger than the cumulative effect of light and sucrose treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>). Also the activity of the CK output reporter <italic>pTCSn:GUS</italic> strictly depended on sucrose, but could be further stimulated by light, suggesting that CK signaling mainly acts to transmit light signals, but that elevation of CK levels genetically or by treatment are insufficient to elicit the full developmental response. Based on these results we suggest that light enhances CK levels by reducing the expression of <italic>CKX</italic> genes, however we cannot rule out other explanations, such as stimulation of CK biosynthesis.</p><p>Interestingly, the WUS paralog <italic>WOX9/STIMPY (STIP</italic>) also plays an important role in light, sugar and CK crosstalk at the shoot apex. Meristems of weaker <italic>stip</italic> mutants arrest at seedling stage but can be rescued by addition of sucrose to the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>STIP</italic> was further shown to integrate CK signals at the meristem and <italic>STIP</italic> over-expression can partially overcome the deficits of CK perception mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Skylar et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast to <italic>WUS</italic>, however, sugar acts downstream of <italic>STIMPY</italic>, and it would be interesting to investigate whether the same is true for light signals.</p><p>Our experiments suggested that light and metabolic signals converge downstream of CK and locally at the SAM and consistently, we identified the TOR kinase to be an integrator of both signaling pathways. Earlier reports had shown that glucose-TOR signaling regulates photosynthesis-driven activation of the root meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>) and we demonstrated here that also shoot stem cell activation by metabolizable sugars is dependent on TOR kinase. Intriguingly, TOR activity was not only required for the response to energy availability, but also for <italic>WUS</italic> stimulation by light. This activity was independent of photosynthesis, because the TOR pathway was also activated under norflurazon treatment, in the absence of CO<sub>2</sub> or the suppression of COP1 function. The direct regulation of TOR kinase by light signaling elegantly explains the recently discovered impact of phytochromes on the metabolic state of the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), but also represents another striking example of a so far undiscovered re-wiring of a core regulatory component within the stem cell network. Consistently, upstream regulators of TOR kinase described in other organisms are not well conserved in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dobrenel et al., 2016</xref>) and thus evolution seems to have found alternative mechanisms to activate the TOR pathway in a highly context dependent manner. Coupling light and energy sensing via TOR could help plants to prepare for the dramatic developmental transition from skotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis, which involves transcriptional re-programming of almost a quarter of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">López-Juez et al., 2008</xref>). Light dependent activation of TOR kinase could allow etiolated seedlings to build up the photosynthetic apparatus, initiate ribosome biogenesis and prime stem cells via the expression of <italic>WUS</italic> to efficiently shift gear towards organogenic growth and development, once energy becomes available.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Double reporter</title><p>The <italic>pCLV3:mCHERRY</italic> (pMD149) construct was obtained by LR reactions of the <italic>pDONR221-mCHERRY-NLS</italic> plasmid (pFK143) with pFK317, a pGreen-IIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hellens et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mathieu et al., 2007</xref>) based binary vector with <italic>CLV3</italic> 1.4 kb promoter and 1.2 kb terminator sequences and kanamycin resistance cassette.

Overall, the data appear solid and are presented in a transparent manner, and the conclusions are largely justified from my point of view. However, the authors' conclusions strongly hinge on the quantification of two reporters under different conditions or in different genetic backgrounds, and I believe some improvements are required to make the manuscript acceptable for publication.</p><p>1) I have one major concern with respect to the genetic material. Several analyses are based on experiments with a mutant in COP1, a central negative regulator of photomorphogenesis. Understandably, the authors use one of the viable <italic>cop1</italic> alleles in their work, the <italic>cop1-4</italic> mutant. However, within the <italic>cop1</italic> allelic series, this allele has always been the most mysterious. Unlike true null alleles, <italic>cop1-4</italic> produces a truncated protein that comprises both the RING finger and coiled coil domains, yet alleles that retain these domains as well but are truncated further C-terminal or carry certain point mutations in the WD40 repeat domain also have a strong phenotype.</p><p>Therefore, I believe it is important to check whether the results obtained with <italic>cop1-4</italic> are representative. I understand that it would be too much to ask to repeat reporter experiments in another <italic>cop1</italic> background, but I think the authors could check the principal physiological responses in true <italic>cop1</italic> null alleles, which should be easily available. In particular, the authors could repeat the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>. They could also try to detect the effect of <italic>cop1</italic> on <italic>WUS</italic> expression by qPCR instead of a reporter, the difference appears strong enough although it is restricted to few cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>2) Another genetic concern: I believe the authors are formally right to conclude that HY5 has no role in light-dependent stem cell activation, however it is important to remember that unlike <italic>cop1</italic>, none of the COP1-target mutants has a phenotype that is as absolute skotomorphogenic as <italic>cop1</italic> is photomorphogenic. If their conclusions with respect to <italic>cop1</italic> are right, multiple mutants combining various COP1 targets should eventually show the pertinent defect. Among others, the <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutant comes to mind. In the shoot, HYH is stronger expressed than HY5, and <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants have been reported to have meristematic defects, like &quot;delayed&quot; organ formation. I believe the authors should check light-dependent SAM activation at least in <italic>hyh</italic> single and <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants, and maybe also pertinent triple mutants with additional factors.</p><p>3) With respect to responses illustrated by images only, like <italic>cop1</italic> shoot formation on +/- suc, are those responses fully penetrant? If so, this should be explicitly stated, if not, proportions clearly indicated.</p><p>4) One of the two ML1 transgenic lines deviates from the highlighted phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Why is that? Is it an expression problem? As I understand, the <italic>phyB</italic> mutant was not tagged? Maybe the authors can present evidence from additional lines and/or correlation with expression levels. As is, their statement regarding ML1 is misleading, because one out of two lines shows the other phenotype, so it's a 50:50 choice.</p><p>5) With regard to the cytokinin experiments, and the sometimes inconclusive contribution, I wonder whether the actual cytokinin used is of importance? Given the variety of cytokinins and their reported shoot- and root-specific activities, the authors might find a &quot;better&quot; cytokinin, which might have a more clear effect on WUS expression.</p><p>6) Because of the importance of the fluorescence measurements, I would like the authors to confirm that samples analyzed for one graph were grown in parallel and analyzed with identical settings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting manuscript exploring how light and metabolic signals activate the SAM. The SAM is dormant in etiolated seedlings and gets activated upon light perception. As shown previously the SAM of etiolated <italic>cop1</italic> seedlings is activated by adding sugar thereby leading to the formation of leaves (even flowers) in darkness. This suggests that both light signals (constitutively on in <italic>cop1</italic>) and metabolic signals cooperate to enable SAM activation. The authors explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this activation. The authors show that the <italic>CLV3</italic> expression domain is rather constant across conditions while <italic>WUS</italic> expression is induced by light. A number of experiments indicate that this light activation comprises both light and metabolic signals. TOR is implicated in the metabolic regulation of <italic>WUS</italic> expression while the phytohormone CK is involved in light regulation of <italic>WUS</italic> expression. This paper should be of broad interested for developmental biologists. Below I list a few issues that the authors should clarify.</p><p>1) Based on WUS expression in <italic>cop1</italic> +/- sucrose and WT +/- light and the use of NF and Linc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the authors conclude that both light and metabolic signals contribute to <italic>WUS</italic> expression. How can we be sure that NF and Linc were really effective in the experiment shown in 2A? More generally, if at all possible it would more elegant/convincing to show the role of light on the production of sugars by performing at least one experiment in a CO<sub>2</sub> free environment (see for example Kircher and Schopfer 2012). This would not lead to the rather drastic effects of these drugs on chloroplasts. In principle the effect of CO<sub>2</sub>-free air could be complemented by adding sucrose. Haydon et al., 2013 also complemented the NF effect by adding sucrose which to some extent rules out non-specific effects of NF.</p><p>2) The role of CK is potentially quite complex and I'm not sure that the current data allows drawing a clear conclusion. The authors propose that CK promote <italic>WUS</italic> expression by transmitting the light signal (e.g. subsection “Mechanisms of hormonal stem cell activation”, end of last paragraph). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> one can observe that light-grown plants treated with NF still show strong <italic>WUS</italic> expression. However, on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> light grown seedlings treated with NF show absolutely no TCS:GUS signal, indicating no CK activity. How then could such seedlings express <italic>WUS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) given that the metabolic signal should be gone (in the presence of NF) and TCS:GUS is also gone? A second problem with the model is the role of light-regulated <italic>CKX5/6</italic> expression. The authors propose that this is how light regulates the CK function in this process. However, light regulation of <italic>WUS</italic> expression is just as robust in the <italic>ckx5/ckx6</italic> double mutant than in the WT (4B). It therefore rather appears that these genes are involved in basal regulation of <italic>WUS</italic> expression and not in light regulation. It would actually be interesting to test this by adding sucrose to the double mutant and look for signs of leaf development in darkness rather than hypocotyl elongation as shown in supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>3) A potential difficulty with the role of CK in this process and the use of drugs like NF is that CK biosynthesis requires plastids and chloroplast development is promoted by CK. Not sure how this can be untangled but it should be discussed.</p><p>4) All figure legends should be more explicit and provide detailed information about the exact light conditions (intensity, color), presence of sucrose and numbers of seedlings used per experiment. For example, I don't see which data correspond to + sucrose (hatched box) in 2A.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This interesting manuscript investigates the regulation of the stem cell inducer <italic>WUSCHEL (WUS</italic>) and of it repressor CLAVATA3 (<italic>Clv3</italic>) by metabolic, hormonal and light signals using fluorescent markers driven by the promoters of these genes. This manuscript covers a lot of ground and makes a thorough analysis of the factors regulating the expression of these reporter genes. Specifically the role of cytokinins as well as sucrose and sugars in inducing <italic>WUS</italic> expression is shown and the obtained data suggest that the Target Of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase plays a central role in connecting metabolic signals to <italic>WUS</italic> induction. This manuscript is well written on the overall, although some Results parts could be shortened, and given the central and conserved roles of both TOR and <italic>WUS/Clv3</italic> in promoting organ formation in plants, it is likely to be of interest for a large audience.</p><p>Nevertheless, I have a few points that, to my opinion, should be addressed by the authors:</p><p>1) It is not clear from the Methods if the <italic>WUS</italic> 5'UTR is included in the chimaeric construct used, which should be more clearly defined? This could be important given the translation regulations of <italic>WUS</italic> expression (see Cui et al., PCE 2015). Thus I am not sure that a transcriptional fusion with a reporter gene completely recapitulates <italic>WUS</italic> or <italic>Clv3</italic> regulations.</p><p>2) Therefore I think that the data obtained with the fluorescent markers should be backed up, for the most important experiments, with another method like QPCR or even better immunolocalization. In situ hybridization was used but only for the first experiment.</p><p>3) The effect of TOR inhibition on <italic>WUS</italic> induction by sugars or light is quite clear and interesting. However, this effect could be indirect and linked to the pleiotropic effect of TOR inhibition on development and metabolism. This part of the paper is mainly descriptive and the authors could try to find more mechanistic evidence by mining the available data on the impact of TOR inhibition on transcriptome or metabolome. The western blot used to measure S6K phosphorylation, a classical readout for TOR activity, could be improved. The molecular mass of both phosphorylated and total S6K bands should be indicated together with a picture of the whole membrane. Much less proteins seem to have been loaded for dark-grown plants? Also a control experiment with AZD should be performed to check for lower S6K phosphorylation.</p><p>4) Some differences in metabolite abundance are quite small and should be confirmed by statistical analyses to avoid over-interpretation of the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17023.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>All reviewers agree that your work is of general interest and in principle support publication.

We therefore now carried out additional experiments using CO<sub>2</sub>-deficient environment as proposed by reviewer #2 and described earlier in Kircher and Schopfer, 2012. The new experiments lead to the same conclusion as our previous experiments with norflurazon. The growth of plants in a CO<sub>2</sub>-deficient environment also inhibited development in light and could be rescued by the addition of sucrose to the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In 4 day old seedlings the CO<sub>2</sub>-deficiency did not affect light induced <italic>WUS</italic>-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) but strongly suppressed the TCS reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The reviewers also have some concerns regarding the plant material, especially with regard to the cop1 allele used. They ask that some of the basic experiments are verified with a cop1 null allele.</italic></p><p>We used <italic>cop1</italic> mutants in several of our experiments. Since <italic>cop1</italic> null mutants arrest at early seedling stage (McNellis et al., 1994), we used the weak allele <italic>cop1-4</italic>. The <italic>cop1-4</italic> mutant expresses a truncated COP1 protein that lacks the WD repeats. A recent publication shows that the comparatively weak phenotype of the <italic>cop1-4</italic> mutant relies on the SPA proteins that can partially substitute the lack of the WD repeats that are missing in <italic>cop1-4</italic><sub>1</sub>. In absence of the SPA proteins the COP1-4 protein has no activity.</p><p>Addressing the concerns of Reviewer #1, we want to point out that the development of <italic>cop1</italic> mutants in darkness is not restricted to the <italic>cop1-4</italic> allele. It has already been described in previous publications for the alleles <italic>cop1-1, cop1-6</italic> and <italic>cop1-8</italic> (Kircher &amp; Schopfer, 2012; Nakagawa &amp; Komeda, 2004).</p><p>Following the suggestions of the reviewers, we now repeated some key experiments with other <italic>cop1</italic> mutant alleles (namely <italic>cop1</italic>-6 (McNellis et al., 1994) and <italic>cop1</italic>-19 (Favory et al., 2009) and all confirmed the results obtained with <italic>cop1-4</italic>. We show that in all alleles tested <italic>WUS</italic> expression is induced in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and that S6K phosphorylation levels are elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We therefore conclude that the effects are not restricted to the <italic>cop1-4</italic> allele, but characteristic for <italic>cop1</italic> mutants in general.</p><p><italic>3) The reviewers acknowledge the use of reporters as an output for CLV3/WUS activity, but also wonder whether some of the basic observations could be confirmed by qPCR analysis of the endogenous genes?</italic></p><p>Many conclusions of our manuscript are based on the analysis of the <italic>WUS</italic> reporter line because it is by far the most sensitive and robust way to quantify <italic>WUS</italic> promoter activity. We have characterized these reporters in great detail and found them to faithfully recapitulate in many different settings, including other transgenes, suggesting that positional effects have minor influence on their output (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref><italic>pWUS:mCHERRY-GUS</italic> reporter in 4 day old seedlings as an example).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17023.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17023.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17023.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-17023-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have now quantified <italic>WUS</italic> expression by qRT-PCR to independently verify our results obtained with the reporter line. We were able to confirm our findings, however the lack of spatial resolution and the small number of expressing cells translated to low signal to noise ratio in the qRT assays. Therefore, we only detected mild expression changes of <italic>WUS</italic> with some variation in 4 day old seedlings grown in darkness, red light or in presence of sucrose (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref>). We therefore decided to test 7 day old seedlings, which showed very reliable results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref> and E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The qRT-PCR analysis confirmed all key findings, including the induction of <italic>WUS</italic> expression by light and sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) as well as the positive effect of the <italic>cop1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>) and the <italic>ckx5/ckx6</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) on <italic>WUS</italic> expression.</p><p>We want to point out that quantitative analysis of <italic>WUS</italic> expression by qRT-PCR is problematic, since we need to compare plants of different morphology and thus an appropriate reference gene is not available (the issue was discussed in detail by Demidenko and Penin, 2012 <sub>2</sub>). We believe it to be essential to analyze WUS expression with cellular resolution and thus view the qRT-PCR results as a qualitative rather than a quantitative confirmation of our reporter gene analysis.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17023.016</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17023.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17023.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-17023-resp-fig2-v3"/></fig></p><p><italic>Please find the reviewer comments attached below for more details, and please respond to them to the best of your capacity.</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>This manuscript from the Lohmann lab and colleagues presents a complex set of data, which indicate that SAM activation is both light- and energy-status dependent in Arabidopsis.

However, the authors' conclusions strongly hinge on the quantification of two reporters under different conditions or in different genetic backgrounds, and I believe some improvements are required to make the manuscript acceptable for publication.</italic></p><p><italic>1) I have one major concern with respect to the genetic material. Several analyses are based on experiments with a mutant in COP1, a central negative regulator of photomorphogenesis. Understandably, the authors use one of the viable cop1 alleles in their work, the cop1-4 mutant. However, within the cop1 allelic series, this allele has always been the most mysterious. Unlike true null alleles, cop1-4 produces a truncated protein that comprises both the RING finger and coiled coil domains, yet alleles that retain these domains as well but are truncated further C-terminal or carry certain point mutations in the WD40 repeat domain also have a strong phenotype.</italic></p><p><italic>Therefore, I believe it is important to check whether the results obtained with cop1-4 are representative. I understand that it would be too much to ask to repeat reporter experiments in another cop1 background, but I think the authors could check the principal physiological responses in true cop1 null alleles, which should be easily available. In particular, the authors could repeat the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>. They could also try to detect the effect of cop1 on WUS expression by qPCR instead of a reporter, the difference appears strong enough although it is restricted to few cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</italic></p><p>Done – Please see response to Reviewing Editor point 2 above.</p><p><italic>2) Another genetic concern: I believe the authors are formally right to conclude that HY5 has no role in light-dependent stem cell activation, however it is important to remember that unlike cop1, none of the COP1-target mutants has a phenotype that is as absolute skotomorphogenic as cop1 is photomorphogenic. If their conclusions with respect to cop1 are right, multiple mutants combining various COP1 targets should eventually show the pertinent defect. Among others, the hy5 hyh double mutant comes to mind. In the shoot, HYH is stronger expressed than HY5, and hy5 hyh double mutants have been reported to have meristematic defects, like &quot;delayed&quot; organ formation. I believe the authors should check light-dependent SAM activation at least in hyh single and hy5 hyh double mutants, and maybe also pertinent triple mutants with additional factors.</italic></p><p>The hy5 mutation did not have any effect WUS expression in our reporter line. However, Reviewer #1 is right in pointing out that other COP1 targets might be also involved in downstream signaling and therefore the effects of the hy5 mutation might be masked by redundancy. Since we cannot exclude that HY5 is involved in regulation of meristem activity, we now state in the text:</p><p>&quot;However, hy5 mutants showed no defect in activation of WUS expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that either SAM stem cell activation makes use of another COP1-targeted transcriptional transducer or the function of HY5 can in this case be substituted by the HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH).&quot;</p><p>and in the Discussion:</p><p>&quot;However, we cannot exclude that the HY5 homolog HYH with partially overlapping function but higher expression level in the shoot might mask any effect of <italic>hy5</italic> on <italic>WUS</italic> expression (Holm et al., 2002; Sibout et al., 2006). Since <italic>hy5/hyh</italic> mutants showed deficiencies in development of the first leaved future experiments analyzing such a double mutant might give further insights.&quot;</p><p>We currently prepare CRISPR-CAS9 mutants of HYH in the <italic>hy5</italic> double reporter background to test this hypothesis. However, these experiments will take six months to carefully execute and go well beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) With respect to responses illustrated by images only, like cop1 shoot formation on +/- suc, are those responses fully penetrant? If so, this should be explicitly stated, if not, proportions clearly indicated.</italic></p><p>We now clarify the percentage of plants with shoot formation in the text. We see that 100% of <italic>cop1-4</italic> mutants developing leaves on sucrose. In contrast, only approximately one third of WT plants develop leaves on norflurazon CO<sub>2</sub>-deficient environment in light when supplemented with sucrose. In the absence of sucrose we never see development of the <italic>cop1</italic> mutants in darkness or WT on norflurazon or CO<sub>2</sub>-deficient environment in light.</p><p><italic>4) One of the two ML1 transgenic lines deviates from the highlighted phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Why is that? Is it an expression problem? As I understand, the phyB mutant was not tagged? Maybe the authors can present evidence from additional lines and/or correlation with expression levels. As is, their statement regarding ML1 is misleading, because one out of two lines shows the other phenotype, so it's a 50:50 choice.</italic></p><p>When we grew <italic>pML1:PHYB Y276H</italic> expressing lines in darkness, some showed a <italic>cop</italic>-like phenotype, while others resembled WT seedlings. We now show that this correlates with the expression level of <italic>PHYB</italic> by analyzing the total and endogenous <italic>PHYB</italic> expression by qRT PCR. Line AP88.2.1 (<italic>cop</italic> phenotype in darkness) shows 15x higher level of <italic>PHYB</italic> than line AP88.1.3 (WT phenotype) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Additionally we also analyzed the expression level of several lines expressing <italic>pML1:PHYB Y276H-YFP</italic> and also saw a clear negative correlation of hypocotyl length and <italic>PHYB Y276-YFP</italic> expression strength (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3</xref> pictures of 2 seedlings of each line grown for 4 days in darkness and above each line corresponding epifluorescence pictures of the YFP signal of hypocotyl cells with intensity coded in FIJI LUT &quot;fire&quot;).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17023.017</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17023.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17023.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-17023-resp-fig3-v3"/></fig></p><p><italic>5) With regard to the cytokinin experiments, and the sometimes inconclusive contribution, I wonder whether the actual cytokinin used is of importance? Given the variety of cytokinins and their reported shoot- and root-specific activities, the authors might find a &quot;better&quot; cytokinin, which might have a more clear effect on WUS expression.</italic></p><p>To elucidate the role of different cytokinin molecules we now assayed the effect of Kinetin and Zeatin on <italic>WUS</italic> expression. However, we did not see striking differences in the activation of <italic>WUS</italic> expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 4</xref>, plants were grown for 6 days in darkness and treated with 0.5 µM of cytokinin during the last 3 days).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17023.018</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17023.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17023.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-17023-resp-fig4-v3"/></fig></p><p><italic>6) Because of the importance of the fluorescence measurements, I would like the authors to confirm that samples analyzed for one graph were grown in parallel and analyzed with identical settings.</italic></p><p>All datasets were grown and analyzed in parallel with the reference sample (which is either the red light treated sample or the glucose treated sample) as well as an untreated (dark grown) sample and we now state so explicitly in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>&quot;For all these experiments plants of one experimental set were always grown and analyzed in parallel to the untreated (dark-grown) and the corresponding reference sample.&quot;</p><p>We already mentioned in the Methods that microscope settings were identical during all measurements.

How can we be sure that NF and Linc were really effective in the experiment shown in 2A? More generally, if at all possible it would more elegant/convincing to show the role of light on the production of sugars by performing at least one experiment in a CO<sub>2</sub> free environment (see for example Kircher and Schopfer 2012). This would not lead to the rather drastic effects of these drugs on chloroplasts. In principle the effect of CO<sub>2</sub>-free air could be complemented by adding sucrose. Haydon et al., 2013 also complemented the NF effect by adding sucrose which to some extent rules out non-specific effects of NF.</italic></p><p>We want to thank Reviewer #2 for pointing out that growth a CO<sub>2</sub>-free environment would be a good alternative for the norflurazon and lincomycin treatments. We now have carried out the suggested experiments and found them to confirm our earlier results. For further details please see response to Reviewing Editor point 1 above.</p><p><italic>2) The role of CK is potentially quite complex and I'm not sure that the current data allows drawing a clear conclusion. The authors propose that CK promote WUS expression by transmitting the light signal (e.g. subsection “Mechanisms of hormonal stem cell activation”, end of last paragraph). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> one can observe that light-grown plants treated with NF still show strong WUS expression. However, on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> light grown seedlings treated with NF show absolutely no TCS:GUS signal, indicating no CK activity. How then could such seedlings express WUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) given that the metabolic signal should be gone (in the presence of NF) and TCS:GUS is also gone? A second problem with the model is the role of light-regulated CKX5/6 expression. The authors propose that this is how light regulates the CK function in this process. However, light regulation of WUS expression is just as robust in the ckx5/ckx6 double mutant than in the WT (4B). It therefore rather appears that these genes are involved in basal regulation of WUS expression and not in light regulation. It would actually be interesting to test this by adding sucrose to the double mutant and look for signs of leaf development in darkness rather than hypocotyl elongation as shown in supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers' thought on this complex matter and agree that the proposed role of CK in transmitting light signals likely is only one of many.</p><p>We have carried out the experiment suggested to test a potential role of CK as a regulator of basal WUS expression. However, <italic>ckx5/ckx6</italic> mutants grown in darkness for a prolonged time do not develop leaves, even in the presence of sucrose (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Therefore, additional development promoting components are still missing in line with the CKX genes being only one element in the system. The reviewer is also right to point out the discrepancy between WUS activation and TCS activity, but since TCS is merely a read out B-type ARR activity and not of CK levels, and we have no knowledge on the relative sensitivities of the two promoters, or the directness of WUS regulation, we are unable to provide any further mechanistic insight into that matter at the moment.</p><p>We pointed out these complications in the following paragraph of the Discussion: &quot;Also the activity of the CK output reporter <italic>pTCSn:GUS</italic> strictly depended on sucrose, but could be further stimulated by light, suggesting that CK signaling mainly acts to transmit light signals, but that elevation of CK levels genetically or by treatment are insufficient to elicit the full developmental response. Based on these results we suggest that light enhances CK levels by reducing the expression of CKX genes, however we cannot rule out other explanations, such as stimulation of CK biosynthesis.&quot;</p><p><italic>3) A potential difficulty with the role of CK in this process and the use of drugs like NF is that CK biosynthesis requires plastids and chloroplast development is promoted by CK. Not sure how this can be untangled but it should be discussed.</italic></p><p>To disentangle the dependency of CK biosynthesis on chloroplast development we now grew plant in a CO<sub>2</sub>-free atmosphere in addition to the pharmacological treatment to show the dependency of CK signaling on energy and this new experiment confirmed our original findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) All figure legends should be more explicit and provide detailed information about the exact light conditions (intensity, color), presence of sucrose and numbers of seedlings used per experiment. For example, I don't see which data correspond to + sucrose (hatched box) in 2A.</italic></p><p>We tried to improve the readability of the figures and now add more information about the growth conditions in the figure legends. We also refer to the Materials and methods section, where we explained in detail the quantification of the fluorescence intensities.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>This interesting manuscript investigates the regulation of the stem cell inducer WUSCHEL (WUS) and of it repressor CLAVATA3 (Clv3) by metabolic, hormonal and light signals using fluorescent markers driven by the promoters of these genes. This manuscript covers a lot of ground and makes a thorough analysis of the factors regulating the expression of these reporter genes. Specifically the role of cytokinins as well as sucrose and sugars in inducing WUS expression is shown and the obtained data suggest that the Target Of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase plays a central role in connecting metabolic signals to WUS induction. This manuscript is well written on the overall, although some Results parts could be shortened, and given the central and conserved roles of both TOR and WUS/Clv3 in promoting organ formation in plants, it is likely to be of interest for a large audience.</italic></p><p><italic>Nevertheless, I have a few points that, to my opinion, should be addressed by the authors:</italic></p><p><italic>1) It is not clear from the Methods if the WUS 5'UTR is included in the chimaeric construct used, which should be more clearly defined? This could be important given the translation regulations of WUS expression (see Cui et al., PCE 2015). Thus I am not sure that a transcriptional fusion with a reporter gene completely recapitulates WUS or Clv3 regulations.</italic></p><p>Reviewer #3 pointed out the importance of the 5'UTR in the regulation of WUS expression. The 5' and 3´ UTRs are part of our <italic>WUS</italic> reporter and the regulatory regions used in the reporter have been shown to fully rescue the meristem defect of <italic>wus</italic> mutants in the context of a WUS-GFP fusion, which has been published and is also used in our study (<italic>pWUS:WUS- linker-GFP</italic> in <italic>wus</italic> mutant background (Daum et al., 2014). To clarify the reporter design, we now state in the text:</p><p>&quot;The <italic>pWUS:3xVENUS-NLS</italic> construct (pTS81) was generated accordingly, using a pGREEN- IIS based binary vector with a 4.4 kb genomic <italic>WUS</italic> promoter upstream of the ATG and 2.8 kb <italic>WUS</italic> terminator downstream of the stop codon (pFK398) and a Basta resistance cassette.&quot;</p><p><italic>2) Therefore I think that the data obtained with the fluorescent markers should be backed up, for the most important experiments, with another method like QPCR or even better immunolocalization. In situ hybridization was used but only for the first experiment.</italic></p><p>We have now repeated key experiments using qRT-PCR and confirmed our results obtained with the WUS reporter. For a detailed answer, please see response to Reviewing Editor point 3 above.</p><p><italic>3) The effect of TOR inhibition on WUS induction by sugars or light is quite clear and interesting. However, this effect could be indirect and linked to the pleiotropic effect of TOR inhibition on development and metabolism. This part of the paper is mainly descriptive and the authors could try to find more mechanistic evidence by mining the available data on the impact of TOR inhibition on transcriptome or metabolome. The western blot used to measure S6K phosphorylation, a classical readout for TOR activity, could be improved. The molecular mass of both phosphorylated and total S6K bands should be indicated together with a picture of the whole membrane. Much less proteins seem to have been loaded for dark-grown plants? Also a control experiment with AZD should be performed to check for lower S6K phosphorylation.</italic></p><p>Normalization of TOR activation assays is challenging in situations of diverging protein synthesis, such as light vs. dark, since TOR kinase has been described as a central regulator of protein synthesis. Therefore, we decided to load equal amounts of fresh weight to the gel instead of equal total protein amounts and to use unphosphorylated S6K1/2 for normalization. In our experience loading equal fresh weight results in rather similar amounts of unphosphorylated S6K1/2 signal, while protein levels correlated strongly with TOR activity, as expected. We now repeated the Western Blot analysis on AZD-8055 treated samples as control to confirm the specificity of the phosphorylation specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As requested, we now show a larger section of the membrane and added indicators of molecular mass.</p><p>As suggested, we have again screened the literature and databases for candidates that might explain the effect of TOR on SAM development. Obviously, several regulators could be identified, but since we cannot provide any evidence of the contribution of these candidates in meristem regulation we would like to constrain ourselves from speculation at this point.</p><p>We hope that the manuscript text makes this point rather clear:</p><p>&quot;Characteristic expression changes that were described in response to glucose-TOR signaling (Xiong et al., 2013) and E2Fa overexpression (Vandepoele et al., 2005; López- Juez et al., 2008), namely affecting genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, protein translation and cell proliferation have also been identified in microarray analyses of shoot apex tissue derived from young seedlings (López-Juez et al., 2008). These genes were rapidly and synchronously induced by photosynthetically active light preceding organ growth, which lead us to hypothesize that stem cell activation in the SAM might also be under control of the TOR kinase.&quot;</p><p><italic>4) Some differences in metabolite abundance are quite small and should be confirmed by statistical analyses to avoid over-interpretation of the results.</italic></p><p>We now added statistical information to all metabolite measurements and also added a PCA that analyses the overall variability of our data sets and replicates.</p><p>References</p><p>1) Ordoñez-Herrera, N. et al.
