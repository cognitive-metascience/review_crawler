channel essential for immunocyte activation, insulin secretion, and postischemic cell death. TRPM2 is activated by ADP ribose (ADPR) binding to its C-terminal cytosolic NUDT9-homology (NUDT9H) domain, homologous to the soluble mitochondrial ADPR pyrophosphatase (ADPRase) NUDT9. Reported ADPR hydrolysis classified TRPM2 as a channel-enzyme, but insolubility of isolated NUDT9H hampered further investigations. Here we developed a soluble NUDT9H model using chimeric proteins built from complementary polypeptide fragments of NUDT9H and NUDT9. When expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic>, chimeras containing up to ~90% NUDT9H sequence remained soluble and were affinity-purified. In ADPRase assays the conserved <italic>Nudix-box</italic> sequence of NUDT9 proved essential for activity (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>~4-9s<sup>-1</sup>), that of NUDT9H did not support catalysis. Replacing NUDT9H in full-length TRPM2 with soluble chimeras retained ADPR-dependent channel gating (K<sub>1/2</sub>~1-5 μM), confirming functionality of chimeric domains. Thus, TRPM2 is not a 'chanzyme'. Chimeras provide convenient soluble NUDT9H models for structural/biochemical studies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17600.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17600.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17600.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ion channels are proteins that allow specific charged particles to move across the membranes of cells – for example to travel in or out of a cell, or between different parts of the same cell. Almost all ion channels are gated, meaning that they can open and close in response to different signals. For instance, so-called ligand gated channels open in response to binding of some small molecule, known as the &quot;ligand&quot;. A small number of channel proteins are also enzymes, meaning that they are able to catalyze chemical reactions, and these channel-enzymes are often referred to as “chanzymes”.</p><p>TRPM2 is an ion channel found in humans that opens when a small molecule called ADPR binds to a portion of the channel inside the cell. This channel is also thought to be a chanzyme because the part that binds to ADPR is similar to an enzyme called NUDT9. The NUDT9 enzyme converts ADPR into two other chemicals. When studied in biochemical assays, the enzyme-like part of TRPM2 – which contains a segment called a “Nudix box” – appeared to act in the same way, although this activity was not linked to the opening and closing of the TRPM2 channel.</p><p>Iordanov et al. set out to re-examine whether TRPM2 is actually an enzyme by comparing the activity of NUDT9 to the enzyme-like part of TRPM2. To test an enzyme’s activity, it typically needs to be dissolved in water. However, the enzyme-like part of TRPM2 does not dissolve, and so it could not be tested directly. Instead, Iordanov et al. identified which parts of TRPM2 make it insoluble and replaced them with the equivalent parts from NUDT9 to create several new proteins. For all the proteins tested, only those with the Nudix box from NUDT9 were active enzymes, while those with the Nudix box from TRPM2 were not.</p><p>Iordanov et al. conclude that TRPM2 is a ligand gated channel and not a chanzyme, and that the experimental conditions used in previous biochemical assays, and not TRPM2 activity, led to the breakdown of ADPR. Finally, the TRPM2 channel is involved in cell damage following heart attacks or stroke and may contribute to Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and bipolar disorder as well. As such, knowing how TRMP2 behaves could guide efforts to develop new drugs for these illnesses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17600.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17600.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>chanzyme</kwd><kwd>NUDT9H domain</kwd><kwd>chimera</kwd><kwd>ADPR</kwd><kwd>TRPM2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Early Career Scientist grant, 55007416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Magyar Tudományos Akadémia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lendület grant, LP2012-39/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TRPM2 is simply a ligand gated channel and does not to possess enzymatic activity, even though it shows sequence similarity to Nudix hydrolases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) belongs to the TRP protein family and is predominantly expressed in brain neurons, spleen, bone marrow, leukocytes, phagocytes, pancreatic β cells, and cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagamine et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Togashi et al., 2006</xref>).

In addition, it contains a large cytosolic N-terminal domain of unknown function specific to the TRPM subfamily, and a C-terminal coiled-coil region (CCR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) followed by a small cytosolic domain (NUDT9H). The NUDT9H domain exhibits a high degree of sequence similarity (~35% identity, ~45% similarity) to the soluble, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mitochondrial pyrophosphatase NUDT9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shen et al., 2003</xref>), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of adenosine 5'-diphosphoribose (ADPR) into AMP and ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

Indeed, previous work reported weak enzymatic activity for isolated NUDT9H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2003</xref>), compatible with the slow timescale of channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Csanády and Törocsik, 2009</xref>), classifying TRPM2 among channel-enzymes ('chanzymes'). This small group of proteins, in which a single polypeptide chain forms both a transmembrane ion pore and a catalytically active domain, includes two other members of the TRPM subfamily (TRPM6 and TRPM7), and the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) chloride ion channel. In CFTR catalytic (ATPase) activity is strictly coupled to channel gating, which therefore follows a nonequilibrium cyclic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Csanády et al., 2010</xref>). In TRPM7 catalytic (phosphotransferase) activity is not linked to pore gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsushita et al., 2005</xref>), but instead serves to regulate expression of TRPM7-dependent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krapivinsky et al., 2014</xref>). In the case of TRPM2 the physiological role of the proposed ADPRase activity has not yet been clarified, but we have previously shown that any hydrolytic activity of NUDT9H is not coupled to gating of the TRPM2 channel itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tóth et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, our observation of intrinsic instability of several pyridine dinucleotides at basic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tóth et al., 2015</xref>) raised the possibility of a similar instability for ADPR, which might lead to false positive results when assessing the hydrolytic activity of a putative slow ADPRase enzyme. It thus remained a question whether the NUDT9H domain truly exhibits any enzymatic activity, not coupled to TRPM2 gating. One way to address this would be to further analyze the TRPM2 ADPR-binding domain in isolation. However, in our hands NUDT9H proved to be extremely insoluble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tóth et al., 2014</xref>), despite its high degree of sequence similarity to highly soluble NUDT9. For this reason we first constructed a series of chimeric proteins built from complementary polypeptide fragments of the two homologous proteins, and correlated solubility with NUDT9H sequence content. This approach allowed us to pinpoint the NUDT9H segments responsible for its insolubility, and to purify and investigate soluble chimeric proteins which contain up to ~90% of the native NUDT9H sequence. We then investigated enzymatic activities of such soluble chimeras in isolation, as well as their capacities to substitute for native NUDT9H in conferring ADPR-dependent gating to the full-length TRPM2 channel.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>C-terminal residues of NUDT9H are responsible for its insolubility</title><p>In a previous attempt to purify and biochemically characterize the TRPM2 NUDT9H domain in isolation we found it to be essentially insoluble, unlike its mitochondrial homologue NUDT9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tóth et al., 2014</xref>). Because of this unexpected difference we further investigated the two proteins in an attempt to obtain a soluble analogue of NUDT9H. Prompted by the strong similarity between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we generated chimeric constructs by swapping homologous segments between NUDT9 and NUDT9H. The crystal structure of mitochondrial NUDT9 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shen et al., 2003</xref>]; PDB ID: 1Q33) identified two subdomains - a 'Cap' and a 'Core' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>blue</italic> and <italic>brown</italic>). Assuming structural similarity between NUDT9 and NUDT9H, these two structurally distinct regions of NUDT9 provided the basis for generating the first chimeric constructs (Chi1/1A and Chi2/2A), obtained by exchanging the Cap and Core segments of the two native proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The NUDT9-Cap/NUDT9H-Core chimeras Chi1 and Chi1A were insoluble, whereas the NUDT9H-Cap/NUDT9-Core chimeras Chi2 and Chi2A were soluble, and Chi2 could be purified by Ni-affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The low solubility of NUDT9H is thus caused at least in part by its Core subdomain.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17600.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Alignment of NUDT9H and NUDT9 sequences.</title><p>Aligned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Corpet, 1988</xref>) sequences of NUDT9H and NUDT9, highlighting identical (<italic>red</italic>) and similar (<italic>blue</italic>) residues.

The low yields of soluble Chi3 and Chi4 could be robustly increased using a slower induction protocol (0.1 mM IPTG, 25°C, overnight); and replacement of the hexahistidine tag with a Twin-Strep tag (Chi3S and Chi4S) greatly improved protein purity, as confirmed by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and mass spectrometry analysis of the purified Chi4S sample. Indeed, using this slow induction protocol even some soluble NUDT9H protein could be obtained and purified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, right); however, this preparation precipitated overnight at 4°C. Thus, Chi4S remained the best NUDT9H model that we were able to obtain in stable, soluble form (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17600.007</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Properties of the recombinant proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17600.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17600.007</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Construct</th><th valign="top">M.W.

Closer inspection of the TLC plates of the inactive proteins indeed revealed very weak AMP spots appearing in the reaction mixtures at basic pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>, lanes 3 and 6). The low sensitivity of the TLC technique requires the presence of at least 0.2–0.3 mM AMP for visual detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, top slice). Thus, assuming 2–300 μM AMP produced by 1 μM protein within our 2-hr incubation would suggest apparent <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values of 0.03–0.04 s<sup>−1</sup> for Chi3S, 4S and NUDT9H at pH 8.5 and 25°C, in good agreement with the previous reports on NUDT9H (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> ~0.06 s<sup>−1</sup> at pH 9 and 37°C). However, our prior observation of spontaneous degradation of several dinucleotides at basic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tóth et al., 2015</xref>) prompted us to consider inherent instability of ADPR at basic pH as a possible reason for the observed slow AMP accumulation. Indeed, we found that ADPR undergoes slow degradation to AMP and R5P at pH 8.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, middle slice; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), highlighting that care must be taken to distinguish spontaneous hydrolysis from true enzymatic activity. At 25°C and pH 8.5 ~20% of ADPR degraded spontaneously in 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, middle slice, compare the two lanes marked by asterisks), indicating a decay time constant of ~100 h, and thus ~2% degradation in 2 hr: this rate of spontaneous degradation indeed fully accounts for the weak AMP spots observed for Chi3S, 4S, and NUDT9H at basic pH. More importantly, addition of either 0.1 or 1 μM Chi4S to ADPR-containing reaction mixtures at basic pH, either with (RB6) or without (RB3) 100 mM NaCl, did not affect the rate of spontaneous AMP accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, bottom slice). This clearly demonstrates that Chi4S does not possess any hydrolytic activity towards ADPR, most likely due to critical substitutions in its <italic>Nudix</italic> box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; cf., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Perraud et al., 2003</xref>]), and that the observed slow accumulation of AMP is merely caused by ADPR instability at basic pH.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Enzymatic activity of NUDT9 and Chi2 is pH dependent</title><p>We noted slower enzymatic activity for Chi2 at pH 6.5 and 7.1 compared to 8.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), whereas ADPR hydrolysis by NUDT9 appeared complete at all pH values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To test whether such pH dependence might also apply for NUDT9, but could not be observed at the chosen timescale of 2 hr, we analyzed for both enzymes the time course of AMP accumulation in ADPR-saturated reaction mixtures at the three different pH values (in RB1, RB2 and RB3). Both NUDT9 and Chi2 showed a clear preference for basic pH, causing AMP accumulation to be fastest at pH 8.5 and slowest at pH 6.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). The calculated <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values (in s<sup>−1</sup>) quantify this pH dependence of catalytic rates for both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), and reveal higher sensitivity for Chi2 (~5.8-fold decrease from pH 8.5 to 6.5) compared to NUDT9 (~1.4-fold decrease from pH 8.5 to 6.5). Spontaneous degradation of ADPR at basic pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, middle slice) is not a major contributor to this pH dependence, because the total duration of these kinetic experiments (~20 min) was too short for that effect to become significant: correction for the ~30 μM AMP which forms spontaneously in 20 min at pH 8.5 would amount to a downward adjustment of those <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <italic>black bars</italic>) by only ~0.05 s<sup>−1</sup>. Furthermore, whereas we cannot exclude the possibility that the two proteins were applied at slightly different concentrations, and that this may have caused the observed differences in their absolute reaction rates, investigating pH dependence of activity of a given enzyme (i.e. the same protein stock) is not subject to such limitations. Of note, the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of 9 s<sup>−1</sup> for NUDT9 at pH 8.5 is very similar to previously reported values (~8 s<sup>−1</sup>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2003</xref>]).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17600.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Enzyme kinetics of Chi2 and NUDT9.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative TLC images showing the time courses (in minutes) of hydrolysis of ADPR (10 mM) by 0.5 μM Chi2 (<italic>top</italic>) or NUDT9 (<italic>bottom</italic>) at 3 different pH values (RB1, RB2 and RB3).

In the case of CFTR ATP hydrolysis by two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 1996</xref>) appears to be an evolutionary vestige inherited from some ancestral ABC exporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gadsby et al., 2006</xref>): whereas in transporters the energy of ATP hydrolysis is harnessed to drive a cycle of conformational changes that result in thermodynamically uphill substrate transport, in CFTR ATP-binding induced dimerization of the two NBDs is strictly coupled to opening, and dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis to closure, of its transmembrane anion-selective pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Csanády et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vergani et al., 2005</xref>). Such a nonequilibrium cyclic gating mechanism is unique among ion channels which mediate downhill electrodiffusion of ions, and confers specific properties on CFTR, including stimulation of channel open probability by catalytic-site mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vergani et al., 2003</xref>), or by drug-induced stabilization of energy barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Csanády and Töröcsik, 2014</xref>). The other well studied chanzyme is the TRPM7 cation channel, which contains a kinase domain fused to its cytosolic C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Runnels et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nadler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yamaguchi et al., 2001</xref>). In this protein the catalytic activity of the enzymatic domain does not appear to be linked to gating of the channel pore, because phosphotransferase and channel activities can be modulated independently of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsushita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schmitz et al., 2003</xref>) and the kinase domain is functional when expressed on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Clark et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, recent work uncovered unexpected important specific functions of TRPM7 enzymatic activity: the kinase domain is proteolytically cleaved and translocates to the cell nucleus where it regulates gene expression by phosphorylating histones in the promoters of TRPM7-dependent genes. Moreover, Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent binding of the kinase domain to histone remodeling complexes provides a functional link to the TRPM7 channel pore, a major Zn<sup>2+</sup> influx pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krapivinsky et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the case of TRPM2 sequence similarity of its C-terminal NUDT9H domain to Nudix-family phosphohydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bessman et al., 1996</xref>) played an essential role in the discovery of the channel's activating ligand, ADP ribose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sano et al., 2001</xref>). Early demonstration of ADPR hydrolase activity for the isolated ligand binding domain NUDT9H classified TRPM2 as a chanzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2003</xref>), and raised intriguing questions about the possible role of this activity: all the more as the reported slow turnover rate (~0.1 s<sup>-1</sup>) falls into the range of channel gating rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>). Of note, while this slower rate of catalysis of NUDT9H, compared to NUDT9, was explained by lack of a conserved glutamate in its Nudix box motif important for Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordination, the actual catalytic base is highly variable in Nudix enzymes, and has not yet been identified for either of these two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shen et al., 2003</xref>). However, when introduced into NUDT9H, catalytic site mutations that abolish, or greatly diminish, ADPRase activity of NUDT9 failed to affect the rates of pore gating, and TRPM2 channels were also readily gated by a non-hydrolyzable ADPR analog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tóth et al., 2014</xref>). These findings ruled out a direct link between the ADPRase cycle and gating of the TRPM2 channel pore itself, but did not eliminate the possibility of some, as yet unidentified, role for this catalytic function. The present work therefore addressed the putative enzymatic activity itself.</p><p>To circumvent the problem of low solubility of NUDT9H we sought to establish a chimeric model which resembles the native protein sequence as closely as possible. The region responsible for the low solubility of NUDT9H could be confined to its ~60 C-terminal residues: replacing the entire span (Chi3S), or even just the downstream half (Chi4S) of this C-terminal segment with homologous NUDT9 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) was sufficient to confer solubility upon NUDT9H. The C-terminus of NUDT9 is surface exposed ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shen et al., 2003</xref>]; PDB ID: 1Q33; 1QVJ), free to interact with other protein molecule(s), and presumably the same is true for the C-termini of the chimeras and NUDT9H. Therefore, among other reasons, the cumulative charge of the C-terminus may play an important role in determining their aggregation propensity during expression in the bacterial cytoplasm (at around neutral pH). The theoretical total charges of the ~60–70 C-terminal residues of our constructs (ignoring affinity tags) are −8.1 (NUDT9, Chi2 and Chi3), +0.9 (NUDT9H), −2.9 (Chi4) at pH 7.0. It is thus possible that the relative charge-neutrality of the C-terminus of NUDT9H contributes to its insolubility.</p><p>Such low solubility, when expressed in isolation, for a cytoplasmic protein domain like NUDT9H – in striking contrast to its very soluble mitochondrial homologue – is somewhat unexpected. A likely explanation is that NUDT9H natively exists in the context of tetrameric TRPM2, and must share an interface with other channel regions which transduces ligand binding into pore opening. Whether NUDT9H interacts with the large N-terminal domain of the channel, with the cytosolic loops connecting the transmembrane helices, and/or with other NUDT9H domains remains to be elucidated, but it is tempting to speculate that the C-terminal ~20% of NUDT9H sequence might be directly involved in such interactions. Consistent with such an interpretation, incremental replacement of NUDT9H segments with corresponding NUDT9 sequences (TRPM2(-NUDT9H) → TRPM2-Chi4 → TRPM2-Chi3 → TRPM2-Chi2) causes a parallel graded decrease in the stability of the open-channel state, as reflected by a speeding of channel closure upon ADPR removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; <italic>gray</italic> → <italic>red</italic> → <italic>dark blue</italic> → <italic>light blue bars</italic>).</p><p>NUDT9, the soluble chimeric constructs generated by sequence swapping, and even some NUDT9H could be purified and tested for enzymatic activity. These experiments revealed a distinct pattern directly correlated with the origin of the <italic>Nudix</italic> box in each protein: constructs possessing the <italic>Nudix</italic> box of NUDT9 (NUDT9 and Chi2) were active ADPR hydrolases, whereas those containing the <italic>Nudix</italic> box of NUDT9H (Chi3S, Chi4S and NUDT9H) were inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Notably, our soluble chimeric model most similar to the native NUDT9H sequence, Chi4S, is ~90% identical to NUDT9H (including the <italic>Nudix</italic> box region) and clearly capable of ligand binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8C–D</xref>), but did not exhibit any sign of enzymatic activity under the various reaction conditions tested.</p><p>Previous studies reported a weak enzymatic activity for the isolated NUDT9H domain of TRPM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2003</xref>). While we did also detect slow accumulation of AMP when Chi3S, Chi4S, or NUDT9H was incubated with ADPR under alkaline conditions, we fully attribute those results to inherent instability of ADPR at basic pH. Indeed, we observed gradual accumulation of AMP even in protein-free samples of ADPR incubated in alkaline buffers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and, assuming an exponential decay time course, estimated a time constant of ~100 hr for spontaneous ADPR hydrolysis at 25°C and pH 8.5. Spontaneous degradation of ADPR at basic pH (~0.3% and ~2% within 20 min and 2 hr, respectively, at 25°C and pH 8.5; ~1% within 30 min at 37°C and pH 9 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>]) did not significantly distort the results of the 20- to 30-min enzyme kinetics measurements for the active constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>), but fully accounted for the weak AMP signals for our inactive constructs observed after 2-hr incubations using TLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>, <italic>lanes 3 and 6</italic>), or already after 30-min incubations using the more sensitive P<sub>i</sub> detection assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>): this phenomenon fully explains the reported weak activity of NUDT9H at 37°C and pH 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2003</xref>). Of note, spontaneous degradation affects enzymatic ADPR hydrolysis assays only at basic, but not at neutral or slightly acidic pH at which ADPR is inherently stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>, lanes 1, 2, 4, 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The catalytic properties of our two enzymatically active recombinant proteins (NUDT9 and Chi2) were largely similar. NUDT9 appeared slightly faster than Chi2, which may be attributed either to slight structural mismatch between ‘foreign’ Cap and Core segments in Chi2, or to errors in estimating their concentrations. Both enzymes exhibited a modest but clear pH-dependence, with a preference towards basic pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Perhaps NUDT9, which natively resides in mitochondria, might have adapted to this environment, and Chi2, which contains ~60% of the NUDT9 sequence (the entire Core subdomain), presumably shares most of its preferences. In contrast, the cytosolic NUDT9H domain of plasma-membrane resident TRPM2 faces the neutral pH of the cytosol. For this reason, care was taken to test the NUDT9H-like proteins (Chi3S, Chi4S and NUDT9H) in buffers at different pH values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p><p>When introduced into full-length TRPM2 in place of the native NUDT9H domain, chimeric constructs Chi2, Chi3 and Chi4 supported ADPR-induced channel activity which resembled that of intact TRPM2 channels, except for a somewhat reduced apparent affinity of TRPM2-Chi2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). One possible reason for this small defect is that the other constructs contain catalytically inactive <italic>Nudix</italic> domains, whereas ADPR hydrolysis by Chi2 might reduce fractional saturation of this domain at low (~1 μM) ADPR concentrations. Alternatively, the significantly larger portion of non-native (i.e. NUDT9-like) sequence in Chi2 (the entire Core subdomain) might compromise formation of the proper interface responsible for transducing ligand binding into channel opening. Nevertheless, all full-length chimeric TRPM2 constructs formed functional channels, demonstrating that NUDT9/NUDT9H chimeric domains are properly folded and competent to bind ADPR and gate the channel. Importantly, TRPM2-Chi4 is almost identical in sequence to the background T5L-TRPM2, its channel behaviour is almost indistinguishable from that of T5L-TRPM2, and we have clearly shown that its isolated ligand-binding domain (Chi4S) – although capable of binding an ADPR analog with a similar affinity as the intact NUDT9H domain of a full-length TRPM2 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) – is not catalytically active. Based on these results, we conclude that the NUDT9H domain of TRPM2 is not an ADPR hydrolase, and that TRPM2 is a simple ligand-gated channel, not a 'chanzyme', despite the fact that its ligand binding domain is clearly a member of the family of Nudix enzymes. One potential advantage of its broken enzymatic activity might be increased ligand occupancy at low ADPR concentrations. The Chi4S construct developed here is a convenient soluble model of NUDT9H which might be useful for future structural and biochemical studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>Except for Chimera 2 (Chi2), all recombinant proteins for bacterial expression were synthesized and incorporated into the pJ411 plasmid which bears kanamycin resistance (DNA2.0, Menlo Park, CA, USA).

The NUDT9H domain of TRPM2 was replaced by Chi2A, Chi3 or Chi4 using the native <italic>BlpI</italic>-site upstream of the domain and an <italic>XbaI</italic>-site downstream of the Stop-codon in each chimeric construct. Single-base mutations to generate Stop-codons immediately upstream of the hexahistidine tags of Chi3 and Chi4 were then introduced (QuickChange II, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), yielding TRPM2-Chi3 and TRPM2-Chi4; TRPM2-Chi2 lacked a His-tag because it was derived from Chi2A.</p><p>All constructs were sequence-verified. The TRPM2/pGEMHE plasmids were linearized with <italic>NheI</italic> (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and transcribed in vitro using T7 polymerase; cRNA was stored at −80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The soluble proteins (NUDT9 and Chi2) were expressed and purified as previously described for mitochondrial NUDT9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tóth et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, bacterial cultures were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic and induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) upon reaching OD<sub>600</sub> of ~0.7. After 3 hr of incubation, cells were harvested and lysed with sonication in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.5 with HCl) / 200 mM NaCl. The cleared supernatant was incubated with Ni-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare Hungary, Hungary) for 3 hr under gentle rotation. The resin was then washed with lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mM imidazole, and the protein eluted with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.5 with HCl), 100 mM NaCl, and 400 mM imidazole.</p><p>Chi3S, Chi4S and NUDT9H were little soluble to insoluble when expressed at 37°C, the majority of the proteins ending up in inclusion bodies, but gave tractable (~1–5%) soluble fractions when induced with 0.1 mM IPTG at 25°C overnight. NUDT9H was then purified as NUDT9. Chi3S and Chi4S were purified using Strep-Tactin chromatography following the manufacturer’s instructions (IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany).</p><p>Following affinity chromatography, all proteins were subjected to a gel filtration purification step in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 100 mM NaCl (Superdex 200 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare Hungary). Affinity tags were not removed. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using theoretical molar extinction coefficients (ε<sub>o</sub> ~ 55,000 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> at λ = 280 nm). Protein purity was visually checked with SDS PAGE. Protein identity was confirmed by the band position, the main peak position on the gel filtration profile, and, in the case of Chi4S, also by mass spectrometry (Proteome Factory AG, Berlin, Germany). NUDT9 and Chi2 were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −20°C until used. Chi3S, Chi4S and NUDT9H were kept at 4°C, and immediately used for experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Enzymatic activity assay using thin-layer chromatography (TLC)</title><p>ADPRase activities of mitochondrial NUDT9, NUDT9H, and the purified chimeric constructs (Chi2, Chi3S, Chi4S) were quantitated by densitometric detection of the AMP product on TLC sheets. The 20-μl reaction mixtures contained 0.1, 0.5 or 1 μM purified protein, 10 mM Na-ADPR (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 16 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 50 mM reaction buffer (RB). The reaction buffers used were: 50 mM MES, pH 6.5 with NaOH (RB1); 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.1 with NaOH (RB2); 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5 with HCl (RB3); RB1 + 100 mM NaCl (RB4); RB2 + 100 mM NaCl (RB5), and RB3 + 100 mM NaCl (RB6). For the enzyme kinetics experiments on NUDT9 and Chi2, aliquots from the reaction mixtures were collected at the indicated time points; 3 independent experiments were performed for both proteins and each condition, and data are presented as mean ± SEM. For other experiments, the total incubation time was as indicated in the figures legends. All incubations were at room temperature (~25°C). For TLC, 1-μl aliquots of reaction mixtures were placed on Polygram SIL G/UV254 plates (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), dried and developed in 0.2 M NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> in ethanol:water 7:3 (vol/vol).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The proposed channel-enzyme Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 2 does not possess ADP ribose hydrolase activity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, David E Clapham (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another one is Merritt Maduke (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a Ca-permeable cation channel activated by ADP ribose(ADPR) binding to its C-terminal cytosolic NUDT9-homology (NUDT9H) domain. This domain is homologous to the soluble mitochondrial ADPR pyrophosphatase (ADPRase) NUDT9, but as shown here, does not hydrolyze ADPR. Reported ADPR hydrolysis classified TRPM2 as a channel-enzyme, but insolubility of isolated NUDT9H hampered further study. The authors develop a soluble NUDT9H, by replacing incrementally extended N-terminal portions of NUDT9 with homologous NUDT9H sequence. When expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, chimeras containing up to ~90% NUDT9H sequence remained soluble and were affinity-purified. In ADPRase assays, the conserved Nudix-box sequence of NUDT9 proved essential for activity (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>~4-9s<sup>-1</sup>) – NUDT9H itself did not support catalysis. Replacing NUDT9H in full-length TRPM2 with soluble chimeras retained ADPR-dependent channel gating, confirming functionality of chimeric domains. Based on these results, the authors conclude that the NUDT9H domain of TRPM2 is not an ADPR hydrolase, and that TRPM2 is a simple ligand-gated channel, not a &quot;chanzyme&quot;. The authors speculate that the potential advantage of its broken enzymatic activity might be increased ligand occupancy at low ADPR concentrations.</p><p>This is excellent work, well documented and controlled. This is an outstanding example of careful science well-executed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the experimental results are beautifully presented. However, the conclusion that the purified domains have no activity remains undemonstrated because it has not been shown that these domains are truly soluble and monodispersed. With expression at 37°C, the domains are completely insoluble; with expression at 25°C, only a tiny fraction of the protein is obtained in the soluble fraction. So, one wonders whether the domains are only quasi-stable and prone to micro-aggregation in solution. The authors perform size exclusion chromatography as a purification step, but none of the chromatograms are shown. Do the domains run as monomers or oligomers? Are there significant aggregate peaks in the chromatograms?</p><p>Are the domains monodispersed when re-run on size exclusion chromatography, or are they only quasi-stable? Do the proteins remain monodispersed after concentration for the binding assays? These questions need to be addressed in order for the conclusion that there is no catalytic conclusion to be certain. While the binding assay in principle could confirm that the domains are well behaved, the weak signal observed in the fluorescent binding assay could be due to non-specific effects of aggregated protein on fluorescence rather than to specific binding. Since BSA is a highly soluble protein, it is not a great control in this case. In summary, the chromatograms should be shown and these points discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17600.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Overall, the experimental results are beautifully presented.

Both inactive proteins – Chi4S and NUDT9H – show a main monomeric peak which can be isolated fairly well, and a smaller peak corresponding to a dimer, just as the highly soluble (and active) NUDT9 protein. Higher-stoichiometry aggregates constitute only a minor fraction in each case. Only the fractions corresponding to the monomeric peaks were collected and pooled for further use in functional assays. Thus, lack of catalytic activity for Chi4S and NUDT9H is not due to protein microaggregation in a quasi-stable solution. We have added this information to the Results section which presents high-resolution colorimetric assays on catalytic activities.</p><p><italic>Are the domains monodispersed when re-run on size exclusion chromatography, or are they only quasi-stable?

For the enzymatic assays these preparations were not further concentrated, but rather diluted (to 0.1-1 μM for the TLC-based, and to 5-50 nM for the colorimetric assay). The only assay in which the protein was concentrated following SEC was the fluorescent binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C-D</xref>): here we had to concentrate Chi4S by ~5-fold, to reach a concentration of 100 μM (3.6 mg/ml). Originally we did not re-run the Chi4S protein on SEC following the binding assay, but we have now performed a control experiment to mimic the effect of this concentration step, and show the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>. Chi4S was expressed and purified as before (solid blue SEC elution profile), left overnight at 4<sup>o</sup>C, and then concentrated 5-fold using a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff Vivaspin column (Sartorius). The concentrated protein was then re-run on SEC, and the elution profile (dashed blue profile) again showed a preserved main monomeric peak with a smaller peak corresponding to a dimer. Importantly, larger aggregates did not reappear. This confirms that the signal observed in the fluorescent binding assay is not due to non-specific effects of aggregated protein. We have added this information to the Materials and methods section that describes the binding assay.</p></body></sub-article></article>
