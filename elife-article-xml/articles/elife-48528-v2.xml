However, the bioavailability of iron in the environment is extremely low, and under aerobic conditions iron is found mostly as insoluble hydroxides. The demand for the ionic form of iron by all microorganisms growing in iron-limited conditions has led to the evolution of several efficient iron scavenging strategies. One of the predominant mechanisms by which microbes and fungi acquire iron is through the synthesis and secretion of small, specific high-affinity chelators termed siderophores, which keep iron in a chelated, soluble state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neilands, 1995</xref>). In Gram-negative bacteria, these ferric-siderophore complexes are actively taken up into cells using highly specific TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) situated in the bacterial outer membrane (OM) as well as specific transporters present in the bacterial inner membrane (IM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferguson and Deisenhofer, 2004</xref>). The energy for this uptake process is derived from the proton motive force and relies on the energising complex consisting of TonB/ExbB/ExbD situated in the bacterial IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Celia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Noinaj et al., 2010</xref>). TonB acts as a physical link between the transporters in the OM and the energising complex in the IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jordan et al., 2013</xref>). Siderophore binding facilitates TBDT contact with the C-terminus of TonB through an allosteric mechanism, which exposes the TonB-binding site within TBDT, known as the TonB box, to the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lundrigan and Kadner, 1986</xref>). Association of TBDTs with TonB establishes the main point of contact with ExbB/ExbD and the proton motive force provides the energy needed for the translocation of siderophores through the lumen of the OM barrel. The precise mechanism of this translocation process is not yet fully understood but is thought to involve a mechanical extraction or unfolding of the plug region from within the barrel lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hickman et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, a subclass of TBDTs possesses an N-terminal signalling domain, which regulates gene transcription of target operons, often participating in siderophore uptake and processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enz et al., 2000</xref>). The activation of these signalling cascades is both ligand- and TonB-dependent, however the molecular details of this signalling process and its activation remain highly elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferguson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koebnik, 2005</xref>). It is speculated that the N-terminal pocket of the signalling domain is involved in the interactions with the σ-factor regulator proteins. To date, the crystal structures of the intact TBDT FpvA with the fully-resolved signalling domain suggest that there is a high degree of flexibility at the N-terminal region of the transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brillet et al., 2007</xref>). However the putative site involved in contacting the regulator protein is tucked away beneath the barrel lumen. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium and an opportunistic human pathogen, which is a major cause of hospital-acquired infections in immunocompromised patients. In patients with cystic fibrosis <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lung infections are usually associated with increased mortality rates. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is able to utilise a range of xenosiderophores, that is siderophores produced by other bacteria or fungi in order to scavenge free iron. Such instances of so-called ‘siderophore piracy’ highlight bacterial adaptability and potential for colonising in an extremely broad range of environmental niches. One example of siderophore piracy is the uptake of ferrioxamine B, a hydroxamate siderophore produced by many <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species, by the specific OM transporter FoxA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Llamas et al., 2006</xref>). FoxA belongs to the family of TBDTs (transducers) and is involved in ferrioxamine B transport as well as modulation of transcriptional cascades in the bacterial cell. Ferrioxamine B uptake comes at a relatively low energetic cost, when compared with the production of native siderophores such as pyoverdin and pyochelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dumas et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, when grown in the proximity of <italic>Streptomyces ambofacients</italic>, several <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species do not produce their own siderophores and instead parasitize on the siderophores of their neighbour by expressing the ferrioxamine B transporter, FoxA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galet et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we determined several crystal structures of FoxA from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, in the apo state as well as in complex with the siderophore ferrioxamine B and TonB. Using a hybrid approach combining X-ray crystallography with biophysical interaction studies, we provide insights into TonB-mediated siderophore uptake across the bacterial OM as well as TonB-dependent signalling. Our results indicate that the transporter can exist in several different conformations, and that both substrate- and TonB-binding is required to form a translocation-competent state of the FoxA transporter in a two-step TonB-binding mechanism necessary for transport function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ternary structure of FoxA bound to ferrioxamine B and TonB<sub>Ct</sub></title><p>Active uptake of siderophores such as ferrioxamine B across the outer membrane (OM) relies on the establishment of a physical contact between the specific transporter and inner membrane (IM)-tethered TonB. In order understand the mechanism of complex formation between FoxA and TonB we determined the crystal structure of the ternary complex consisting of FoxA bound to ferrioxamine B and the C-terminal TonB domain (residues 251-340, referred to hereafter as TonB<sub>Ct</sub>). Two complexes were present in the asymmetric unit, with crystal contacts generated through the exposed soluble regions of both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We could resolve almost an entire FoxA molecule including the signalling domain (residues 53-820, with 11 amino acids missing from the N-terminus after the signal peptide) as well as the full TonB<sub>Ct</sub>. We can identify two main modes of contact between FoxA and TonB<sub>Ct</sub>. Similar to the FhuA and BtuB-TonB complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pawelek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shultis et al., 2006</xref>) the primary interaction site between FoxA and TonB<sub>Ct</sub> occurs through β-augmentation with parallel strands forming between residues 332-337 of TonB and residues 142-146 of FoxA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In addition to the observed β-augmentation, the unstructured polypeptide segment upstream of the TonB box (residues 135-141) forms complementary contacts with the surface of TonB molecule mediated by backbone H-bond interactions as well as side-chains Leu<sub>137</sub>, Met<sub>139</sub> and Val<sub>142</sub> located in a small cavity on the surface of TonB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Most of the TBDTs do no harbour this extra binding motif upstream of the TonB box since it would only be present in TBDTs involved in regulating signalling events at the OM via the additional N-terminal domain in the periplasm. The secondary point of contact involves the side chains of residues in the periplasmic loops and barrel interior of FoxA with several residues in the loops of TonB facing the barrel. These contacts are mediated by electrostatic forces between TonB<sub>R271</sub> and FoxA<sub>D352</sub>, and between TonB<sub>R266</sub> and FoxA<sub>D355</sub> as well as a side-chain (FoxA<sub>E316</sub>) to the backbone carbonyl (TonB<sub>S300</sub>) via a hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These contacts provide a secondary site of attachment for the TonB fragment and tether the C-terminal region of TonB to the barrel. This tethering locks the orientation of TonB against the barrel and the membrane plane. An overlay of the two complexes found in the asymmetric unit reveals that TonB<sub>Ct</sub> and the signalling domain are rotated by 9° with respect to the barrel and the membrane plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is evident that TonB<sub>Ct</sub> and the signalling domain experience some degree of flexibility in the distal part of the complex, whereas the proximal part of the complex is most likely stabilised by the contacts at the secondary site. In the previous structural models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pawelek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shultis et al., 2006</xref>), TonB sits in close proximity to the β-barrel, almost parallel to the putative lipid bilayer plane. In our crystal structure, the TonB fragment is located almost perpendicular to the β-barrel and the membrane plane highlighting the potentially dynamic nature of TBDR-TonB complexes, which has been suggested by recent EPR experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sarver et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Overall, the structure of the ternary FoxA-ferrioxamineB-TonB<sub>Ct</sub> complex presented in this work reveals both the structure of the N-terminal signalling domain as well as a markedly different orientation of the TonB<sub>Ct</sub> relative to the TBDT compared to previously determined ternary structures of FhuA and BtuB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pawelek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shultis et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48528.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Complex formation between ferrioxamine B-bound FoxA and TonB is driven by multiple binding sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the ferrioxamine B-bound FoxA-TonB<sub>Ct</sub> complex.

In this structure a large solvent-exposed lumen faces the extracellular side of the membrane and is filled with solvent molecules. No electron density was present for the last two amino acids of the TonB box region and the N-terminal signalling domain of FoxA (residues 45-143), most likely due to the high flexibility of the linker connecting the plug domain and the signalling domain, as previously observed in the structures of FecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferguson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yue et al., 2003</xref>) and FpvA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brillet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greenwald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wirth et al., 2007</xref>). Inspection of both apo as well as ligand- and TonB<sub>Ct</sub>-bound crystal structures of FoxA revealed that in the apo state the TonB box is predominantly occluded in the interior of the barrel domain. A comparison of the plug domain conformations in both of our FoxA structures indicates that the TonB box must be displaced by approximately 22 Å from the folded plug domain in order to allow for β-augmentation to occur with TonB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48528.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Conformational changes in the plug domain and extracellular loops of FoxA in response to ferrioxamine B and TonB binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The overall fold of apo FoxA consists of a 22-stranded β-barrel lined by the small globular plug domain within the lumen.

Displacement of loops 7 and 8 by approx. 7 Å on the extracellular side of the membrane leads to the closure of the barrel lumen on both sides of the membrane, limiting the access to the barrel lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Mechanistically, this would prevent the dissociation of the siderophore during translocation and opening of the entry channel within the barrel.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Biophysical characterisation of the interactions between FoxA and TonB<sub>Ct</sub></title><p>Previous structural and biochemical investigations into the mechanisms of TBDT activation and substrate uptake have shown that siderophore binding usually leads to an unwinding of either an N-terminal helix or a stretch of polypeptide within the plug domain bearing the TonB box motif. This mechanism of polypeptide unwinding, initiated by concerted small motions throughout the plug, allows the C-terminus of TonB to make contact with the loaded transporter molecule. Moreover, insights into TBDT association with TonB paint a very complex, and often conflicting picture of substrate-dependent transporter activation and TonB binding. One model suggests a constitutively bound TonB-TBDT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2007</xref>), whilst another proposes a cooperative mode of transporter-TonB interactions that is driven by initial substrate capture by the TBDT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cadieux and Kadner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Merianos et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we sought to understand the nature of FoxA-TonB interactions using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to characterise the thermodynamics of FoxA-TonB interactions. For this purpose, we have reconstituted FoxA into MSP1D1 nanodiscs in order to minimise the detergent mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fanucci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mills et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, nanodiscs (ND) provide a lipidic scaffold and alleviate the deleterious effects detergents might have on the conformation of the transporter. Titration of TonB<sub>Ct</sub> into apo FoxA-ND complexes resulted in strong, saturable exothermic heats indicative of protein association. ITC data were fitted to a single binding site model and yielded a K<sub>d</sub> of 111 ± 6 nM. The binding process is enthalpically driven with a large, negative ΔH of -10.1 ± 0.8 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). No binding was observed when TonB<sub>Ct</sub> was titrated into empty nanodiscs. The observation of tight binding between TonB<sub>Ct</sub> and apo FoxA in nanodiscs is in contrast to similar experiments performed with FhuA and TonB<sub>Ct</sub>, for which no binding could be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mills et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate that the presence of the N-terminal domain and the interacting region upstream of the TonB box in FoxA is responsible for the differences in the binding modes between these two transporters.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48528.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Two distinct modes of association between FoxA and TonB as revealed by the thermodynamics of complex formation.</title><p>ITC profiles showing titration of TonB<sub>Ct</sub> (150 μM) into 15 μM apo FoxA nanodisc complexes (<bold>A</bold>) and 15 μM ferrioxamine B-FoxA nanodisc complexes (<bold>B</bold>).

The data were also fitted to a single binding site model. Our ITC experiments showed that in the presence of ferrioxamine B the binding affinity is increased 17-fold yielding a K<sub>d</sub> value of 6.6 ± 1.2 nM. The thermodynamic parameters of the association reaction also differ such that the ΔH value decreases drastically to -18.1 ± 0.9 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> with an entropically unfavourable contribution of TΔS = -6.62 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We speculate that the decrease in the entropy of TonB<sub>Ct</sub> binding in the presence of ferrioxamine B most likely arises from large conformational restrictions of the flexible and highly mobile TonB and signalling domains as well as folding/desolvation events involved in association with TonB<sub>Ct</sub>. The difference in thermodynamics between the two binding reactions also suggests several distinct binding modes between TonB<sub>Ct</sub> and FoxA, which rely on the siderophore capture. The negative entropy is compensated for by a large decrease in the enthalpy of binding, which is driving the association reaction. Our ITC data suggest that in the presence of ferrioxamine B, FoxA is able to form a much tighter complex with TonB<sub>Ct</sub>. Since β-augmentation between the TonB box of FoxA and TonB<sub>Ct</sub> is driven predominantly by hydrogen-bonded interactions, the stark decrease in the enthalpy of binding in our ITC could be explained by the formation of these additional contacts. The increased affinity and drastically reduced enthalpy of association is indicative of a much larger surface area participating in the complex formation process compared with the thermodynamics of apo FoxA-TonB<sub>Ct</sub> complexes. Altogether, the interaction studies presented here strongly support a cooperative mechanism of siderophore-dependent TonB capture by FoxA and that two distinct TonB-binding events can occur at the FoxA transporter.</p><p>To delineate the interactions between FoxA and TonB we generated FoxA variants with truncations in the signalling domain and analysed complex formation using analytical size-exclusion chromatography. Full-length FoxA exhibits three distinct elution profiles corresponding to apo protein, FoxA-TonB<sub>Ct</sub> complex and the ternary complex FoxA-ferrioxamine B-TonB<sub>Ct</sub> confirming our ITC findings of two distinct TonB<sub>Ct</sub>-bound states, with and without the siderophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Deletion of residues 64-130, which correspond to the majority of the signalling domain, yet retaining the sequence upstream of the TonB box observed in our crystal structure, had no effect on the constitutive and cooperative binding of TonB<sub>Ct</sub> to FoxA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, the deletion of residues 64-143, which also include the upstream binding motif of the TonB box, abrogated the constitutive binding of TonB<sub>Ct</sub> to FoxA, whilst retaining the ability to cooperatively form the ternary complex between FoxA, ferrioxamine B and TonB<sub>Ct</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In combination with our structure of the ternary complex, we propose a two-step binding mechanism: The constitutive mode of TonB<sub>Ct</sub> binding is mediated by the stretch of amino acids located upstream of the TonB box, and the interaction with ferrioxamine B would result in the allosteric release of the TonB box from within the barrel interior allowing the formation of a very tight complex between ferrioxamine B-bound FoxA and TonB, which is necessary for downstream translocation events leading to siderophore uptake.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Loop movements establish additional contacts with the bound siderophore</title><p>Siderophore capture by a specific TBDT is an integral part of establishing the necessary contacts with the TonB/ExbB/ExbD complex, which provides the energy for substrate translocation. As we have demonstrated, the full engagement of TonB by FoxA is dependent on the presence of ferrioxamine B. To understand how FoxA interacts with its substrate ferrioxamine B, we co-crystallised and determined the structure of FoxA with ferrioxamine B in absence of TonB<sub>Ct</sub> and compared this structure with apo FoxA as well as the ternary complex. Our ferrioxamine B–bound structures of FoxA revealed a common siderophore binding mode similar to other TBDTs. The electron density for the bound ferrioxamine B in both structures allowed us to unambiguously model the conformation of the ligand as judged by the Polder omit maps. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

Such strong association is also observed in other widely studied TBDT-siderophore complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mislin et al., 2006</xref>) and reflects the highly specific nature of these transporters at capturing extremely scarce siderophore-iron chelates from the extracellular milieu. Our crystal structures of apo FoxA and the ferrioxamine B-bound states revealed only minor conformational perturbations of the extracellular loops and the periplasmic side of the plug domain in FoxA upon binding with the siderophore. However, when ligand-loaded, FoxA association with TonB<sub>Ct</sub> leads to the closure of the extracellular loops, shielding the bound siderophore inside the barrel. It is worth mentioning that the ability of FoxA to bind ferrioxamine B is unaffected by the bound TonB<sub>Ct</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), meaning that the movement of the loops is not initiated by the binding of TonB to the apo state of the transporter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our structures enable us to postulate a mechanistic model for the TonB-mediated uptake of ferrioxamine B by the TBDT FoxA. FoxA can sequester free ferrioxamine B from solution and remain siderophore-bound until it is able to engage with TonB for transport of the siderophore inside the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, left half). Likewise, FoxA can form a constitutive complex with TonB, even in the absence of ferrioxamine B. Ferrioxamine B binding to this constitutive state of FoxA-TonB would then lead to the ternary high-affinity complex with TonB via β-augmentation and initiate a cascade of structural re-arrangements within the plug domain to allow for the passage of the substrate through the barrel lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, right panel).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48528.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism of TonB-mediated ferrioxamine B uptake via the FoxA transporter.</title><p>Our studies suggest that FoxA can exist in several states depending on the abundance of ferrioxamine B in the environment and the occupancy of TonB by other TBDRs. FoxA is able to interact with ferrioxamine B or engage with TonB with near-equal affinity (K<sub>d</sub>≈100 nM) in a constitutive fashion. The presence of ferrioxamine B, however, is necessary for the expulsion of the TonB box into the periplasm and the formation of the full, translocation-competent ternary complex through β-augmentation (K<sub>d</sub>≈6–10 nM). This very high-affinity interaction provides the necessary contacts in the complex for subsequent steps of the plug domain re-modelling or expulsion, necessary for siderophore translocation through the lumen of the barrel.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48528-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Previous studies into ferrioxamine B uptake suggested that the expression levels of FoxA, compared with other TBDTs like FpvA and FptA, are non-detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Llamas et al., 2006</xref>). Yet, in the presence of ferrioxamine B and under iron-limiting conditions the levels of FoxA in the OM reach those of other TBDTs, which can reach 100-fold the TonB concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klebba, 2003</xref>). This fact indicates that the “left half” of the proposed mechanism of TonB-mediated ferrioxamine B uptake via the FoxA transporter as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> might be the dominating path in vivo under iron-limiting conditions and in the presence of ferrioxamine B. This path is also favoured by the significantly higher affinity of TonB<sub>Ct</sub> towards “activated” FoxA/FoaB.</p><p>The physiological function for the formation of a constitutive FoxA-TonB complex in the absence of ferrioxamine B is currently unclear, but may relate to the basal detection of environmental ferrioxamine B. This would subsequently amplify the <italic>fox</italic> operon leading to efficient uptake of ferrioxamine B from the environment, with little cost of native siderophore production.</p><p>Our structure also offers potential insight into signal transduction necessary for the regulation of transcription of the FoxA operon. The signalling domain, visible in the ternary complex, is exposed N-terminally to the periplasmic space, allowing it to engage with the sigma factor regulator protein FoxR situated in the IM.

Briefly, FoxA was mixed with purified MSP1D1 and POPC lipids in 1:2:70 ratio and biobeads were added to initiate the nanodisc assembly. After approximately 4-5 hours, the mixture was concentrated and purified by gel size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex S200 10/300 column. All proteins were extensively dialysed against 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 overnight. 15 μM FoxA or FoxA-FoaB incorporated into MSP1D1 nanodiscs were loaded into the ITC cell, 150 μM TonB<sub>Ct</sub> was placed in the syringe. For the “pre-loaded” FoxA-FoaB complex, FoxA in nanodiscs was dialyzed against 1 mM FoaB. All binding reactions were measured at 26 °C. TonB<sub>Ct</sub> was also titrated against empty nanodiscs as a control. Heat of dilution was obtained by titrating TonB<sub>Ct</sub> into the dialysis buffer and subtracted from all subsequent measurements. Heats of binding for all the reactions were integrated using Microcal Origin software and all the data were fitted to a single-site binding model. All titrations were performed as triplicates and errors are reported as standard deviations (SD).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments</title><p>All fluorescence measurements were performed using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer. FoxA purified in nonyl glucopyranoside (NG) was diluted to 100 nM in a 3 ml quartz cuvette. Trp fluorescence was excited at 280 nm and emission spectra were recorded from 310-420 nm. Ferrioxamine B, diluted in the same buffer as FoxA, was titrated into the cuvette until saturation in fluorescence quenching was reached. Control experiments with buffer were performed to account for dilution effects on Trp fluorescence. Buffer conditions were 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 0.4% NG. Curves were plotted and analysed in GraphPad Prism 7. The binding curve was fitted to a single-site binding model. Measurements were performed as triplicates.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the staff at beamlines P13 and P14 (EMBL, Hamburg), BL14.1 (BESSY, Berlin) and ID30B (ESRF, Grenoble) and thank members of the Tidow lab for helpful discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Volker Dötsch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Wiener (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a solid structural biological and biophysical manuscript on the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> outer membrane (OM) TonB-dependent transporter FoxA, which will be of great interest to those who work on this still-enigmatic class of active transport membrane proteins. These transporters utilize the pmf of the inner/plasma membrane to transport substrates across the outer membrane by using the TonB protein to couple to the ExbB/ExbD motor complex in the plasma membrane. The most striking structural result, compared to what already exists in the literature, is the crystal structure of the ternary complex of FoxA/ferrioxamineB/TonB C-terminal domain. In contrast to the two previous transporter/substrate/TonB complex structures, FoxA contains an N-terminal extension which plays a role in transcriptional regulation of siderophore synthesis. In these previous structures (FhuA and BtuB), the β-sheet of TonB is approximately perpendicular to the β-strands of the transporter barrel, and interacting with both the transporter's &quot;Ton box&quot; and the β-barrel. In contrast, in the FoxA ternary complex, the TonB β-sheet is approximately parallel to the strands of the β-barrel, &quot;pulled away&quot; from the barrel, and interacting with the transporter's Ton-box and residues upstream of the Ton-box, in the linker region between Ton-box and N-terminal extension. This &quot;linker interaction&quot; has not been previously observed structurally. Additional biophysical experiments, primarily ITC but also (intrinsic) fluorescence quenching, as well as SEC of various modified/truncated constructs, indicate that TonB's affinity for FoxA increases almost 20-fold with substrate (ferrioxamineB) bound to FoxA.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) How do these results bear upon the functional mechanism in the bacteria? Is the statement that &quot;The FoxA transporter can form a constitutive complex with TonB, even in the absence of ferrioxoamine B&quot; necessarily true in vivo? This depends on relative concentrations of TonB, FoxA, and &quot;competition&quot; for TonB by the multiple other TonB-dependent transporters present in the OM.

Regarding the relative concentrations of TonB and FoxA, it is known that FoxA expression could only be observed under iron-restricted conditions in the presence of ferrioxamine B (Llamas et al., 2006). As the FoxA gene contains a Fur box in its promoter region, the expression of FoxA is most likely repressed via regulation by the Fur repressor protein under iron-rich conditions (Llamas et al., 2006). Thus, under resting conditions the TonB concentration should always dominate over the FoxA levels.</p><p>On the other hand, if FoxA gets upregulated via a signaling cascade involving binding of ferrioxamine B to FoxA, signal transmission to FoxR (anti-sigma factor) and increased activity of FoxI (sigma factor), its total concentration (like that of many other TBDT) can reach 100-fold of that of TonB (Klebba, 2003). This results in two populations of TBDT in the outer membrane: active transporters associated with TonB and inactive transporters unassociated with it (Newton, Trinh, and Klebba, 2010, <underline>J Biol Chem</underline>). Whether the “activated” ferrioxamine B-bound FoxA then indeed binds to TonB depends on the relative affinities of TonB to the different TBDT (which seem to be very similar) and their expression levels. In the presence of ferrioxamine B, the production of other siderophores is downregulated (Galet et al., 2015), which would result in fewer “active” TBDTs other than FoxA and thus reduced competition by TonB-binding to other TBDTs.</p><p>We have now revised the manuscript and in particular the conclusion section to discuss these aspects in more details. Given the above-mentioned facts, the “left half” of the proposed mechanism of TonB-mediated ferrioxamine B uptake via the FoxA transporter as shown in Figure 5 might be the dominating path in vivo under iron-limiting conditions and in the presence of ferrioxamine B. This path is also favored by the significantly higher affinity of TonB<sub>Ct</sub> to “activated” FoxA/FoaB (compared to all other affinities along the reaction circle).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Since TonB binds to apo FoxA with ~100nM K<sub>d</sub>, were any crystallization experiments attempted with this binary complex?</p></disp-quote><p>We have indeed tried very hard to crystallize the binary FoxA/TonB<sub>Ct</sub>-complex as this would be the last missing puzzle piece in the variety of structural states adopted by FoxA during TonB-mediated ferrioxamine B uptake. Unfortunately, despite very pure and stable samples, we never obtained any crystals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The error propagation in the ITC experiments is not clear. For example, how can a 75% fractional error in K<sub>d</sub> lead to only a 2% fractional error in ΔH (and no stated error for TΔS)? What was the number of replicates?</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous version of the manuscript, the reported errors were fitting errors for a single measurement each, and thus quite large. We have now repeated all measurements to obtain triplicates and report the errors as standard deviations (SD) obtained from averaging K<sub>a</sub>-values and converting them to K<sub>d</sub>-values with error propagation. Errors for all other thermodynamic parameters are also given as SD now and included in Table 2 in Supplementary file 1. We have included the information about number of replicates and error propagation in the Materials and methods section now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Likewise, errors are missing for the Trp quenching experiments. This should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we have now performed all binding experiments in triplicates and reported the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) as average ± SD. For the Trp quenching experiments shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, this results in a K<sub>d</sub> of 100 ± 10 nM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For ITC determination of TonB binding to FoxA/ferrioxamineB, FoxA appears to have been &quot;pre-loaded&quot; with ferrioxamine B. Please provide more information on how this was done, and how estimated occupancy could affect the observed results. For example, given an ITC determination of ferrioxamine K<sub>d</sub> for FoxA of 180 +/- 140 nM (78% fractional error), a 1:1 complex of FoxA:ferrioxamineB at 15uM will be ~90% occupancy, so the determined thermodynamic parameters are a combination of +/- substrate-bound FoxA.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. For the ITC titration of TonB into FoxA/FoaB, we “pre-loaded” FoxA with ferrioxamine B by dialyzing FoxA in nanodiscs against 1 mM (excess) FoaB. We have added this information to the Materials and methods section now.</p><p>Given a K<sub>d</sub> of 100-200 nM for the binding of FoaB to FoxA (from fluorescence or ITC measurements, respectively) this excess of FoaB during the “pre-formation” of the FoxA/FoaB complex ensures that &gt; 99.9% of FoxA is substrate-bound. This enables a clear distinction of binding parameters between binding of TonB to apo FoxA vs. TonB-binding to the FoxA/FoaB complex.</p><p>The errors of all ITC measurements have been updated according to our new triplicate repeat measurements (see Table 2 in Supplementary file 1). Initially, we reported fitting errors of single experiments. Now we report SD errors from triplicate titrations, which result in much lower fractional errors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The term &quot;novel insights&quot; should be eliminated from the title (and elsewhere in the text).

We have changed the title to “Ternary structure of the outer membrane transporter FoxA with resolved signaling domain provides insights into TonB-mediated siderophore uptake”. This title now puts further emphasis on the fact that the structure presented in this manuscript is the first ternary structure of a TBDT including a signalling domain.</p><p>This aspect as well as the different orientation of the TonB<sub>Ct</sub> (compared to previous studies) has also been emphasized in the Results section:</p><p>“Overall, the structure of the ternary FoxA-ferrioxamineB-TonB<sub>Ct</sub> complex presented in this work reveals both the structure of the N-terminal signalling domain as well as a markedly different orientation of the TonB<sub>Ct</sub> relative to the TBDT compared to previously determined ternary structures of FhuA and BtuB (Pawelek, Croteau et al., 2006, Shultis, Purdy et al., 2006).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
