<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of 50 papers in the field of cancer biology published between 2010 and 2012. This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘Discovery and Preclinical Validation of Drug Indications Using Compendia of Public Gene Expression Data’ by Sirota et al., published in <italic>Science Translational Medicine</italic> in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Sirota et al., 2011</xref>). The key experiments being replicated include Figure 4C and D and Supplemental Figure 1. In these figures, Sirota and colleagues. tested a proof of concept experiment validating their prediction that cimetidine, a histamine-2 (H2) receptor agonist commonly used to treat peptic ulcers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Kubecova et al., 2011</xref>), would be effective against lung adenocarcinoma (Figure 4C and D). As a control they also tested the effects of cimetidine against renal carcinoma, for which it was not predicted to be efficacious (Supplemental Figure 1).

They compared data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)—which they used to determine gene expression signatures of diseases—to data from the Connectivity Map, which tracks the changes in mRNA expression caused by 164 drugs. By comparing these two mRNA expression sets, Sirota and colleagues created a similarity score to describe how similar the changes in mRNA expression were between each drug and each disease. They theorized that a similarity score close to −1 (exactly opposite signatures) might indicate that the drug could treat the disease.</p><p>In Figure 4C and D, Sirota and colleagues directly test their hypothesis by examining the effects of cimetidine, an H2 receptor blocker commonly used to treat gastric ulcers by reducing the production of stomach acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Kubecova et al., 2011</xref>), on xenograft transplanted A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Mice treated with cimetidine showed a dose-dependent reduction in tumor size after 12 days of treatment. In Supplemental Figure 1, they also treated ACHN renal carcinoma cells with cimetidine, although cimetidine was not predicted to treat this cancer line. They observed no effect of cimetidine on the growth of this cancer cell line. These experiments will be replicated in Protocol 1. However, the conclusions that can be drawn from these experiments are limited by the fact that only a single cell line was tested with only a single drug.</p><p>To date, no direct replication of the experiments presented in Sirota and colleagues' Figure 4C and D or Supplemental Figure 1 has been reported. However, Stoyanov and colleagues did examine the effect of cimetidine on growth of A459 cells activated with histamine and reported that cimetidine did reduce proliferation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Stoyanov et al., 2012</xref>). An exploratory analysis of a cohort of diabetic patients demonstrated a decreased risk of developing lung cancer, specifically adenocarcinoma, in patients who took over-the-counter H2 receptor blockers, including cimetidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, all protocol information was derived from the original paper, references from the original paper, or information obtained directly from the authors.

Tumor growth is then assessed during 11 days of cimetidine treatment. Sirota and colleagues designed this experiment to test their predictions that A549 cells would be susceptible to cimetidine treatment while ACHN cells would not. Treatment with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone will serve as the negative control, while treatment with the lung adenocarcinoma standard drug doxorubicin will serve as the positive control.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Sampling</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This experiment will use at least 12 mice per group for a final power of 82.4%.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>See ‘Power calculations’ for details.</p></list-item></list></list-item><list-item><p>The experiment contains five cohorts total:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>A549 lung adenocarcinoma xenografts:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>a.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Stylianos Antonarakis (Senior editor), Chi Dang (Reviewing editor), and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a biostatistician.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, the authors propose a study to reproduce the findings reported in Figure 4C/D and Supplementary Figure 1 from a previously published manuscript (Sirota et al. Sci Trans Med, 2010), which aimed at assessing the ability to predict drug repurposing opportunities based on connectivity map data analysis. Specifically, the previous Sci Trans Med paper reports that cimetidine, a histamine-2 (H2) receptor agonist commonly used to treat peptic ulcers, can diminish lung cancer tumorigenesis in vivo. There are several key concerns about the design of the study. The first concern is about the duration of the experiment and statistical analysis, and the second about conclusions drawn from using only one lung cancer cell line.</p><p>1) At the beginning of the Materials and methods section: The authors plan to follow the mice for 11 days instead of 12 days. Is there a good reason to follow the mice one day short? In addition, the experiment contains five cohorts. Among the five cohorts, cohort 2 only has 5 mice while the other 4 cohorts have 14 mice. Please justify.</p><p>2) Power calculation was based on <italic>t</italic>-test. It is suggested that the authors use two-tailed unequal variance <italic>t</italic>-test if normality is not violated or the use of Wilcoxon rank-sum test if normality is violated. The authors propose the use of two-way ANOVA followed by <italic>t</italic>-test for analyzing tumor weight data (in the subsection headed “Confirmatory analysis plan”). Please make sure that the data do not violate the assumptions of ANOVA: normality and homoscedasiticity. If the data do not fit the assumptions well enough, please try to find a data transformation that makes them fit. If this doesn't work, please apply a nonparametric counterpart of ANOVA such as Kruskal–Wallis test. In addition, I suggest the use of contrast within the ANOVA framework instead of <italic>t</italic>-test if the assumptions of ANOVA are met.</p><p>3) To compare growth curves of tumors, the authors propose ANCOVA followed by Bonferroni corrected <italic>t</italic>-test. Please make sure that the data do not violate the assumptions of ANCOVA and perform transformation or use non-parametric ANCOVA if needed.</p><p>4) For the additional comparison of PBS-treated A459 tumors to Doxorubicin treated tumors (in the subsection headed “Confirmatory analysis plan” and in the subsection headed “Test family”), I suggest the use of two-tailed unequal variance <italic>t</italic>-test instead of <italic>t</italic>-test if normality is not violated or the use of Wilcoxon rank-sum test if normality is violated.</p><p>5) Although the reproducibility project is aimed toward reproducing previously published results, the reviewers would like for the authors to address the limitation of drawing conclusions for the use of only one cell line, A549. Specifically, activity of drugs in cell lines and xenografts is generally highly idiosyncratic. As a result, most journals require that any in vitro and in vivo experiments are replicated in multiple cell lines and in vivo models.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06847.003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) At the beginning of the Materials and methods section: The authors plan to follow the mice for 11 days instead of 12 days.

We interpreted this to mean that the original authors counted Day 0 as one of the days of monitoring; including Day 0 accounts for the 12 days of monitoring mentioned by the authors and reconciles that statement with the 11 days of data displayed in Figure 4D and Supplemental Figure 1.</p><p>For budgetary and ethical reasons, we wished to minimize the number of animals required for these experiments. Thus, we did not use equal sample sizes for the additional positive control (doxorubicin) treatment group when performing our power calculations. These calculations demonstrated that we could use 3 mice in the control group and still achieve 80% power to detect the original data’s effect size. The main aim of the experiment is to test the effect of vehicle (PBS) treatment compared to experimental (cimetidine) treatment, which includes an equal number of mice in each cohort. Considering the unbalanced nature of this design we will be performing a planned comparison between the PBS and doxorubicin outside the framework of the ANOVA, however, the four cohorts that are the main aim of the experiment are analyzed within the balanced ANOVA framework.</p><p><italic>2) Power calculation was based on</italic> t<italic>-test.

The original data was not shared, so instead summary statistics estimated from the graph presented in Figure 4C and Supplemental Figure 1 were used. This limits what we can ascertain from the original data. We recalculated the samples sizes using a Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test instead of a Student’s. The sample size we have planned is still sufficient. This is also true for the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We plan to use the contrast within the ANOVA framework if the assumptions are met, with the exception of the doxorubicin cohort, which will be performed outside the framework because of the unbalanced design.</p><p><italic>3) To compare growth curves of tumors, the authors propose ANCOVA followed by Bonferroni corrected</italic> t<italic>-tests.

We have added a sentence addressing this point to the Introduction. We will also include this point in the Discussion section of the Replication Study that will be published once the replication data has been generated. We agree the use of one model limits the overall conclusions that can be drawn. This project focuses on understanding if the effects drawn from a single model can be reproduced. While this does not speak to the robustness of the effect, such as can be inferred through multiple models/approaches, it does provide a mechanism to examine the extent to which an effect with a given model can be observed again. We will also limit the conclusions that can be drawn to only this model.</p></body></sub-article></article>
