Lipid droplet (LD) accumulation is a hallmark of hypoxic cancer cells, yet how LDs form and function during hypoxia remains poorly understood. Herein, we report that in various cancer cells upon oxygen deprivation, HIF-1 activation down-modulates LD catabolism mediated by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the key enzyme for intracellular lipolysis. Proteomics and functional analyses identified hypoxia-inducible gene 2 (HIG2), a HIF-1 target, as a new inhibitor of ATGL. Knockout of HIG2 enhanced LD breakdown and fatty acid (FA) oxidation, leading to increased ROS production and apoptosis in hypoxic cancer cells as well as impaired growth of tumor xenografts. All of these effects were reversed by co-ablation of ATGL. Thus, by inhibiting ATGL, HIG2 acts downstream of HIF-1 to sequester FAs in LDs away from the mitochondrial pathways for oxidation and ROS generation, thereby sustaining cancer cell survival in hypoxia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lipid droplet</kwd><kwd>lipolysis</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>cancer metabolism</kwd><kwd>fatty acid oxidation</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-17-1-0546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Thai H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK089178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK109096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The survival and growth of solid tumor cells in hypoxia is dependent on fatty acid storage in triglyceride lipid droplets promoted by HIG2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are key organelles responsible for storing cellular surplus of fatty acids (FAs) in esterified forms such as triglycerides (TGs) and sterol esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilfling et al., 2014</xref>). While TG-LDs likely form through de novo synthesis of TGs as a lens within the ER bilayer, TG catabolism/lipolysis is catalyzed by LD-localized adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zechner et al., 2012</xref>). ATGL is the rate-limiting intracellular TG hydrolase in various cell and tissue types, and its activity in vivo is modulated by coactivator Comparative Gene Identification 58 (CGI-58) and inhibitor G0/G1 Switch Gene 2 (G0S2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lass et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). The enzymatic action of ATGL channels hydrolyzed FAs to mitochondria for Î²-oxidation as well as to the synthesis of lipid ligands for PPARÎ±, whose activation in turn leads to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and function. In normal oxidative cell types such as hepatocytes, brown adipocytes and cardiomyocytes, loss of ATGL is known to cause accumulation of TG-LDs and impairment of mitochondrial oxidative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmadian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haemmerle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ong et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recently, emerging evidence also points to a novel tumor suppressive role for ATGL. For example, whole-body ablation of ATGL in mice induces spontaneous pulmonary neoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Zoughbi et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, adipose-specific knockout of ATGL together with HSL causes liposarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), and intestine-specific disruption of the ATGL co-activator CGI-58 promotes colorectal tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ou et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, these new findings implicate the possibility that inhibition of ATGL-mediated lipolysis may facilitate cancer development. However, the pathophysiological context and the molecular pathways that regulate ATGL in cancer are still unknown.</p><p>During the growth of solid tumors, hypoxic regions often arise when the rate of tumor cell proliferation exceeds that of angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jain, 1988</xref>). Hypoxia is a potent microenvironmental factor promoting aggressive malignancy, and is known for its association with poor survival in a variety of tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Masson and Ratcliffe, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rankin and Giaccia, 2016</xref>). In response to oxygen deprivation, hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) mediate multiple protective mechanisms, which together act to maintain oxygen homeostasis through reducing oxidative metabolism and oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gordan and Simon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Papandreou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rankin and Giaccia, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Semenza, 2010</xref>).</p><p>To date, the best-characterized metabolic adaptation is the HIF-1-mediated switch from glucose oxidation to glycolysis for energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Masson and Ratcliffe, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nakazawa et al., 2016</xref>). In comparison, little is known regarding the regulation of intracellular fatty acid (FA) availability and oxidation in hypoxic cancer cells. Since enhanced fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and hypoxia both promote mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bleier and DrÃ¶se, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guzy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">SchÃ¶nfeld and Wojtczak, 2008</xref>), one conceivable mechanism for hypoxic cells to prevent oxidative stress is to channel free FAs to TG-LDs for storage. Indeed, increased accumulation of TG-LDs is now being recognized as a hallmark of hypoxic cancer cells of various origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koizume and Miyagi, 2016</xref>). Evidence derived from studies of cancer, glial and neural stem cells further implies that the capacity to accumulate LDs is positively linked to the ability of cells to survive oxidative stress in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bensaad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). However, establishing a definitive relationship would require a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern hypoxia-induced LD formation.</p><p>In the present study, we have obtained compelling evidence to show that hypoxia causes profound inhibition of ATGL-mediated lipolysis in cancer cells. By using an unbiased proteomics screen and functional analyses, we identified a small protein encoded by Hypoxia-Inducible Gene 2 (HIG2) as a novel endogenous inhibitor of ATGL and as being solely responsible for mediating lipolytic inhibition in hypoxia. Our results further demonstrate that through inhibiting ATGL and mitochondrial FA oxidation, HIG2 acts downstream of HIF-1 to promote LD accumulation, attenuate ROS production, and enhance cancer cell survival in hypoxia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intracellular lipolysis is reduced in hypoxic cancer cells</title><p>To determine whether lipolytic changes contribute to LD accumulation in hypoxia, we measured free FA release as an index of intracellular lipolysis in various human colorectal cancer (CRC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines under different oxygenated conditions. In ACHN (RCC), Caki-1 (RCC), DLD-1 (CRC) and HCT116 (CRC) cells, a 24 hr hypoxic treatment (0.5% O<sub>2</sub>) resulted in release of significantly lower levels of FA (2.5â3-fold) relative to the normoxic condition (20% O<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Following resolution of co-immunoprecipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), Mass Spectrometry analysis identified one potential ATGL-binding partner as HIG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), a 63-amino acid (~7 kDa) protein encoded by the Hypoxia Inducible Lipid Droplet Associated (Hilpda) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gimm et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, successive sequence alignment revealed that HIG2 contains a hydrophobic domain (HD) highly similar to the ATGL inhibitory domain of G0S2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cerk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), raising the possibility of HIG2 being a novel ATGL inhibitor. Immunoblotting analysis provided the first piece of evidence that verified coimmunoprecipitation of ATGL with endogenous HIG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The interaction between ATGL and HIG2 was further confirmed in HeLa cells (a human UCC cell line), when the two proteins were coexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Deletion of LY(V/L)LG (Î7â11), a motif conserved between the HDs of HIG2 and G0S2, completely eliminated the ability of HIG2 to bind ATGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

In cells from the control clones of all four cell lines, hypoxia dramatically induced HIG2 expression along with TG deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1AâF</xref>). While deletion of HIG2 mildly decreased the low levels of TG in normoxia, the ability to accumulate TG in hypoxia was uniformly lost in cells from the HIG2 knockout (KO) clones generated by using two independent gRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1CâF</xref>). Strikingly, co-disruption of ATGL was able to restore hypoxia-induced TG and LD accumulation in HIG2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4AâC</xref>). Similar effect was achieved in the HIG2-deficient HCT116 cells by the overexpression of wild type HIG2 but not HIG2Î7â11, the mutant disabled in ATGL interaction and inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Additionally, deletion of HIG2 alone in hypoxic cells led to a 7âfold increase in the lipolytic rate, which was completely reversed upon co-deletion of ATGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Taken together, these results provide proof that HIG2 acts to enhance intracellular TG levels through inhibiting ATGL-catalyzed lipolysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31132.005</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Lipolytic inhibition by HIG2 causes TG accumulation under hypoxia.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>) HCT116 or HeLa KO clone cells created by CRISPR/Cas9 method were incubated under normoxia or hypoxia for 24 hr, and then cellular TG was detected by TG kits or by BODIPY 493/503 (green indicates lipids and blue indicates DAPI-stained nucleus). <italic>n</italic>Â =Â 3 biologically independent experiments for (<bold>A</bold>); <italic>n</italic>Â =Â 4 biologically independent experiments for (<bold>B</bold>).*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001 vs. Normoxia WT; <sup>ââ</sup>p&lt;0.01, <sup>âââ</sup>p&lt;0.001 vs. Hypoxia WT; <sup>###</sup>p&lt;0.001 vs. Hypoxia HIG2 KO.

However, when hypoxia was extended to 48 hr, loss of HIG2 caused a significant reduction in the number of viable cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) as well as a marked increase in apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by the robust appearance of cleaved PARP and Caspase-3 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AâE</xref>).

We speculated that in hypoxic HIG2 KO cells, increased FAO and low oxygen conditions would synergistically cause excessive ROS production. In support of this hypothesis, HIG2 KO cells exhibited a near 250% increase of intracellular ROS levels in hypoxia as compared to normoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Most importantly, treatment of hypoxic HIG2 KO cells with anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) dose-dependently inhibited cleavage of PARP and Caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and cell labeling by Annexin V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

One compelling idea is that metabolic adaptations driven by HIF-1 confer a selective advantage for cancer cells in the low oxygen environment. It had been recognized previously that through enhanced HIF-1 activity, cancer cells increase their TG-LD accumulation in response to oxygen deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bensaad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koizume and Miyagi, 2016</xref>). Additionally, HIF-1 activation downregulates mitochondrial oxidative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Masson and Ratcliffe, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>), by which it helps to reduce oxygen consumption and maintain oxygen homeostasis in hypoxia. However, the earlier studies did not precisely define how HIF-1 functions to facilitate these two metabolic alterations. In this regard, the present study has uncovered a major unifying mechanism by demonstrating that inhibition of ATGL-mediated lipolysis by HIG2 contributes to LD storage and attenuated mitochondrial FA oxidation under hypoxia.</p><p>The first hint of the HIG2 protein function came from the sequence alignment that revealed a homology between the HIG2 HD and the ATGL inhibitory domain of G0S2. Biochemical and cell biological analyses subsequently confirmed that like G0S2, HIG2 specifically inhibits the TG hydrolase activity of ATGL. Decreased TG hydrolysis results from a specific interaction, since deletion of the LY(V/L)LG motif conserved between the HDs of HIG2 and G0S2 abolished both ATGL interaction and inhibition. Recently, Cerk et al. demonstrated that a peptide derived from the G0S2 HD containing the LY(V/L)LG motif is capable of inhibiting ATGL in a dose dependent, non-competitive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cerk et al., 2014</xref>). It is highly conceivable that HIG2 inhibits ATGL <italic>via</italic> a similar biochemical mechanism. In addition, HIG2-ablated hepatocytes were previously shown to exhibit increased TG turnover under normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DiStefano et al., 2015</xref>). However, knockout mouse studies conducted by the same group and Dijk et al. later yielded results arguing against a direct involvement of HIG2 in lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dijk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DiStefano et al., 2016</xref>). The reason for these discrepancies is currently unknown. We speculate that the lack of hypoxia in the employed experimental settings, under which endogenous HIG2 might be expressed at low levels and thus possess a relatively insubstantial role, may contribute to the absence of significant changes caused by HIG2 ablation.</p><p>Knockout of HIG2 increased lipolysis and decreased TG levels in hypoxic cancer cells. Co-ablation of ATGL was able to rescue these phenotypes of HIG2 deficiency, suggesting that the specific inhibition of ATGL is functionally important for the adaptive LD accumulation downstream of HIG2 expression. Moreover, early studies have shown that ATGL-mediated TG hydrolysis provides necessary lipid ligands for PPARÎ± activation. Associated with a markedly diminished PPARÎ± target gene expression, ATGL-deficient cells often exhibit severely disrupted mitochondrial oxidation of FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmadian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haemmerle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ong et al., 2011</xref>). In agreement with these previous findings, our data demonstrate that in cancer cells, hypoxia-induced downregulation of FAO and reduction in expression of PPARÎ± target genes both are dependent on HIG2. This dependency was completely lost upon ATGL ablation, again suggesting a prerequisite role for ATGL inhibition by HIG2. Inhibition of FAO and antagonism of PPARÎ± both led to reduced ROS production and apoptotic induction in hypoxic HIG2 KO cells, indicating the activation of PPARÎ±-dependent FAO as a major contributor to oxidative stress. PPARÎ± is generally thought to limit lipotoxicity through upregulating FAO during excess FA availability. While sustained activation of FAO often results in increased generation of ROS in mitochondria, PPARÎ± is known to promote the expression of various anti-oxidases such as catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khoo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). We speculate that in normoxia, mechanisms balancing ROS generation and degradation likely operate to maintain the steady-state redox environment. However, during hypoxia when oxygen is insufficiently supplied, a tilt toward excessive ROS production can occur as a result of increased electron leakage from the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), leading to oxidative stress.</p><p>A question arises as to why lipolytic inhibition in hypoxic cancer cells would be advantageous. Cancer cells require large amounts of lipids for the synthesis of cellular membranes to maintain high cell proliferation rates. However, lipotoxicity can occur at times when FA delivery to the cells exceeds FA oxidation rates. This may be especially important during the periods of hypoxia, when HIF-1 activation is known to induce FA uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bensaad et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, the oxidation of FAs may need to be decelerated in hypoxia as it consumes significant amounts of oxygen, which can exacerbate oxygen insufficiency. More importantly, both hypoxia and excessive FA oxidation cause elevated mitochondrial ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bleier and DrÃ¶se, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guzy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">SchÃ¶nfeld and Wojtczak, 2008</xref>). Elevated ROS levels lead to peroxidation of membrane lipids, denaturation of proteins and deactivation of enzymes, which together can lead to cell damage and apoptosis. Therefore, switch-off of FA oxidation combined with storage of excess FAs in TG-LDs through inhibition of lipolysis would constitute a conceivable strategy for cancer cells to prevent ROS overproduction and oxidative damage as well as evade lipotoxicity in hypoxia. In this regard, the present study provides compelling evidence that the HIF-1-HIG2 antilipolytic pathway is a central component of such a survival strategy. In hypoxia, restoration of lipolysis by ablation of either HIG2 or HIF-1Î± caused significant increases in FAO and ROS generation along with decreased cell viability. A causal relationship between ROS elevation and increased cell death is demonstrated by the fact that exogenously applied antioxidant NAC protected HIG2 KO cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of wild type HIG2 but not HIG2â7â11, the mutant deficient in ATGL inhibition, decreased ROS production and increased resistance to hypoxia-induced apoptosis. These results clearly establish that inhibition of ATGL-mediated lipolysis by HIG2 is downstream of and required for HIF-1 to elicit the protective effects in hypoxic cancer cells.</p><p>Our results complement the existing model illustrating that HIF-1 represses glucose flux to the TCA cycle through mediating expression of PDK1, which inhibits pyruvate oxidation through phosphorylating and inactivating PDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). In cancer cells located within the poorly oxygenated regions of solid tumors, coordinate inhibition of ATGL and PDH by HIG2 and PDK1, respectively, should collectively lead to reduced mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and ROS production as well as improved tissue oxygen homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In addition, we observed that neither hypoxia-induced glucose consumption nor glycolysis was affected by HIG2 deletion. Although excessive mitochondrial FAO may impair glucose utilization <italic>via</italic> the classic Randle cycle, our results suggest that the acquisition of glycolytic phenotypes by hypoxic cancer cells is independent of the inhibition of FA mobilization by HIG2. We speculate that the main purpose of storing excessive FAs in TG-LDs in hypoxia likely is for prevention of the potential cytotoxicity that is associated with FAO-driven ROS generation.</p><p>Based on the data derived from the present study, we propose that HIG2 is a novel metabolic oncogenic factor, which exerts its function by neutralizing the tumor suppressive role of ATGL/CGI-58. Our observations that ATGL inhibition by HIG2 promotes hypoxic cancer cell survival in vitro and tumor growth in vivo are supportive of this hypothesis. By suggesting a critical role of lipolytic inhibition in hypoxic tumor areas, the present study provides justification for the development of specific chemical disruptors of HIG2-ATGL interaction. Such drugs presumably would be able to liberate ATGL and potentiate FAO-driven ROS production to toxic levels, resulting in apoptotic death of hypoxic cancer cells. Our findings that HIG2 is highly upregulated in multiple human solid tumors are in agreement of this concept. The HIF-1-HIG2 antilipolytic pathway represents a departure from the typical metabolic pathways that have been targeted therapeutically to deprive cells of necessary fuel/building blocks. Lastly, it is important to note that while the bioinformatics analysis revealed an upregulated expression of HIG2 in a variety of solid tumors, our mechanistic studies mainly employed HeLa, CRC and RCC cell lines. It is conceivable that the impact of HIG2 as a lipolytic inhibitor varies among different tumor types. In this regard, increased expression of LD coat protein Perilipin 2 downstream of HIF-2 was recently shown to promote lipid storage in clear cell RCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qiu et al., 2015</xref>). Together, the accumulating data have painted a complex and intricate picture in which cancer cells regulate their lipid accumulation in hypoxia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>The following antibodies were used: Rabbit anti-HIG2 (Santa Cruz, #sc-137518, 1:500 dilution); Rabbit anti-HIF-1Î± (Novusbio, #NB100-449, 1:500 dilution); Rabbit anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz, #sc-789, 1:1000 dilution); Mouse anti-Flag M2 (Sigma, #F1804, 1:1000 dilution); Mouse anti-Actin (Sigma, #A1978, clone AC-15, 1:10,000 dilution); Rabbit anti-cleaved Caspase-3 (Cell signaling technology, #9661, 1:300 dilution); Rabbit anti-cleaved PARP (Cell signaling technology, #5625, clone D64E10, 1:1000 dilution); Rabbit anti-ATGL (Cell signaling technology, #2138, 1:500 dilution); Rabbit anti-CGI-58 (Proteintech lab, #12201â1-AP, 1:1000 dilution); Rabbit anti-4 Hydroxynonenal (4 HNE) (Abcam, #ab46545, 1:300 dilution); Alexa Fluor 568 anti-Mouse Secondary Antibody (Invitrogen, #A-11004, 1:1000 dilution); Alexa Fluor 633 anti-Rabbit Secondary Antibody (Invitrogen, #A-21070, 1:1000 dilution); Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories(1:5000 dilution).[9, 10 (n)-<sup>3</sup> hr] triolein, [9, 10 (n)-<sup>3</sup> hr] oleic acid were from Perkin Elmer Life sciences.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Mark McCarthy (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ralph DeBerardinis (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper studies the role of HIG2 in lipid droplet (LD) dynamics and cell survival during hypoxia.. Proteomics and functional studies demonstrate that a HIF-1 target, hypoxia inducible gene-2 (HIG2) is a novel inhibitor of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). During hypoxia, HIG2 binds to ATGL, suppresses its lipase activity and prevents it from catabolizing LDs. During prolonged hypoxia, HIG2's association with ATGL is required for cell survival, and the authors present evidence that the mechanism of cell death under HIG2-silenced conditions involves reactive oxygen species arising from unconstrained fatty acid oxidation (FAO). In xenografts, HIG2 deletion reduces lipid deposition and suppresses tumor growth, but these effects are rescued by co-deleting ATGL. The authors also present evidence that HIG2 expression tends to be enhanced in human cancers from several organ sites. Overall this is an interesting and clearly written paper with conclusions supported by the data. A few additional experiments and analyses would strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors' model indicates that fatty acids released from LDs are oxidized to produce ROS. Although the data indicate that HIG2 is required for FAO and ROS production, two additional experiments should be performed. First, the authors should formally test whether inhibiting FAO mitigates ROS and cell death during HIG2 silencing. Second, the FAO assay uses exogenous fatty acids as a source of tracer. It is not clear that these fatty acids are first sent to the LD before being oxidized, and given the effects of HIG2 on expression of FAO enzymes, it is possible that the major substrate for FAO is the exogenous fatty acid pool rather than LD hydrolysis. It should be possible to load the LD pool with labeled fatty acids, then wash out the label, subject the cells to hypoxia and measure FAO. If the liberation of labeled water is still enhanced by HIG2 knockout, this would provide additional support to the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>.</p><p>2) The patient data is preliminary. A large number of patient materials are characterized as having elevated HIG2 mRNA expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>. However, protein data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> only depicts 5 patient samples. A larger cohort of human patient material tissue sections should be acquired to show that primary patient tissues accumulate HIG2 protein, and ideally that this is also inversely correlated with markers of lipid peroxidation, such as by 4-HNE immunostaining. This would increase the conclusions drawn from the paper and further bolster the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>.</p><p>3) Most of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are convincing, but the quality of the lipid peroxidation and cleaved Caspase 3 IHCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> is poor.

Also, ROS levels were considerably reduced in Ranolzine-treated cells under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).
