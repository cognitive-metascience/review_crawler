Crystal structures showed that pT1471 binds the canonical SH2 pY site while pS1493 binds an unanticipated pocket 70 Å distant. Remarkably, the pT1471 phosphate occupies the phosphate-binding site of a canonical pY complex, while Y1473 occupies the position of a canonical pY side chain, with the combination of pT and Y mimicking a pY moiety. Biochemical data and modeling indicate that pY1473 can form an equivalent interaction, and we find that pT1471/pS1493 and pY1473/pS1493 combinations occur in vivo. ChIP-seq and genetic analyses demonstrate the importance of these interactions for recruitment of Spt6 to sites of transcription and for the maintenance of repressive chromatin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Spt6</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd><kwd>histone chaperone</kwd><kwd>SH2 domain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM116560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sdano</surname><given-names>Matthew Allan</given-names></name><name><surname>Whitby</surname><given-names>Frank G</given-names></name><name><surname>Formosa</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Christopher P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50GM082545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sdano</surname><given-names>Matthew Allan</given-names></name><name><surname>Fulcher</surname><given-names>James M</given-names></name><name><surname>Whitby</surname><given-names>Frank G</given-names></name><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Christopher P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA042014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parnell</surname><given-names>Timothy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The tandem SH2 domains of Spt6 use novel mechanisms to bind unexpected phosphorylated serine and threonine residues in the RNA polymerase II linker to recruit Spt6 to sites of transcription and maintain repressive chromatin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNAPII is the twelve-subunit complex that transcribes mRNAs and many noncoding RNAs in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kornberg, 1999</xref>). The largest subunit, Rpb1, contains a flexible C-terminal domain (CTD) comprising multiple repeats of the heptad consensus sequence YSPTSPS, with about 26 repeats in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and 52 in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eick and Geyer, 2013</xref>). Phosphorylation of CTD residues is thought to recruit multiple co-factors, including the essential and conserved transcription factor Spt6, which directly binds to and co-localizes with RNAPII at sites of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrulis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaplan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mayer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perales et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoh et al., 2008</xref>). Spt6 has been implicated in multiple steps of gene expression including transcription, mRNA processing and export, histone post-translational modification, and nucleosome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duina, 2011</xref>). A well-established Spt6 activity that is thought to depend upon its association with RNAPII is the reassembly of nucleosomes in the wake of elongating RNAPII, which is required to maintain chromatin in the repressive state that prevents aberrant transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adkins and Tyler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeGennaro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hainer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanovska et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaplan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thebault et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The 1451 residues of Spt6 comprise three structural regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Close et al., 2011</xref>). The N-terminal ~300 residues are highly acidic, predicted to be disordered, and are necessary for binding both nucleosomes and the transcription factor Spn1/IWS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diebold et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McDonald et al., 2010</xref>). The core of Spt6 (residues 298–1248) contains several structural motifs associated with binding to DNA or proteins, and has overall similarity to the prokaryotic transcription factor Tex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>). The C-terminal region (residues 1250–1440) comprises a tandem SH2 (tSH2) domain that is tethered to the core by a flexible 21-residue helix and contains both of the two known SH2 structural motifs in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Close et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diebold et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2010</xref>). These two SH2 motifs pack against each other to form a single structural unit. The N-terminal module (nSH2) resembles a canonical SH2 domain while the C-terminal module (cSH2) is vestigial and does not conserve the residues that are normally associated with binding to pY-containing peptides that comprise the vast majority of known SH2 domain ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The tSH2 domain is important for Spt6 function. In yeast, deletion of the tSH2 domain causes slow growth and phenotypes attributed to defects in transcription elongation or maintenance of chromatin status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diebold et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartzog et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCullough et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2010</xref>). In mammals, the tSH2 domain is important for mRNA processing and export, and for class switch recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Begum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okazaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoh et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, deletion of the tSH2 domain reduces occupancy of Spt6 throughout transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burugula et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mayer et al., 2010</xref>). Although the tSH2 domain was initially reported to bind the serine-2 phosphorylated Rpb1 CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoh et al., 2008</xref>), the conservation of the nSH2 domain implies that it binds a pY residue, and the presence of this modification in the CTD heptad repeats provides an attractive model for recruitment of Spt6 to RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mayer et al., 2012</xref>). This widely accepted model is supported by a number of studies that have reported binding of the tSH2 domain to phosphorylated RNAPII CTD peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Close et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mayer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Despite its wide acceptance, a number of observations caused us to question the prevailing model: (1) Affinity of the tSH2 domain for phosphorylated CTD-derived peptides is weak under physiological salt conditions, (2) binding displayed little preference for different phosphorylation states, and (3) mutations expected to disrupt pY interaction had only modest effects on binding and no apparent physiological consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Close et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore took an unbiased approach to map the tSH2 domain binding site within RNAPII and, contrary to the earlier assumptions, found that Spt6 tSH2 directly binds the flexible, 86 residue Rpb1 linker (residues 1456–1541) that tethers the heptad CTD repeats to the RNAPII core. Biochemical and structural studies demonstrate that optimal binding requires phosphorylation of the Rpb1 linker on S1493 as well as either T1471 or Y1473. The interaction with pS1493 occurs through a novel, unanticipated site, while phosphorylated T1471/Y1473 binds to the canonical SH2-pY-binding site. The pT1471 interaction displays remarkable molecular mimicry with canonical pY complexes, and suggests both an evolutionary pathway to the extensive family of SH2-pY complexes of metazoans and the possibility of novel SH2 signaling paradigms. Mass spectrometry showed that phosphorylation can occur in vivo simultaneously on T1471 and S1493 or on Y1473 and S1493. ChIP-seq revealed that disruption of the Spt6-Rpb1 interface reduced Spt6 occupancy of transcription units, especially at highly transcribed genes. Genetic analysis demonstrated the functional importance of the Spt6-RNAPII interaction for the maintenance of repressive chromatin. These studies therefore uncover the mechanism through which Spt6 is recruited to transcription sites, and reveal an unexpectedly complex phosphorylation-dependent switch for this recruitment that has strong implications for other SH2-mediated processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Rpb1 linker, but not the CTD region, is required for Spt6 tSH2 binding</title><p>To test the importance of the heptad repeats of Rpb1 for binding the Spt6 tSH2 domain, we inserted PreScission protease sites into Rpb1 to facilitate removal of the CTD (ΔCTD) or linker and CTD (Δlinker) during purification from yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

Conserved residues in the Rpb1 linker therefore contribute significantly to Spt6 tSH2 binding in this assay while the CTD heptad repeats do not.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phosphorylation of Rpb1 S1493 promotes tSH2 binding</title><p>To determine if the Rpb1 linker is sufficient for Spt6 tSH2 binding, we used fluorescence polarization to quantify binding to a fluorescein-labeled peptide spanning the FSP<sup>1492-1494</sup> residues implicated in the previous section (Fl-Rpb1<sup>1476-1511</sup>). Spt6<sup>1247-1451</sup> (tSH2) bound the peptide in solution with a <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> of ~43 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which is unlikely to explain the binding observed in the far western assay. Direct binding of Spt6 tSH2 to fluorescein itself at concentrations above ~15 μM prevented accurate testing of interactions weaker than 2 μM (data not shown). Notably, this effect may have influenced previously published data measuring binding of tSH2 to fluorescein-labeled CTD peptides. Given the reported importance of RNAPII phosphorylation in Spt6 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoh et al., 2008</xref>) and the strong effect noted with mutation of S1493, we next tested the binding to Fl-Rpb1<sup>1476-1511</sup> with S1493 phosphorylated (Fl-Rpb1<sup>1476-1500 pS1493</sup>). Phosphorylation increased the affinity ~500 fold, to a <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> of 90 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which is approximately three orders of magnitude tighter than reported for monophosphorylated CTD heptad-derived peptides under the same buffer conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Close et al., 2011</xref>). We conclude that Spt6 tSH2 has high affinity for a peptide centered on S1493 of Rpb1, that phosphorylation of this residue is an important binding element, and that at least some of the Rpb1 obtained from yeast that displayed binding to Spt6 tSH2 is likely to be phosphorylated at this site.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28723.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of Rpb1 linker S1493 enhances binding and occurs in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spt6 tSH2 was titrated into Fl-Rpb1<sup>1476-1511</sup> peptides with or without S1493 phosphorylated, yielding the indicated changes in polarization.

The unmodified Rpb1 Y1473 side chain occupies the typical position of the phenolic ring of pY, while the phosphate is instead contributed by pT. The phosphate is displaced 3–3.5 Å from the canonical location, and is hydrogen-bonded to the Y1473 hydroxyl via an ordered water molecule. This allows many of the interactions that stabilize binding in conventional SH2 domain interactions to be conserved in the Spt6-pT complex. For example, the water molecule that bridges the T1471 phosphate and the Y1473 hydroxyl is anchored to Spt6 through hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group and main chain nitrogen of S1285, which is analogous to the SH2 BC2 residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuriyan and Cowburn, 1997</xref>) that in many SH2 domains is a serine or threonine that hydrogen bonds with the tyrosine phosphate. Similarly, Spt6 R1282 (SH2 βB5) hydrogen bonds the phosphate, as it does in canonical SH2-pY interactions. The 3–3.5 Å displacement of the phosphate relative to conventional pY complexes allows formation of an additional hydrogen bond interaction with the main chain carbonyl of Spt6 G1264 (SH2 αA2). In many SH2 domains, the αA2 residue is an arginine or lysine that forms a cation-pi interaction with the pY, so a glycine in this position may open the pocket to allow the displacement of the phosphate seen in our structure. The crystallographic interface therefore explains the binding data, and reveals a striking example of molecular mimicry with canonical SH2-pY interactions.</p><media id="video4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-28723-video4.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28723.015</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the Spt6 tSH2-Rpb1 pT1471/Y1473 interaction with other SH2-pY interactions.</title><p>Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

The <italic>spt6-KK-AA<sup>(S)</sup>, rpb1-S-A</italic> double mutant had a stronger phenotype than either single mutant, suggesting that each mutation caused only a partial loss of chromatin maintenance. The additive effects of these alleles suggest that these residues may have additional functions outside of this specific interaction. A more severe Rpb1 mutation that replaces residues LMFSPLV<sup>1490-1496</sup> with KMKRRRK<sup>1490-1496</sup> (alias = <italic>rpb1-FSP<sup>+</sup>-KRR<sup>+</sup></italic>) saturated the Spt<sup>−</sup> phenotype. Because greater phenotypic suppression is not possible, combining <italic>rpb1-FSP<sup>+</sup>-KRR<sup>+</sup></italic> with <italic>spt6-KK-AA<sup>(S)</sup></italic> showed no further defect. The <italic>rpb1-FSP<sup>+</sup>-KRR<sup>+</sup></italic> strain also activated a cryptic promoter located within the <italic>FLO8</italic> gene to a low level (growth on galactose). This defect was enhanced by adding the <italic>spt6-KK-AA<sup>(S)</sup></italic> mutation, indicating that even <italic>rpb1-FSP<sup>+</sup>-KRR<sup>+</sup></italic> retains partial Spt6 binding activity or, as mentioned above, that these residues have additional functions that contribute to chromatin maintenance during transcription. Combining the ‘dual site’ <italic>spt6</italic> and <italic>rpb1</italic> alleles slightly enhanced the phenotypes caused by individual mutations, including activation of the cryptic promoter under low levels of transcription (growth on glucose), suggesting that the individual mutations do not completely disrupt the interaction. This is consistent with the large interface that extends beyond the specific residues mutated in these alleles. We also note the possibility of additional functions of these regions such as interactions of other factors with the Spt6 pockets or Rpb1 residues. These mutants displayed additional defects similar to those caused by a full tSH2 domain deletion, including slow growth at normal and elevated temperatures and hydroxyurea (HU) sensitivity, suggesting that these two interfaces represent essentially all of the biological functions of this domain.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-28723-fig5-figsupp1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig5s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28723.019</object-id><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Schematic of Spt<sup>−</sup> and cryptic promoter activation reporters used to assay yeast phenotypes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The suppressor of Ty1 (Spt<bold><sup>−</sup></bold>) phenotype was scored by growth of strains carrying the <italic>lys2-128∂</italic> allele on media lacking lysine.

That model was made attractive by the established role of CTD phosphorylations in binding RNAPII cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eick and Geyer, 2013</xref>), the presence of pY residues in the heptad repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mayer et al., 2012</xref>), and the numerous characterized interactions of SH2 domains with pY residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Machida and Mayer, 2005</xref>). In contrast to this assumption, we found that the Spt6 tSH2 domain binds to the flexible Rpb1 linker that tethers the CTD heptad repeats to the core enzyme rather than to the CTD repeats themselves, thereby uncovering a functional role of the Rpb1 linker. Phosphorylation of Rpb1 residues T1471, Y1473, and S1493 within this linker contributed to tight binding, and crystal structures revealed unexpected mechanisms for recognition of pT1471 and pS1493, while biochemical data imply a canonical SH2 interaction for pY1473. Rpb1 pT1471 and Y1473 collaborated to bind the nSH2 pocket in a manner mimicking canonical pY binding, and Rpb1 pS1493 bound a novel pS-binding pocket that is located 70 Å distant. We further demonstrated that Rpb1 T1471, Y1473, and S1493 are phosphorylated in vivo, validated the interface biochemically and genetically, and found that the interface is important for the recruitment of Spt6 to highly transcribed genes and for the maintenance of repressive chromatin.</p><p>Mutations that disrupt the Spt6 tSH2-Rpb1 linker interaction caused defects in transcription-dependent chromatin-mediated repression of cryptic promoters, as indicated by appearance of the Spt<sup>−</sup> phenotype and the activation of a cryptic promoter reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These observations indicate that maintaining the appropriate association of Spt6 with RNAPII is important for maintaining a repressive chromatin structure, which is consistent with a role for Spt6 in the reassembly of nucleosomes in the wake of elongating RNAPII, an activity that is likely mediated by interactions of the Spt6 N-terminal domain with nucleosomes/histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duina, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McDonald et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Deletion of the tSH2 domain has been previously shown to greatly reduce Spt6 occupancy at a subset of protein coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burugula et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mayer et al., 2010</xref>). We find that mutations that impair both of the phosphate-binding pockets in the Spt6 tSH2-Rpb1 linker interface also reduce Spt6 occupancy at the average gene, with large effects at frequently transcribed genes. This suggests that Rpb1 T1471/Y1473 and S1493 phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of Spt6 is utilized more frequently at highly transcribed genes. An attractive model is that engaging a dedicated molecule of Spt6 during elongation is helpful, but is not essential for RNAPII transcription, possibly because the high abundance of Spt6 (about one molecule per three nucleosomes or ~10 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCullough et al., 2015</xref>]) allows the essential histone chaperone functions of Spt6 to be performed with diminished but sufficient efficiency through spontaneous encounters. At highly transcribed genes, where there is increased disruption of chromatin due to the more frequent passage of RNAPII, a dedicated Spt6 has to be recruited to the phosphorylated Rpb1 linker to maintain an appropriate chromatin state. This is consistent with a study that found greater loss of H3 at highly transcribed genes in the absence of Spt6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perales et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the severe Spt6 and Rpb1 mutants, less severe mutations that impair a single phosphate-binding site increase Spt6 occupancy across gene bodies. One possible explanation for this observation is that these less severe mutations allow relatively normal recruitment of Spt6 to transcription sites, but cause a defect in RNAPII progression that results in increased RNAPII (and therefore Spt6) retention/occupancy. Our data also include the intriguing observation that Spt6 occupancy is skewed toward the 3' end of average genes, and that the accumulation of Spt6 directly over the transcription termination site is diminished or lost in our binding interface mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which may reflect a role for this interaction in termination of transcription. Definitive explanations for these various correlations will require further study.</p><p>As noted above, Spt6 is highly abundant in the yeast nucleus (~10 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCullough et al., 2015</xref>]), which raises interesting questions about the affinities we observed for biochemical binding of phosphorylated peptides. In particular, the 100 nM affinity of the singly phosphorylated pS1943 peptide might be sufficient to ensure saturation of Spt6-Rpb1 binding in the absence of a reinforcing interaction from phosphorylation at T1471 or Y1473. One possibility is that the Spt6 tSH2 domain has additional ligands in the cell, and that T1471 or Y1473 phosphorylation is required to drive Rpb1 association in the face of competing interactions.</p><p>In addition to the maintenance of repressive chromatin, Spt6 is reported to participate in mRNA processing and export, although the mechanistic role of Spt6 in these processes is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrulis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Estruch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoh et al., 2007</xref>). One possibility is that Spt6 forms a bridge between the transcription machinery and mRNA processing and export factors. In support of this, the N-terminus of Spt6 directly binds the factor Spn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diebold et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McDonald et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoh et al., 2007</xref>), which has been implicated in these processes. One attractive model is that the interaction between the Spt6 tSH2 domain and the Rpb1 linker might recruit Spt6 to transcription complexes where it serves as a binding platform for mRNA processing and export factors such as Spn1. Thus, it is possible that the interaction that we have characterized with the Rpb1 linker might contribute to multiple known functions of Spt6, and testing these possibilities and associated mechanisms will be a priority for future studies.</p><p>Human SPT6 was found to associate with an Rpb1 construct that had been incubated with the kinase P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoh et al., 2008</xref>). The role of P-TEFb in yeast is typically performed by the cyclin-dependent kinases Ctk1 and Bur1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowman and Kelly, 2014</xref>). Consistent with a possible role for Ctk1 and/or Bur1, T1471 and P1472 comprise a minimal cyclin-dependent kinase site and the residues flanking Rpb1 S1493 resemble those of known Ctk1 and Bur1 substrates. Moreover, Ctk1 and Bur1 have been physically and functionally linked to Spt6, and contribute to Spt6 localization at the 5’ end of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burugula et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dronamraju and Strahl, 2014</xref>). In contrast, candidate kinases for phosphorylating Y1473 are less obvious because there are no dedicated tyrosine kinases recognized in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Identification of the authentic physiological kinase(s) and the timing and regulation of their T1471, Y1473, and S1493 phosphorylation activities are important goals of future studies.</p><p>The tSH2-pT1471 structure provides a remarkable example of molecular mimicry in which the components of a cognate pY ligand are provided in two parts: a tyrosine side chain (Y1473) and a phosphate (pT1471). Because the Spt6 tSH2 represents the only SH2 domain that has been recognized in yeasts and a dedicated yeast tyrosine kinase has not been described, it is attractive to speculate that the Spt6 tSH2 domain reflects a primordial interaction module that bound pT-X-Y peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu and Nash, 2012</xref>). The subsequent emergence of a tyrosine kinase may have led to an altered signaling pathway in which the molecular recognition responded to phosphorylation of the tyrosine. Thus, our structural and biochemical observations suggest a plausible evolutionary origin of the highly abundant and diverged SH2-pY interaction family of metazoa. A related concept that merits future study is that the ability of alternative pT or pY to bind an SH2 site might allow distinct kinases to converge on the same molecular interaction, thereby further enriching the potential of many signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Plasmids used in this study are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Species-specific and orthologous alignments were extracted by comparing the alignment metrics for every read to either genome with a custom program, cross_species_alignment_picker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parnell, 2016</xref>); orthologous alignments were discarded for analysis. Fragment coverage for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was generated with BioToolBox bam2wig with an extension of 130 bp, a consensus fragment length as determined by peak cross-strand correlation, and depth-normalized by scaling to reads per million mapped (RPM). These coverage tracks were further normalized for ChIP efficiency by dividing by the number of unique <italic>C. glabrata</italic> alignments (scaled to millions) in each sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Orlando et al., 2014</xref>). After normalization, a mean consensus track was generated by merging the replicates using bedtools (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_006646">SCR_006646</ext-link>) and dividing by the number of replicates. To generate fold enrichment tracks, genomic intervals with zero coverage in the input samples were artificially set to a non-zero value of 1 (a value well below the genomic mean) and a fold enrichment calculated with macs2 bdgcmp. Coverage track manipulation was performed using the script manipulate_wig.</p><p>For high-level gene analysis from all ChIP experiments, fold enrichment was mapped across gene bodies in 40 bins (representing 2.5% of gene length) plus 25 10 bp bins upstream and downstream using the BioToolBox program get_binned_data. Subsequent analysis and data processing steps were performed using programs available within the BioToolBox package.

Your article has been very favorably reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bruce J Mayer (Reviewer #1); Michael J Eck (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript is an excellent combination of in vitro biochemistry, structural biology, and in vivo biology that reveals details of the interaction between the SH2 domains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Spt6 with the RNA PolII subunit Rpb1. Spt6 contains the only known SH2 domains in yeast, arranged in a tandem module, which are thought to represent the progenitor domain from which the many phosphotyrosine-binding SH2 domains present in metazoans evolved. The authors find that this module binds to a singly or doubly phosphorylated segment in the linker region of Rbp1, rather than to the heptad repeat region of the CTD, contrary to the prevailing model.</p><p>An X-ray crystal structure of the tandem SH2 domains with phosphorylated Rpb1 linker peptide showed that the primary binding surface to the phosphopeptide is not the canonical phosphotyrosine binding pocket of the N-terminal SH2 domain, but instead a novel peptide binding groove on the C-terminal cryptic SH2 domain (which lacks many of the hallmark residues common to other SH2 domains). They go on to show that longer Rpb1 peptides, containing additional N-terminal phosphorylation sites, bind with higher affinity than the minimal binding peptide; a crystal structure reveals that the N-terminal phosphosite interacts with the canonical pTyr binding pocket of the N-terminal SH2. Furthermore, the phosphate of phosphothreonine and the ring of a nearby tyrosine residue together bind to the pTyr pocket of the SH2 domain in a fashion that closely mimics binding of phosphotyrosine in metazoan SH2 domains. This raises an intriguing possibility that this primordial binding activity, optimized for binding the Rpb1 linker, may have been co-opted for new signaling purposes once dedicated tyrosine kinases evolved. Finally, as expected, mutations in either Spt6 or Rpb1 designed to impair the two binding interfaces impaired known Spt6-mediated phenotypes in yeast.</p><p>The study is very well done and will be important addition to the field, as it overturns accepted wisdom and provides structural evidence for a new paradigm for SH2 domain recognition of Y..pS instead of pY ligands. The structural work is first rate, and is complemented by careful binding studies with phosphopeptides (singly and doubly phosphorylated) derived from the newly discovered binding site. Mass spectrometry studies confirm phosphorylation of these sites in vivo, and the functional relevance of the Spt6 interaction at the site is demonstrated via extensive structure-function work and ChIP-seq experiments that show the interaction is important for maintaining repressive chromatin.</p><p>Overall, this is a thorough and convincing work, that provides important new understanding of the repertoire of SH2 domain interactions. The work is eminently suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Please consider the following points raised by the reviewers in preparing a revised manuscript. Note that although some of the points that are raised might require new experimentation to address the issues completely, we are not requiring further experimentation as a condition for acceptance of the manuscript. You should use your judgement as to how to best address the issues.</p><p>Important points to address:</p><p>1) The absence of any binding data for extended peptides that are phosphorylated on the N-terminal site (T1471 or Y1473) but not S1493 hampers the ability to understand the extent to which the &quot;canonical&quot; site cooperates with the S1493 binding site. In particular, it would be very helpful to know whether phosphorylation of the N-terminal site is sufficient to mediate some specific binding even in the absence of S1493 phosphorylation. This would help interpret the in vivo data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The reviewers do not think that this is absolutely essential, but feel that it would make the story more complete, and help in interpreting the in vivo binding data. If such data are not readily available, please provide an explanation along with the revised manuscript.</p><p>2) The authors should discuss the measured binding affinities in the context of the high concentration of Spt6 present in vivo (as noted in the Discussion). By a back-of-the-envelope calculation, the nuclear concentration of Spt6 is ~10 μM, high above the dissociation constant for singly phosphorylated (S1493) peptide. One might expect binding would be saturated even in the absence of the phosphorylation of the second Rpb1 site.</p><p>3) Subsection “The Spt6-Rpb1 interaction is important for maintaining repressive chromatin”: The fact that mutations in Rpb1 and Spt6 affecting the same binding interface have additive effects is difficult to understand-if the effect if the Spt6-KK-AA mutant is failure to coordinate the phosphate of pS1493, addition of the Rpb1S1493A mutation in the double mutant should have no additional phenotype.</p><p>4) Subsection “The Rpb1 linker recruits Spt6 to highly transcribed transcription units”: &quot;One likely explanation for this observation is that these less severe mutations allow relatively normal recruitment of Spt6 to transcription sites, but cause a defect in RNAPII progression, which would result in increased RNAPII (and therefore Spt6) retention/occupancy.&quot;</p><p>There does not appear to be specific evidence for &quot;likely&quot;- this should be tested or moved to discussion as speculation. It might be important to consider Rpb1 or Rpb3 or other Pol II subunit controls for the claim that recruitment of Spt6 is defective in the interface mutants- under that model there is unstated assumption that Pol II levels are not changing when occupancy of Spt6 is reduced, though altered Pol II levels are invoked to explain increased Spt6 occupancy in weak interface mutants.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28723.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Important points to address:</p><p>1) The absence of any binding data for extended peptides that are phosphorylated on the N-terminal site (T1471 or Y1473) but not S1493 hampers the ability to understand the extent to which the &quot;canonical&quot; site cooperates with the S1493 binding site.

The revised manuscript includes the following segment in the Discussion section:</p><p>“As noted above, Spt6 is highly abundant in the yeast nucleus (~10 μM (McCullough et al., 2015)), which raises interesting questions about the affinities we observed for biochemical binding of phosphorylated peptides. In particular, the 100 nM affinity of the singly phosphorylated pS1943 peptide might be sufficient to ensure saturation of Spt6-Rpb1 binding in the absence of a reinforcing interaction from phosphorylation at T1471 or Y1473. One possibility is that the Spt6 tSH2 domain has additional ligands in the cell, and that T1471 or Y1473 phosphorylation is required to drive Rpb1 association in the face of competing interactions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “The Spt6-Rpb1 interaction is important for maintaining repressive chromatin”: The fact that mutations in Rpb1 and Spt6 affecting the same binding interface have additive effects is difficult to understand-if the effect if the Spt6-KK-AA mutant is failure to coordinate the phosphate of pS1493, addition of the Rpb1S1493A mutation in the double mutant should have no additional phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have added the following text in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> legend):</p><p>“The additive effects of these alleles suggest that these residues may have additional functions outside of this specific interaction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “The Rpb1 linker recruits Spt6 to highly transcribed transcription units”: &quot;One likely explanation for this observation is that these less severe mutations allow relatively normal recruitment of Spt6 to transcription sites, but cause a defect in RNAPII progression, which would result in increased RNAPII (and therefore Spt6) retention/occupancy.&quot;</p><p>There does not appear to be specific evidence for &quot;likely&quot;- this should be tested or moved to discussion as speculation.

One possible explanation for this observation is that these less severe mutations allow relatively normal recruitment of Spt6 to transcription sites, but cause a defect in RNAPII progression that results in increased RNAPII (and therefore Spt6) retention/occupancy. Our data also include the intriguing observation that Spt6 occupancy is skewed toward the 3' end of average genes, and that the accumulation of Spt6 directly over the transcription termination site is diminished or lost in our binding interface mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which may reflect a role for this interaction in termination of transcription. Definitive explanations for these various correlations will require further study.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
