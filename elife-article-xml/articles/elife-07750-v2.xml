Ku binding to yeast telomerase RNA promotes telomere lengthening and telomerase recruitment to telomeres, but how this is achieved remains unknown. Using telomere-length analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that Sir4 – a previously identified Ku-binding protein that is a component of telomeric silent chromatin – is required for Ku-mediated telomere lengthening and telomerase recruitment. We also find that specifically tethering Sir4 directly to Ku-binding-defective telomerase RNA restores otherwise-shortened telomeres to wild-type length. These findings suggest that Sir4 is the telomere-bound target of Ku-mediated telomerase recruitment and provide one mechanism for how the Sir4-competing Rif1 and Rif2 proteins negatively regulate telomere length in yeast.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07750.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07750.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07750.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside a cell's nucleus, DNA is packaged into structures called chromosomes. The ends of every chromosome are capped by repeating sequences of DNA known as telomeres, which protect the chromosomes from damage. Every time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten. If telomere length falls below a critical level, the cell can die or enter a state in which it can no longer divide.</p><p>During cell division, an enzyme called telomerase normally restores telomeres to their original length. Telomerase is made up of several proteins and an RNA molecule. In yeast and humans, a protein called Ku is one part of the telomerase enzyme. Ku binds to the RNA subunit of telomerase and helps the enzyme find and interact with the telomeres. Previous research has shown that Ku is unable to work alone to recruit telomerase to the chromosome.</p><p>A protein called Sir4 binds to telomeres and cells lacking it have short telomeres, but the reason behind this was not known. Hass and Zappulla confirmed previous reports that Ku binds to Sir4 using a biochemical approach. Additional experiments provided genetic evidence that this binding interaction is important for telomerase to lengthen telomeres appropriately.</p><p>Cells in which the RNA subunit of telomerase is unable to bind effectively to Ku have short telomeres. Hass and Zappulla directly tethered Sir4 to this defective RNA and found this restored the shortened telomeres to a normal length, indicating that Sir4 normally binds Ku to recruit telomerase. Discovering this mode of recruitment also helps to explain how two other telomeric proteins (Rif1 and 2) limit telomere lengthening; they compete with Ku-Sir4 recruitment to form a length-regulating system.</p><p>Taken together, Hass and Zappulla's results provide strong evidence that Sir4 cooperates with Ku to control the lengthening of chromosome ends. Future research will hopefully reveal the precise space and time requirements for this telomerase-controlling system in yeast. Additionally, because Ku has been reported to be a subunit of human telomerase, future studies could also explore whether human cells use a similar strategy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07750.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07750.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>telomerase</kwd><kwd>telomere</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>transcriptional silencing</kwd><kwd>Ku</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#5-FY12-91</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zappulla</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM080400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zappulla</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In yeast, the secondary pathway for recruiting telomerase to chromosome ends requires a component of telomeric transcriptionally silent chromatin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes are protected by telomeres, which contain DNA repeats that buffer against shortening caused by the end-replication problem. In most eukaryotes, telomeres are lengthened by the enzyme telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greider and Blackburn, 1985</xref>). Telomerase is a multi-subunit ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, containing the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and the telomerase RNA, which contains the template for telomeric repeat synthesis by TERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shippen-Lentz and Blackburn, 1990</xref>). The telomerase RNA is more than just a template, however, as it has conserved structures in its core that are required for catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharyya and Blackburn, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tzfati et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mefford et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niederer and Zappulla, 2015</xref>) and serves as a scaffold for assembling the telomerase RNP holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zappulla and Cech, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zappulla et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lebo and Zappulla, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lebo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Telomeric DNA and neighboring subtelomeric regions are often packaged into heterochromatin. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, telomeric silent chromatin is largely composed of the histone deacetylase Sir2 and structural components, Sir3 and Sir4. Complexes of these three proteins are recruited to telomeric DNA in part by the DNA-binding protein Rap1, which interacts with Sir3 and Sir4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moretti et al., 1994</xref>). Sir2/3/4 complexes then associate with hypoacetylated H3 and H4 tails from telomeric into subtelomeric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luo et al., 2002</xref>) and can cause silencing of telomere-proximal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gottschling et al., 1990</xref>). In addition to the Sir2/3/4 complex, telomeric silencing also requires the Ku heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boulton and Jackson, 1998</xref>), a highly conserved DNA end-binding complex of the proteins Ku70 and Ku80 (Yku70 and Yku80 in yeast) well known for its function in non-homologous end-joining. Ku binds telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin et al., 1999</xref>) and has been found to interact with Sir4 in two-hybrid screens as well as by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsukamoto et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roy et al., 2004</xref>). Ku also protects the telomeric 5′ end from resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gravel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polotnianka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonetti et al., 2010</xref>) and is a subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme.</p><p>Ku binds telomerase RNA both in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peterson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stellwagen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalby et al., 2013</xref>) and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ting et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Ku binds to the tip of a 74-nt hairpin in the 1157-nt telomerase RNA, TLC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peterson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stellwagen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dandjinou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zappulla and Cech, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalby et al., 2013</xref>). In cells where the tip of this hairpin is deleted (<italic>tlc1</italic>Δ<italic>48</italic>), telomeres shorten by ∼70 base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peterson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stellwagen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zappulla et al., 2011</xref>). This defect can be mostly rescued by inserting a Ku-binding hairpin at other locations within the mutant tlc1Δ48 RNA, whereas inserting additional Ku-binding hairpins into wild-type TLC1 causes progressive telomere hyper-elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zappulla et al., 2011</xref>). Lack of Ku binding to TLC1 has also been reported to reduce nuclear localization of TLC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallardo et al., 2008</xref>) and recruitment of telomerase to telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fisher et al., 2004</xref>). Also important for telomerase recruitment to telomeres is the protein Est1. Est1 was the first telomerase subunit identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lundblad and Szostak, 1989</xref>) and is required for recruiting telomerase to telomeres through an interaction with the single-stranded telomeric DNA-binding protein Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Evans and Lundblad, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qi and Zakian, 2000</xref>). In contrast to Est1, the mechanism by which Ku recruits telomerase to telomeres has yet to be elucidated.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07750.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Secondary structure model of yeast telomerase RNA.</title><p>The 48 nucleotides deleted in the <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ<italic>48</italic> allele are highlighted in red.

However, this model has been largely discounted by in vitro binding experiments showing that purified Ku cannot bind DNA and RNA concurrently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pfingsten et al., 2012</xref>). It therefore seemed likely to us that Ku recruits telomerase to telomeres by interacting with a telomere-associated protein. Such a protein must bind Ku and associate with telomeres. Knowing that Ku also plays a role in the formation of telomeric silent chromatin, we chose to investigate its binding partner in this process, the protein Sir4, as a possible candidate. Sir4 associates with telomeres, and as mentioned above, an interaction between Sir4 and Ku has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsukamoto et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roy et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, <italic>sir4</italic>Δ cells have been shown to have shortened telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palladino et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Askree et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gatbonton et al., 2006</xref>), although the cause of this phenotype has remained apparently unexplored.</p><p>Here, we provide genetic evidence suggesting that <italic>SIR4</italic> and TLC1-bound Ku promote telomere lengthening through the same pathway and that <italic>SIR4</italic> is required for Ku-mediated telomere lengthening. In contrast, the negative regulators of telomerase, Rif1 and Rif2, which compete with Sir3 and Sir4 for binding to Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moretti et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wotton and Shore, 1997</xref>), appear to inhibit Ku-mediated telomere lengthening. By measuring telomerase recruitment to telomeres by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we find that a TLC1 RNA containing three Ku-binding sites, TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub>, causes increased telomerase recruitment in wild-type cells. Furthermore, <italic>sir4</italic>Δ cells display a defect in telomerase recruitment indistinguishable from that of <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ<italic>48</italic> cells, even when expressing TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub>. Finally, we show that tethering Sir4 directly to tlcΔ48 RNA restores telomeres to wild-type length, while tethering Sir3 to tlc1Δ48 does not. Together, these results suggest that Ku recruits telomerase to telomeres through its interaction with Sir4 and that this recruitment pathway is counterbalanced by Rif1 and Rif2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Ku</italic>, <italic>SIR4</italic>, and the <italic>TLC1</italic> Ku-binding site promote telomere lengthening through the same pathway</title><p>Although the exact mechanism of Ku-mediated telomerase recruitment remains unclear, a simple model is that Ku recruits telomerase to telomeres by binding a telomere-bound protein. The telomeric silent chromatin protein Sir4 is an attractive candidate for playing this role, since it has been shown to bind Ku and because <italic>sir4</italic>Δ cells have telomeres 50–150 bp shorter than wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palladino et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gatbonton et al., 2006</xref>), a phenotype similar to the ∼70-bp reduction seen in <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ<italic>48</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peterson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stellwagen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zappulla et al., 2011</xref>).

We observed similar results in <italic>sir2</italic>Δ and <italic>sir3</italic>Δ cells, which, like <italic>sir4</italic>Δ cells, completely lack telomeric silencing, although telomeres supported by TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub> in these backgrounds were not quite as short as those supported by TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub> in a <italic>sir4</italic>Δ background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

The input, unbound supernatant, and bound fraction were resolved on a gel and subjected to autoradiography. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, when Ku heterodimer was omitted from this procedure, a trace amount of radioactive Sir4 was recovered in the bound fraction, indicating a small amount of non-specific Sir4 binding the beads, and when Sir4 template DNA was omitted, no bands were detected. However, when both Ku and Sir4 template DNA were present in the RRL, ∼fivefold more radioactive Sir4 was recovered in the bound fraction than in the no-Ku control, providing evidence for a direct interaction between the Ku heterodimer and Sir4. To test if this protein–protein interaction was specific, we repeated this experiment with Ku heterodimer that had been boiled before being added to the RRL. In this condition, only trace amounts of Sir4 were recovered in the bound fraction, similar to what was observed when Ku was omitted altogether.

The MS2CP tags on Sir3 caused a small amount of telomere shortening (lanes 10 and 11), and tethering Sir3 to wild-type TLC1 (lanes 14 and 15) restored telomeres to approximately wild-type length, but, again, this was dependent on the 48-nt TLC1-binding site for Ku (lanes 16 and 17). In summary, the finding that specifically tethering Sir4 to Ku-binding-defective tlc1Δ48 RNA restores wild-type length telomeres provides direct support for Sir4 being the telomere-associated factor required for Ku-mediated telomerase recruitment.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07750.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Tethering Sir4 to the tlc1Δ48 RNA restores telomeres to wild-type length.</title><p>Using the same <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ <italic>pTLC1-URA3</italic> strain background from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Sir3 and Sir4 were expressed from their endogenous loci bearing C-terminal (MS2CP)<sub>2</sub> tags, separated by an 8-glycine linker.

Obstacles include the enzyme's extremely low concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mozdy and Cech, 2006</xref>), the short period of time when telomerase has to act at the end of S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diede and Gottschling, 1999</xref>), and the fact that chromosome ends are likely difficult to access due to telomeric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guertin and Lis, 2013</xref>). Considering these impediments, it becomes clearer why telomerase would have multiple recruitment pathways assisting in providing enzyme access to telomeres. Furthermore, carefully regulating telomerase activity is critical – it is upregulated in 90% of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shay and Bacchetti, 1997</xref>) and reduced in telomere syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</xref>) – and multiple pathways provide opportunities for layers of regulatory control. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the primary telomerase recruitment pathway is essential and requires the Est1 telomerase subunit binding to the telomere-specific DNA-binding protein Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Evans and Lundblad, 1999</xref>). In humans, it has been shown recently that telomere-bound Pot1•Tpp1 recruits telomerase through the Tpp1 ‘TEL patch’ binding TERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nandakumar and Cech, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>). A second recruitment pathway in yeast has been identified that requires the Ku telomerase subunit and its binding to TLC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peterson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stellwagen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fisher et al., 2004</xref>).

Ku binding to TLC1 promotes telomere lengthening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peterson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stellwagen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zappulla et al., 2011</xref>) and recruitment of the telomerase catalytic protein subunit to telomeres as assessed by ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fisher et al., 2004</xref>). Our current findings support this Ku-mediated recruitment pathway and provide the first evidence that it is achieved by binding the telomeric silencing protein Sir4. First, we report genetic epistasis between <italic>SIR4</italic> and the Ku-binding site in <italic>TLC1</italic> with respect to telomere-length maintenance. Second, we show that telomere hyper-elongation caused by a TLC1 RNA containing three Ku-binding sites, TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub>, is dependent on <italic>SIR4</italic>. Third, using ChIP, we report that deleting <italic>SIR4</italic> causes low levels of telomerase catalytic subunit at telomeres and that this low degree of recruitment is indistinguishable from what is observed in <italic>tlc1</italic>Δ<italic>48</italic> cells. Furthermore, TLC1 with two extra Ku-binding sites causes a 10-fold increase in TERT enrichment at telomeres, and this increase in telomerase recruitment requires <italic>SIR4</italic>. Finally, tethering Sir4 directly to a TLC1 RNA lacking its Ku-binding site restores telomeres to wild-type length, whereas tethering Sir3 to Ku-binding-defective TLC1 RNA does not. The fact that the loss of the telomere length-promoting function of the Ku-binding site in TLC1 can be rescued by directly tethering Sir4 to TLC1 provides strong evidence that Sir4 protein directly participates in Ku-mediated telomerase recruitment and telomere extension.</p><p>Based on the results presented here, we propose that Ku mediates telomerase recruitment to telomeres by binding to Sir4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Since Ku-mediated telomerase recruitment occurs via Sir4 associating with telomeric DNA-bound Rap1, regulation of Sir4 association with Rap1, in turn, can control the ability of the Ku-Sir4 recruitment pathway to assist in telomere lengthening. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, Sir4 association with telomeres is increased in the absence of Rif1 or Rif2, suggesting that Rif1 and Rif2 inhibit Sir4 binding to telomeres. The Rif1 and Rif2 proteins have been proposed to represent a ‘counting mechanism’ for telomere-length homeostasis in which decreased binding of the Rif proteins – negative regulators of telomerase – leads to increased telomerase recruitment at short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marcand et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levy and Blackburn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teixeira et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianchi and Shore, 2007</xref>). Our model provides a parsimonious explanation for one way in which Rif1 and Rif2 regulate telomere length; that is, as competitive inhibitors of Sir4 binding to Rap1, and therefore, the Sir4-Ku telomerase recruitment pathway. The model that the Ku-Sir4 recruitment pathway is subject to Rif protein-mediated negative regulation is supported by our findings and reports in the literature. First, we showed that TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub>, a telomerase RNA with three Ku-binding sites, causes many telomeres to become hyper-elongated, which is similar to telomere hyper-elongation exhibited by <italic>rif1</italic>Δ and <italic>rif2</italic>Δ mutants. Second, deleting the Ku-binding site in TLC1 greatly reduces the telomere hyper-lengthening observed in <italic>rif1</italic>Δ and <italic>rif2</italic>Δ cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, it has been shown that the hyper-lengthening of telomeres in <italic>rif2</italic>Δ as well as <italic>rif1</italic>Δ <italic>rif2</italic>Δ mutants is greatly reduced when combined with a <italic>yku70</italic>Δ mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mishra and Shore, 1999</xref>). Regulation of the Ku-Sir4 pathway by Rif1 and Rif2 likely modulates, in turn, the essential Est1-Cdc13 telomerase-recruitment pathway. Ku-mediated telomerase recruitment has been proposed to promote function of the Est1-Cdc13 pathway by increasing Est1 association with telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fisher et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Williams et al., 2014</xref>), a mechanism that is complementary to our model for Ku-mediated telomerase recruitment.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07750.014</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for Ku-Sir4 telomerase recruitment to telomeres and its role in telomere-length regulation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.</title><p>Telomerase has previously been shown to extend a telomere infrequently and shorter telomeres are preferentially extendable. We propose here that Ku recruits telomerase to telomeres by binding Sir4. Since it has been shown that Rif1 and Rif2 compete with Sir4 and Sir3 for binding telomere-bound Rap1, the Ku-Sir4 telomerase recruitment pathway is inhibited by Rif1 and 2, providing a simple mechanistic explanation for one way in which Rif proteins function to inhibit telomerase action at telomeres. (<bold>A</bold>) Ku recruitment of telomerase via Sir4 is inhibited by Rif1/2 competition for Rap1 binding with Sir4. In situations where Ku-Sir4-mediated telomerase recruitment does not occur, Est1-Cdc13-mediated telomerase recruitment can still happen, although with low efficiently. (<bold>B</bold>) When telomerase is recruited to a telomere through the Ku-Sir4 pathway, subsequent Est1-Cdc13-mediated recruitment to the end of the telomere becomes more efficient, resulting in increased telomerase extension of telomeres.

Such a relationship has already been suggested by the fact that Rif1 and Rif2 proteins compete with silencing proteins Sir3 and Sir4 for association with telomere-bound Rap1 and inhibit telomerase acting at longer telomeres. Accordingly, we propose that the Ku-Sir4 recruitment pathway tends to occur at shorter telomeres and is part of the negative-feedback loop regulating telomere length homeostasis. This is supported by telomerase preferentially acting at shortened telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teixeira et al., 2004</xref>), which tend to have weaker silencing than longer telomeres and have fewer Rif proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kyrion et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park and Lustig, 2000</xref>). Our results and previous studies show that when telomeric transcriptional silencing is absent due to <italic>sir2</italic>∆ or <italic>sir3</italic>∆ mutation, a reduced but detectable amount of Sir4 is found at telomeres by ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoppe et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, in wild-type cells, it may be that Sir4 binds to Rap1 to recruit telomerase via its Ku subunit without having established telomeric silent chromatin at the end. In summary, it seems most likely that short, non-silenced chromosome ends are the ones targeted for extension by the Sir4-Ku telomerase recruitment pathway and that this is an important part of the negative-feedback loop that maintains telomere-length homeostasis.</p><p>Although the Ku-Sir4 recruitment mechanism we propose is inhibited by the important negative regulators of telomerase Rif1 and Rif2, it is clear that the Ku-Sir4 pathway normally has a more modest role in telomere-length maintenance than the Est1-Cdc13 pathway. Disrupting the Ku-Sir4 pathway results in short but stable telomeres, whereas, in contrast, loss of Est1-Cdc13 recruitment causes complete loss of telomeres and cellular senescence. The typically smaller magnitude of the effects of the Ku-Sir4 pathway makes its disruption more likely to have been missed in prior studies. Furthermore, it has been difficult to separate the roles of Sir proteins in telomerase recruitment from competing negative roles of Rif1 and Rif2. The C-terminal domain of the Rap1 protein that binds telomeric dsDNA repeats is bound by Rif1 and Rif2 and recruits Sir3 and Sir4 to telomeres. Deleting the C-terminal domain of Rap1 therefore not only disrupts Sir-dependent silencing at telomeres but also abolishes Rif-protein inhibition of telomerase, and consequently, the net result is that telomeres become extremely long in a mutant lacking the Rap1 C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kyrion et al., 1992</xref>). However, our model cannot fully explain the long-telomere phenotype of this mutant. In the absence of Rif1 and Rif2 binding at telomeres in <italic>rap1</italic>∆<italic>c</italic> cells, telomeres will only become hyper-elongated if a process that the Rif proteins inhibit persists. Because mutants lacking the Rap1 C-terminus have long telomeres despite having lost Sir4 binding at telomeres (at least via Rap1), the Ku-Sir4-mediated recruitment pathway we propose is not the only one inhibited by Rif1 and Rif2.</p><p>There are, however, a few noteworthy results in the literature suggesting that telomeric silent chromatin factors, particularly Rap1, contribute to telomere-length maintenance. First, deleting <italic>SIR3</italic> or <italic>SIR4</italic> causes telomere-length maintenance defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palladino et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Askree et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gatbonton et al., 2006</xref>). Second, the Rap1 M763A mutation, which abolishes the Rap1-Sir3 interaction and slightly impairs telomeric silencing, has been shown to cause shortened telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feeser and Wolberger, 2008</xref>). Lastly, Rap1 binding near a telomeric seed sequence has been shown to promote telomerase-dependent de novo telomere formation, although this activity was reportedly <italic>SIR4</italic>-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ray and Runge, 1998</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have shown that telomerase RNA-bound Ku recruits telomerase to telomeres by binding the telomeric silent chromatin protein Sir4. The Ku-Sir4 pathway is inhibited by the telomerase regulators Rif1 and Rif2 and likely promotes telomerase recruitment through the essential Est1-Cdc13 recruitment pathway. Thus, this pathway represents an important mechanism by which telomerase is regulated to maintain telomere length in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and it may be generally conserved in many other species. For instance, both telomeric silent chromatin and the Ku-telomerase RNA interaction are present in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baur et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ting et al., 2005</xref>). Although humans lack an obvious Sir4 homolog, the protein HP1α has been implicated in human telomeric silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koering et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnoult et al., 2012</xref>) and has been shown to bind Ku70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Song et al., 2001</xref>), so it will be interesting to learn if these interactions also comprise a telomerase-recruitment pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experiments in yeast</title><p>Lists of the yeast strains and plasmids used can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

The remaining supernatant was discarded, and the beads were washed twice with 500 μl of ‘stringent’ Ku-Sir4 buffer (same as ‘standard’ Ku-Sir4 buffer but with 200 mM NaCl and 0.2% IGEPAL). Beads were then re-suspended in 120 μl TE +1% SDS and heated at 95°C for 5 min. The beads were pulled down with a magnet, and the entire supernatant was saved as the bound fraction. 2 μl of 2× protein sample buffer was added to the input and unbound aliquots, which were then heated at 95°C for 5 min. These samples along with a bound sample (10 μl of the bound fraction plus 10 μl of 2× protein sample buffer) were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. The resulting gel was imaged using phosphor screens and a Typhoon 9410 Variable Mode Imager. It should be noted that the ‘standard’ and ‘stringent’ Ku-Sir4 buffers were designed based off of the buffers used in co-immunoprecipitation experiments described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roy et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Robert Schleif, Haiqing Zhao, and members of the Zappulla laboratory for comments on the manuscript, Tom Cech's laboratory for the generous gift of purified Ku heterodimer, and Virginia Zakian's laboratory for advice with ChIP and quantitative PCR procedures.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The other review, David Shore, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their comments with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As Sir4 can bind telomeres in the absence of other Sir proteins, the authors need to address why <italic>sir2</italic> and <italic>sir3</italic> mutants have short telomeres (the smaller amount of Sir4 bound not sufficient?). Most important, in my opinion, is that they measure Sir4 ChIP in the <italic>rif</italic> mutants, but they should also do this in <italic>sir2</italic> and <italic>sir3</italic>, as well as to measure Est2 (TERT) in all the <italic>sir</italic> mutants.</p><p>2) All reviewer comments must be addressed. Some other experiments would be nice, but are not required.</p><p>Comments 1 and part of 3 from Reviewer 1 are the main ones.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper provides evidence that Ku promotes telomere lengthening via a direct interaction with Sir4. Although the Ku-Sir4 interaction has been previously described (2-hybrid), and Sir4 and Ku are known to be important for normal telomere length, the mechanistic connection of the Ku-Sir4 interaction to telomere length is unknown and important. As such, I think the paper is appropriate in principle for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are some unexplained aspects of the model and a few missing experiments that need to be performed prior to acceptance.</p><p>1) The crux of the paper hinges on the specific interaction of Ku and Sir4. In accord with this, the authors show that Sir4 is required for recruitment of TERT (Est2) to telomeres. However, it is essential to analyze TERT recruitment in Sir2 and Sir3 mutant strains. To go along with this, it will also be important to analyze Sir4 occupancy in the mutant strains.</p><p>2) The Sir4 tethering experiment is very nice. However, it is unclear why Sir3 tethering doesn't work, because it is my understanding that all the Sir proteins are bound to the telomere. In this case, why does it matter which protein is tethered? This needs to be analyzed by Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 ChIP in the relevant strains.</p><p>3) Rif1 and Rif2 are clearly important in the story and model, but the experiments here are limited. Sir protein ChIP experiments need to be done in the <italic>rif1</italic>/<italic>rif2</italic> mutant strains carrying the relevant alleles of telomerase RNA. In addition, Rif1 and Rif2 ChIP experiments in the tethered strain and the various telomerase RNA alleles also need to be done.</p><p>4) In the ideal world, the authors would conclusively prove their model by obtaining derivatives of Sir4 and/or Ku that selectively block their interaction without affecting other functions of these proteins. Such derivatives should affect telomere length without affecting silencing or other aspects of telomere function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Hass and Zappulla identify a new telomerase recruitment pathway in the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Previous work had implicated the yeast Ku heterodimer (yKu) in telomerase recruitment through a well-characterized interaction with the telomerase RNA template (TLC1). Thus, yKu bound to telomeric DNA was thought to directly recruit telomerase. However, a more recent study from the Cech lab showed that yKu could not simultaneously bind DNA and RNA in vitro, putting this simple model into question. Hass and Zappulla present a convincing case, based on genetic, biochemical and ChIP data that telomere-bound Sir4 protein instead binds to yKu, which in turn recruits telomerase through the previously described yKu-TLC1 interaction. Although this pathway does not substitute for the essential and more thoroughly studied Cdc13-Est1 telomerase recruitment pathway, the authors argue that this additional pathway may improve the robustness of the system for telomerase extension and provide additional means for its regulation.</p><p>I believe that the findings reported here are novel and significant, and will be of considerable interest both to researchers in the telomere field and to a wider audience. I have the following specific comments:</p><p>1) Prior evidence for the Sir4-yKu interaction is not clearly described and the evidence presented here is relatively weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Has a domain of Sir4 been identified that is sufficient? Can the interaction be measured with purified proteins?</p><p>2) The observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) that the <italic>TLC1(Ku)</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub> mutant appears to “cause telomeric restriction fragments to be progressively more heterogeneous over time” does not seem to me to be a very good description of the data. To me it seems that a population of very short Y' telomeres is maintained whereas the rest of the Y' telomeres elongate progressively over time. Analysis of clones from these cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>) doesn't clarify this issue, and I wonder if it might be useful to probe the blots only for Y' telomeres. The authors claim that a similar observation has been made in two other publications; details should be provided and discussed. Since there are cases where extensive telomere elongation is observed in the absence of this apparently bi-modal distribution, the authors should at least discuss this issue and propose a testable model to explain the observation. I did not understand their comments on this (subsection “Telomere hyper-lengthening by telomerase RNA with extra Ku-binding sites is <italic>SIR4</italic>-dependent”).</p><p>3) The observation regarding the effect of <italic>tlc1Δ48</italic> in cells lacking either Rif1 or Rif2 is interesting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and should be looked at more closely. Again, it might be useful to specifically examine Y' ends, since the heterogeneity of non-Y' telomeres and their frequent co-migration with the Y' ones complicates the analysis. The authors should test whether <italic>sir4Δ</italic> causes a further reduction (or not, as they would presumably predict). Again, the effect of TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub> in these mutants was complex, with some telomere shortening evident. This needs to be addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07750.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) As Sir4</italic> can <italic>bind telomeres in the absence of other Sir proteins, the authors need to address why</italic> sir2 <italic>and</italic> sir3 <italic>mutants have short telomeres (the smaller amount of Sir4 bound not sufficient?).

The current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is new and shows Sir4 ChIP in wild-type, <italic>rif1</italic>∆, <italic>rif2</italic>∆, <italic>sir3</italic>∆ and <italic>sir2</italic>∆ strains. We have also completed Est2 ChIP in all <italic>sir</italic> mutants, as requested, and this is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.</p><p>The results of all of these experiments provide additional strong evidence supporting our proposed Sir4-Ku telomerase recruitment model and its relationship with the Rif-based counting model for telomere-length regulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We agree with the reviewers that shorter telomeres in <italic>sir2</italic> and <italic>sir3</italic> mutants is explainable due to reduced Sir4 at telomeres in these strains, as we now show this to be the case from the new results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, which were what we expected based on earlier data from Danesh Moazed’s lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoppe et al., 2002</xref>). The reduced Sir4 occupancy of telomeres in <italic>sir3</italic>∆ and <italic>sir2</italic>∆ strains could simply be mechanistically explained by the fact that Sir2/3/4 form a heterotrimeric complex and when one of the factors is absent, the trimer cannot form appropriately and this reduces the formation of higher-order complexes that normally enhance Sir4 recruitment (in addition to being a trimer, Sir3 can bind itself and Sir4, Sir4 can bind itself and Sir3, and Sir2 binds Sir4). It is possible that Sir4 molecules that are part of a higher-order Sir2/3/4 multimeric complex (i.e., Sir4 not directly bound to Rap1) can assist in telomerase recruitment and/or it could be that Sir4 bound to Rap1 is available for the Ku interaction and that the absence of Sir2 or Sir3 actually affects telomere-association of the complex due to altering Sir4’s ability to associate with Rap1 as effectively as in wild-type cells.</p><p>The requested experiment examining Sir4 ChIP in <italic>rif1</italic>∆ and <italic>rif2</italic>∆ mutants shows that Sir4 occupancy at telomeres is increased, consistent with these factors acting to inhibit Sir4 at telomeres from the “counting model” originally proposed by the Shore and Blackburn labs and our model for this functioning via the Sir4-Ku telomerase-recruitment pathway. We appreciate the reviewers suggesting this experiment, as it adds new results for the field and additional evidence for the Sir4-Ku recruitment model.</p><p>The new results showing Est2 ChIP in <italic>sir3</italic>∆ and <italic>sir2</italic>∆ mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) correlate nicely with the added Sir4 ChIP data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.

To go along with this, it will also be important to analyze Sir4 occupancy in the mutant strains</italic>.</p><p>We have performed all of the experiments requested by Reviewer 1, as described above in our response to the essential revisions; we did ChIP for TERT in <italic>sir2</italic>∆ and <italic>sir3</italic>∆ strains and Sir4 ChIP as well in <italic>sir2</italic>∆, <italic>sir3</italic>∆, <italic>rif1</italic>∆ and <italic>rif2</italic>∆ strains. The results were those expected if the Sir4-Ku model for telomerase recruitment is valid as well as its relationship to the telomere length-regulating counting model.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that specific interaction of Ku and Sir4 is important for the paper. This is a reason why we did the in vitro-binding studies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to reconstitute this interaction and show that it is direct.</p><p>Ku and Sir4 are not quite required for recruitment of TERT to telomeres (they are not essential to avoid senescence), but these factors are clearly important for the majority of recruitment as assessed by TERT ChIP. Our data confirm that <italic>sir4</italic>∆ and Ku-binding-defective TLC1 (<italic>tlc1∆48</italic>) have very similar deficits in telomerase recruitment, as would be expected if Sir4 is required for the Ku telomerase subunit to recruit the enzyme to telomeres.</p><p><italic>2) The Sir4 tethering experiment is very nice. However, it is unclear why Sir3 tethering doesn't work, because it is my understanding that all the Sir proteins are bound to the telomere. In this case, why does it matter which protein is tethered? This needs to be analyzed by Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 ChIP in the relevant strains</italic>.</p><p>As requested and as described above in the response to the essential revisions, we have now also done Sir4 ChIP, in wild-type, <italic>sir2</italic>∆, <italic>sir3</italic>∆, <italic>rif1</italic>∆ and <italic>rif2</italic>∆ strains that we constructed, with expected outcomes. Reviewer 1 points out here that our results show that the ability to productively recruit telomerase is specific to Sir4. We are also interested in why it is that Sir4 is the specific Sir protein that has evolved to be involved in Ku-mediated telomerase recruitment. This topic is the basis for future studies as it will involve a significant effort to evaluate potential hypotheses for why this is the case. It could be an issue of position of Sir4 along the telomere or subtelomere, or an issue of timing in the cell cycle as Sir proteins (individual molecules vs subcomplexes) are recruited to Rap1, etc.</p><p><italic>3) Rif1 and Rif2 are clearly important in the story and model, but the experiments here are limited. Sir protein ChIP experiments need to be done in the</italic> rif1<italic>/</italic>rif2 <italic>mutant strains carrying the relevant alleles of telomerase RNA. In addition, Rif1 and Rif2 ChIP experiments in the tethered strain and the various telomerase RNA alleles also need to be done</italic>.</p><p>As Sir4 ChIP was part of the requested essential revisions, which we performed in multiple strains including <italic>rif1</italic>∆ and <italic>rif2</italic>∆ as requested here, this request has now been addressed above and the new data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The newly added results are described in the revised Results and Discussion sections. These results expand on the Rif1 and Rif2 aspects of this paper and further validate their role in the proposed model. In the two months suggested for revisions and as they were not part of the essential revisions, we could not also address the Rif1 and Rif2 ChIP requests in the variety of telomerase RNA conditions.</p><p><italic>4) In the ideal world, the authors would conclusively prove their model by obtaining derivatives of Sir4 and/or Ku that selectively block their interaction without affecting other functions of these proteins. Such derivatives should affect telomere length without affecting silencing or other aspects of telomere function</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this set of experiments would be great. We have concerns, however, that it may not be possible to obtain such findings, as the Ku interaction with Sir4 is important not only for telomerase recruitment via Ku as a telomerase subunit, but also for Sir2/3/4 recruitment to telomeres, which in turn affects the former process. Presumably the same Ku-Sir4 interaction interface is used for both functions and since Ku’s central role in recruitment of Sir2/3/4 to telomeres is “upstream” of its other role in recruiting telomerase as a subunit of the RNP to telomere-associated Sir4. This is a very interesting dual role of Ku, but it will be the subject of future studies to examine it and understand why telomere biology involves this multifaceted Ku functionality. Perhaps it is an important facet of the telomere length-regulating negative feedback loop.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>[…] I believe that the findings reported here are novel and significant, and will be of considerable interest both to researchers in the telomere field and to a wider audience. I have the following specific comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Prior evidence for the Sir4-yKu interaction is not clearly described and the evidence presented here is relatively weak (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>). Has a domain of Sir4 been identified that is sufficient? Can the interaction be measured with purified proteins?</italic></p><p>We have added to the description details of the interaction and referencing of the prior evidence for the Sir4-Ku heterodimer association in the subsection “Ku binds Sir4 in vitro” of the revised manuscript to give a better sense of what is known about these questions and what is newly contributed by this publication.</p><p><italic>2) The observation (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic>A</xref><italic>) that the</italic> TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub> <italic>mutant appears to “cause telomeric restriction fragments to be progressively more heterogeneous over time” does not seem to me to be a very good description of the data.

I did not understand their comments on this (subsection “Telomere hyper-lengthening by telomerase RNA with extra Ku-binding sites is</italic> SIR4<italic>-dependent”)</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer suggesting Y′ probing of our Southern blots to add specificity about the elongation vs shortening within this population of 17 of the total 32 telomeres in yeast. We have performed Y′ probing on the blots from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref> and show these in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>We also appreciate the reviewer pointing out that our description of the telomere length heterogeneity could be more accurate, so we revised the relevant section substantially to try to be clearer. The Y′ probing data in the new figure supplement is similar to what we saw with telomeric repeat-probing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> for these telomeres. It does generally seem that there are two qualitatively different subpopulations of telomeres; those that are hyperelongating and those that are shortened and certainly it is not a simple Gaussian distribution spread over a wider length range. However, it is not obvious even from Y′ probing that the hyperelongating telomeres are a subgroup that behaves uniformly; they seem rather heterogeneously spread of a range of lengths. We have adjusted the text, including the lines referred to above, to help reflect the entirety of our results.</p><p>The Y′ probing has also been helpful in that it allows us to get a more quantitative sense of telomere length hyperelongation extent (∼1000 bp) and the rate (∼5 bp/generation) for the elongating subpopulation in the <italic>TLC1(Ku)</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub> cells. This information is referred to in the text.</p><p><italic>3) The observation regarding the effect of</italic> tlc1Δ48 <italic>in cells lacking either Rif1 or Rif2 is interesting (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic>C</xref><italic>) and should be looked at more closely.

This needs to be addressed</italic>.</p><p>As mentioned in the point above, we have now probed some of the key blots for Y′ telomeres. The results of this probing show that what we presumed were Y′ telomeres in telomeric repeat-probing data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> are indeed Y′ ends. With respect to the suggestion of the epistasis experiment (deleting <italic>SIR4</italic> to test for lack of a further reduction in <italic>rif</italic>∆ <italic>tlc1</italic>∆<italic>48</italic> cells, etc), this is a relevant, interesting experiment, but we were not able to add it to the substantial experimentation, involving several newly constructed strains, triplicate ChIP experiments for Sir4 and Est2, and Y′ Southern blots, accomplished in the two months suggested. This was also due to the fact that strain constructions for the particular set of TLC1-allele testing in novel triple–mutant combinations proposed would be significantly involved due to unavailability of markers in the strains.</p></body></sub-article></article>
