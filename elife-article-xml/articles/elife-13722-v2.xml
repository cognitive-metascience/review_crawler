It is widely used in cancer histopathology but its functions remain unclear. Here, we show that Ki-67 controls heterochromatin organisation. Altering Ki-67 expression levels did not significantly affect cell proliferation in vivo. Ki-67 mutant mice developed normally and cells lacking Ki-67 proliferated efficiently. Conversely, upregulation of Ki-67 expression in differentiated tissues did not prevent cell cycle arrest. Ki-67 interactors included proteins involved in nucleolar processes and chromatin regulators. Ki-67 depletion disrupted nucleologenesis but did not inhibit pre-rRNA processing. In contrast, it altered gene expression. Ki-67 silencing also had wide-ranging effects on chromatin organisation, disrupting heterochromatin compaction and long-range genomic interactions. Trimethylation of histone H3K9 and H4K20 was relocalised within the nucleus. Finally, overexpression of human or <italic>Xenopus</italic> Ki-67 induced ectopic heterochromatin formation. Altogether, our results suggest that Ki-67 expression in proliferating cells spatially organises heterochromatin, thereby controlling gene expression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13722.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13722.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13722.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells divide in two to produce new cells. In mammals, cell division is strictly controlled so that only certain groups of cells in the body are actively dividing at any time. However, some cells may escape these controls so that they divide rapidly and form tumors.</p><p>A protein called Ki-67 is only produced in actively dividing cells, where it is located in the nucleus – the structure that contains most of the cell’s DNA. Researchers often use Ki-67 as a marker to identify which cells are actively dividing in tissue samples from cancer patients, and previous studies indicated that Ki-67 is needed for cells to divide. However, the exact role of this protein was not clear. Before cells can divide they need to make large amounts of new proteins using molecular machines called ribosomes and it has been suggested that Ki-67 helps to produce ribosomes.</p><p>Now, Sobecki et al. used genetic techniques to study the role of Ki-67 in mice. The experiments show that Ki-67 is not required for cells to divide in the laboratory or to make ribosomes. Instead, Ki-67 alters the way that DNA is packaged in the nucleus. Loss of Ki-67 from mice cells resulted in DNA becoming less compact, which in turn altered the activity of genes in those cells.</p><p>Sobecki et al. also identified many other proteins that interact with Ki-67, so the next step following on from this research is to understand how Ki-67 alters DNA packaging at the molecular level. Another future challenge will be to find out if inhibiting the activity of Ki-67 can hinder the growth of cancer cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13722.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13722.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Ki-67</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-09-BLAN-0252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parisis</surname><given-names>Nikolaos</given-names></name><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EL2013.LNCC/DF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sobecki</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sobecki</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>GEFLUC Languedoc Roussillon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Subvention</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Antigen Ki-67, which is widely used as a cell proliferation marker, controls heterochromatin organisation and gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cell proliferation antigen Ki-67 (Ki-67 or Ki67) is constitutively expressed in cycling mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerdes et al., 1983</xref>). It is therefore widely used as a cell proliferation marker to grade tumours. Ki-67 is a nuclear DNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacCallum and Hall, 2000</xref>) with two human isoforms that have predicted molecular weights of 320kDa and 359kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerdes et al., 1991</xref>). The domain structure of Ki-67 is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. All homologues contain an N-terminal Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which can bind both to DNA and to phosphorylated epitopes. The most characteristic feature of Ki-67 is the presence of multiple tandem repeats (14 in mice, 16 in human) containing a conserved motif of unknown function, the 'Ki-67 domain'. Two other conserved motifs include a Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>) and a 31 amino acid conserved domain (CD) of unknown function, 100% identical between human and mouse, that includes a 22 amino acid motif conserved in all homologues. Ki-67 homologues also have a weakly conserved leucine/arginine rich C-terminus which can bind to DNA and, when overexpressed, promotes chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scholzen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takagi et al., 1999</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13722.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of human and mouse Ki-67 structural elements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: cartoon of human (long form) and mouse Ki-67 protein highlighting conserved elements and functional motifs.

Its maximum expression is found in G2 phase or during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Endl and Gerdes, 2000b</xref>). In interphase, Ki-67 forms fibre-like structures in fibrillarin-deficient regions surrounding nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Verheijen et al., 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kill, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheutin et al., 2003</xref>). Ki-67 also colocalises with satellite DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bridger et al., 1998</xref>) and is found in protein complexes that bind to satellite DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saksouk et al., 2014</xref>). It remains associated with nucleolar organiser regions of acrocentric chromosomes throughout interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bridger et al., 1998</xref>). Ki-67 is a direct substrate of the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blethrow et al., 2008</xref>) and is hyperphosphorylated in mitosis. This may regulate its expression and / or localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Endl and Gerdes, 2000a</xref>). In HeLa cells, Ki-67 binds tightly to chromatin in interphase, whereas this binding is weakened in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saiwaki et al., 2005</xref>) when it associates with condensed chromosomes before relocating to the chromosome periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verheijen et al., 1989a</xref>).</p><p>Ki-67 is generally assumed to be required for cell proliferation. An early study found that injection of antisense oligonucleotides that block Ki-67 expression inhibited cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schluter et al., 1993</xref>). Subsequent studies have shown that unperturbed Ki-67 expression levels are required for normal proliferation rates in various cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kausch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rahmanzadeh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2009</xref>). However, no complete Ki-67 loss of function studies have been reported. Therefore, it remains unclear what its functions are and whether it is essential for cell proliferation.</p><p>The dynamic localisation of Ki-67 has led to suggestions that it could coordinate nucleolar disassembly and reassembly at either side of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmidt et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, Ki-67 is required to localise nucleolar granular components to mitotic chromosomes, thereby potentially playing a role in nucleolar segregation between daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>). It has also been reported that Ki-67 has roles in ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rahmanzadeh et al., 2007</xref>), consistent with its nucleolar localisation and apparent role in cell proliferation.</p><p>In this work, we characterise the cellular roles of Ki-67 using knockdown and genetic approaches. We find that mutant mice with disrupted Ki-67 expression are viable and fertile. Preventing Ki-67 downregulation upon cell cycle exit in vivo does not impede differentiation. Thus, Ki-67 expression can be uncoupled from cell proliferation. Instead, we show that Ki-67 is an essential mediator of heterochromatin organisation and long-range chromatin interactions, controlling gene expression. As it is expressed at high levels only in proliferating cells, our results suggest that Ki-67 links heterochromatin organisation to cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mouse development is not affected by genetic up- and downregulation of Ki-67 expression</title><p>Given the tight correlation between Ki-67 expression and cell proliferation, it is often assumed that Ki-67 is required for cell proliferation and that its downregulation might promote cell cycle exit. We tested these hypotheses genetically. Ki-67 protein expression is regulated during the cell cycle, and we speculated that it might be a target for the APC/C-Cdh1 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is active in late mitosis and G1, and triggers degradation of substrates containing D-boxes and KEN boxes. Human Ki-67 isoforms contain two or three KEN boxes, whereas mouse Ki-67 contains two D-boxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Mouse Ki-67 contains an additional sequence, AQRKQPSR at 2680–2687, which is highly similar to the A-box, a third APC/C-Cdh1 recognition motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Littlepage and Ruderman, 2002</xref>). To see whether Cdh1 regulates Ki-67, we analysed mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking the <italic>Fzr1</italic> gene that encodes Cdh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia-Higuera et al., 2008</xref>). Asynchronous <italic>Fzr1</italic> heterozygous MEFs, that are at different stages of the cell cycle, had variable Ki-67 levels, whereas in the <italic>Fzr1</italic> knockout MEFs Ki-67 was upregulated and more homogeneously expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To see whether sustained Ki-67 expression in quiescent cells would have a negative impact on cell cycle arrest in vivo, we analysed <italic>Fzr1</italic>-knockout mice. Here, Ki-67 was overexpressed and uncoupled from cells that incorporate BrdU in all tissues examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, Ki-67 expression is regulated by APC/C-Cdh1 in mice and its downregulation is not a prerequisite for cell cycle exit.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13722.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Maintenance of Ki-67 expression in quiescent cells in vivo by Cdh1 mutation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence analysis of Ki-67 in MEF cells isolated from embryo (E13.5) of <italic>Fzr1</italic>(+/Δ);<italic>Sox2</italic>-Cre and Fzr1(-/Δ);<italic>Sox2</italic>-Cre mice.

To disrupt the gene encoding Ki-67, <italic>Mki67</italic>, in the mouse germline, we used a TALEN pair targeting the unique ATG start codon. This is predicted to generate null alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). After cytoplasmic injection of these TALEN-encoding mRNAs into zygotes, 10 out of 54 mice had mutations disrupting the coding sequence. We crossed founder mutant mice, and four gave germline transmission of the mutation. Due to mosaicism, this resulted in six lines: two lines with mutations eliminating the initiation codon and four lines with deletions which cause frameshifts immediately downstream of the ATG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). From these, we selected a 2-nucleotide deletion (2nt∆) mutant that retains the ATG initiation codon but has a frameshift in the next codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and a 21-nucleotide deletion (21nt∆) that eliminates the ATG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We crossed these mice and, unexpectedly, obtained homozygous mutants at the expected Mendelian frequency that were indistinguishable from heterozygous or wild-type (WT) littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Both deletion mutant lines showed normal growth and were fertile. Sagittal sections from <italic>Mki67<sup>2nt∆/2nt∆</sup></italic> mice did not reveal any obvious defects in tissue morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since the intestinal epithelium is the most highly proliferative adult mouse tissue, we compared its morphology between WT and mutant mice. In WT animals, the proliferative crypt compartment was strongly stained for Ki-67 by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while only minimal levels of Ki-67 were observed in the differentiated cells on the villus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, top), as expected. In contrast, in the mutants, proliferating crypt cells showed only residual levels of Ki-67 staining by IHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, bottom) or immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Immunoblotting of intestinal epithelium preparations could detect a weak band of similar size to WT Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The signal was, however, reduced by at least 90% in both mutants compared to WT tissue. Three different Ki-67 antibodies gave similar results. These are all extremely sensitive as they recognise the highly repeated Ki-67 domain. They should also detect N-terminally truncated Ki-67 that would result from translation from the ATG at position 433. qRT-PCR analysis showed that Ki-67 mRNA level was, unexpectedly, increased rather than reduced in the intestinal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). In the intestinal epithelium, analysis of Wnt signalling and differentiation of goblet and tuft cells showed no differences between WT and <italic>Mki67<sup>21nt∆/21nt∆</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>).

Homozygous <italic>Mki67<sup>2nt∆/2nt∆</sup></italic>MEFs had at least 90% lower Ki-67 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We could not confirm by immunoblotting whether or not the protein was full-length or truncated since SDS-PAGE cannot resolve 15kDa differences between proteins of nearly 400 kDa, and no antibodies are available against the N-terminus of Ki-67. As with intestinal tissue, the loss of Ki-67 expression was not due to mRNA degradation, as shown by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). Indeed, in the homozygous mutant, the Ki-67 mRNA level was increased to a level comparable with that of proliferating NIH-3T3 cells. Mutant MEF proliferated comparably to controls, and flow cytometric assessment of EdU incorporation after a 1 hr EdU pulse showed similar numbers of replicating cells in Ki-67 WT and mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>The low level residual Ki-67 expression in homozygous Ki-67 mutants suggests that TALEN or the conceptually-related CRISPR approaches may not lead to complete loss of expression, even when the translation initiation codon has been mutated. To further investigate whether Ki-67 translation can occur with a mutated initiation codon, we used the same TALEN pair to generate monoclonal Ki-67 mutant mouse NIH-3T3 cell lines, allowing analyses of translation that are technically impossible using animal tissues. We also performed the same procedure in the absence of TALENs to isolate wild-type clones. We obtained nine mutants with very low Ki-67 expression. Cloning and sequencing showed that five had biallelic mutations around the ATG codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>). As in mice, even though Ki-67 was visible by immunofluorescence, Ki-67 was barely detectable by Western blot in all clones analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s9">Figure 3—figure supplement 9A</xref>). All clones proliferated efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s9">Figure 3—figure supplement 9B</xref>). qRT-PCR showed that mutants did not have decreased Ki-67 mRNA levels compared to WT NIH-3T3 cells; indeed, like mutant MEFs, clone 14 had a higher level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s9">Figure 3—figure supplement 9C</xref>). We selected two clones for further analysis of Ki-67 translation. Clone 14 had lost the ATG codon in one allele, but had acquired an insertion of 4 nucleotides after the ATG in the second allele, generating the same shifted reading frame as the <italic>Mki67<sup>2nt∆/2nt∆</sup></italic> mice. Clone 21 had lost the ATG codon in both alleles, thus mimicking the situation with <italic>Mki67<sup>21nt∆/21nt∆</sup></italic> mice. qRT-PCR quantification of Ki-67 mRNA from ribosome purifications shows that in clones 14 and 21 there was no decrease in ribosome association with Ki-67 mRNA; indeed, in clone 14 it increased, probably due to the higher Ki-67 mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s10">Figure 3—figure supplement 10</xref>). To definitively determine levels of Ki-67 translation in the mutants, we performed SILAC quantitative mass spectrometry from exponentially growing WT or mutant NIH-3T3 cells cultured in light (L) (WT) or heavy-labelled (H) medium (clones 14 and 21). Chromatin was purified and run on SDS-PAGE. Peptides were purified from two gel slices, one around the predicted size of full length Ki-67 (&gt;250 kDa; band 1) and one at a smaller size (130k Da-250 kDa, band 2). Ki-67 could not be positively identified in clones 14 and 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s11">Figure 3—figure supplement 11</xref>). In peptides from WT cells (L), 44 peptides derived from Ki-67 were identified by MS/MS. In contrast, in peptides from mutant cell lines (H), no MS/MS spectra for Ki-67 could be identified in either band. Selecting the ‘re-quantify’ option in MaxQuant (that forces quantitation of identified light peaks against any peaks that have the expected difference in m/z ratio), the ratios H/L observed for putative Ki-67 peaks were in the range of most typical contaminants that are only found unlabelled in a SILAC experiment. In band 1, the median normalised H/L intensity ratio of the 5 corresponding m/z peaks in clone 14 was 0.095 (mean, 0.100, SD, 0.02), and in clone 21 (7 peptides) was 0.191 (mean 0.203, SD 0.05). In band 2, which would result from truncated or degraded Ki-67, there were only 3 corresponding peaks, with median H/L ratios for clones 14 and 21 of 0.358 (mean, 0.402, SD, 0.30) and 0.500 (mean, 0.454, SD 0.33) respectively. Taken together, these results show that if Ki67 is translated in the mutant cell lines, it is at trace levels that are not positively identifiable by state-of-the-art mass spectrometry. At best, translation can occur from the mutated Ki-67 gene with an estimated 10% efficiency. The product is most likely an N-terminally truncated protein lacking the conserved FHA-domain, arising from a downstream in-frame ATG.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cells lacking Ki-67 proliferate efficiently</title><p>Given the above results, it remained possible that very low levels of Ki-67 remain after <italic>Mki67</italic> gene mutation and that they might suffice to sustain cell proliferation. To rule out this possibility we devised a 'double TALEN' strategy to completely eliminate Ki-67 expression. We designed and synthesised an additional TALEN pair targeting a sequence downstream of the translation stop codon. We co-transfected the ATG TALEN pair and the Stop TALEN pair with a GFP knock-in construct containing homology arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We thus isolated several monoclonal cell lines in which Ki-67 mRNA was essentially eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating efficient nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). These cell lines had no residual Ki-67 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), confirming that the basal immunostaining seen in clones 14 and 21 indeed reflected trace level Ki-67 expression. We used Southern blotting of genomic DNA to characterise these alleles. The 3’ end of the <italic>Mki67</italic> gene remained intact in all clones, while the 5’ end of mutants showed a rearrangement consistent with a tandem insertion of multiple copies of the knockin construct upstream of the <italic>Mki67</italic> ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the <italic>Mki67</italic> gene was severely disrupted but not deleted. These Ki-67-negative cells proliferated normally. Growth curves and DNA content profiles were indistinguishable from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Time-lapse videomicroscopy showed that although individual clones had slightly different cell cycle lengths, cell division time was not significantly different between WT and mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We noticed that mitotic cells of one of the clones lacking Ki-67 had an altered chromosomal periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Such a phenotype has previously been reported in Ki-67 knockdown HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>).

These were analysed by label-free mass spectrometry. This approach identified 406 proteins specific to the Ki-67 pulldown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These included known Ki-67 partners: CDK1, an established Ki-67 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blethrow et al., 2008</xref>), nucleolar protein NIFK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takagi et al., 2001</xref>), protein phosphatase 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>), and five subunits (HCFC1, HSPA8, MATRIN3, RBBP5 and WDR5) of a histone methylase complex that interacts with the nuclear receptor coregulator NRC (also known as NCOA6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garapaty et al., 2009</xref>). Gene ontology and STRING analysis classified the Ki-67 interactors as being enriched in two general processes: chromatin regulation and ribosomal biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Specifically, interactors could be subdivided into groups involved in chromatin modification and transcription, ribosomal subunit biogenesis, pre-rRNA processing, protein translation, and splicing. These interactions suggested that Ki-67 might be involved not only in ribosomal biogenesis, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rahmanzadeh et al., 2007</xref>), but also in regulating chromatin. Among chromatin regulators interacting with Ki-67, we found the NRC-interacting methylase complex; KMT2D, ASH2L and SUZ12 proteins which are components of MLL and PRC2/EED-EZH1 complexes which regulate histone H3 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pasini et al., 2004</xref>); SETD1A, HCFC1, HDAC2, YY1 and RCOR1, which are components of H3K4 demethylase complexes and co-repressors; and UHRF1, which binds to H3K9me3-modified chromatin and is involved in both maintaining DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bostick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guetg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rottach et al., 2010</xref>).

Briefly, soon after the onset of mitosis, when transcription is shut down, the nucleolus is rapidly disassembled; it then slowly reforms through the formation of intermediary organelles that undergo consecutive transformations, identifying three distinct organelle stages, and the process is complete by telophase. The first of these three intermediary organelles is a sheath of nucleolar proteins that forms around the surface of the mitotic chromosomes, the so-called 'perichromosomal region' or PR. To date, not much is known about the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors involved in PR formation. Remarkably, we found that Ki-67 depletion totally disrupted PR formation and PES1 no longer associated with the chromosome surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). A similar finding, using other nucleolar proteins than PES1 as PR markers, was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Having established that Ki-67 controls nucleolar assembly during mitosis, we wondered whether Ki-67 is required for pre-rRNA processing. We found that Ki-67 knocked down U2OS cells, that have essentially undetectable Ki-67, could still incorporate normal levels of 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) in nucleolar RNA. This suggests that rRNA transcription is not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next looked at pre-rRNA processing pathways by Northern blotting of precursor rRNAs or intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). This showed that silencing Ki-67 expression by shRNA or siRNA had no significant effect on pre-rRNA processing in four different cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We did, however, notice a marginal but reproducible increase in the level of the 47S precursor rRNA, indicating a mild delay in the early nucleolar pre-rRNA cleavage steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The tumour suppressor TP53 (p53) is a sensor of nucleolar stress resulting from defective ribosome biogenesis, and it represses ribosomal gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bursac et al., 2014</xref>). Impairment of early pre-rRNA cleavage steps upon depletion of Ki-67 was independent of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that while Ki-67 is dispensable for efficient pre-rRNA processing, it is essential for the formation of the perichromosomal layer during nucleologenesis.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13722.032</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Ki-67 is not required for rRNA biogenesis but controls gene transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Northern-blot analysis of total RNA extracted from HeLa and U2OS cells constitutively expressing shRNA against Ki-67; and HeLa, U2OS, HCT-116 and HCT-116 TP53 (-/-) depleted of Ki-67 by siRNA for 72 hr in two biological replicates (#1 and #2) or with scrambled siRNA control (Scr).

We next asked whether it is involved in control of mRNA expression. We performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis from U2OS and HeLa cells expressing non-silencing control or Ki-67 shRNA, using Agilent gene-microarrays. Ki-67 knockdown led to downregulation (corrected p value &lt;0.02, Fold-change &gt;1.5) of over 200 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Expression of cell cycle regulatory genes was not affected.

We thus hypothesised that Ki-67 might be required for heterochromatin compaction. To directly assess chromatin compaction in living cells, we used a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer-Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FRET-FLIM)-based assay. In this system, HeLa cells stably co-express versions of histone H2B labelled with eGFP and mCherry. Inter-nucleosomal interactions between H2B-eGFP and H2B-mCherry generates FRET, whose efficiency depends on the distance between nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Llères et al., 2009</xref>).

To determine whether Ki-67 knockdown also affects long range interactions, we assessed interactions between perinucleolar and pericentromeric heterochromatin. We stained for the centromeric histone variant CENP-A to determine the localisation of centromeric DNA. In HeLa and U2OS cells, CENP-A showed a non-random nuclear localisation and clustered around nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>, arrowheads), confirming that CENP-A can be used as a surrogate marker for adjacent pericentromeric DNA. Consistent with our hypothesis, this interaction was disrupted upon Ki-67 knockdown, and the CENP-A signal was no longer grouped around nucleoli but dispersed throughout the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). These results imply that Ki-67 mediates interaction between different regions in the genome that are normally packaged into heterochromatin, and could potentially maintain silencing of genes by recruiting them to constitutive heterochromatin.</p><p>Constitutive heterochromatin, including PNHC, is characterised by histone post-translational modifications H3K9me3 and H4K20me3. We asked whether they were affected by downregulation of Ki-67. Stable shRNA-mediated Ki-67 knockdown in HeLa, U2OS and inducible knockdown in BJ-hTERT fibroblasts caused a visible reduction in nucleolar staining of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">3</xref>). This mark was relocalised either to foci in proximity to the nucleolus or a punctate pattern dispersed throughout the nucleus. In mouse cells, where pericentromeric heterochromatin is prominent, H3K9me3 staining colocalised with DAPI-dense chromocentres, but TALEN-ablation of <italic>Mki67</italic> resulted in general nuclear punctate H3K9me3 that was excluded from nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>). Western blotting revealed that Ki-67 depletion did not affect the overall levels of these chromatin modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s4">Figure 10—figure supplement 4</xref>). We also analysed the localisation of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which binds to chromatin containing H3K9me3. Immunofluoresence showed that, surprisingly, despite the loss of the intense H3K9me3 staining regions in the <italic>Mki67</italic> mutant cells, all three HP1 isoforms maintained their localisation at DAPI-dense regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s5">Figure 10—figure supplement 5</xref>). Next, we determined whether heterochromatic histone marks were reduced on specific DNA sequences, or whether they were retained but the sequences themselves were delocalised. To do this we examined co-localisation of H3K9me3 with mouse major satellite DNA, by combining immunofluorescence with fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). In control cells, major satellite DNA, DAPI-dense regions and H3K9me3 largely colocalised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). In cells lacking Ki-67, major satellite DNA was still present at regions of compacted DNA, despite the loss of H3K9me3 at these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that Ki-67 is required for maintaining heterochromatic histone marks at genomic regions that are organised into heterochromatin.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13722.039</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Ki-67 controls heterochromatin organisation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top, immunofluorescence analysis of H3K9me3 in mouse NIH-3T3 WT and <italic>Mki67</italic> TALEN mutant clones 60 and 65.

To see whether Ki-67 is sufficient to promote heterochromatin formation, we cloned a full-length cDNA encoding human Ki-67, that we fused to the eGFP gene, and transfected it into U2OS cells. There was a strong correlation between cells with higher levels of exogenous Ki-67 and appearance of DAPI-dense foci resembling ectopic heterochromatin, marked by H3K9me3 and HP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). Cells showing this phenotype were negative for cyclin A staining, suggesting that they were unable to enter S-phase, whereas lower expression did not prevent cyclin A accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). They were also negative for histone H3 Ser-10 phosphorylation, a mitotic marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). If controlling heterochromatin organisation is a major function of Ki-67, it is likely to be conserved in more distantly related Ki-67 homologues. In a proteomics-based screen for proteins associated with replicating chromatin in egg extracts, we identified a putative <italic>Xenopus</italic> Ki-67 homologue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2</xref>). To assess whether <italic>Xenopus</italic> and human Ki-67 are functionally conserved, we cloned and HA-tagged full-length <italic>Xenopus</italic> Ki-67 and expressed it in U2OS cells. Whereas in interphase, exogenous <italic>Xenopus</italic> Ki-67 is present ubiquitously on chromatin, it colocalises with endogenous Ki-67 in mitosis at the perichromosomal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Ki-67, like human Ki-67, caused extreme chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>).

Using various genetic and knockdown approaches, we found no evidence for this in any cell type we tested: HeLa, U2OS, BJ-hTERT and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Our data show that Ki-67 expression can be uncoupled from cell proliferation in both directions. Indeed, not only can cells lacking Ki-67 proliferate efficiently, conversely, interfering with Ki-67 downregulation by disrupting the <italic>Cdh1</italic> gene did not prevent cell cycle exit in vivo. It remains possible that certain cell lines are more sensitive to inhibition of Ki-67 expression, eg cancer cell lines of bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kausch et al., 2003</xref>) or renal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2009</xref>) origins. Alternatively, off-target effects of previous antisense or RNAi approaches might have contributed to the cell proliferation defects observed in previous studies, as none of them employed restoration controls using silencing-insensitive constructs. Such rescue experiments are virtually unfeasible given the large size of Ki-67, the targeting of silencing oligonucleotides to the repeated domains, and the fact that Ki-67 overexpression induces ectopic heterochromatin. Several other studies used different approaches. In one, microinjection of an anti-Ki-67 antibody in 3T3 cells did not cause an abolition of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Starborg et al., 1996</xref>). Instead, there was a modest reduction, from 80% to 64%, of dividing cells over a 36-hr period. Another study used chromophore-mediated light inactivation of Ki-67 after injecting chromophore-labelled Ki-67 antibodies, and found an inhibition of ribosomal RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rahmanzadeh et al., 2007</xref>). However, such an approach might cause non-specific collateral damage to nucleolar processes where Ki-67 is localised.</p><p>We found that rather than promoting cell proliferation, the role of Ki-67 is to organise heterochromatin. We showed that Ki-67 is required for the maintenance of a high level of compaction typical of heterochromatin, and mediates long-range interactions between different regions of the genome that are packaged into heterochromatin. We speculate that heterochromatin compaction relies on local interactions that depend on Ki-67. Cells lacking Ki-67 show altered gene expression profiles upon long-term Ki-67 silencing, with a striking correlation between upregulation of genes that normally are physically associated with perinucleolar heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Németh et al., 2010</xref>). To determine possible mechanisms of action of Ki-67, we comprehensively identified its interacting partners. We thus found at least seventeen proteins that are involved in histone methylation complexes or are interactors of methylated chromatin required for heterochromatin maintenance. This suggests that Ki67 might target these proteins to their genomic sites to promote heterochromatin formation. Consistent with this hypothesis, Ki-67 downregulation led to reduction of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 at heterochromatin, while Ki-67 overexpression caused appearance of ectopic heterochromatic foci enriched in these methylation marks. Unexpectedly, Ki-67 downregulation did not prevent association of HP1 isoforms with heterochromatin. Possibly, low levels of H3K9me3 or H4K20me3 persist and are sufficient for recruitment of HP1, or alternative mechanisms exist to localise HP1 to chromatin. The former hypothesis would be consistent with the observation that loss of the Suv39H methyltransferases that are responsible for H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 abrogates HP1 recruitment to heterochromatin in mice, whose late embryonic growth and survival is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peters et al., 2001</xref>). Nevertheless, evidence for the latter possibility has been provided by a study in <italic>C.elegans</italic>, in which genome-wide distribution of HP1 binding, as assessed by ChIP-seq, was conserved in animals lacking H3K9 di- and trimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garrigues et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Given the requirement for Ki-67 expression in organising heterochromatin, it is perhaps surprising that mouse development is not affected by Ki-67 downregulation. This once again highlights the robustness of biological systems. However, to determine whether mouse development can occur normally in the complete absence of Ki-67 will require a gene deletion rather than a gene disruption mediated by genome-editing, as we found that even deletion of the translation initiation ATG using TALENs did not completely abolish Ki-67 expression. The eight subsequent ATG codons are out of frame, and the next in-frame ATG is 433 bp downstream. Translation from any frameshifted ATG will lead to a premature stop codon within 65 nucleotides. Although NMD of the mRNA did not occur, translation was strongly reduced. This is probably due to the presence of many out-of-frame ATG codons before the next in-frame ATG codon, as well as the distance from the 5’ end of the mRNA. It is likely that the residual Ki-67 in proliferating cells occurred from the next in-frame ATG, thus eliminating the most highly conserved domain of Ki-67, the Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. However, the unexpected translation in the mutants suggests that care should be taken to examine possible low level expression of proteins after mutating start sites using genome editing approaches.</p><p>Since Ki-67 is degraded upon cell cycle exit, we speculate that this may alter chromatin structure. For example, Ki-67 degradation might be involved in heterochromatin rearrangements observed during senescence onset. Facultative heterochromatic foci, that characterise some senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Narita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2006</xref>) are not a consistent feature of senescence in all cell types. In contrast, large-scale satellite heterochromatin decondensation is an early step in senescence in all cells studied and it precedes loss of H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Swanson et al., 2013</xref>). As Ki-67 is required for heterochromatin compaction, its degradation may be involved in the heterochromatin decompaction occurring upon senescence onset. Heterochromatin reorganisation caused by Ki-67 downregulation does not interfere with cell cycle progression or cell proliferation, but likely contributes to remodelling of gene expression. Heterochromatin is also less compact in highly proliferative pluripotent stem cells, suggesting that heterochromatin organisation is critical for determining transcriptional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fussner et al., 2011</xref>). Ki-67 overexpression, which led to pronounced chromatin condensation, appeared to arrest the cell cycle in G1, implying that controlled Ki-67 degradation is required to allow unperturbed progression through the cell cycle.</p><p>The nucleolus is a potent cancer biomarker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Derenzini et al., 2009</xref>), and a recently demonstrated target in cancer therapy. Inhibitors of nucleolar functions have indeed been shown to selectively kill cancer cells, leaving non-cancerous cells intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bywater et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peltonen et al., 2014</xref>). It is therefore critical to understand how the nucleolus forms during mitosis. An important step in nucleolar assembly is the formation of a sheath of nucleolar proteins around the chromosome surface on the metaphase plate. This so-called perichromosomal layer has been suggested to play roles in chromosome protection, in the faithful partitioning of nucleolar proteins between daughter cells, and in the segregation of opportunistic passenger proteins. Whether the PR performs any of these functions or has other, unidentified, roles will be a promising field for future studies. In this study, we have identified Ki-67 as one of the first <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors involved in PR formation during nucleologenesis, corroborating a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our data reveal a novel concept whereby heterochromatin organisation is linked to cell proliferation by Ki-67. As heterochromatin organisation is often compromised in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carone and Lawrence, 2013</xref>) and Ki-67 expression is widely used in clinical assessments in cancer, these data provide a rationale for further investigation of the functional consequences of Ki-67 expression in tumour samples. Importantly, our data suggest that Ki-67 is likely to modulate transcription in cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with international ethics standards and were subjected to approval by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of Languedoc Roussillon.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Normal human diploid foreskin fibroblasts (HDF) were provided by Jacques Piette (CRBM, Montpellier), the <italic>hTERT</italic>-immortalized foreskin fibroblast cell line (BJ hTERT) was provided by Jean Marc Lemaitre (IRB, Montpellier).

Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) was performed using an inverted laser scanning multiphoton microscope LSM780 (Zeiss) equipped with temperature-controlled environmental black walls chamber. Measurements were acquired at 37°C, with a 63× oil immersion lens NA 1.4 Plan-Apochromat objective from Zeiss. Two-photon excitation was achieved using a Chameleon Ultra II tunable (680–1080 nm) laser (Coherent) to pump a mode-locked frequency-doubled Ti:Sapphire laser that provided sub-150-femtosecond pulses at a 80-Mhz repetition rate with an output power of 3.3 W at the peak of the tuning curve (800 nm). Enhanced detection of the emitted photons was afforded by the use of the HPM-100 module (Hamamatsu R10467-40 GaAsP hybrid PMT tube). The fluorescence lifetime imaging capability was provided by TCSPC electronics (SPC- 830; Becker &amp; Hickl GmbH). TCSPC measures the time elapsed between laser pulses and the fluorescence photons. EGFP and mCherry fluorophores were used as a FRET pair. The optimal two-photon excitation wavelength to excite the donor (EGFP) was determined to be 890 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Llères et al., 2007</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript has improved and is now more focused on revisiting the prevailing models for Ki-67 functions and heterochromatin organization. Considering that the work represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of the role of Ki-67, it is likely of broad interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readers. The major concerns raised by reviewers have been acceptably answered: assessment of remaining Ki-67 expression in the Ki-67 mutants is exhaustive and well performed; all subtypes of heterochromatin protein (HP1alpha/β/γ) were tested. However, the reviewers have some outstanding concerns.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One remaining concern is with the H3K9 and K4K20 data that leads the authors to conclude &quot;trimethylation of histone H3K9 and H4K20 at heterochromatin is strongly reduced&quot; in the abstract. Looking at the data, in Figure 10—figure supplement 1, this is not apparent. It does seem reduced, but it is hard to tell. The authors could do some quantification here as they have done for some of the other microscopy-based data. A result featured so strongly in the Abstract should be backed by clear data. Either the authors should tone down the Abstract and put the caveats in the paper, or bolster these data.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work, &quot;Ki-67 organises heterochromatin to control gene expression during cell proliferation&quot;, for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your work has been seen by three reviewers, one of who is a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic> as they currently stand.</p><p>In principle all three reviewers were interested in your discoveries. We think that the role of Ki-67 in vivo is a potentially important advance.</p><p>However we have two main concerns.</p><p>Firstly, the paper came across as a bit incoherent. We think that this is mainly due to the large number of different models and techniques you used, which could be addressed by streamlining the writing of the paper. I think that this aspect could be improved through changes to the text to allow them to streamline this and frame things on a key question or a couple of main points. Alternatively, you could eliminate some of the unnecessary approaches from the paper to assist this streamlining. Generally, rather than setting the paper up as opposing previous work in some way, the authors should know that this paper clearly stands out as an important advance on its own. Highlighting their work for what it reveals related to the core functions of Ki-67 and citing the other work where appropriate for both the similarities and differences will nicely indicate this.</p><p>Secondly, and more importantly, there are a number of technical problems that we feel preclude publication at this point.</p><p>We are generally worried about your mouse alleles.</p><p>1) The way in which the authors generated these mice was through the introduction of TALEN-mediated mutations. These would disrupt aspects of Ki-67 expression based on the mutations listed in Figure 4, but it is certainly possible that there is the expression of a N-terminally truncated product utilizing a downstream AUG. The highly cropped Western blot presented in this figure does not exclude the possibility that there are other versions of the protein produced that confer some function. It is also not clear from their Methods section which region of the protein the utilized antibodies recognize, and whether it is possible that alternative forms of this are produced in their mutants.</p><p>2) The fact that tissues from the Ki-67 delete mouse still stains for Ki-67 is concerning. The authors suggest that this could be due to a downstream ATG that is still functional. This should be investigated using RT-qPCR.</p><p>At a minimum, we would like you to more thoroughly investigate the state of your alleles. But this could mean generating new mouse alleles, which would clearly require a new submission because it would take longer than two months.</p><p>We also have some other technical issues.</p><p>1) Previous studies that identified important roles for Ki-67 in nucleolar structure and RNA biogenesis (most recently the paper by Booth et al.) used siRNA-mediated knockdowns, and in fact they rescued the phenotypes that they observed using hardened constructs. For the experiments conducted in this paper in human cells, they primarily used shRNA-mediated depletion, which is typically less efficient.</p><p>2) rRNA biogenesis does appear to be affected at some steps (e.g. 47S). Quantification and replicates are necessary.</p><p>3) There appears to be a modest cell cycle defect after Ki-67 disruption (see Figures 3E, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, Figure 2—figure supplement 2C). The cell cycle certainly isn't halted, however, it would be good to soften claims that use strong wording like, &quot;dispensible&quot;. To support the conclusion, single cells have to be filmed for around the doubling time (or 24 hr or longer) upon knockdown or knockout of Ki-67.</p><p>4) While the authors describe &quot;Surprisingly, HP1 localization was not altered (Figure 7B)&quot; in the Results section, they tested only HP1beta. HP1 has subtypes of α, β, and γ, with HP1a and g relatively more important in cell division. I am very surprised at this over-simplification. HP1alpha and HP1gamma must be also stained in the background of Ki-67 downregulation. Without this experiment, any statement about &quot;HP1 localization&quot; is difficult to make with confidence.</p><p>We realize that this is a high bar to set-but we think that sorting out these technical issues is important for your work to have the impact that it deserves. This is especially true in this case because of the varied role of KI-67 reported in the literature. Please note that we aim to publish articles with a single round of revision that would typically be accomplished within two months.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13722.049</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: One remaining concern is with the H3K9 and K4K20 data that leads the authors to conclude &quot;trimethylation of histone H3K9 and H4K20 at heterochromatin is strongly reduced&quot; in the abstract.

Either the authors should tone down the Abstract and put the caveats in the paper, or bolster these data.</italic></p><p>We would argue that the statement in the Abstract was technically correct – that H3K9 and H4K20 is strongly reduced at heterochromatin (though it is not changed in overall levels). For example, in Figure 10A, the H3K9me3 no longer colocalises with the intense DAPI spots that identify heterochromatin. However, we accept that this could be slightly misleading if read wrongly, and it is true that this is hard to see if one does not look closely, especially for Figure 10—figure supplement 1. And of course there remained a doubt as to whether heterochromatin organisation itself is the same in the knockdown cells (which it probably isn’t, in spite of the retention of HP1 staining).</p><p>We have thus made the following changes.</p><p>1) We changed the wording in the Abstract to: “Trimethylation of histone H3K9 and H4K20 was relocalised within the nucleus”.</p><p>2) We have used imaging tools to better represent the H3K9 and H4K20 staining in U2OS and HeLa cells control and knockdown cells (new Figure 10—figure supplements 1 and 2). Using the “Fire” Look-up table pseudocolour scheme, the altered patterns of histone methylation become more apparent, especially as we have enlarged these images. This shows that on Ki-67 knockdown, the majority of cells show less intense peak methylation mark staining, and both the peak intensity of the mark and the DAPI-dense chromatin are relocalised away from the nucleoli, confirming a relocalisation of H3K9me3/H4K20me3, and possibly of heterochromatin itself.</p><p>3) We have quantified the number of cells showing each pattern, and this is presented graphically below the images (new Figure 10—figure supplements 1 and 2).</p><p>Unfortunately, we could not perform the same exercise for the BJ-hTERT cells, where nucleoli (and the histone methylation marks) are much less visible. We could not objectively define nucleoli in these cells, and our attempts at co-staining H3K9me3/H4K20me3 (which is best visualised using methanol fixation) and nucleolin (best visualised using formaldehyde fixation) were not successful. Therefore, we kept the original qualitative BJ—hTERT data, since they show a qualitatively similar result in non-transformed cells, and separated it into a new figure supplement: Figure 10—figure supplement 3.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>In principle all three reviewers were interested in your discoveries.

Highlighting their work for what it reveals related to the core functions of Ki-67 and citing the other work where appropriate for both the similarities and differences will nicely indicate this.</italic> </p><p>This is a very good suggestion. It was a highly multidisciplinary study of several aspects of Ki-67 function and regulation with several conclusions. It is indeed possible to focus on the key points. We have now done this in three main ways, and we agree that the result is a much more streamlined paper:</p><p>1) We have completely reordered the paper. We now start with the key in vivo results of overexpression and mutation of Ki-67 in the mouse. We then follow on with the characterisation of cell proliferation in the functional knockout mouse lines. All complementary work on cell proliferation in human cancer cell lines using RNAi has been relegated to supplementary information. We continue with the proteomics of Ki-67 interactors that opens up avenues in ribosome biogenesis and chromatin regulation. To take this further, we present work on rRNA processing and gene expression. The rest of the paper is then dedicated to the role of Ki-67 in organising heterochromatin.</p><p>2) We have removed two somewhat more descriptive sections. These sections were on control of Ki-67 expression on CDK4/6 activity and proteasome-mediated degradation, and on requirements for Ki-67 for tumour progression using xenografts of knockdown and control cancer cells in mice. We considered that these were potentially important from a medical point of view and so included them in the original paper. But thanks to the criticisms of reviewers we have now decided it would be more appropriate to remove these and publish them in a more specialised journal.</p><p>3) We have strengthened the existing sections on the cell cycle, ribosome biogenesis and control of heterochromatin with additional work, detailed below.</p><p> <italic>Secondly, and more importantly, there are a number of technical problems that we feel preclude publication at this point. We are generally worried about your mouse alleles. 1) The way in which the authors generated these mice was through the introduction of TALEN-mediated mutations. These would disrupt aspects of Ki-67 expression based on the mutations listed in Figure 4, but it is certainly possible that there is the expression of a N-terminally truncated product utilizing a downstream AUG. The highly cropped Western blot presented in this figure does not exclude the possibility that there are other versions of the protein produced that confer some function. It is also not clear from their Methods section which region of the protein the utilized antibodies recognize, and whether it is possible that alternative forms of this are produced in their mutants.</italic> </p><p> <italic>2) The fact that tissues from the Ki-67 delete mouse still stains for Ki-67 is concerning. The authors suggest that this could be due to a downstream ATG that is still functional. This should be investigated using RT-qPCR. At a minimum, we would like you to more thoroughly investigate the state of your alleles. But this could mean generating new mouse alleles, which would clearly require a new submission because it would take longer than two months.</italic> This is also a perfectly valid comment. We consider that it is vitally important that researchers in genetics, and mouse genetics in particular, should be aware that endonuclease-generated “knockouts” may not be functional knockouts. Many researchers these days (including ourselves) target genes in cell lines using CrispR to ablate the translation initiation ATG codon. We did this for Ki-67 in both cell lines and in the mouse using the related (and still recent) technology of TALENs. Because Ki-67 antibodies are highly sensitive (they recognise a highly repeated sequence and have been extensively optimised due to their biomedical use), we can detect what appears to be residual expression in biallelic mutants, both in the mouse and in monoclonal cell lines. Typically, we see many smaller lower intensity bands even in wild-type cells, probably resulting either from protein degradation (even within cells) or alternative splicing isoforms. All bands are strongly reduced on knockdown or mutation, but we do not usually blot the entire membrane. Western blots already presented were not artificially cropped, the membranes had been cut to allow probing for other proteins at different molecular weights. We agree that it is important to investigate further the apparent residual expression in Ki-67 mutants and we have spent the majority of the last three months doing this. Briefly, we have done the following:</p><p>1) We have revitalised a second mouse line that we had frozen as sperm. Whereas the first (∆2nt) mouse retained the ATG translation initiation codon but had an immediate downstream frameshift, the second mouse line (∆21nt) has lost the initiation ATG codon. We investigated whether this would generate a functional knockout and if not, how this would affect expression. ∆21nt homozygotes show an identical lack of phenotype to the first mouse, and a very similar residual level of Ki-67 protein in proliferating tissues, that we estimated to be around 10%. Additionally, we isolated MEFs from the ∆2nt mouse and performed qRT-PCR and Western blotting. We present an uncropped Western blot demonstrating that there is no appearance of a shorter form. This led to an identical conclusion: destroying the ATG eliminates the majority, but probably not all, of the expression.</p><p>2) We have characterised the residual expression by exploiting two new monoclonal mouse cell lines that we generated, which have similar genetic alterations to the ∆2nt and ∆21nt mice, respectively. Importantly, by Western blotting and immunofluorescence these showed very similar residual Ki-67 expression levels to the mutant mice and MEFs. The use of immortal mouse cell lines rather than proliferative tissues (the intestine is, of course, sensitive to protein degradation) enabled us to undertake a sophisticated analysis of translation. This involved, firstly, qRT-PCR of mRNA levels, showing that mRNA expression is not decreased (there is no nonsense-mediated decay). We confirmed that this is also true in the intestinal tissue and in MEFs. We then performed two series of experiments that are technically virtually impossible in vivo. In the first, we purified and quantified Ki-67 mRNA from different ribosomal fractions. Again, neither mutant showed a decrease in levels that would have indicated a decrease in translation initiation. This implies that the approximately 10-fold reduction seen in protein levels by Western blotting results not from defective translation initiation but from frameshifted (and potentially truncated) translation. Finally, we performed SILAC-proteomics by mass spectrometry to quantify Ki-67 protein in the mutants and attempt to identify whether it is truncated or not. This showed that in both mutants Ki-67 is undetectable – no Ki-67 heavy peptides were identifiable by MS/MS. Nevertheless, by expected peak m/z isotopic pattern similarity to the control sample peptides, we could identify and quantify a number of peptides in the mutants that may derive from Ki-67. This led to several main conclusions. Firstly, there is probably residual Ki-67 translation in the biallelic mutants but the level is <italic>extremely</italic> low. No residual expression could be positively identified in either of the two mutants, one of which retains the ATG on one allele but has an immediate frameshift thereafter, the other lacking the ATG altogether. Quantitation of the putative Ki-67 peptides in the mutants revealed that this protein is present at about 10% of the level of full length Ki-67 in the WT. Finally, no putative peptides were detected that could derive from the N-terminus, suggesting that the basal expression is of an N-terminally truncated protein.</p><p>3) We have investigated by Southern blotting the nature of the alleles in the TALEN mutant clones that have a total absence of Ki-67 expression. This shows a multiple tandem insertion of the GFP gene upstream of the Ki-67 initiation ATG.</p><p><italic>We also have some other technical issues. 1) Previous studies that identified important roles for Ki-67 in nucleolar structure and RNA biogenesis (most recently the paper by Booth et al.) used siRNA-mediated knockdowns, and in fact they rescued the phenotypes that they observed using hardened constructs. For the experiments conducted in this paper in human cells, they primarily used shRNA-mediated depletion, which is typically less efficient.</italic> </p><p>We mainly used shRNA to confirm in human cells results seen using mutation of the Ki-67 gene in the mouse. Our shRNA was, however, highly optimised to ensure the most effective knockdown possible. We firstly characterised three different shRNA vectors and chose the most efficient. We then used increasingly high levels of puromycin selection after lentiviral infection, and FACs sorting based on intensity of the co-expressed turbo-GFP or RFP, to generate stable cell lines with the highest expression. For inducible shRNA we additionally used high doxycyclin levels for induction of the shRNA. However, the experiment using inducible shRNA in non-transformed cells to prevent Ki-67 expression upon re-entry into the cell cycle shows less effective knockdown. This is because the shRNA is not well induced by doxycyclin in serum-starved cells. We were only able to do this experiment by inducing the shRNA prior to serum starvation. We should add, however, that we also used siRNA for several sets of experiments, notably the H2B-FRET and pre-rRNA processing experiments. Nobody, however, has performed rescue of full-length Ki-67 using si/sh-resistant constructs: careful reading of the Booth et al. paper shows that the siRNA-resistant Ki-67 employed is only a fairly short N-terminal fragment (that nevertheless rescued the nucleolar protein targeting).</p><p> <italic>2) rRNA biogenesis does appear to be affected at some steps (e.g. 47S). Quantification and replicates are necessary.</italic> </p><p>There indeed does appear to be a very slight increase in the 47S product; we have verified and quantified this in replicates in several different cell lines.</p><p><italic>3) There appears to be a modest cell cycle defect after Ki-67 disruption (see Figure 3E, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, Figure 2—figure supplement 2C). The cell cycle certainly isn't halted, however, it would be good to soften claims that use strong wording like, &quot;dispensible&quot;. To support the conclusion, single cells have to be filmed for around the doubling time (or 24 hr or longer) upon knockdown or knockout of Ki-67.</italic> </p><p>We originally showed 5-day growth curves that show that there is no significant decrease in cell proliferation in the mutants. As requested, we have now done time-lapse on the mutant cells that express no residual Ki-67. We thus quantified cell cycle length. Within a clone there is significant variability in cell cycle length between cells. While one of the two mutant clones (60) has a marginally longer cell cycle (p&lt;0.05), this appears to be a clone effect as the other clone (65) does not. The latter clone does, however, show an unusual mitotic chromosome morphology, as the Booth et al., paper also shows using siRNA. Cells could, however, divide normally. And we have quantified EdU incorporation by FACs to determine the sensitivity of the mutant clones to serum starvation. This shows that, indeed, there is a mild effect of loss of Ki-67 in these mutant clones: cells starve more effectively, fewer of them remain able to incorporate EdU after 72h at 0.1% serum. Nevertheless, this does not alter our conclusion that starved cells are perfectly capable of entering into and progressing through the cell cycle in the absence of detectable Ki-67. We have, as requested, altered the language used in the paper.</p><p><italic>4) While the authors describe &quot;Surprisingly, HP1 localization was not altered (Figure 7B)&quot; in the Results section, they tested only HP1beta. HP1 has subtypes of α, β, and γ, with HP1a and g relatively more important in cell division. I am very surprised at this over-simplification. HP1alpha and HP1gamma must be also stained in the background of Ki-67 downregulation. Without this experiment, any statement about &quot;HP1 localization&quot; is difficult to make with confidence.</italic> </p><p>We had actually at various times performed localisation of all three HP1 isoforms in different cell lines, but not always in the same experiment. We did not see any obvious effect of Ki-67 loss on localisation pattern of any isoform. We have now done this systematically to look at all three isoforms in the same experiment, and we reproduce our previous conclusions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
