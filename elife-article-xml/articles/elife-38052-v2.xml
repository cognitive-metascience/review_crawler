Much progress has been made toward identifying the contribution of specific neuronal populations in hippocampal oscillations, but less is known about the role of hippocampal area CA2, which is thought to support social memory. Furthermore, the little evidence on the role of CA2 in oscillations has yielded conflicting conclusions. Therefore, we sought to identify the contribution of CA2 to oscillations using a controlled experimental system. We used excitatory and inhibitory DREADDs to manipulate CA2 neuronal activity and studied resulting hippocampal-prefrontal cortical network oscillations. We found that modification of CA2 activity bidirectionally regulated hippocampal and prefrontal cortical low-gamma oscillations and inversely modulated hippocampal ripple oscillations in mice. These findings support a role for CA2 in low-gamma generation and ripple modulation within the hippocampus and underscore the importance of CA2 in extrahippocampal oscillations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hippocampal CA2</kwd><kwd>DREADD</kwd><kwd>hM3Dq</kwd><kwd>hM4Di</kwd><kwd>gamma oscillation</kwd><kwd>ripple</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES100221</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dudek</surname><given-names>S M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hippocampal area CA2 controls low gamma and ripple oscillations, brain waves known to be impaired in schizophrenia, implicating this important brain region in cognition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Area CA2 has become appreciated as a distinct subfield of the hippocampus based on several molecular, synaptic, anatomical, and functional properties (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dudek et al., 2016</xref> for review). We and others have recently identified similarities and differences between CA2 and the neighboring CA1 and CA3 subfields based on action potential firing <italic>in vivo </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mankin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kay et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to action potential firing, another form of neuronal communication may be achieved through synchronized oscillations, which reflect the summated electrical activity of a population of neurons and can be detected in local field potentials (LFPs). CA1 and CA3 networks propagate oscillations in three primary frequency bands: theta (~5 – 10 Hz), gamma (~30 – 100 Hz) and sharp-wave ripples (~100 – 250 Hz). A few studies have reported properties of network oscillations in CA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oliva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boehringer et al., 2017</xref>), but none of them have examined CA2 gamma oscillations or the impact of CA2 oscillations on extrahippocampal structures.</p><p>In the hippocampus, high- and low-gamma oscillations are thought to arise from two distinct sources and likely play separate roles in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>). High-gamma (~60 – 100 Hz) oscillations in CA1 are prevalent in <italic>stratum lacunosum-moleculare </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>), co-occur with high-gamma oscillations in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>), are increased by Gq-Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD)-mediated activation of cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>), and are impaired by lesioning of EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bragin et al., 1995</xref>), leading to the conclusion that high-gamma oscillations arise from MEC. High-gamma is thought to contribute to memory encoding because high-gamma power is increased upon exploration of novel stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kemere et al., 2013</xref>). Low-gamma (~30 – 55 Hz) oscillations in CA1 are prevalent in <italic>stratum radiatum </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>), synchronize with low-gamma in CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colgin, 2015</xref>), and become more evident upon EC lesioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bragin et al., 1995</xref>), supporting the conclusion that low-gamma oscillations arise from CA3. Low-gamma oscillations are believed to promote memory retrieval because the magnitude of low-gamma coupling to theta oscillations correlates with performance on learned behavioral tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shirvalkar et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, complete silencing of the synaptic output of CA3 with tetanus toxin light chain does not completely impair low-gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Middleton and McHugh, 2016</xref>), suggesting the presence of another source of low-gamma oscillations.</p><p>Another prominent oscillation seen in hippocampus is sharp-wave ripple oscillations, which are high frequency (~100 – 250 Hz), short-duration electrical events prominently seen in LFP recordings from CA1 during awake immobility and slow wave sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki et al., 1992</xref>). Sharp waves are thought to arise from the synchronous firing of CA3 pyramidal cells, which depolarize the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells. The synchronous CA3 firing recruits excitatory and inhibitory neurons in CA1 to generate ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ylinen et al., 1995</xref>). A role for CA2 neurons in sharp-wave ripples has recently been suggested based on three <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiology studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oliva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boehringer et al., 2017</xref>), although consensus has not been reached on the precise role that these neurons play. found that CA2 is the only hippocampal subregion to have a substantial population of neurons that cease firing during ripples (termed ‘N cells’), whereas nearly all pyramidal cells queried in neighboring subfields fired during ripples. Although not associated with ripples, these N cells fired at high rates during low running speed or immobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kay et al., 2016</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oliva et al. (2016)</xref> later reported that CA2 pyramidal cell activity ramps up before the onset of sharp-wave ripples, leading these authors to conclude that CA2 neurons play a leading role in ripple generation. By contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boehringer et al. (2017)</xref> later found that chronic silencing of CA2 pyramidal cell output leads to the occurrence of epileptic discharges arising from CA3, which the authors suggested reflect anomalous ripple oscillations. Accordingly, findings of the Boehringer study do not appear to support the conclusion of that CA2 neurons initiate ripples. Given the disparate conclusions of these reports, further study is required to clarify the role of CA2 neuronal activity in ripple generation.</p><p>Area CA2 has recently been recognized for its role in processing long-term memories containing socially relevant information in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pagani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, a mouse model of schizophrenia that shows hypoactive CA2 pyramidal cells <italic>in vitro</italic> also shows impaired social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piskorowski et al., 2016</xref>). Further, long-range synchrony between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), including low-gamma coherence, is impaired in another mouse model of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sigurdsson et al., 2010</xref>), raising the question of how altering CA2 pyramidal cell activity experimentally may impact social behavior and synchrony between hippocampus and PFC.</p><p>In this study, we present evidence that selective, acute activation or inhibition of CA2 pyramidal cells using Cre-dependent expression of Gq- and Gi-coupled DREADD receptors (hM3Dq and hM4Di, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>) bidirectionally modulates low-gamma oscillations in both hippocampus and PFC and ripple occurrence in hippocampus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increasing CA2 pyramidal cell activity increases hippocampal and prefrontal cortical low-gamma power</title><p>To gain selective genetic access to molecularly-defined CA2, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse line, <italic>Amigo2</italic>-icreERT2.

We measured oscillatory power during the 30 to 60 min time window following treatment during each of running and resting behavioral periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Conversely, we found that inhibiting CA2 pyramidal cell output decreased hippocampal and prefrontal cortical low-gamma power and increased hippocampal sharp-wave ripples.

Gamma oscillations in hippocampus and cortex reflect synchronous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) from a network of interconnected perisomatically targeted basket cells, with excitatory drive onto these interneurons arising from pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisahn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mercer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Valero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). The frequency of the gamma oscillations is thought to be controlled by the decay kinetics of the IPSP such that slower decay yields a lower gamma frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisahn et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Low-gamma oscillations in CA1 were previously reported to arise from neuronal activity in CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bragin et al., 1995</xref>). However, permanent silencing of CA3 output with tetanus toxin light chain produced only a 30% reduction in low-gamma power recorded in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Middleton and McHugh, 2016</xref>), thereby challenging the notion that CA3 is the only origin of hippocampal low-gamma oscillations. Here, we report that CA2 activation increases low-gamma power and that acute CA2 silencing reduces low-gamma power recorded in CA1 by approximately 20%. CA2 pyramidal cells target local inhibitory basket cells in CA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mercer et al., 2012</xref>), providing a mechanism for local gamma generation within CA2, as well as similar inhibitory neurons in CA1, permitting feed-forward excitation to drive IPSPs and gamma oscillations in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Valero et al., 2015</xref>). hM4Di was previously reported to substantially, but not entirely, inhibit synaptic neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stachniak et al., 2014</xref>), although we found that hM4Di produced near complete silencing of CA2 output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Complete silencing of CA2 with tetanus toxin light chain may reduce low-gamma power by greater than the 20% we observed here, but more likely, silencing of both CA2 and CA3 may be needed to abolish low-gamma power. Based on these findings, CA2 and CA3 together likely provide the excitatory drive required to generate low-gamma oscillations in CA1. Given the dynamic nature of the brain, we propose that when CA2 is inhibited, CA3, or another source, is capable of compensating, and vice versa. Further, gamma activity arising from CA2 and CA3 may engage distinct circuits involving the deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). As such, low-gamma oscillations arising from the two areas may subserve distinct cognitive functions based on the output of these two populations. In addition, the hippocampus is known to function in spatial navigation, and navigation strategies may be either cue-based, relying on sensory cued or landmarks to navigate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gothard et al., 1996</xref>), or sequence-based, relying on sequential steps or turns to navigate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rondi-Reig et al., 2006</xref>). Low-gamma oscillations, arising from CA2 and CA3 appear to be related to sequence-based navigation, consistent with a role in memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabral et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the low-gamma oscillations generated by CA2 neurons may contribute to sequence-based spatial navigation.</p><p>Modification of CA2 neuronal activity also affected the occurrence of sharp-wave ripple oscillations. Specifically, increasing CA2 activity with hM3Dq decreased the occurrence of ripples, whereas decreasing CA2 output with hM4Di increased ripple occurrence as well as amplitude. The mechanism underlying these findings likely includes the robust inhibition that CA2 presents over CA3 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boehringer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, CA2 pyramidal cells contact local parvalbumin-expressing basket cells, which project to CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mercer et al., 2012</xref>), and CA2 pyramidal cell firing is reported to discharge CA3 interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oliva et al., 2016</xref>). As a potential secondary mechanism underlying the observed inverse relationship between CA2 neuronal activity and occurrence of ripples, CA2 neurons preferentially target the deep layer of pyramidal cells in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>). During recordings of ripples from these deep CA1 pyramidal cells, dominant hyperpolarizations are observed, which contrasts with dominant depolarizations during ripples seen in superficial CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Valero et al., 2015</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Further, stimulation of CA2 neurons produces robust feed-forward inhibitory responses onto CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boehringer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Valero et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, silencing of CA2 neurons may remove feed-forward inhibition and produce a net excitatory response in CA1. Together, these two mechanisms may explain the significant gating influence that CA2 neurons have over hippocampal excitability and, consequently, sharp-wave ripples in CA1.</p><p>Consistent with this finding, mice in which CA2 synaptic output was fully and permanently blocked via tetanus toxin light chain showed normal ripples during immobility and also anomalous epileptiform discharges that arose from CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boehringer et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings of increased ripples in CA1 upon acute silencing of CA2 output are consistent with these findings in that in both studies, CA2 silencing increases CA3 to CA1 output during immobility. Echoing the statement by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boehringer et al. (2017)</xref>, our data do not agree with the suggestion by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oliva et al. (2016)</xref> that CA2 neuronal activity triggers the occurrence of ripples. Rather, CA2 activity may play a role in sculpting the CA3 network activity and gate output to CA1. Consistent with a gating, or permissive, role of CA2 toward the occurrence of ripples, revealed that CA2 is the only hippocampal subregion to have a substantial population of neurons that cease firing during CA1 ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kay et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, demonstrated an inverse correlation between occurrence of ripples in CA2 and CA1. During periods of low occurrence of ripples in CA2, ripple occurrence was high in CA1, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oliva et al., 2016</xref>). The inverse correlations described by these two findings suggest a negative regulatory role of CA2 activity on CA1 ripples, which is consistent with our findings.</p><p>The results of our study present further similarities between CA2 functions and impairments seen in schizophrenia. Gamma oscillations are impaired in patients with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Woo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pinkham et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, which contribute to the generation of gamma oscillations, are notably reduced in hippocampal area CA2 and PFC in postmortem tissue from patients with this disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beasley and Reynolds, 1997</xref>). Findings from the <italic>Df16A± </italic>mouse model of schizophrenia demonstrate impaired social behavior, decreased number of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in CA2, decreased activity of CA2 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piskorowski et al., 2016</xref>), and decreased synchrony between hippocampus and PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sigurdsson et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, the forebrain-selective calcineurin knock-out model of schizophrenia was reported to have increased CA1 ripple events during periods of resting wake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suh et al., 2013</xref>). We report that CA2 neuronal activity contributes to low-gamma oscillations in PFC, which could arise from CA2 drive of CA1 neurons and, in turn, CA1 drive of excitatory and inhibitory PFC neurons, thereby contributing to low-gamma oscillation generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim and Cho, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marek, 2018</xref>). We also found that CA2 activity contributes to gamma coherence between hippocampus and PFC and hippocampal ripple oscillations, suggesting that CA2 may play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p><p>Here, we have provided evidence that CA2 neuronal activity bidirectionally controls hippocampal and prefrontal cortical low-gamma oscillations as well as hippocampal sharp-wave ripple oscillations. These findings demonstrate a role for CA2 in the extended hippocampal-prefrontal cortical network and further support the idea that CA2 is an integral node in the hippocampal network that may be dysregulated in schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional Information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Amigo2</italic>-icreERT2</td><td>NIEHS</td><td><italic>B6(SJL)-Tg(Amigo2-icre/ERT2)1Ehs</italic>)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>B6(SJL)-Tg(Amigo2-icre/ERT2)2Ehs</italic>)</td><td>NIEHS</td><td><italic>B6(SJL)-Tg(Amigo2-icre/ERT2)2Ehs</italic>)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>ROSA</italic>-tdTomato</td><td>Jax</td><td>B6.129S6-Gt(ROSA)26Sor&lt;tm9(CAG-td Tomato) Hze&gt;/J</td><td>RRID: Jax 007909</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>GAD</italic>-eGFP</td><td>Riken</td><td>ICR.Cg-Gad1&lt;tm1.1Tama&gt;</td><td>RRID: RBRC03674</td></tr><tr><td>AAV</td><td>hM3Dq AAV</td><td>University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill Viral Vector Core</td><td>AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry</td><td>Serotype AAV5</td></tr><tr><td>AAV</td><td>hM4Di AAV</td><td>University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill Viral Vector Core</td><td>AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry</td><td>Serotype AAV5</td></tr><tr><td>AAV</td><td>ChR2 AAV</td><td>University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill Viral Vector Core</td><td>AAV-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP</td><td>Serotype AAV5</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit anti-PCP4</td><td>SCBT</td><td>Cat # sc-74186</td><td>IHC, 1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit anti-CaMKII alpha</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat # ab131468</td><td>IHC, 1:250</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rat anti-mCherry</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td>Cat# M11217</td><td>IHC, 1:500- 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>mouse anti-calbindin</td><td>Swant</td><td>Cat# D-28k</td><td>IHC, 1:500</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were carried out in adult male and female mice (8–12 weeks at the start of experiments).

The icreERT2 cassette was fused to the A-Box replacing the <italic>Amigo2</italic> ATG with the icre ATG preceded with a perfect KOZAK sequence. At the 3' end of the icreERT2 cassette a synthetic bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation signal was added after the STOP codon. For selection of recombined BACs, a flipase-site flanked neomycin resistance gene was incorporated into the targeting fragment following the icreERT2 cassette. Finally, the 3' end of the targeting fragment contained a 263 bp homology region (B-Box) starting downstream of the <italic>Amigo2</italic> ATG.

One ground screw (positioned approximately 4 mm posterior and 2 mm lateral to Bregma over the right hemisphere) and four anchors were secured to the skull and electrode arrays were then lowered into drilled holes over the target brain regions. Electrode wires were connected to a printed circuit board (San Francisco Circuits, San Mateo, CA), which was connected to a miniature connector (Omnetics Connector Corporation, Minneapolis, MN). For all but one mouse that was implanted with tetrodes, electrodes consisted of stainless steel wire (44 μm) with polyimide coating (Sandvik Group, Stockholm, Sweden).

Continuous LFP data were band-pass filtered at 0.3–500 Hz and stored at 1,000 Hz. Single unit data were sampled at 30 kHz and high-pass filtered at 250 Hz. Neurophysiological recordings were referenced to a silver wire connected to a ground screw secured in the posterior parietal bone. To confirm that gamma power activity recorded in hippocampus and PFC were not artifacts of volume conduction or apparent brain-wide increases in low-gamma power due to differential voltage measurement between the active recording electrode and the ground screw, in some animals, one wire per bundle targeting hippocampus or PFC, was positioned either in the cortex above hippocampus or in the striatum lateral to PFC. Referencing signals to these short or lateral wires showed LFPs that increased or decreased in gamma power upon CNO administration to hM3Dq or hM4Di-infused mice, respectively, similar to recordings that were referenced to the ground screw. For behavioral tracking, the X and Y coordinates in space of a light-emitting diode (for use with color camera) or a small piece of reflective tape (for use with infrared camera) present on the wireless headstage were sampled at 30 Hz using Neuromotive Software (Blackrock Microsystems) and position data were stored with the neural data.</p><p>For recordings from mice infused with hM3Dq AAV, baseline data was acquired for at least 20 min followed by treatment with vehicle (10% DMSO in saline) or CNO (0.05–4 mg/kg CNO dissolved in DMSO to 50 mM then suspended in saline, SQ) and recording continued for an additional 2 hr. During the entire recording time, mice were inside of an open-field arena, which was a custom-built, five-sided (open top) dark arena (approximately 80 cm long x 80 cm wide x 100 cm high). The walls and floor of the arena were constructed from black-colored Plexiglass. Mice administered various doses of CNO were first treated with vehicle and then increasing doses of CNO at three-day intervals. Room light remained illuminated, but a curtain was placed around the open field chamber during recordings. For neurophysiology experiments on hM4Di AAV-infused mice, after connecting headstages to the animals’ electrodes, animals were administered either vehicle or CNO (5 mg/kg, SQ) then returned to their cage for 30 min before starting recording. Room lights were turned off and red lights were illuminated after administering vehicle or CNO. After 30 min had elapsed, mice were placed in the open field arena for recording. This behavioral procedure was employed in an effort to drive endogenous gamma activity by increasing locomotor activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E–F</xref>).

Continuous neural data were low-pass filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 1000 Hz. For these experiments, baseline recordings were obtained for several minutes before delivering fiber optic stimulation. Stimulation consisted of five pulses delivered at 10 Hz, with each pulse being five msec in duration and with a current intensity of 200 mA delivered to the light emitting diode. One train was delivered per minute for 3 min. Animals were then administered either vehicle or CNO (5 mg/kg, SQ), and LFP responses to light stimulation were made following identical stimulation parameters between 20 min and 24 hr following vehicle/CNO treatment.

Spectral density plots for each behavioral state, each treatment and in each recording site were averaged across animals according to genotype and AAV infused. Plots shown in figures are measured in arbitrary units due to z-scoring of LFPs, as described above. Peak powers in each frequency range were collected to compare changes in peak theta, low-gamma or high-gamma power according to treatment.

To rule out volume conduction as a source of any change in coherence, we measured phase lag of low-gamma filtered LFPs in CA2 and PFC and confirmed the absence of zero-phase lag in our recordings. Phase angles were obtained by convolution for CA2 and PFC signals. Phase angle differences were taken between the two signals, and v-tests were used to determine statistically significant difference from zero or 2π (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen, 2014</xref>). Phase angle differences were significantly different from both zero and 2π. Power and coherence values measured for each treatment were compared using appropriate statistical tests, listed in text, after data were checked for normal distributions and equal variance. Of note, as a consequence of z-scoring LFPs for periods of run and rest separately, theta power appears to be similar between the two states. However, measurement of spectral power without z-scoring LFPs for run and rest shows that theta power is higher during periods of running than during rest (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref>; 4 mg/kg spectrogram shows strong theta power during periods of running). We did not observe a difference in time spent running or in running speed during recordings for any of the treatments.</p><p>Ripple events were identified according to modified methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boehringer et al., 2017</xref>) from recordings originating from the pyramidal cell layer during periods of rest in hM3Dq (eight animals with dorsal CA1 recordings) and hM4Di (two animals with dorsal CA1 recordings, four animals with intermediate CA1 recordings) animals. Z-scored signals were denoised with an IIR notch filter at 60 and 180 Hz and filtered between 100 and 300 Hz with a 69-order FIR zero phase shift filter. Signals were then Hilbert transformed, and the absolute value envelopes were smoothed with a 50-ms window. Envelope amplitude deflections that exceeded three standard deviations from the mean amplitude (i.e. mean +3 standard deviations) for more than 30 ms were counted as ripple events. Deflections within 200 ms of a previous ripple event were excluded. Ripple event frequency and ripple amplitude were measured and appropriate statistical tests were applied, as listed in the text, after data were checked for normal distributions and equal variance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Results reporting and data availability</title><p>For each experiment presented within the Results section and in figures, the number of replicates is presented as ‘N’ when indicating the number of animals that were used for the experiment or as ‘n’ when referring to the number of neurons used for the experiment.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper uses chemogenetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings from freely behaving mice to investigate how activation or inactivation of CA2 affects hippocampal rhythms, PFC gamma rhythms, and CA1-PFC coherence. To achieve this, the authors developed a novel mouse that specifically targets pyramidal cells in CA2. The authors report that low frequency gamma rhythms are enhanced by CA2 activation, whereas sharp wave-ripples are enhanced by CA2 inactivation. These findings provide novel insights into gamma oscillators in hippocampus and also reveal the potentially important role of CA2 in hippocampal oscillations related to cognition and memory consolidation.</p><p>All reviewers were generally positive about the importance of these findings. However, all reviewers also agreed that there are a number of issues that require further attention.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major concern is whether animals' behavior differed during CA2 manipulations compared to controls. One would expect to see increased low frequency gamma rhythms at higher running speeds in mice (Chen et al., 2011), and the authors should also note that this paper showed that the theta phase-gamma amplitude modulation index changes with running speed. The authors write, &quot;We did not observe a difference in time spent running or in running speed during recordings for any of the treatments&quot;, but no results or statistics are provided to back up this statement. In Figure 2A, it seems as though the theta power band in the color plots is more prominent for the vehicle group, possibly suggesting that the CNO treatments affected animals' behavior in a way that could bias gamma power measurements. Related to this point, why were mice returned to their home cage prior to recordings for the hM4Di group but not for the hM3Dq group? This could cause a difference in general activity level or attentional state that could bias measurements of rhythmic activity.</p><p>2) Throughout the paper, the recording locations need to be clearly identified and emphasized. In the Results section related to Figure 2, it is unclear if the results arise from signals recorded in CA1, CA2, or both. It would be best to show CA1 and CA2 separately to best interpret results. In the hM3Dq mice, there are many recording sites close to CA2. Thus, one wonders how much of the increase in low gamma power is a rather trivial result of the increased firing of the CA2 cells. That is, does the gamma power in the LFP merely reflect the activity level of the local neuronal population? Also, while the placement of electrodes for the hM3Dq mice is near the border between CA2 and proximal CA1, the electrode placements for the hM4Di mice run the gamut from proximal to distal CA1, and also at different levels of the longitudinal axis. Although it is not obvious that this difference in placement can account for the different results of excitation of CA2 in the former set of mice and inhibition of CA2 in the latter set, this difference in electrode placement should be emphasized explicitly and prominently in the Results section so that readers are made aware of this issue. Also, the authors need to show the histological placement of electrodes for the control (Cre-) mice in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 2, not just the Cre+ mice. It is crucial that the electrode placements be equivalent for Cre+ and Cre- mice in order for the conclusions to hold.</p><p>3) The authors present several arguments against volume conduction (e.g., presenting data from electrodes that missed their targets). However, it seems as though it would be more convincing to present single unit phase-locking of spikes. The authors mention tetrodes in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Electrode Implantation”), but no single unit analyses are presented (other than optogenetic manipulation of spike rate in one mouse). Was spiking within each region modulated by the slow gamma that increased with CNO administration? Alternatively, the authors could perform analyses specifically developed to address volume conduction.</p><p>4) Some of the statistical reporting in the paper is a bit strange, and the rationale for the way in which some of the results and statistics are presented is unclear. For gamma power modulation by theta phase, the authors report &quot;a trend toward significantly decreasing with CNO treatment&quot; and a p-value of 0.0612. Yet, in the subsection “Increasing CA2 pyramidal cell activity increases hippocampal and prefrontal cortical low gamma power”, they report a p-value of less than 0.0501 for high frequency gamma power and report that this is not significant. This type of reporting of results makes it seem as though the authors are choosing to focus on some results and ignore others, regardless of statistics. Also, is it possible that the lack of significance (p &lt;.0.0501) for high gamma is the result of low statistical power? Also, throughout the paper, when making comparisons across groups, the authors' results would be stronger if they assessed all rhythm measurements together in the same ANOVA then checked for interaction effects. For example, if the authors want to claim that chemogenetic activation of CA2 enhances low frequency gamma but not high frequency gamma, one would expect to see a significant interaction between rhythm type and CNO treatment group, with a main effect of CNO treatment only observed for low frequency gamma. Also, it is unclear why a t-test was used to assess effects of hM4Di infusion (subsection “CA2 pyramidal cell inhibition decreases hippocampal and prefrontal cortical low gamma power”, second paragraph), but a repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess significance of hM3Dq results (fourth paragraph).</p><p>5) For hippocampal recordings, the authors measure &quot;beta&quot; activity. However, it is unclear what is actually being measured because beta rhythms are typically not prevalent in CA1 in tasks lacking olfactory sampling of stimuli. What is likely being measured is the theta harmonic, which can clearly be seen in some of the spectra (e.g., Figure 5A), especially considering that &quot;beta&quot; results seem to mirror theta results (e.g., Figure 2B-C).</p><p>6) The authors assess theta and high frequency gamma rhythms during immobility, but this seems strange. Theta should not occur during immobility. Immobility is thought to be a sharp wave-ripple-associated behavioral state. Low gamma rhythms have been reported to co-occur with sharp wave-ripples, but high frequency gamma rhythms have not. What are the authors actually measuring during rest when they are assessing power in the theta and high frequency gamma ranges?</p><p>7) The results in Figure 2 are confusing. In example data of Figure 2A, it's quite obvious that low gamma power increased during CNO treatment. In addition, CNO also induced increased power in the 60-80 Hz frequency band compared to the vehicle condition, particularly in running periods when theta was strong. Furthermore, there is a trend toward increasing high gamma as a function of CNO dosage in Figure 2D. It looks like high gamma increased for half of the animals but not for the other half. If the authors specifically examine 60-80Hz is there a significant increase in 60-80Hz power with higher CNO dosage? Is there something different about the exact recording location for the 3 animals that relates to an increase in high gamma? More broadly, was there any difference between running and resting state for 60-80 Hz gamma band in either CNO or vehicle groups? Something also seems strange about the theta results presented in Figure 2B. For the run data, why is one animal so different than the rest? What exactly is significant in the run data? There seems to be no effect apparent, just a lot of variability across animals.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38052.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major concern is whether animals' behavior differed during CA2 manipulations compared to controls.

We also found no significant difference in running velocity for Cre+ or Cre- mice across treatments (Figure 2—figure supplement 4B). Similarly, among hM4Di mice, we observed no significant difference in percent of time running for Cre+ or Cre- mice between treatments (Figure 2—figure supplement 4C). We also found no significant difference in running velocity for Cre+ or Cre- mice between treatments (Figure 2—figure supplement 4D). From these analyses, we conclude that CNO treatment did not significantly impact locomotion for either hM3Dq or hM4Di mice.</p><p>Regarding the theta phase-gamma amplitude relationship with running speed, the apparent decrease in modulation index following CNO treatment among hM3Dq animals likely reflects the increased occurrence of gamma cycles following CNO treatment, which is seen during the expected descending phase of the theta cycle and spreads throughout the theta cycle at higher doses of CNO. Therefore, the decreased modulation index with CNO would not necessarily reflect decreased running speed, which is supported by the lack of significant difference in running speed or percent of time running with CNO in hM3Dq animals discussed above.</p><p>As the reviewer(s) note, we returned mice to their home cage prior to recordings for the hM4Di group but not for the hM3Dq group. Our objective for the hM4Di experiments was to drive endogenous gamma oscillations and then ask whether silencing CA2 activity inhibited endogenous gamma oscillations. We compared percent of time running and run velocity following vehicle treatment for hM3Dq mice and hM4Di mice (Cre+ and Cre- combined) and found that both time spent running and run velocity were significantly greater in the hM4Di mice than hM3Dq mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 4E-F), which likely reflected the different procedures described above, as hoped.</p><p>Regarding the color plots in Figure 2A appearing to show a stronger theta band during the vehicle treatment, the relative color difference between spectral plots representing LFPs collected during experiments with various treatments likely reflects variability of recordings over the days between successive treatments. Importantly, the theta band does not appear to change in color from before vehicle/CNO to after vehicle/CNO treatment, further supporting the conclusion that vehicle/CNO treatment did not impact animals’ locomotor activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Throughout the paper, the recording locations need to be clearly identified and emphasized. In the Results section related to Figure 2, it is unclear if the results arise from signals recorded in CA1, CA2, or both. It would be best to show CA1 and CA2 separately to best interpret results. In the hM3Dq mice, there are many recording sites close to CA2. Thus, one wonders how much of the increase in low gamma power is a rather trivial result of the increased firing of the CA2 cells. That is, does the gamma power in the LFP merely reflect the activity level of the local neuronal population?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have divided the hM3Dq data into recordings made from CA2, proximal CA1 and intermediate CA1, as determined by electrode placement images (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). These new analyses are presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 6. We found no significant difference in the magnitude of low gamma power change between recordings from close to CA2 and further from CA2 during periods of run (Figure 2—figure supplement 6A-B) or periods of rest (Figure 2—figure supplement 6C-D). These data do not support the conclusion that the increase in low gamma power simply reflects an increase in firing rate of CA2 pyramidal cells. We now emphasize the electrode positioning within the hM3Dq group (subsection “Increasing CA2 pyramidal cell activity increases hippocampal and prefrontal cortical low gamma power”, seventh paragraph), and present these analyses showing no difference in gamma power increase according to recording location within hippocampus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, while the placement of electrodes for the hM3Dq mice is near the border between CA2 and proximal CA1, the electrode placements for the hM4Di mice run the gamut from proximal to distal CA1, and also at different levels of the longitudinal axis. Although it is not obvious that this difference in placement can account for the different results of excitation of CA2 in the former set of mice and inhibition of CA2 in the latter set, this difference in electrode placement should be emphasized explicitly and prominently in the Results section so that readers are made aware of this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in the manuscript, we chose to focus our hM4Di analyses on the target area of CA2 neurons because the primary effect of hM4Di is on neurotransmitter release rather than somatic membrane potential, and thus spike activity. CA2 neurons project to CA1 in the same anterio-posterior plane as well as toward intermediate to posterior CA1. Therefore, we measured effects of hM4Di in dorsal and intermediate/posterior CA1. That said, in our revised manuscript, we have divided the hM4Di animals into those with recordings in dorsal CA1 and those with recordings in intermediate CA1. These analyses are now presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 3. Statistical analyses showed a main effect of drug treatment during periods of running (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-B) but no main effect of recording location (dorsal vs. intermediate CA1) and no interaction effect. During periods of rest, we found no significant effect of recording location, drug treatment or an interaction (Figure 5—figure supplement 3C-D). This analysis is thoroughly described in the Results section of the main text (subsection “CA2 pyramidal cell inhibition decreases hippocampal and prefrontal cortical low gamma power”, second paragraph) to clearly articulate the presence of two target recording sites included in the CA1 hM4Di dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the authors need to show the histological placement of electrodes for the control (Cre-) mice in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 2, not just the Cre+ mice. It is crucial that the electrode placements be equivalent for Cre+ and Cre- mice in order for the conclusions to hold.</p></disp-quote><p>Histological electrode placements for Cre- animals are now shown in the associated supplementary figures (now Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors present several arguments against volume conduction (e.g., presenting data from electrodes that missed their targets). However, it seems as though it would be more convincing to present single unit phase-locking of spikes. The authors mention tetrodes in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Electrode Implantation”), but no single unit analyses are presented (other than optogenetic manipulation of spike rate in one mouse). Was spiking within each region modulated by the slow gamma that increased with CNO administration? Alternatively, the authors could perform analyses specifically developed to address volume conduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We recorded single unit activity from CA2 to demonstrate an increase in CA2 pyramidal cell firing rate by hM3Dq upon CNO administration and indeed found increased firing rate of these neurons with CNO (shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2). We did not record single unit firing from areas outside of CA2, including CA1 and PFC. To address volume conduction, we measured phase lag of low gamma filtered LFPs in CA2 and PFC and confirmed the absence of zero-phase lag in our recordings. Phase angles were obtained by convolution for CA2 and PFC low gamma filtered signals. Phase angle differences were taken between the two signals, and v-tests were used to determine statistically significant difference from zero or 2π<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Indeed, phase angle differences were significantly different from both zero and 2π. This information is now provided in the Materials and methods subsection “Electrophysiology Data Analysis”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some of the statistical reporting in the paper is a bit strange, and the rationale for the way in which some of the results and statistics are presented is unclear. For gamma power modulation by theta phase, the authors report &quot;a trend toward significantly decreasing with CNO treatment&quot; and a p-value of 0.0612. Yet, in the subsection “Increasing CA2 pyramidal cell activity increases hippocampal and prefrontal cortical low gamma power”, they report a p-value of less than 0.0501 for high frequency gamma power and report that this is not significant. This type of reporting of results makes it seem as though the authors are choosing to focus on some results and ignore others, regardless of statistics. Also, is it possible that the lack of significance (p &lt;.0.0501) for high gamma is the result of low statistical power?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and have now adjusted the wording to be clear that <italic>p</italic> values less than 0.05 are not considered to be significant. It is possible that with more animals, high gamma power would also be significantly affected by CA2 activity modulation. If further animals were to yield a significant effect on high gamma power, this would most likely be seen in the hM3Dq mice. In that hypothetical situation, one possible mechanism that could account for the increase in high gamma power could be through CA2 activity driving activity in entorhinal cortex via CA1, which then could feed back onto CA1 and promote high gamma activity. However, using the opposite manipulation – decreasing CA2 activity with hM4Di – we found a selective decrease in low gamma power upon CNO administration, and not high gamma power, leading us to conclude that CA2 activity is needed for low gamma oscillations in CA1 but not necessarily high gamma oscillations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, throughout the paper, when making comparisons across groups, the authors' results would be stronger if they assessed all rhythm measurements together in the same ANOVA then checked for interaction effects. For example, if the authors want to claim that chemogenetic activation of CA2 enhances low frequency gamma but not high frequency gamma, one would expect to see a significant interaction between rhythm type and CNO treatment group, with a main effect of CNO treatment only observed for low frequency gamma. Also, it is unclear why a t-test was used to assess effects of hM4Di infusion (subsection “CA2 pyramidal cell inhibition decreases hippocampal and prefrontal cortical low gamma power”, second paragraph), but a repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess significance of hM3Dq results (fourth paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>Repeated-measures ANOVAs were used to compare hM3Dq data because multiple doses of CNO were studied (vehicle, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg CNO). We studied multiple doses of CNO in the hM3Dq mice to take advantage of the dose dependent nature of CNO effects on hM3Dq and, consequently, neuronal activity. Ttests were used for hM4Di animals because only two treatments were being compared (vehicle and 5 mg/kg CNO). We did not study dose-dependent effects of CNO in the hM4Di experiments but rather aimed to use a high enough dose of CNO to inhibit CA2 output to the maximum allowable extent afforded by the DREADD ligand.</p><p>As the reviewer requested though, in the revised manuscript, we have also performed two-way ANOVAs for the both hM3Dq and hM4Di groups with the two factors of treatment and gamma range. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, as we did indeed find interaction effects between treatment and gamma range. These analyses are now presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 5.</p><p>For the hM3Dq group, for periods of running, we found a main effect of treatment, a main effect of gamma range and a significant interaction between treatment and gamma range (Figure 2—figure supplement 5A). Follow-up post hoc tests revealed a significant increase in low gamma for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg CNO. Post hoc tests did not reveal a significant change in high gamma power for any dose of CNO. For periods of rest, we found a significant main effect of gamma range, a main effect of treatment, and a significant interaction between gamma range and treatment (Figure 2—figure supplement 5B). Follow-up post hoc tests revealed a significant increase in low gamma power for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg CNO. Post hoc tests did not reveal a significant change in high gamma power for any dose of CNO. Among Cre- animals, during periods of running, we found a significant main effect of gamma range but no main effect of treatment and no interaction (Figure 2—figure supplement 5C). Similarly, in Cre- mice during periods or rest, we found a main effect of gamma range but no effect of treatment or an interaction (Figure 2—figure supplement 5D).</p><p>For the hM4Di group, during periods of running, we found a main effect of treatment, a main effect of gamma range and a significant interaction between treatment and gamma range (Figure 5—figure supplement 5A).

However, it is unclear what is actually being measured because beta rhythms are typically not prevalent in CA1 in tasks lacking olfactory sampling of stimuli. What is likely being measured is the theta harmonic, which can clearly be seen in some of the spectra (e.g., Figure 5A), especially considering that &quot;beta&quot; results seem to mirror theta results (e.g., Figure 2B-C).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer(s) raise a good point, and we have now removed these findings on beta oscillations from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors assess theta and high frequency gamma rhythms during immobility, but this seems strange. Theta should not occur during immobility. Immobility is thought to be a sharp wave-ripple-associated behavioral state. Low gamma rhythms have been reported to co-occur with sharp wave-ripples, but high frequency gamma rhythms have not. What are the authors actually measuring during rest when they are assessing power in the theta and high frequency gamma ranges?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer(s) bring up an interesting issue. Indeed, type I theta oscillations occur significantly more during mobility than during immobility, although a second type of theta, type II theta, occurring during aroused immobility have also been observed<sup>2</sup>. Thus, we think the oscillations in the theta frequency range that we report here likely reflect this type II theta. Consistent with this possibility, type I theta has a somewhat higher frequency (6-12 Hz) than type II theta (5-9 Hz), and in our dataset the peak theta frequency during running was significantly higher than the peak theta frequency during resting (for example, for hM3Dq Cre+ animals, main effect of behavioral state: F(1, 7)=20.42, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0027; main effect of treatment: F(4, 28) = 0.352, <italic>p</italic> = 0.8404; interaction: F(4, 28) = 0.7871, <italic>p</italic> = 0.5433; two-way ANOVA; post hoc tests of frequency during run vs. rest: vehicle: <italic>p</italic> = 0.0003, 0.5 mg/kg: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, 1 mg/kg: <italic>p</italic> = 0.0007, 2 mg/kg: <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002, 4 mg/kg: <italic>p</italic> = 0.0027, Bonferroni multiple comparisons test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Of note though, hM3Dq mediated activation of CA2 did not result in a significant shift in peak theta frequency.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38052.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-38052-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Regarding high gamma oscillations, high gamma power has been shown to increase with increasing running speed, but at low running speeds, high gamma power does not appear to be completely absent, particularly in CA3<sup>3,4</sup>. For the sake of providing information on each relevant hippocampal oscillation with a balanced presentation of running and resting data, we have presented high gamma oscillation power for both running and resting, although high gamma power is notably lower during periods of rest (see Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The results in Figure 2 are confusing. In example data of Figure 2A, it's quite obvious that low gamma power increased during CNO treatment. In addition, CNO also induced increased power in the 60-80 Hz frequency band compared to the vehicle condition, particularly in running periods when theta was strong. Furthermore, there is a trend toward increasing high gamma as a function of CNO dosage in Figure 2D. It looks like high gamma increased for half of the animals but not for the other half. If the authors specifically examine 60-80Hz is there a significant increase in 60-80Hz power with higher CNO dosage? Is there something different about the exact recording location for the 3 animals that relates to an increase in high gamma?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to use 65-80 Hz for the high gamma sampling range to minimize any possible contamination of the signal by 60 Hz line noise, although line noise has not been observed in our recordings. As requested by the reviewer, we have sampled the 60-80 Hz frequency band and asked whether high gamma power in that range was significantly increased with CNO treatment. We focused on hM3Dq animals during periods of run, as the reviewer notes particularly increased high gamma power in the 60-80 Hz range during periods of running. We found that power was not significantly increased by CNO in the 60-80 Hz frequency band (F(1.462, 10.23)=2.642, <italic>p</italic> = 0.1275, repeated-measures one-way ANOVA with Geisser-Greenhouse correction for unequal variance).

As a further analysis to address the reviewer’s question, we also divided animals into the various areas of electrode implantation and analyzed high gamma power during running. The results show no main effect of recording location, CNO treatment or an interaction (main effect of location: F(2, 5) = 0.3812, <italic>p</italic> = 0.7013; main effect of treatment: F(4, 20)=1.553, <italic>p</italic> = 0.2255; interaction: F(8, 20) = 0.3717, <italic>p</italic> = 0.9234, two-way ANOVA; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38052.030</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-38052-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More broadly, was there any difference between running and resting state for 60-80 Hz gamma band in either CNO or vehicle groups?</p></disp-quote><p>As demonstrated in the spectrograms in Figure 2A, there was greater high gamma power during running than resting. Due to the LFP normalization within each of the run and rest datasets, the power values for high gamma do not appear to differ significantly; however, to address the reviewer’s question, we analyzed non-normalized data for periods of run vs. periods of rest following vehicle treatment in hM3Dq animals. We found that high gamma power in the 60-80 Hz range was significantly greater during periods of running than during periods of resting, as expected (N=8, t(7)=4.996, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0016, paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>). As the reviewer brings up an important point worth clarifying for the reader, we have now included a supplementary figure in the revised manuscript comparing theta and high gamma power from non-normalized LFPs during periods of running versus periods of resting in hM3Dq animals following vehicle treatment. For the supplementary figure, we used the high gamma frequency range of 65-80 Hz to be consistent with other high gamma data presented in the manuscript. In analyzing theta power and high gamma power between running and resting in hM3Dq animals following vehicle treatment, we found that both theta and high gamma power were significantly increased during periods of running (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A-C). We also compared theta frequency and found that peak theta frequency was significantly higher during periods of running than during resting (Figure 2—figure supplement 3D), consistent with the presence of type II theta during rest, as discussed in point #6 above.</p><fig id="respfig4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38052.031</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-38052-resp-fig4-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Something also seems strange about the theta results presented in Figure 2B.

We have confirmed the accuracy of the analysis and results for this animal and conclude that biological variability is responsible for the high theta power in this animal. Regarding the statistics for theta power results presented in Figure 2B, we compared theta power across treatments (vehicle, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, or 4 mg/kg CNO) using the Friedman test, a non-parametric form of one-way ANOVA. We used the Friedman test due to the non-Gaussian distribution of data, as exemplified by the one animal showing higher theta power than the other animals in the cohort. The Friedman test reported a Friedman statistic of 11.3 with a <italic>p</italic> value of 0.0234.
