Hyaluronan (HA) is a major component of this structure. While the role of HA in malignancy is well-defined, the mechanisms driving its biosynthesis in cancer are poorly understood. We show that the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, an oncoprotein, drives HA biosynthesis. eIF4E stimulates production of enzymes that synthesize the building blocks of HA, UDP-Glucuronic acid and UDP-N-Acetyl-Glucosamine, as well as hyaluronic acid synthase which forms the disaccharide chain. Strikingly, eIF4E inhibition alone repressed HA levels as effectively as directly targeting HA with hyaluronidase. Unusually, HA was retained on the surface of high-eIF4E cells, rather than being extruded into the extracellular space. Surface-associated HA was required for eIF4E’s oncogenic activities suggesting that eIF4E potentiates an oncogenic HA program. These studies provide unique insights into the mechanisms driving HA production and demonstrate that an oncoprotein can co-opt HA biosynthesis to drive malignancy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell culture</kwd><kwd>Primary AML Samples</kwd><kwd>Mouse Lung Metastasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>80728</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borden</surname><given-names>Katherine LB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005189</institution-id><institution>Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borden</surname><given-names>Katherine LB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>98571</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borden</surname><given-names>Katherine LB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E induces hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesis to drive cancer metastasis which can be reversed following eIF4E inhibition and HA degradation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The tumor microenvironment plays important roles in cancer, providing a niche for the preferential survival and proliferation of tumor cells. A major component of this structure is the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA). HA is composed of repeating disaccharides units of UDP-Glucuronic Acid and UDP-N-Acetyl Glucosamine. HA is synthesized by hyaluronic acid synthases (HAS), which are single transmembrane proteins localized to the inner-face of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kultti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lenart et al., 2017</xref>). HA chain length can be associated with differential functions including regulation of various cellular processes such as embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, wound healing and inflammation and when dysregulated can promote EMT, tumor growth, and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goncharova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Toole, 2004</xref>). Shorter chains are primarily synthesized by HAS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Itano et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spicer and McDonald, 1998</xref>). These shorter forms of HA are often associated with malignant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Slevin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Slevin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">West et al., 1985</xref>). Artificial overexpression of HAS enzymes causes increased tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of prostate, breast and colon carcinomas while its knockdown reverses this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kultti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koistinen et al., 2015</xref>). Further, HA is cleaved by hyaluronidases which have been suggested to act as tumor suppressors; whereby increased expression inhibits tumor growth in colon and breast xenografts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertrand et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Junker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sá et al., 2015</xref>). Increased HA levels are correlated with formation of less dense matrices to facilitate invasion and promote angiogenesis. Elevated levels of HA in the stroma around tumors is associated with poor outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anttila et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auvinen et al., 2000</xref>). In addition to surrounding tumors in some cases, HA can coat the surface of tumor cells with HA-based protrusions radiating from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ropponen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Setälä et al., 1999</xref>). Indeed, overexpression of HAS3 alone is sufficient to induce the formation of an HA coat with microvillus-like protrusions on the cell surface. The major HA receptor CD44 is found to co-localize with these surface HA coats but is not required for HA coat formation. The number of cancer cell types with cell-surface HA is not yet known, and the extent to which cell-associated HA also plays physiological roles in cancer is an important open question in the field.</p><p>Despite the wealth of knowledge relating HA to malignancy, there is virtually no information regarding how HA levels become elevated in cancer and further, there is no understanding of what physiological conditions drive production of cell-surface-associated HA. Indeed, the levels of mRNAs encoding the enzymes in the biosynthetic pathways are often poor predictors of HA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nykopp et al., 2010</xref>). For instance in endometrial and ovarian carcinomas, mRNA levels of HAS enzymes do not predict elevated HA levels in these specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nykopp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nykopp et al., 2009</xref>). These data suggest that this pathway is not always under direct transcriptional control and begs the question how else is HA production regulated. In this study, we demonstrate that the production of HA and its related downstream effectors are coordinately controlled post-transcriptionally by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E. eIF4E is highly expressed in many cancers and this correlates with increased invasion, metastases and poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assouline et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Culjkovic-Kraljacic and Borden, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pettersson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). In early-stage clinical trials, eIF4E targeting with ribavirin led to objective responses including remissions in some acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assouline et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assouline et al., 2015</xref>). In mouse models, eIF4E overexpression is sufficient to drive tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kentsis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lazaris-Karatzas et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lazaris-Karatzas and Sonenberg, 1992</xref>). At the biochemical level, eIF4E modulates expression of selected transcripts through its roles in nuclear mRNA export and translation. Both these functions contribute to its oncogenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Culjkovic-Kraljacic and Borden, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carroll and Borden, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Osborne and Borden, 2015</xref>). eIF4E-target transcripts are the downstream effectors of its physiological effects. Here, we identified the enzymes encoding the HA biosynthetic pathway, HAS3, CD44 and associated factors as eIF4E target transcripts. We demonstrated that this pathway was required for eIF4E to mediate its oncogenic activities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We set out to identify mRNA target transcripts which could encode proteins that were downstream effectors of the oncogenic activities of eIF4E. To identify these mRNAs, we took advantage of a fundamental difference in the RNA-binding properties of eIF4E between cellular compartments. In the cytoplasm, eIF4E binds all capped-RNAs regardless of whether it increases their translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rousseau et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Culjkovic-Kraljacic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graff and Zimmer, 2003</xref>). However, in the nucleus, eIF4E binds transcripts that are functional export targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Culjkovic et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Culjkovic et al., 2006</xref>). These export target mRNAs typically contain a structurally-defined 50-nucleotide element known as an eIF4E sensitivity element (4ESE) in their 3’ UTR and are m<sup>7</sup>G capped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Culjkovic et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2007</xref>). This element is directly bound by the leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat (LRPPRC) protein which also directly binds the dorsal surface of eIF4E. The eIF4E-4ESE RNA-LRPPRC complex in turn binds the CRM1 nuclear pore receptor which transits it to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Topisirovic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Volpon et al., 2016</xref>). To date, about 3500 RNAs have been shown to immunoprecipitate with eIF4E from the nuclear fraction of lymphoma cells suggesting that this is a broadly used mRNA export pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Culjkovic-Kraljacic et al., 2016</xref>). Given these considerations, we reasoned that identification of eIF4E-bound transcripts in the nucleus would provide a straightforward strategy for the discovery of downstream factors that execute its biological effects. These included enzymes involved in HA biosynthesis (see below).</p><p>We identified eIF4E-bound RNAs using an RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) strategy. Nuclear lysates from osteosarcoma U2Os cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-eIF4E antibodies, and results were compared to IgG controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). To ensure these interactions were functional, we also monitored the mRNA export of candidate transcripts as a function of eIF4E overexpression by monitoring RNA content in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. In both experiments, RNAs were detected by quantitative reverse transcription PCR methods (RT-qPCR). Fractionation quality was assessed using U6snRNA and tRNA<sup>lys</sup> for nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively. Preliminary studies using genome-wide screens of our nuclear eIF4E RIPs provided evidence that factors involved in HA biosynthesis were targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Using RT-qPCR, we determined that the transcripts encoding most of these enzymes bound eIF4E in nuclear RIPs with enrichments ranging from 2.5 to 15 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). These target mRNAs include hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3; 2.6 fold), as well as many of the enzymes involved in generating the UDP-Glucuronic acid and UDP-N-Acetyl Glucosamine precursors including hexokinase 1 (HK, ~15 fold), and phosphoglucomutase (PGM5, ~11 fold), amongst others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Comparison of eIF4E RIPs to input gave a similar pattern of results as to those compared to IgG controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). We note that comparisons to input for abundant RNAs can lead to false negatives because even if fully bound to eIF4E, levels of nuclear eIF4E may not be sufficient to deplete the input pool. Further comparison to IgG allows an assessment of background binding to beads.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29830.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>eIF4E regulates the expression of HA synthesizing enzymes and HA receptor CD44.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HA biosynthesis pathway.

In addition to the HA biosynthetic machinery, other eIF4E targets identified in our RIP and fractionation studies included downstream effectors of HA for example CD44 as well as its signaling partners for example Ezrin and MMP9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Montgomery et al., 2012</xref>). Total levels for target mRNAs were not affected by eIF4E overexpression confirming that these effects were post-transcriptional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Negative control RNAs such as GADPH, Hsp90 and β-Tubulin were not in the immunoprecipitations and were not modulated at the export level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). For comparison, we used the S53A eIF4E mutant which is deficient in mRNA export and transformation but active in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Osborne and Borden, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Culjkovic-Kraljacic et al., 2012</xref>). As expected, the S53A eIF4E mutant did not promote export of any of these mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We also assessed whether the HA pathways transcripts were targets of eIF4E at the translation level using polysomal analysis in eIF4E-overepxressing or vector control U2Os cells and monitored mRNAs by RT-qPCR in each fraction. We did not observe substantial shifts for most of these mRNAs on the polysomes with modest shifts to heavier polysomes including CD44, UAP, UGDH and UGP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a,b</xref>). c-Myc mRNA, an established translational target of eIF4E, showed a substantial polysomal shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a,b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Culjkovic-Kraljacic et al., 2016</xref>). Our previous studies demonstrated that whether mRNAs were translation targets of eIF4E could be cell-type dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Culjkovic-Kraljacic et al., 2016</xref>), and thus, while most HA pathways transcripts do not appear to be substantially shifted on polysomes in U2Os cells, it is possible that the HA-pathway may be more translationally regulated by eIF4E in other cell types. In U2Os cells, the effects of eIF4E on the HA pathway appear to be more dependent on its mRNA export functions.</p><p>Consistent with our above findings, eIF4E overexpression led to increased protein levels of the relevant enzymes, including HAS3, HK, GFPT1, GNPNAT1, UAP1, UGDH, as well as downstream effectors of HA function such as CD44 and Ezrin, relative to vector controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Available antibodies for PGM5, UGP2 and GPI were not of sufficient quality to assess their respective protein levels. The positive controls Mcl1 and c-Myc were elevated in eIF4E overexpressing cells relative to vector controls, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Although the S53A eIF4E mutant did not export the corresponding transcripts, a modest increase relative to vector controls was observed at the protein levels for UAP1, c-Myc and Mcl-1 consistent with modest shifts in the polysomal profiles for these transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Culjkovic-Kraljacic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rousseau et al., 1996</xref>). Notably, the changes induced by S53A eIF4E were substantially less than those observed for wild-type eIF4E for all cases, consistent with the role of RNA export in their expression. Thus, eIF4E increases levels of the enzymes in the HA biosynthetic pathway and downstream effectors of HA signalling (e.g. CD44 and Ezrin) through increased mRNA export.</p><p>Next, we determined whether eIF4E overexpression drove production of HA. To address this, we monitored HA levels in eIF4E, eIF4E S53A and vector control U2OS cells using biotinylated HA-binding protein (HABP) with streptavidin-FITC and confocal microscopy. HA levels were substantially elevated in eIF4E overexpressing cells relative to vector controls or S53A eIF4E cells <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Strikingly, HA was not extruded into the media, but rather coated the cell surface and formed short, filamentous protrusions radiating from the surface coat in the eIF4E overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Enzymatic depletion of HA with <italic>Streptomyces</italic> hyaluronidase (HAse) virtually eliminated the HA signal indicating that the staining was specific and suggesting that the structures were HA-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Our findings are consistent with studies which used HAS3 overexpression to artificially induce HA production (1) where the protrusions were too narrow (120–130 nm) to be seen by light microscopy but were readily detectable using fluorescent HABP conjugates. We used fluorescence-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) to independently validate elevated HA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). We observe a ~ threefold increase in HA levels in eIF4E-overexpressing cells relative to vector controls. HA levels in S53A-eIF4E cells were much lower than eIF4E overexpressing cells, and only modestly elevated relative to vector controls consistent with the mutant’s modest effects on the HA biosynthetic enzymes. Further, removal of extracellular glucose led to reduction of HA signalling consistent with the use of glucose as the major metabolic precursor in this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g–h</xref>). Thus, eIF4E overexpression induced HA production and was found associated with cells, coating the surface and forming protrusions. eIF4E required its mRNA export activity for HA production and this was likely augmented by its translation activity.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29830.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>eIF4E overexpression correlates with increased HA synthesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence staining of HA (in green) using biotinylated HA-binding protein with streptavidin-FITC in U2Os cells overexpressing eIF4E, S53A mutant or vector control in the presence or absence of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> Hyaluronidase treatment.

Ribavirin directly binds eIF4E and inhibits its mRNA export and translation functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pettersson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kentsis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Volpon et al., 2013</xref>). We observed a reduction in HA to background levels via confocal microscopy using either ribavirin treatment or RNAi knockdown of eIF4E. Using FACE, we similarly observed a ~ ninefold reduction in HA levels for both eIF4E knockdown relative to control RNAi and ~2.5-fold for ribavirin treated versus untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Thus, eIF4E is necessary for HA production in these cells.</p><p>We extended our studies to assess whether eIF4E drives HA production in cellular contexts characterized by naturally occurring elevation of eIF4E for example acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assouline et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pettersson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assouline et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pettersson et al., 2011</xref>). First, we examined the MM6 AML cell line which is characterized by elevated nuclear eIF4E levels, and thus with increased mRNA export activity for eIF4E targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a–d</xref>). Using nuclear RIPs and mRNA export assays, we found that all mRNAs for the HA biosynthesis machinery including HAS3 and CD44 are eIF4E export targets in this cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref>). These targets included transcripts encoding GPI, which was not an export target in U2Os cells. This suggests that the ability to promote HA production in these cells might be even more potent and also that the cell context plays a role particularly in terms of isoform content of RNAs and protein compliment. We also note diversity in terms of the enzyme family members associated with eIF4E in MM6 cells versus eIF4E-overexpressing U2Os cells. For instance, transcripts encoding PGM5 which were eIF4E targets in U2Os cells, were not well expressed in MM6 cells. Instead, eIF4E bound to and exported PGM1 mRNAs. Importantly, these conservative substitutions in enzyme content still led to increased HA biosynthesis as observed by FACE and HABP staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Similar to U2Os cells, the surface of MM6 cells was characterized by HA coats. We also found in MM6 cells that eIF4E targeting with ribavirin reduced the mRNA export of the corresponding HA enzymes and CD44 from two- to ninefold depending on the mRNA monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Ribavirin did not alter total mRNA levels consistent with this being a post-transcriptional effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Consistently, ribavirin treatment dramatically lowered protein levels for the representative members of the HA biosynthetic machinery examined: HAS3, HK, UGDH as well as CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). HA staining was reduced to background levels by ribavirin or HAse treatment as observed by HABP staining and confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). We paralleled these studies in primary high-eIF4E AML specimens and also in CD34+ bone marrow specimens isolated from healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–f</xref>). Consistent with the MM6 cells, 9/9 high-eIF4E AML specimens had HA coats and protrusions with HA staining 4–10 fold higher than the five normal human CD34+ specimens which all showed low-level, presumbably background, HA staining similar to intensities observed in vector controls U2Os cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). These findings suggest that the HA coat is specific to the malignant state and not a general feature of blood cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–f</xref>). These findings point to new functionalities for HA in leukemia cells, where it was previously thought HA only played a role in the bone marrow stroma and not on the leukemia cells themselves.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29830.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>eIF4E elevates HA in cancer cell lines and primary specimens.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RT-qPCR of HA synthesizing enzymes and its receptor CD44 following RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) from nuclei of MM-6 cells using anti-eIF4E antibody.

These cells had highly elevated nuclear eIF4E, and also had readily visible HA-surface coats and protrusions as observed by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). Ribavirin treatment reduced HAS3 and CD44 levels relative to untreated controls as well as dramatically reduced HA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). Furthermore, we observed by in situ translation studies using fluorescence non-canonical amino-acid tagging (FUNCAT), that there could be active translation down the length of the protrusions in eIF4E-overexpressing and 66cl4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a–b</xref>). These translation foci are cyclohexamide dependent validating them as sites of ongoing translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a–b</xref>). We postulate that eIF4E could be involved in localized protein synthesis to spatially couple translation of relevant HA enzymes with HA biosynthesis. In this way, increased rates of translation may not be required, but localization of translation could facilitate HA synthesis as well as mRNA export. In all, our studies demonstrate that eIF4E controls HA biosynthesis at both the mRNA export and translation level thereby coordinately driving HA production.</p><p>eIF4E plays well-established roles in invasion, migration and metastasis. We hypothesized that eIF4E co-opted HA synthesis to execute these activities. Starting with invasion, we observed that eIF4E-overexpressing cells invaded matrigel fourfold better than vector controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–b and e–f</xref>). By contrast, the S53A eIF4E mutant increased invasion by only 50% relative to vector controls consistent with its more modest effects on HA production by FACE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e–f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). In both eIF4E overexpressing and vector control cells, RNAi to eIF4E or ribavirin treatment reduced invasion by ~2.5-fold consistent with the significant reduction in HA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e–f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e–f</xref>). To determine the relevance of HA production specifically to eIF4E mediated invasion, we used RNAi to knockdown HAS3 in eIF4E overexpressing and vector cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). We focused on HAS3 since this is the last step in the biosynthetic pathway of HA and its inhibition specifically impairs HA synthesis, whereas other enzymes in this pathway also participate in unrelated processes. We observed that RNAi to HAS3 reduced the invasion activity of eIF4E by ~ fivefold in eIF4E overexpressing cells (to levels of RNAi controls) and 2.5-fold in vector controls where the effects of endogenous eIF4E are likely being targeted. HAS3 knockdown did not affect eIF4E levels as observed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Furthermore, confocal microscopy experiments revealed that RNAi to HAS3 decreased HA levels to background consistent with its baseline invasion activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).

Given the length of time between HAse treatment and re-emergence of HA in eIF4E-overexpressing cells was 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1h</xref>), we treated cells with HAse every 8 hr to ensure HA was depleted during the course of the experiments. We observed that HAse treatment reduced invasion by 40% relative to untreated controls. For comparison, ribavirin decreased invasion by 60% consistent with its reduction of HA to background levels. Strikingly, the combination of ribavirin and HAse reduced invasion by 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e–f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c–d</xref>). Importantly, ribavirin affects multiple eIF4E target pathways, not only HA biosynthesis, and thus its effects are expected to be greater than HAse alone. We extended these studies to monitor the role HA production played in the migration activity of eIF4E in wound healing assays. As expected, we observed increased migration in eIF4E-overexpressing cells relative to vector controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g,h</xref>). Knockdown of HAS3 reduced eIF4E-dependent migration by ~ fourfold while treatment with HAse reduced it by almost twofold indicating this was also an HA dependent phenomenon.</p><p>We extended the above studies to examine the role of HA in eIF4E-mediated metastasis in vivo. Previously, we demonstrated that ribavirin treatment reduced metastasis by 3-fold in an eIF4E-dependent pulmonary metastatic mouse model using 66cl4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pettersson et al., 2015</xref>). In this previous study, 66cl4 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of syngeneic Balb/c mice. On day 11 post injection, mice with palpable tumors were randomized into two groups and treated orally with water or 3 mg ribavirin/mouse/day (5d/week, to reach, clinically achievable, plasma concentration of 23 µM). On day 27, all mice were sacrificed and tumors and lungs were preserved. Metastatic lung burden was calculated as the percentage of tumor/total lung areas for each mouse on 5 × 50 μm serial step sections by manually circling the metastasis (Visiomorph Software). Above, we demonstrated that eIF4E drives HA production in these cells and that ribavirin repressed HAS3 and HA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Here, we investigated these tissue sections to ascertain whether inhibition of eIF4E activity correlated not only with reduced lung metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pettersson et al., 2015</xref>) but also with lower HA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Serial formalin-fixed sections of tumor bearing lungs, from control and ribavirin-treated animals, were stained for HA, and hematoxylin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Staining intensity and area were quantified using Visiomorph. Tumors from 10 animals for treated and nine in the untreated groups were analyzed. Strikingly, we observed a 50% decrease in HA levels in the lungs of ribavirin-treated mice relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–b</xref>). HA surrounded tumor cells indicating that HA was adjacent to and/or on the surface of these cells. As expected, HA was also found in normal tissues, consistent with its major structural role in the microenvironment. HAse treatment of serial sections indicated that the HA staining observed is specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Thus, we demonstrate that eIF4E targeting leads to reduced HA levels and decreased metastasis in vivo.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29830.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>HA biosynthesis is required for eIF4E-mediated lung metastasis in mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histochemical staining of HA using biotinylated HABP in metastatic mouse tumors. +HAse indicates sections were treated with HAse prior to biotinylated HABP to ensure HA staining was specific.

Indeed, CD44 and HA co-localized on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a and e</xref>). These studies are similar to those showing that CD44 bound HA on the surface of HAS3 overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kultti et al., 2006</xref>). Inhibition of CD44 with RNAi or independently with CD44-blocking antibodies (mAb A3D8) reduced eIF4E-mediated invasion by ~ fourfold for RNAi and ~ threefold for mAb A3D8 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b–c and f–g</xref>). The similarity for the reduction induced by CD44 inhibition, knockdown of HAS3 or ribavirin treatment suggests that CD44 plays an important role in this process. Significantly, modulation of CD44 did not alter HA status, as seen by HABP-staining via confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2e</xref>). Thus, although HA is essential for eIF4E-mediated invasion, its co-factors CD44 and perhaps others, are likely also required for this activity. This suggests that the HA coat and/or protrusions need to be armed with CD44 to support the invasion potential of eIF4E overexpressing cells. Further in high-eIF4E cells, HA is likely directly binding CD44 to activate this signaling pathways in neighboring cells and/or in its own cells leading to autocrine stimulation. In either case, these would stimulate cellular signaling cascades that drive the oncogenic phenotype.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our studies demonstrate that the entire HA-network is subjected to coordinated post-transcriptional control by eIF4E, in effect, an RNA regulon controlling HA biosynthesis and ultimately cell surface architecture. Our data suggest that HA levels would scale with both elevation and loss of control of eIF4E. Thus, in normal cells with less eIF4E and tighter eIF4E regulation, HA biosynthesis would be expected to be lower. In cancer cells, elevation of eIF4E and loss of key regulators of eIF4E such as PRH/Hex in AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Topisirovic et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Topisirovic et al., 2003b</xref>), allows more of these transcripts to be bound to eIF4E in the nucleus, have their export elevated and in some cases be better translated. These findings have several mechanistic and clinical implications. For instance, factors that modulate the levels, localization, or phosphorylation of eIF4E are positioned to profoundly affect HA production and the global activity of the HA network. Indeed, targeting eIF4E with RNAi knockdown or ribavirin treatment reduced HA levels as effectively as direct targeting with HAse. We note that eIF4E drove the production of cell-associated HA which in turn, fundamentally modified the cell-surface architecture facilitating invasion and metastases. Thus eIF4E may specifically drive an oncogenic HA-programme, in contrast to typical situations where this large glycosaminoglycan is extruded into the matrix. It is not yet known if the ability to modulate HA is a property unique to eIF4E, or if other oncoproteins initiate a similar programme.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Reagents and constructs</title><p>pcDNA-2Flag-eIF4E wild-type and S53A mutant constructs were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Culjkovic et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Culjkovic-Kraljacic and Borden, 2013</xref>).

scratch assay</title><p>U2Os cells overexpressing 2Flag-eIF4E or vector control subjected to HAS3 knockdown for 72 hr were seeded in Millicell EZ slide (4-well glass) at 80,000 cell per well diluted in DMEM containing 10% FBS + 1% Pen/Step. On the next day, cells were starved in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS + 1% Pen/Strep for 16 hr. Following incubation, a scratch was made in the cell layer using a 1 ml tip. Cells were then washed with PBS to remove floating cells and fresh DMEM-low-glucose media containing 10% FBS + 1% Pen/Strep + 1 g/l glucose was added (total glucose concentration is 2 g/l). For the HAse treatment conditions, 12 units/ml of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> Hyaluronidase was added per well following media change. Pictures of the scratches were taken at the time of the scratching and after 16 hr. The area not filled with cells was quantified using TScratch software (available from Computational Science and Engineering lab at ETH University, Zurich, Switzerland).</p></sec><sec id="s3-15"><title>Fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE)</title><p>U2Os cells were seeded at 1 million cells/well of a six-well plate and incubated at 37°C 5% CO<sub>2</sub> overnight. 24 hr after, cells were starved in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS + 1% Pen/Strep for 16 hr. Media was then replaced with low glucose DMEM + 1 g/l glucose + 10% FBS + 1% Pen/Strep and incubated for 12 hr at 37°C, 5% CO2. Following incubation, samples were prepared for FACE analysis as previously described (PEG protocol Cleveland Clinic). Briefly, media was collected and cells were washed 3 times with 1x PBS. Media and cells were treated with 1x Proteinase K (from Tritirachium album, Sigma Aldrich, Cat# P2308) for 2 hr at 60°C followed by precipitation and treatment with Hylauronidase and Chondroitinase ABC. Samples were finally lyophilized, resuspended in AMAC solution and separated on acrylamide gels as described. Fluorescence detection of AMAC derivatives was achieved with GelDoc system. DNA was quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit (ThermoFisher, P11496).</p></sec><sec id="s3-16"><title>Histochemistry staining</title><p>Tumor blocks of mouse mammary tumors and lung metastases of published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pettersson et al., 2015</xref>) were analyzed for HA staining as a function of ribavirin treatment from 10 ribavirin and 10 control animals. A total of 3 × 4 μm serial step sections were prepared and stained for each mouse for HABP and hematoxylin. Batch analysis of 10 selected areas of 5.8 × 10<sup>−2</sup> mm (2.4 × 105 pixels) were run. Percent positive nuclei per section were determined by addition of areas until the average percent positive nuclei for one section did not change. One tumor section per animal was analyzed, and at least three areas of healthy tissue were taken into consideration for the percent positive nuclei result.</p></sec><sec id="s3-17"><title>In situ protein synthesis assay</title><p>We used Click-iT HPG Alexa Four 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# C10428) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells pretreated with 20 µM Ribavirin for 48 hr were seeded in Millicell EZ slide (4-well glass) at 80,000 cell per well diluted in DMEM containing 10% FBS + 1% Pen/Step. On the next day, cells were starved in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS + 1% Pen/Strep for 16 hr. Following starvation, media was replaced with fresh DMEM-low glucose containing 10% FBS + 1% Pen/Strep+1 g/l glucose was added (total glucose concentration is 2 g/l) and cells were incubated for 12 hr to allow synthesis of HA. After incubation, cells were incubated with HPG for 1 hr in methionine-free RPMI + 10% FBS + 1% P/S + 1 g/l glucose. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Incorporation of HPG was detected using Click-iT Cell Reaction Buffer Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confocal analysis was used to assess in situ protein synthesis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was supported by grants to KLBB from the NIH (80728 and 98571) and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Translational Research Program.

They used RNA-IP of nuclear extracts to identify mRNAs bound to eIF4E in the nucleus, which included multiple hyaluronic acid (HA)-synthesizing enzymes and HA receptors, and showed evidence that nuclear export of all but one of these mRNAs was enhanced by overexpressing WT but not an export-defective eIF4E mutant. For several of these mRNAs, they showed that increased protein expression accompanied increased mRNA export. This appeared to involve increased translation of the mRNAs in addition to increased mRNA export as protein expression was increased by a smaller amount when the export-defective eIF4E was overexpressed. Consistent with this, they showed that cellular HA levels were increased by overexpression (OE) of WT, and less so by the export-defective mutant 4E protein, and the HA was found coating the cell surface. siRNA KD of eIF4E, or its inhibition with ribavirin, eliminated the HA overproduction conferred by eIF4E OE. They extended these assays to various malignant cell lines and demonstrated eIF4E IP with HA-relevant mRNAs and eIF4E-dependent HA overproduction on cell surfaces, supporting the relevance to cancer of the results obtained from eIF4E OE in U2OS cells. They go on to show that increased invasiveness of cells conferred by OE of WT eIF4E, and less so by the mutant eIF4E is reversed by siRNA KD of the HA biosynthetic enzyme HAS3, which reduces HA expression, to same extent observed for KD of eIF4E or ribavirin treatment, indicating that the known increased invasiveness conferred by eIF4E OE is dependent on HA production. As KD of HAS3 reduces invasiveness even in cells not OE eIF4E, there is some a question about whether the effect of HAS3 KD merely reflects a requirement for HA in invasiveness, and whether other targets of eIF4E mediate the increased invasiveness of eIF4E OE. In fact, inhibiting eIF4E with ribavirin inhibits invasiveness even when cells are treated with HAse to digest HA, implying additional eIF4E targets beyond the enzymes of HA biosynthesis. They further showed that increased cell migration in a wound-healing assay conferred by eIF4E overexpression was blocked by KD of HAS3 or HAase treatment to reverse HA production. Previously, they showed that ribavirin reduced metastasis in an eIF4E-dependent mouse lung tumor cancer model, and they showed here that ribavirin reduced HA levels in the lungs of these mice. Finally, they showed that cell surface receptor CD44, a known downstream effector of HA, is overproduced in cells overexpressing eIF4E, as would be expected from their RNA-IP and mRNA export assays, and that siRNA KD of CD44 reduced the increased invasiveness conferred by eIF4E OE, without affecting the status of HA itself. They conclude that the HA network (biosynthetic enzymes and downstream effectors) is regulated post-transcriptionally by eIF4E, at least in normal or malignant cells that are overexpressing eIF4E. These results are significant in providing evidence for specific target genes of eIF4E required for the known oncogenic effects of overexpressing this initiation factor.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The results of the initial RIP screen described in the beginning of the Results should be presented as supplementary information.</p><p>2) The complete Western data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, containing the MCl-1 loading control, should be incorporated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>3) The Western blots of eIF4E recovered in immune complexes with eIF4E antibodies and IgG relative to input amount of eIF4E should be shown as necessary documentation of the RIPs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, as well as for those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.

Alternatively, and more incisive, the authors could attempt to provide evidence that eIF4E overexpression increases the rate of translation initiation of HA-pathway mRNAs by conferring shift towards heavier polysomes of the polysome-associated pool of these mRNAs on eIF4E overexpression. Although it is not necessary to justify the main conclusions of the paper, providing evidence for altered translation efficiencies of HA pathway proteins on 4E overexpression, or lack thereof, would considerably enhance the scientific quality of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper deals with the mechanism of oncogenic transformation promoted by overexpression of the cap binding protein eIF4E, and evidence that post-transcriptional control by eIF4E of hyaluronic acid producing enzymes and receptors has an important role in the process.

The ability of eIF4E OE to enhance HA production seems to involve both increased export and increased translation of the mRNAs encoding HA network components, as OE of the transport-defective eIF4E variant still conferred increased protein production. However, there is no direct evidence for increased translation of any of these mRNAs, and thus, no examination of what sequences or structures might confer increased translation on eIF4E OE. Nor is there any molecular understanding of what sequences/structures in these mRNAs confer increased nuclear export at high eIF4E levels. Nevertheless, the findings described in the Abstract, which appear to be well established by careful experimentation, do shed new light on the mechanism of oncogenesis in response to eIF4E overexpression.</p><p>1) It would enhance the scientific quality of the paper if they provided evidence that some of the mRNAs in the HA network whose nuclear export is enhanced by eIF4E overexpression were shown to exhibit increased rates of translation initiation as indicated by a shift towards heavier polysomes of the polysome-associated pool of these mRNAs on eIF4E overexpression. (Increased export alone would be expected to increase the fraction of mRNA engaged with ribosomes but not increase the number of ribosomes per mRNA.) If so, a consideration of the potential for forming secondary structure of the mRNA 5'UTRs would be in order to determine whether these mRNAs appear likely to have a greater than average dependence on eIF4F/eIF4A for removing RNA structures that impede ribosome attachment or scanning.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript &quot;The eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E drives production of hyaluronan&quot; provides data showing that eIF4E promotes the increased protein production of hyaluroan and associated proteins through mRNA export and post-transcriptional control. This work is important with regards to understanding the role of elevated eIF4E in cancer and should be published if the reviewers meet the following concerns.</p><p>1) The authors introduce the fact that preliminary studies using genome-wide screens of nuclear eIF4E RIPs provided the evidence that HA biosynthesis factor RNAs were enriched with eIF4E however they do not show any of the data in this paper. This is strange as it is the prerequisite for the rest of the paper. Although the RT-qPCR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows that these RNAs are enriched, the preliminary screen should also be shown. In addition, do the authors have any data to suggest that these RNA targets are direct, e.g. cross-linking data?</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> legend the authors state that MCl-1 served as a loading control, however the western blots do not contain an MCl-1 western.

EIF4E was previously shown to modulate expression of many transcripts through its dual role in nuclear mRNA export and protein translation, both functions are required for its oncogenic role.

This manuscript demonstrated that the HA network is subjected to coordinated post-transcriptional control by eIF4E, and that eIF4E drives the production of cell-associated HA, which in turn, changes the cellular architecture, enabling the processes of tumor invasion and metastasis.

The first screen was an RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) from the nuclear fractions of U2Os cells using an anti-eIF4E antibody and identifying associated RNAs using microarray (RIP-Chip). The second screen determined which RNAs accumulated in the nucleus upon inhibition of eIF4E-dependent mRNA export with ribavirin using microarrays in THP1 AML cells, which are characterized by high-eF4E. In this screen, ribavirin treated or untreated cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic components. Total mRNAs were also assessed and did not change as a function of ribavirin treatment. Data were presented as the ratio of RNA in the nuclear versus cytoplasmic fraction as a function of ribavirin treatment. Thus, higher fold enrichment indicates more RNA is accumulated in the nucleus upon ribavirin treatment due to inhibition of eIF4E-dependent mRNA export. Transcripts that are both enriched in the nuclear eIF4E immunoprecipitation (RIP) and have their nuclear export inhibited by ribavirin (as observed by nuclear accumulation of the transcript) relative to untreated controls were scored as positive hits and prioritized for independent validation by RT-qPCR as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of the manuscript. Strikingly, our analysis showed that nearly all the enzymes involved in hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesis were positive hits (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). For comparison, several negative controls are shown: tubulin, VCAM, GAPDH and UGT2B7.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29830.016</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29830-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>These RIP-chip studies served as a launch point for the studies reported here. The purpose of these screens was to identify targets that we would validate independently using RT-qPCR, as we did in this manuscript. However, both screens were only done once and thus lack statistical power and relied on microarray technology, which is outdated with many disadvantages relative to RNA-Seq etc.</p><p>Our RT-qPCR studies reported in our manuscript validated our choice of studying HA in both U2Os and AML cells (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the preliminary nature of the screen studies makes us uncomfortable publishing the full list. Thus, we included a figure for the reviewers for the relevant factors in the pathway, but respectively request that these data not be included.

Comparison of fold changes for the given normalization methods shows that while normalizing to input controls produces higher fold changes for some transcripts, enrichment of others in the immunoprecipitated fraction is underestimated. Normalizing to input can lead to false negatives especially for very abundant RNAs. For instance, if every eIF4E is bound by a certain RNA, but that RNA is very abundant, one might falsely assume that it is not a target because it has a small depletion versus input. As such, normalizing levels of mRNA enrichment to input may not be more accurate when compared to IgG controls. IgG controls also provide important information about background binding to the beads, which is not incorporated when input alone is used.

Unfortunately, there is no “normal” CD34+ cell line available. The AML cell line referred to by the referee used for the IP was MM6 AML cell lines, and thus amounts of material were not an issue. The primary CD34+ and primary AML studies in the manuscript explored HA levels using confocal microscopy, requiring few cells and thus not very expensive compared to the IP.

Alternatively, and more incisive, the authors could attempt to provide evidence that eIF4E overexpression increases the rate of translation initiation of HA-pathway mRNAs by conferring shift towards heavier polysomes of the polysome-associated pool of these mRNAs on eIF4E overexpression. Although it is not necessary to justify the main conclusions of the paper, providing evidence for altered translation efficiencies of HA pathway proteins on 4E overexpression, or lack thereof, would considerably enhance the scientific quality of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that many nuclear proteins bind to the dorsal surface of eIF4E including LRPPRC one of the key mediators of eIF4E dependent mRNA export (see Volpon et al., RNA 2017). The LRPPRC-binding site on eIF4E overlaps with the eIF4G binding site suggesting that there is every possibility that 4EGI-1 could inhibit mRNA export functions of eIF4E as well as its functions in translation.

Some of the HA pathway enzymes were modestly affected; while most were not altered substantially. For instance, eIF4E shifts UGP2 and UAP RNAs to heavier polysomes but we note these shifts are not dramatic. Our findings are consistent with studies with the S53A mutant, which is active in translation and not in export. By western blot, S53A produced mild stimulations to these same proteins, but given the more dramatic effects of wildtype eIF4E, the export was still the more substantial contributor to the observed phenotypes in U2Os cells.

(Increased export alone would be expected to increase the fraction of mRNA engaged with ribosomes but not increase the number of ribosomes per mRNA.) If so, a consideration of the potential for forming secondary structure of the mRNA 5'UTRs would be in order to determine whether these mRNAs appear likely to have a greater than average dependence on eIF4F/eIF4A for removing RNA structures that impede ribosome attachment or scanning.</p></disp-quote><p>See Essential revisions section for addition of polysomes.</p><p>No obvious structural motifs were apparent when studying the 5’ UTRs of these transcripts.
