reabsorption in the kidney. The lack of potent, specific modulators of TRPV5 has limited the ability to probe the contribution of TRPV5 in disease phenotypes such as hypercalcemia and nephrolithiasis. Here, we performed structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) at a previously identified TRPV5 inhibitor binding site coupled with electrophysiology screening and identified three novel inhibitors of TRPV5, one of which exhibits high affinity, and specificity for TRPV5 over other TRP channels, including its close homologue TRPV6. Cryo-electron microscopy of TRPV5 in the presence of the specific inhibitor and its parent compound revealed novel binding sites for this channel. Structural and functional analysis have allowed us to suggest a mechanism of action for the selective inhibition of TRPV5 and lay the groundwork for rational design of new classes of TRPV5 modulators.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRP channel</kwd><kwd>TRPV5</kwd><kwd>Cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>ion channal</kwd><kwd>inhibitors</kwd><kwd>structure-based virtual screening</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM103899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moiseenkova-Bell</surname><given-names>Vera Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM129357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moiseenkova-Bell</surname><given-names>Vera Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM093290</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohacs</surname><given-names>Tibor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM131048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohacs</surname><given-names>Tibor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NSNS055159</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohacs</surname><given-names>Tibor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ACI-1053575</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Filizola</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB080077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Filizola</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure-based virtual screening reveals multiple novel TRPV5 inhibitors that bind and exert their effect from previously unidentified binding sites as characterized by cryo-electron microscopy and electrophysiology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>TRPV5 is a calcium selective ion channel that is responsible for the fine tuning of calcium reabsorption in the kidney and has been shown to be a critical component of systemic calcium homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoenderop et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Groot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Na and Peng, 2014</xref>). Due to its role in calcium handling, potent and specific chemical modulators of TRPV5 have the potential to aid in treatments of calcium homeostasis disorders such as nephrolithiasis and hypercalcemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nie et al., 2016</xref>). By uncovering specific modulators of TRPV5, it would be possible to identify the contribution of TRPV5 to these disease phenotypes and provide a foundation of targeted treatments. Additionally, chemical probes of TRPV5 could aid in identifying its roles in cell types where it is expressed in low abundance or in cell types that express both TRPV5 and its close homologue TRPV6. While there are some synthetic modulators of TRPV5 including econazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nilius et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughes et al., 2018a</xref>), TH-1177 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Landowski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peng et al., 2018</xref>), and select cannabinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janssens et al., 2018</xref>), all have reported potencies in the mid-micromolar range and currently none have robust selectivity for TRPV5 over TRPV6 and the other TRPV subfamily channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nilius et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Landowski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janssens et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Mechanisms of endogenous regulation of TRPV5 have been well documented using both structural and functional methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Groot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughes et al., 2018a</xref>). In the cell, binding of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is critical for channel opening while rapid desensitization occurs via binding of calmodulin (CaM) to the base of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Na and Peng, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughes et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van der Wijst et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, activators that bind directly to TRPV5 could act by allosterically enhancing conductance during PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> activation, mimicking PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> activation or decreasing CaM-induced desensitization. On the other hand, inhibitors that bind to TRPV5 are expected to act by directly blocking PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding, allosterically limiting the conformational changes induced by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding, directly blocking ion flow by binding in the pore or by increasing the desensitization of TRPV5 by CaM. Due to the conserved nature of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> modulation within the TRP channel family, allosteric modulators are more likely to be both potent and specific for TRPV5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rohács et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thyagarajan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rohacs, 2014</xref>).</p><p>With the availability of large compound libraries in ready-to-dock format and recent advancements in docking algorithms, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) technology is contributing more significantly to drug discovery efforts, especially when high-resolution protein structures are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lyu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basith et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we screened the previously identified econazole-binding pocket of TRPV5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2018b</xref>), which was reported in the same location as the vanilloid binding pocket in TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). This allosteric binding site has been reported to bind modulators such as small molecules and lipids in several TRPV subfamily channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughes et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). Through this screen we identified three novel synthetic inhibitors that to our best knowledge have not been previously characterized as modulators for any protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In silico compound screening</title><p>Currently, several structures of TRPV5 are available with a variety of modulators bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughes et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2018b</xref>). The econazole-bound TRPV5 structure revealed that the small-molecule inhibitor of TRPV5, econazole, bound in the ‘vanilloid’ pocket of TRPV5, which is a well-documented site of modulator binding in other TRPV channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). This pocket, which was resolved to a higher resolution (~3.0 Å local resolution) in the lipid-bound TRPV5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughes et al., 2018a</xref>), was used for SBVS. Specifically, this binding pocket is located at the interface of two adjacent monomers and is composed of the S3, S4 and S4-S5 linker of one monomer and the S5 and S6 helices of the second monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The resolution of this pocket in the lipid-bound TRPV5 structure allowed for unambiguous backbone placement and confident side chain placement. Using the Schrodinger suite 2018–1,~12 million compounds from the ZINC15 ‘Drugs Now’ library, were docked into this pocket. The top 100 compounds as ranked by their docking score were grouped into 65 clusters of unique chemical scaffolds based on their chemical similarity assessed by Tanimoto similarity scores of ECFP4 binary fingerprints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Econazole was not part of the ‘in stock’ library and was therefore excluded from the original screen. A follow up screen in the same pocket that included econazole revealed a less favorable docking score (−5.9) compared to the top 100 hits (&lt;−9.0). Additionally, none of these top 100 compounds exhibited significant similarity (defined by a Tanimoto similarity score larger than 0.4) with econazole or other known TRPV5 inhibitors. Of the 65 unique chemical scaffolds identified as cluster representatives (centroid of clusters), 43 compounds were purchased based on availability and price (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Functional validation of compound hits</title><p>These 43 compounds were screened in HEK293 cells expressing rabbit TRPV5 using whole cell patch clamp experiments to measure modulation of monovalent currents through TRPV5, as describe earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2018b</xref>). While TRPV5 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> selective ion channel, it conducts monovalent currents in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents are not only smaller than monovalent currents, but they also undergo Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced inactivation, therefore monovalent currents are routinely used for assessing channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoenderop et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Velisetty et al., 2016</xref>).

The transmembrane domain (TMD) consists of transmembrane helices 1–4 (S1-S4) bundled in a voltage sensing-like domain with helices 5 and 6 (S5 and S6) domain swapped to create the pore of the channel. The intracellular portion of the protein is primarily composed of tightly packed ankyrin repeat domains (ARDs). Higher local resolution in the TMD of both structures allowed for the confident placement of side chains in this region when building the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>). The lower resolution ARDs of both structures allowed for confident carbon backbone placement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>).

Of these residues that contact the compound density in the EM map, only Y415 is not conserved between TRPV5 and TRPV6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In TRPV6, the residue at this position is a phenylalanine. In order to support ligand binding at this site, we tested the inhibition of ZINC17988990 on F468A, D406A and Y415F mutations of TRPV5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The F468A mutation created a non-functional channel, implying this residue is important for proper protein folding, trafficking to the membrane and/or activation by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. The D406A mutation eliminated inhibition of the channel at low concentrations while maintaining the inhibitory effect at higher concentrations, resulting in an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3.68 ± 1.03 μM. The Y415F mutation also resulted in a reduced potency of ZINC17988990, resulting in an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.644 ± 0.106 μM (Figure 4C). The substantially reduced inhibitory effects of these S1-S4 bundle mutant channels indicate that this compound exerts its inhibitory effect primarily by binding in this pocket. The D406A mutant did not reduce inhibition of TRPV5 by ZINC9155420, which appears to bind in a different area of the TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>; also see following section), indeed this mutant required slightly lower concentrations of the drug than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This indicates that the D406A mutant did not reduce inhibition by ZINC17988990 non-specifically by increasing open state stability of the channel, but rather by specifically interfering drug binding.</p><p>The second density located near the SBVS pocket appeared to be bound at the interface of the S4-S5 linker of one monomer and the S6 helix of an adjacent monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). This region of TRPV5 has a local resolution of 3.0–3.5 Å which allowed for unambiguous side chain and backbone placement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>). It should be noted that this density, though present in the sharpened cryo-EM density map, was not consistently visible in the half-maps and therefore could be attributed to either low occupancy inhibitor binding or noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). To illustrate how the inhibitor could fit in the density, one proposed conformation of ZINC17988990 is shown throughout the figures. To further investigate the contribution of this pocket to channel inhibition we tested the effect of ZINC17988990 on M491A mutated TRPV5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). We observed only a small decrease in the inhibitory potency of ZINC17988990 on this mutant (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.258 ± 0.093 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of the M491A-D406A double mutant by ZINC17988990 was indistinguishable from the D406A S1-S4 bundle mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). These data show that the S4-S5 linker is unlikely to play a major role in ZINC17988990-mediated inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Insights into the mechanism of specific TRPV5 inhibition</title><p>This ZINC17988990-inhibited TRPV5 structure, in combination with the other previously solved TRPV5 structures, provides insight as to how binding in the S1-S4 bundle could lead to channel inhibition. The binding site of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> head group, a well characterized endogenous activator of TRPV5, does not overlap with this identified inhibitor binding site, which implies that the mechanism of inhibition for this novel specific compound is not to directly compete for binding with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Rather, it is possible that conformational changes due to inhibitor binding could lock the channel in a state that would not allow for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-mediated activation.</p><p>Large movements of the TRPV5 channel have been shown to occur during PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> induced channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughes et al., 2018a</xref>). Specifically, the rearrangement of the lower S6 helix caused by the phosphate head group binding to R584 causes global shifts in the protein from the lipid-bound apo state (PDB: 6DMR) to the opened PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-bound state (PDB: 6DMU). While the ZINC17988990-bound TRPV5 structure is similar to the lipid-bound apo structure, there are several key differences when comparing this inhibited state to the lipid-bound apo state.</p><p>In particular, when aligned based on the pore dimer (all atom alignment of M497-R584 of opposite chains using PyMOL) the S1-S4 bundle of the ZINC17988990-bound structure appears to have undergone a shift from the lipid-bound apo structure to accommodate the binding of ZINC17988990. Specifically, the S2 and S3 helices of the ZINC17988990-bound TRPV5 have moved toward the ZINC17988990 density, which creates a tighter space with in the intracellular section of the S1-S4 bundle compared to the lipid-bound apo TRPV5 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Residues E403, D406 and Y415 appear to move 1–2.5 Å (as measured at the Cα) to accommodate compound binding, while F468 and Y467 do not appear to undergo significant conformational rearrangement (&lt;1 Å movement at the Cα; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Conformational changes undergone in the S1-S4 bundle upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding include movement away from the pore axis of all four helices, with the largest movements in the lower halves of the S1 and S2 helices (aligned as described above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). Additionally, a counterclockwise rotation of the bundle and a pivot of the TRP helix occur accommodate the helix transition at the base of the ion conduction pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). Based on the positioning of the ZINC17988990 density, these shifts and rotations would be limited by the interactions of ZINC17988990 with D406 and Y415 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These stabilizing interactions could act to lock this inhibited conformation of the channel in place and not allow for the shifts in the S1-S4 bundle that are necessary for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding and subsequent activation. Consistent with this idea, we found that the D406A mutation slightly, but significantly reduced the inhibition of TRPV5 evoked by decreasing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> using the voltage dependent lipid phosphatase drVSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49572.026</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>S1-S4 bundle mediated inhibition of TRPV5.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overlay of the lower S1-S4 bundle in ZINC17988990-bound (red) and lipid-bound (salmon) TRPV5.

Rather, it appears that the structural difference between TRPV5 and TRPV6 in this region may play a role. The 16 amino acid linker between the S2 and S3 helices of TRPV5 has consistently been resolved as a stable short helix while in the many cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography structures of TRPV6, this linker has not been resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McGoldrick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saotome et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Both Y415 and D406, which make contacts with the drug density in the ZINC17988990-bound TRPV5 structure, are unresolved in all reported TRPV6 structures. The lack of stability in this region in TRPV6 may not allow for those residues to establish interactions with ZINC17988990, preventing effective inhibition. This structural difference could be due to small differences in sequence in the regions that stabilize the S2-S3 linker in TRPV5, such as the TRP domain and the N-linker.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Nonspecific inhibition of TRPV5</title><p>While severely limited by resolution, the ZINC9155420-bound TRPV5 structure was still able to give us some insights on the interactions between this novel nonspecific inhibitor and the TRPV5 channel.

Notably, a post hoc SBVS screen using (a) the ZINC9155420-bound TRPV5 cryo-EM atomic model with a lipid molecule in the econazole pocket and the other identified lipid in the vicinity, (b) the same ZINC15 compound library we used in the original screen, and (c) a screening grid centered on ZINC9155420, identified ZINC9155420 and ZINC17988990, as well as other derivatives of these two molecules, among the top-scored compounds. Therefore, while SBVS protocols utilize predefined binding sites, and we did not foresee lipid occupancy of the initially used econazole site, the retrospective identification of the same novel TRPV5 inhibitors characterized here if one used the correct binding pocket gives confidence in the approach used.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have reported three novel TRPV5 inhibitors. One of these compounds, ZINC17988990 is specific for TRPV5 over its close homologue TRPV6 as well as other TRP family channels. ZINC17988990 inhibits TRPV5 with higher affinity and higher specificity than previously described compounds, and therefore will be a highly valuable tool in future experiments to study TRPV5.</p><p>Structural and functional characterization of two of these compounds identified two novel inhibitor binding sites for the TRPV5 channel. One binding site was identified at the interface between lipids, the S4-S5 linker of one monomer and the S6 helix of an adjacent monomer and appears to play a role in ZINC9155420-mediated inhibition. The other site identified in the ZINC17988990-bound TRPV5 structure occupies the intracellular half of the S1-S4 bundle. This binding site partially overlaps with modulators seen in the recent TRPM8 structures as well as the 2-APB binding site reported for TRPV6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singh et al., 2018</xref>). 2-APB is a small-molecule inhibitor of TRPV6 which acts as an activator for other TRPV subfamily channels while having no effect on TRPV5 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kovacs et al., 2012</xref>). The specificity of both 2-APB and ZINC17988990 in spite of the high sequence homology in this pocket between TRPV5 and TRPV6 may be explained by the structural divergence of these channels in this region.</p><p>An analysis of other TRPV5 cryo-EM structures has provided insight into a potential mechanism of action of the specific inhibitor by locking TRPV5 in closed states that may not allow for the conformational changes necessary for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding and subsequent activation. Specifically, the binding of key residues such as D406 and Y415 in the S1-S4 pocket, that have not been seen to interact with any non-protein density in previous structures, could limit movement in this region and confer inhibition.</p><p>The success of this multidisciplinary approach has allowed for the discovery and characterization of two novel inhibitors of TRPV5 that have the potential to be optimized for higher potency and selectivity. Moreover, the identification of a binding site that allows for specificity of TRPV5 over TRPV6 in spite of the high sequence homology now allows for a more controlled structure-based drug discovery effort at this pocket that has the potential to reveal additional specific small molecule modulators of TRPV5. Overall, this study has laid the groundwork for the development of more potent and specific inhibitors of TRPV5.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Structure-based virtual screening</title><p>The 3.9 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the lipid-bound TRPV5 tetramer (PDB ID: 6DMR) was used for a first SBVS study. The default protocol of the Protein Prep Wizard in the Schrodinger suite 2018-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sastry et al., 2013</xref>) was followed to prepare the protein for docking. Specifically, missing hydrogen atoms were added, side chain protonation states were assigned, and energy minimization was carried out using the OPLS3 force-field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harder et al., 2016</xref>). Since the four monomers of TRPV5 are identical in the starting TRPV5 tetramer structure, monomer A was chosen as a representative structure to build a docking grid using the Schrodinger’s Receptor Grid generation tool, with the grid centered at the lipid molecule’s center in the binding pocket of the protein monomer. The box dimensions for the inner and outer grid boxes were 10 Å x 10 Å x 10 Å, and 30 Å x 30 Å x 30 Å, respectively.</p><p>The ZINC15 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zinc15.docking.org/">http://zinc15.docking.org/</ext-link>) ‘Drugs Now’ subset consisting of 11,768,355 compounds as of March 27, 2018 was downloaded and prepared for docking using the default procedure in the Schrodinger’s Ligprep utility. Following ligand preparation and protein grid generation, Glide was used to dock molecules of the ‘Drugs Now’ subset in two steps. First, Glide standard precision (SP) was used to preliminarily screen the ligand library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Halgren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Friesner et al., 2004</xref>).

Secondly, the resulting 197,820 molecules were subjected to a Glide’s extra precision (XP) refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Friesner et al., 2006</xref>). The top-ranked 100 molecules resulting from this refinement were then grouped into 65 clusters based on their chemical similarity calculated using Tanimoto similarity scores of ECFP4 binary fingerprints in the Schrodinger’s Canvas program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Duan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sastry et al., 2010</xref>).

The structure was prepared for docking following the same procedure as described above, and the grid was centered at the ligand’s (ZINC9155420) center in the binding pocket of monomer A inferred by the cryo-EM density map. Both lipid molecules assumed to occupy the additional densities identified near the compound were kept in this SBVS study. Docking was carried out following the same protocol described above and using the same compound library. Glide SP docking score plateaued at around −5.5, and the resulting 860,000 molecules were selected for Glide XP docking refinement.

Yeast cells were lysed using a microfluidizer and the membranes were isolated via centrifugation at 3,000 g, 14,000 g and 100,000 g. The membranes were solubilized in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM TCEP, 1 mM PMSF and 0.87 mM LMNG. Insoluble material was removed via ultracentrifugation.

TRPV5 was then reconstituted into nanodiscs by combining TRPV5, MSP2N2 and soy polar lipids in a molar ratio of 1:1:200. Purified MSP2N2 was prepared using previously published methods. To prepare the lipids, soy polar lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc) were dried under nitrogen flow for 3 hr and resuspended in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP and DMNG detergent at a molar ratio of 1:2.5 (lipids:DMNG).

This resulted in the identification of new potent inhibitors of TRPV5, including one that is specific for TRPV5 (when compared to the highly similar TRPV6, and several additional TRP channels). The authors also determine new structures of TRPV5 with these inhibitors (ZINC17988990) and localize a novel binding site in S1-S4. Functional studies show that mutations at this binding site dramatically reduce inhibition by ZINC17988990. Together, these studies identify a new druggable site of TRPV5 channel.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: this article was originally rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal against the decision.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Structure-based discovery of novel TRPV5 inhibitors&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Rachelle Gaudet (Reviewer #2); Youxing Jiang (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Your study describes the discovery and structural characterization of a novel drug binding site on the TRPV5 channels. As you see will see below the reviewers have some concerns about the cryo-EM studies but are mainly concerned about the functional aspects of this study which does not rule out alternate mechanisms.

That is a region where we know in other TRPs we can find gating mutations. And they don't look at the effect of this mutation on other stimuli.

They characterized one lead compound and one derivative of this compound for inhibitory effects on TRPV5 and TRPV6. The lead compound had μM affinity for both TRPV5 and TRPV6 and the derivative had subμM affinity for TRPV5 with no inhibition of TRPV6. CryoEM studies of TRPV5 bound to both compounds revealed binding sites for both compounds that did not overlap with the econozole binding site, demonstrating that the structure-based virtual screening was not ultimately useful.</p><p>The CryoEM studies, although not definitive, seem likely to have identified binding sites for the two compounds studied. This is a strength of the manuscript. Unfortunately, the functional studies do not directly address whether the identified binding sites indeed are functionally relevant nor the mechanism by which they inhibit activation. Mutations that shift the apparent affinity for a ligand need not be within the ligand binding site. An extreme example of this phenomenon is the voltage-sensing domain of voltage-gated ion channels; mutations throughout the sequence, even outside the membrane's electric field, shift the voltage dependence of activation. The authors need to show that mutations have no effects on the ligand-free gating of the channels and that they specifically affect regulation by ligands that act within these particular binding sites and not others. As it stands, the mutagenesis studies provide no mechanistic insight into the inhibitory effects of the compounds nor on the selectivity of the derivative compound.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Hughes and colleagues describes the identification of inhibitors of the TRPV5 ion channel using a structure-based virtual screen as a starting point to identify a set of molecules to screen in functional assays. This resulted in the identification of new inhibitors of TRPV5, including one that is specific for TRPV5 (when compared to the highly similar TRPV6, and several additional TRP channels). The authors also determine new structures of TRPV5 and identify some densities that they attributed to the inhibitors, attributions that they support with IC50 measurements of mutant TRPV5 proteins.</p><p>In the maps provided, the densities assigned to ZINC17988990: The one in the S1-S4 seems quite strong, comparable to the protein density, and includes two regions that fit the aromatic groups well, with an appropriate distance and orientation so that the chosen pose fits very well. There is no comparable density in the other TRPV5 structures, including those from other groups. It is interesting to note this site partially overlaps with density observed in the econazole structure that was attributed to lipid in the NSMB publication.</p><p>I find the discovery of the ZINC17988990 compound and its binding site within the TRPV5 S1-S4 region exciting and compelling. Some of the other conclusions, however, are not as strongly supported by the data and analysis.</p><p>In particular:</p><p>The density for the ligands at the S4-S5 regions are rather weak (the ZINC17988990in particular), essentially gone in 5-σ maps, and weaker than several other unmodeled blobs of comparable or larger size. The modeled ligand poses are also somewhat strangely positioned; they contact very few protein atoms.</p><p>None of the modeled lipids are in the provided PDB: the modeled lipids should either not be discussed and illustrated in the figures, or they should be included in the model deposited in the PDB. This is particularly important because the authors also describe a SBVS in which they included these modeled lipids. On that note, the densities attributed to lipids seem much wider that I expect for a linear chain of methylene groups.</p><p>One of the densities assigned to lipid in this manuscript is very similar, and in the same position, to the density assigned to econazole in the NSMB publication. Can the authors comment on this somewhere in this paper?</p><p>The discussion on structural differences in subsection “Insights into the mechanism of TRPV5 inhibition by novel exogenous compounds” and the related figures (Figure 7 and Figure 8, and Supplementary figure 16 and Figure 5) are difficult to follow and evaluate, because the authors do not describe how they performed the superpositions of the different structures. The movements should instead be described as relative to otherwise. Also, RMSD values should include units (typically Å) and basis (Cα carbons, all atoms, which region of the protein, etc.?).</p><p>Discussion of the S2-S3 linker and the difference between TRPV5 and TRPV6: (and Figure 5—figure supplement 2) if there is no sequence difference between the two channels in that linker, then there should be some other sequence (or structure) difference somewhere else that explains why this linker is disordered in TRPV6 but ordered in TRPV5. Can the authors provide some hypothesis to that effect?</p><p>The ZINC91555420-bound structure is derived from such a small number of particles (~22,000) in comparison to the starting point (&gt;500,000). Do the authors have any idea why that is the case? Are there potentially other structures represented in the other particles? Are there other classes identified?</p><p>Subsection “In silico compound screening”: the authors mention that no compound with similarities to econazole was identified in the screen. Did the library contain econazole itself? If the authors dock econazole, how does it score in comparison to the top compounds identified in the screen?</p><p>Subsection “Functional validation of compound hits”: the authors should introduce the &quot;monovalent currents through TRPV5&quot; – at least reference previous work that uses similar assays.</p><p>Along the same lines: Why didn't the authors look for activation (rather than only potentiation)? With the protocol the authors used, is the open probability of TRPV5 known (i.e. to what extent is that signal &quot;potentiatable&quot;)?</p><p>It would be useful to also test the activation of other TRPs (beside TRPV5 and TRPV6) with ZINC9155420: the authors find that it is not selective between TRPV5 and TRPV6, and that raises the interesting question of whether this compound can also activate other TRPVs, and/or other TRPs (How broad or narrow is the selectivity?).</p><p>Could the authors test the combination of D406A and M491A and how this affects inhibition by ZINC17988990?</p><p>Related: it would be useful to have Supplementary figure 14 part of one of the main figures instead. And what about Y415F with ZINC9155420? It should not be assumed that Y415F would have less of an effect (if any) on inhibition by ZINC9155420 because its effect of this on inhibition by ZINC17988990 was less than that of D409A. That is not a given considering the chemical differences between the two inhibitor molecules.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this study, Hughes et al. performed a structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) of a large compound library focusing on a previously identified TRPV5 inhibitor (econazole) binding pocket. They identified two novel inhibitors of TRPV5, one of which is specific for TRPV5. They also define the binding sites of both inhibitors by determining the structures of TRPV5 in complex with each inhibitor using single particle cryo-EM. Since the exact position/orientation of the bound compounds as well as the interacting residues cannot be properly defined from the structures due to the resolution limit, the authors validated the binding sites by mutagenesis. Structural comparison between the inhibitor-bound closed TRPV5 and the PI(4,5)P2-bound open TRPV5 also provide structural insights into the allosteric inhibition of TRPV5 by these two inhibitors. This is a solid study with a large amount of structural and functional data. I have a few minor concerns.</p><p>1) If I understand correctly, the structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was performed focusing on the previously identified econazole-binding pocket of TRPV5. However, the compounds identified from this screening actually do not bind to the predicted region. I am not sure if this can be considered as a successful example of an in silico screen as the actual binding site is different from the predicted/targeted binding site.</p><p>2) The binding sites for both compounds appear to be more accessible from the cytosolic side of the channel, particularly the TRPV5-specific ZINC17988990 that binds at the S1-S4 pocket. Should the authors use inside-out patch for recording in order to have a faster response of inhibition as well as a better/more accurate measurement of the IC50? Related to this, some compounds that have been tested that show no effect could be due to the compounds' inability to cross the membrane.</p><p>3) Figure 4B shows multiple nearby residues at the ZINC9155420-binding site but the authors only show the mutation of M491. I wonder if they have also tested other residues within this binding pocket.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49572.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Your study describes the discovery and structural characterization of of a novel drug binding site on the TRPV5 channels.

We note that <italic>in silico</italic> screenings are not used to predict binding pockets, but rather to identify putative binders for predetermined pockets. As we reported in the manuscript, we would have prioritized for experimental validation the same series of compounds (out of ~12 million compounds) if we had assumed that the econazole binding site could be occupied by a lipid molecule instead of a small-molecule ligand. We have explained this discrepancy and offered a potential explanation for this in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we addressed this by re-screening the library in a grid that accounts for the presence of a lipid in the econazole binding pocket and concluded the following:</p><p>“Notably, a post hoc SBVS screen using (a) the ZINC9155420-bound TRPV5 cryo-EM atomic model with a lipid molecule in the econazole pocket and the other identified lipid in the vicinity, (b) the same ZINC15 compound library we used in the original screen, and (c) a screening grid centered on ZINC9155420, identified ZINC9155420 and ZINC17988990, as well as other derivatives of these two molecules, among the top-scored compounds. Therefore, while SBVS protocols utilize predefined binding sites, and we did not foresee lipid occupancy of the initially used econazole site, the retrospective identification of the same novel TRPV5 inhibitors characterized here if one used the correct binding pocket gives confidence in the approach used.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mutations that shift the apparent affinity for a ligand need not be within the ligand binding site.

Our data show that the D406A mutant robustly reduces inhibition by the derivative compound ZINC17988990 (Figure 4C). This is unlikely to happen via a non-specific effect, such increased open state stability of the channel, as this mutation did not reduce inhibition by the parent compound ZINC9155420 (Figure 4D). Nevertheless, we performed additional experiments to further address this issue, as described below:</p><p>The TRPV5 channel is a constitutively active channel, kept open by basal phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) levels in the plasma membrane. We performed experiments with the voltage-inducible phosphoinositide phosphatases drVSP, and tested if the D406A and Y415F mutations have any effect on inhibition by depletion of PIP2. We found that inhibition of the D406A mutant was less than the inhibition of the wild type channel; the extent of this difference however was much less than the robust left shift of the ZINC17988990 dose response. The altered inhibition by PIP2 depletion is likely explained by the drug’s interference with PIP2 activation of the channel, which was discussed in the original manuscript as well as in this revised version. The inhibition of the Y415F mutant did not show a statistically significant difference from inhibition of the wild type TRPV5. Overall our original and new data strongly support that the D406 and Y415 residues are part of the functionally important binding site for ZINC17988990. The new data can be seen in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the maps provided, the densities assigned to ZINC17988990: The one in the S1-S4 seems quite strong, comparable to the protein density, and includes two regions that fit the aromatic groups well, with an appropriate distance and orientation so that the chosen pose fits very well.

To be absolutely conclusive with this binding site would require extensive additional work, including probably new structures, which we believe is beyond the scope of a revised manuscript. We also feel that this is unnecessary, as the focus of the manuscript will be the higher affinity, more specific compound the ZINC17988990, for which we have strong data indicating that most, if not all of its effects are exerted via binding the S1-S4 binding site.

If the authors dock econazole, how does it score in comparison to the top compounds identified in the screen?</p></disp-quote><p>Econazole was not part of the ZINC subset of &quot;in-stock&quot; compounds we chose to use for virtual screening. However, a docking experiment conducted on econazole revealed a less favorable docking score (-5.9) compared to that of the novel inhibitor we discovered (ZINC9155420; docking score: -9.38). This information has been included in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Functional validation of compound hits”: the authors should introduce the &quot;monovalent currents through TRPV5&quot; – at least reference previous work that uses similar assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We introduced references for assaying TRPV5 activity by measuring monovalent currents, and briefly explained the rationale for these measurements. We also confirmed that ZINC17988990 also inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux though TRPV5 (but not other TRP channels) by measuring cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in HEK293 cells transfected with TRPV5 and GCaMP6 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along the same lines: Why didn't the authors look for activation (rather than only potentiation)? With the protocol the authors used, is the open probability of TRPV5 known (i.e. to what extent is that signal &quot;potentiatable&quot;)?</p></disp-quote><p>We assume the reviewer meant why we did not look for potentiation, rather than only inhibition. None of the compounds showed any potentiation, but the channels are close to fully active at this protocol, even though there are reports that certain stimuli can further increase activity, these effects are generally small, so the dynamic range of potentiation is well below that of inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be useful to also test the activation of other TRPs (beside TRPV5 and TRPV6) with ZINC9155420: the authors find that it is not selective between TRPV5 and TRPV6, and that raises the interesting question of whether this compound can also activate other TRPVs, and/or other TRPs (How broad or narrow is the selectivity?).</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that the characterization of ZINC9155420 is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Also, ZINC9155420 is far inferior to ZINC17988990 as a TRPV5 inhibitor, as it has lower potency, it does not discriminate between TRPV5 and TRPV6, and it is a lot less stable than ZINC17988990. The latter was not emphasized in the original manuscript, but we had to prepare fresh DMSO stock solutions before every experiment, as frozen stocks lost activity within a couple of days. Therefore, we concluded that this compound is difficult to work with reliably, and its further characterization will not be useful for the research community. We briefly mentioned the lack of stability in the methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Instead we solidified our results with the more specific ZINC 17988990 and performed additional Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux experiments to ensure that not only monovalent currents, but also Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux is inhibited. These new data are shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. They confirm the specificity of ZINC 17988990 at 10 μM for TRPV5 over TRPV6, confirm its lack of effect on TRPV1, TRPM8 and TRPV4, and extend our data to show lack of effect on TRPM3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors test the combination of D406A and M491A and how this affects inhibition by ZINC17988990?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed this experiment and found that the inhibition of the D406A-M491A double mutant by ZINC17988990 was indistinguishable from the D406 mutant, indicating that the contribution of the site containing the M491 residue to TRPV5 inhibition by ZINC17988990 is negligible. The data are shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related: it would be useful to have Supplementary figure 14 part of one of the main figures instead. And what about Y415F with ZINC9155420? It should not be assumed that Y415F would have less of an effect (if any) on inhibition by ZINC9155420 because its effect of this on inhibition by ZINC17988990 was less than that of D409A. That is not a given considering the chemical differences between the two inhibitor molecules.</p></disp-quote><p>We have placed the data from Supplementary figure 14 in the main manuscript (Figure 4D). We have found that the inhibition of the Y415F mutant by drVSP activation was not significantly different from wild type TRPV5, therefore it is unlikely that it caused a right shift in the ZINC17988990 by non-specific effects (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this study, Hughes et al. performed a structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) of a large compound library focusing on a previously identified TRPV5 inhibitor (econazole) binding pocket. They identified two novel inhibitors of TRPV5, one of which is specific for TRPV5. They also define the binding sites of both inhibitors by determining the structures of TRPV5 in complex with each inhibitor using single particle cryo-EM. Since the exact position/orientation of the bound compounds as well as the interacting residues cannot be properly defined from the structures due to the resolution limit, the authors validated the binding sites by mutagenesis. Structural comparison between the inhibitor-bound closed TRPV5 and the PI(4,5)P2-bound open TRPV5 also provide structural insights into the allosteric inhibition of TRPV5 by these two inhibitors. This is a solid study with a large amount of structural and functional data. I have a few minor concerns.</p><p>1) If I understand correctly, the structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was performed focusing on the previously identified econazole-binding pocket of TRPV5. However, the compounds identified from this screening actually do not bind to the predicted region. I am not sure if this can be considered as a successful example of an in silico screen as the actual binding site is different from the predicted/targeted binding site.</p><p>2) The binding sites for both compounds appear to be more accessible from the cytosolic side of the channel, particularly the TRPV5-specific ZINC17988990 that binds at the S1-S4 pocket. Should the authors use inside-out patch for recording in order to have a faster response of inhibition as well as a better/more accurate measurement of the IC50?</p></disp-quote><p>This would be a problematic experiment for the following reasons. (1) channel activity shows a marked and full rundown in excised patches, due to the loss of PIP2 in the patch membrane. (2) We are set up for excised patch measurements in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte system, where the drugs have a different IC50 from that obtained in HEK cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). (3) From the practical standpoint for future in vivo experiments intracellular application is not practical, so an IC50 in that system would not be helpful for the vast majority of future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, some compounds that have been tested that show no effect could be due to the compounds' inability to cross the membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>Even though all compounds were lipid soluble, this is a possibility, and we mentioned it in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4B shows multiple nearby residues at the ZINC9155420-binding site but the authors only show the mutation of M491. I wonder if they have also tested other residues within this binding pocket.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not test other mutations, as we refocused the manuscript on the clear and robust data with the derivative compound ZINC17988990 and the S1-S4 binding site.</p></body></sub-article></article>
