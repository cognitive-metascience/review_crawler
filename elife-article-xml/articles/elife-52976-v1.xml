We have recently provided the first direct in planta evidence for polyspermy induced polyploidization. Capitalizing on a novel <italic>sco1</italic>-based polyspermy assay, we here show that polyspermy can selectively polyploidize the egg cell, while rendering the genome size of the ploidy-sensitive central cell unaffected. This unprecedented result indicates that polyspermy can bypass the triploid block, which is an established postzygotic polyploidization barrier. In fact, we here show that most polyspermy-derived seeds are insensitive to the triploid block suppressor <italic>admetos</italic>. The robustness of polyspermy-derived plants is evidenced by the first transcript profiling of triparental plants and our observation that these idiosyncratic organisms segregate tetraploid offspring within a single generation. Polyspermy-derived triparental plants are thus comparable to triploids recovered from interploidy crosses. Our results expand current polyploidization concepts and have important implications for plant breeding.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ever since Darwin published his most famous book on the theory of evolution, scientists have sought to identify the mechanisms that drive the formation of new species. This is especially true for plant biologists who have long been fascinated by the extraordinary diversity of flowering plants.</p><p>Many species of flowering plant first evolved after a dramatic increase in the DNA content of an individual plant, a process termed polyploidization. Most explanations for polyploidization involve a pollen grain making sperm that mistakenly contain two sets of chromosomes rather than one. Yet, it is difficult to reconcile this explanation with an important aspect of plant reproduction – the so-called “triploid block”.</p><p>Fertilization in flowering plants is more complicated than in animals. While one sperm fertilizes the egg cell to make the plant embryo, a second sperm from the same pollen grain must fertilize another cell to form the endosperm, the tissue that will nourish the embryo as it develops. This means that sperm with twice the normal number of chromosomes would affect the DNA content of both the embryo and the endosperm. Yet, an endosperm that receives extra paternal DNA typically halts the development of the seed via a process known as the triploid block, meaning it was not clear how often this process would actually result in a polyploid plant.</p><p>In 2017, researchers reported that plants can, on rare occasions, generate polyploid offspring via a different route: the fertilization of one egg with two sperm rather than one. Now, Mao et al. – who include several researchers involved in the 2017 study – show that this process, termed “polyspermy”, can introduce extra copies of DNA into just the egg cell, meaning it can bypass the triploid block of the endosperm.</p><p>The experiments involved a model plant called Arabidopsis, and a screen of over 55,000 seeds identified about a dozen with embryos that had three parents, one mother and two fathers. Notably, most of these three-parent embryos developed in seeds that contained endosperm with the regular number of chromosomes and hence escaped the triploid block.</p><p>These new results show that polyspermy provides plants with a means to essentially sneak extra copies of DNA ‘behind the back’ of the DNA-sensitive endosperm and into the next generation. They also give new insight in how polyploidization may have shaped the evolution of flowering plants and have important implications for agriculture where the breeding of new “hybrid” crops has often been limited by incompatibilities in the endosperm.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>polyspermy</kwd><kwd>plant reproduction</kwd><kwd>polyploidization</kwd><kwd>egg cell</kwd><kwd>triploid block</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>646644</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Groß-Hardt</surname><given-names>Rita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GR 3526/8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grosse</surname><given-names>Ivo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A ménàge à trois introduces extra DNA only to plant embryos, thus skipping endosperm-induced seed hybridization barriers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolutionary history of flowering plants is characterized by recurrent polyploidization events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Comai, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Bodt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Otto and Whitton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van de Peer et al., 2017</xref>). Polyploids are generally assumed to arise from unreduced gametes or somatic doubling, i.e. from defects during meiosis or mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kreiner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mason and Pires, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramsey and Schemske, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sattler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Spoelhof et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tayalé and Parisod, 2013</xref>). In addition, recent in planta and in vitro assays have provided the first direct evidence that viable polyploid plants can arise from polyspermy, the fusion of one egg cell with supernumerary sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Toda et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, this previous work indicates that a single <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plant can generate several polyspermy-induced triploid seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The currently favored polyploidization scenario involves the formation of unreduced male gametes and the natural occurrence of such sperm has been reported for several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kreiner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mason and Pires, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramsey, 2007</xref>). Consequently, triploid plants are assumed to function as an important bridge towards polyploidization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Comai, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Felber and Bever, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramsey and Schemske, 1998</xref>) and field studies have identified both auto and allopolyploid triploids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kyrkjeeide et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marques et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schinkel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sree Rangasamy, 1972</xref>). However, the generation of triploid plants via unreduced male gametes is limited by the triploid block, which is a postzygotic hybridization barrier operating in many plants species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dilkes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Köhler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marks, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramsey and Schemske, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scott et al., 1998</xref>). The triploid block is explained by the unique reproductive mode of flowering plants, which involves fertilization of two female gametes, the egg and the central cell. The required sperm cell pair is typically delivered by a single pollen tube. While the fertilized egg cell gives rise to the embryo, the fertilized central cell develops into embryo-nourishing endosperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Russell, 1992</xref>). Fertilization involving unreduced sperm consequently not only affects the ploidy status of the egg cell but also introduces additional paternal chromosome copies to the endosperm, and it is this latter tissue, which commonly mounts the triploid block that is manifested by seed abortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Köhler et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the effect of the triploid block is accession-dependent, being highly penetrant e.g. in Col-0, but less strict in L<italic>er</italic> and C24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dilkes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scott et al., 1998</xref>). A complete triploid block has been reported in many taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramsey and Schemske, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schinkel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sekine et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stoute et al., 2012</xref>). In light of this fatal consequence, it has been suggested that there are ways to overcome this hybridization barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Köhler et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Making use of a two-component in planta assay, we here show that polyspermy can selectively polyploidize the egg cell, while rendering the genome size of the ploidy-sensitive endosperm unaffected. By introducing the triploid block suppressor <italic>admetos</italic>, we in addition show, that this unprecedented reproductive mode bypasses the triploid block.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment of a triparental embryo detection assay</title><p>Consistent with animal nomenclature, the term polyspermy is used alone when referring to egg cell polyspermy. Central cell polyspermy is specified as such. During flowering plant fertilization, both egg and central cell fuse in a coordinated manner with a single sperm each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamamura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kawashima and Berger, 2011</xref>). In order to address whether during polyspermy egg cell fertilization is still coupled to the fertilization of the central cell, we aimed at analyzing endosperm in developing seeds that contain polyspermy-derived embryos. To ease the screening process, we established a novel polyspermy-detection assay termed HIPOD<sub>SCO1,</sub> which can efficiently and unambiguously detect the rare event of egg cell polyspermy already in developing seeds. HIPOD<sub>SCO1</sub> capitalizes on the pale green appearance of developing seeds defective for the gene <italic>SNOWY COTYLEDON 1</italic> (<italic>SCO1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ruppel and Hangarter, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and a bipartite <italic>SCO1</italic> complementation system, provided by two different pollen donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Pollen donor one contains the synthetic <italic>GAL4</italic> transcription factor under the control of the <italic>RPS5a</italic> promoter. Pollen donor two contains a functional copy of <italic>tdTOMATO</italic> tagged S<italic>CO1</italic> under the control of the GAL4 responsive <italic>UAS</italic> enhancer sequence. Seeds that contain a monospermy-derived embryo inherit an incomplete complementation system and will consequently be rendered pale green due to the lack of functional <italic>SCO1</italic>. By contrast, combinations of both constructs, which can only result from polyspermy, will give rise to green seeds with a positive tdTOMATO fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). It should be noted that this assay only detects polyspermy if the two sperm are derived from different pollen donors. Monopaternal polyspermy, which only delivers a single HIPOD<sub>SCO1</sub> component, does not rescue seed color. This scenario is expected to account for 50% of all polyspermy events, and escapes detection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Establishment of a detection assay for polyspermy-derived embryos.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of HIPOD<sub>SCO1</sub>. The assay is based on the UAS-GAL4 two-component system whereby a synthetic transcription factor <italic>mGAL4</italic> expressed under the control of the ubiquitous <italic>RPS5a</italic> promoter activates the <italic>tdTOMATO</italic>-tagged <italic>SCO1</italic> gene.

We processed a total of 56,493 seeds seven days after pollination (DAP) and identified 10 normally developed seeds with a change in color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine whether the candidate embryos were indeed of triparental origin, we microscopically inspected the developing seeds and found that all 10 embryos exhibited a tdTOMATO signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This implies that the embryo inherited two rather than one paternal copy. To identify a corresponding shift in embryo ploidy, we carried out a chromosome spread assay. Chromosome counts are technically challenging when performed on subfractions of individual seeds and some chromosomes escape detection. However, comprehensive controls and the fact that parental chromosome contributions are quantal in nature make the assay robust and reliable.</p><p>Notably all embryos showed a triploid profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This finding is comparable to the results obtained from triploid embryos segregated from an interploidy cross between diploid and tetraploid plants and contrasts with the diploid profile detected in embryos recovered from a regular cross involving haploid gametes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To substantiate this result we introduced a GFP-tagged centromere-localized CENH3 reporter into PD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Storme et al., 2016</xref>). In this complementary experiment we screened 10,774 seeds by HIPOD<sub>SCO1</sub> and recovered three green seeds containing tdTOMATO positive embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In all seeds we detected between 11 and 15 GFP foci indicative of triploid embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Together, the analysis confirms the triparental origin of embryos in seeds with dark green color, establishing HIPOD<sub>SCO1</sub> as a powerful novel tool to identify polyspermy-derived embryos already in developing seeds.</p><p>In order to determine whether egg cell polyspermy is concomitant with central cell polyspermy, we assessed the ploidy of the endosperm in developing seeds containing polyspermy-induced triparental embryos. The central cell of many flowering plants, including <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> is homodiploid and generates a triploid nurturing tissue after sperm fusion. In fact, we detected between 12 and 15 chromosomes in the endosperm of seeds recovered from a cross involving diploid plants. By contrast, more than 15 chromosomes are detected in control interploidy crosses between diploid female and tetraploid male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

However, the data suggests that Arabidopsis responds in a transcriptionally balanced fashion to the inheritance of supernumerary genomes and seed homoploidy.</p><p>Along these lines, also the ability to generate tetraploid offspring within a single generation, a parameter that has been described previously for interploidy cross-induced triploids was maintained: To assess whether polyspermy-derived triploids can segregate stable polyploid offspring, we harvested the seeds of polyspermy-derived triparental plants and propagated them in two successive generations. The progeny of polyspermy-derived triploids segregates a complex swarm of karyotypes, similar to what has previously been described for interploidy crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Henry et al., 2005</xref>). On the basis of flow cytometric analysis, we grouped the plants into five different categories: near-diploids, 2n-3n, near-triploids, 3n-4n and near-tetraploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Already in the F<sub>2</sub> generation 5 out of 109 plants were found to fall into the near-tetraploids category, while 22 plants segregated a diploid-like profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). To determine whether any of the high-ploidy plants represented a genuine tetraploid, we collected seeds and determined the ploidy of 20 offspring per individual F<sub>2</sub> plant. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that 3 out of 5 near-tetraploid F<sub>2</sub> plants segregated exclusively plants that exhibit a ploidy profile characteristic to 4n plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This result was confirmed in the F<sub>4</sub> generation, which, again, revealed a homogenous tetraploid ploidy profile. Together these results show that polyspermy-derived triploid plants have the potential to generate stable tetraploid and diploid offspring within a single generation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Polyspermy-derived three accession hybrids are reproductively isolated from their parental lines</title><p>We previously combined three distinct Arabidopsis accessions in a three parent cross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakel et al., 2017</xref>) and noticed that the resulting triploid hybrids initiate flowering later than their parents, an effect which was previously described also for two-accession hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Groszmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore and Lukens, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>). To address whether this phenotype has the potential to reduce gene flow, we compared flowering time between the parental line and triparental three accession hybrids, henceforth referred to as TT<sub>3</sub>. We found that flowering is induced more than one month later in TT<sub>3</sub> than in the parental lines, and the flowering period of TT<sub>3</sub> is completely isolated from the parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Under our plant growth conditions, L<italic>er</italic> and Col-0 start to flower 24.4 ± 0.7 and 26.6 ± 1.0 DAS, and flowering terminates 44.9 ± 1.2 and 47.1 ± 0.9 DAS, respectively. This corresponds to a flowering period of around 20 days. The C24 flowering window is comparable but flower initiation is delayed by five days (31.8 ± 1.2 DAS). By contrast, TT<sub>3</sub> plants initiate flowering only after 64.6 ± 5.4 days, which is around 20, 17 and 15 days after the respective parental lines have terminated their flowering phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Even though these data are obtained under optimized growth condition, the results suggest that polyspermy-derived triploid three accession hybrids are reproductively isolated from the parental plants in the first generation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The triploid block is an established and widely distributed postzygotic hybridization barrier. In light of its fatal consequence, it has been suggested that there are ways to overcome this hybridization barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Köhler et al., 2010</xref>). We here established a novel polyspermy detection assay that allows to identify and characterize developing embryos resulting from supernumerary sperm fusion. With this tool we were able to show that most polyspermy-derived plants develop from seeds resulting from selective egg cell polyploidization. In those seeds, supernumerary paternal copies are only transmitted to the embryo, thereby bypassing the triploid block of the endosperm. Our results expand previous polyploidization concepts, which state that the increase in genome copies is caused by infrequent meiotic or mitotic defects. In fact, the currently favored route towards polyploid plants involves unreduced male gametes; however, this scenario introduces supernumerary paternal copies also to the endosperm, which is not tolerated in many plants resulting in seed abortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dilkes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramsey and Schemske, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scott et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stoute et al., 2012</xref>). In fact, this endosperm-related triploid block is considered a means of reproductive isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Köhler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramsey and Schemske, 1998</xref>). Plant polyploidization via polyspermy, by contrast, often affects the embryo-derived seed fraction only and hence has the potential to bypass the triploid block. It will be a challenge for the future to determine whether and to what extent polyspermy is relevant in nature and contributed to the evolution of polyploid plants.</p><p>From an evolutionary and agricultural point of view, another intriguing implication of polyspermy-induced polyploidization is the one-step combination of three genetically distinct plant genomes in a three-parent hybridization. This scenario is expected to occur rarely in nature, even when taking into account wind and animal pollination. Still, it might be relevant in an evolutionary time scale and when considering the huge seed amounts produced by many plants. In addition, our findings might have important implications for agriculture: Not only do three-parent-crosses hold the potential to instantly combine beneficial traits of three rather than two cultivars. They, in addition, might provide a means to overcome endosperm-induced hybrid incompatibilities by transmitting incompatible sperm along with compatible sperm through the egg cell only. Scrutinizing the potential of this genetic hitchhiking approach opens up new avenues for future research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were carried out using <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Columbia (Col-0).

In plants polyploidization is frequently associated with speciation and occurred during the generation of important crop plants, such as wheat. Thus, the authors address a question of high scientific significance and of broad interest.</p><p>In previous work the authors established that polyploidization in plants can occur via the rare occurrence of polyspermy due to more than one pollen donor contributing to fertilization (as a rule only one pollen tube fertilizes a given ovule). In my opinion, the central advance provided by this paper relates to their finding that during this process two sperm cells, in their set up derived from genetically different pollen donors, fertilize the egg cell. By contrast, the central cell, the other gamete, is fertilized by only one sperm cell. Their data confirm that the resulting embryo is triploid while the endosperm, which develops from the fertilized central cell, is triploid. The authors go on to show that by this mechanism polyspermy circumvents the triploid block, a postzygotic polyploidization barrier, which occurs in the endosperm. It is noteworthy that their genetic method is based on an unbiased approach and does not select for the event, for example through screening for herbicide resistance.</p><p>Overall, I find this a very exciting paper. It certainly has ramifications as to how polyploidization can come about. Moreover, it has obvious potential implications for evolutionary biology (and application), although I am not sure how relevant that really is given the low observed frequency of the event. I concede, however, that I am not an expert in evolution and speciation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Polyploidization has played a major role in the long-term diversification and evolutionary success of angiosperms. Triploid formation among diploid plants, which is generally considered to be achieved by fertilization of an unreduced gamete with a reduced one, has been accepted as a means of polyploid production. However, fusion of an unreduced sperm cell with a reduced central cell forms primary endosperm cell with unbalanced parental genome ratio (maternal genome: paternal genome = 2m: 2p), and such primary endosperm cell abnormally develops, resulting in arrest of embryogenesis and seed development.</p><p>Recently, emergence of polyspermy-derived triploid embryo (progeny) has been clearly presented in planta (Nakel et al., 2017) and in vitro (Toda et al., 2016). Moreover, using a novel GAL4/UAS system, termed HIPOD system, it was clearly indicated that triparental progeny is produced through hetero-pollination (polyspermy) in Arabidopsis by Dr. Groß-Hardt's group (Nakel et al., 2017). The present study is continuous work of the same group, and the authors successfully expanded the HIPOD system to HIPOD-SACO system to analyze developmental profiles of polyspermy-derived embryos and seeds.</p><p>In the study, authors showed that hetero-pollination in Arabidopsis resulted in production of seed in which polyspermy-derived triploid embryo (1m:2p) and monospermy-derived endosperm (2m:1p) are formed. This finding is extremely important and interesting, since triploid progeny (embryo) can be developed without effect of triploid block from unbalanced endosperm. In addition, it was also indicated that tetraploid seeds were obtained from self-pollination of the polyspermy-derived triploid plants. This suggests that polyspermy-derived triploid plants has potential to form tetraploid progenies in one generation, being consistent with the triploid-bridge pathway for emergence of tetraploid plants (polyploid plants). Therefore, the contents of the present study provide highly novel insights and concepts into reproduction system in angiosperms, and the reviewer considers that the present study will be a new milestone for basic and applied plant biology. Therefore, the manuscript will be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Comments from the reviewer are presented below, and the authors can address the comments.</p><p>Does polyspermy selectively polyploidize egg cell? (The term &quot;selective&quot; in title, Abstract and at the end of the subsection “Polyspermy-induced polyploidization events are often insensitive to triploid block suppression by <italic>admetos</italic>”).</p><p>The reviewer totally agrees that triploid-block can be escaped in the seeds containing polyspermy-derived 1m:2p embryo and monospermy-derived 2m:1p endosperm, and such seeds with triploid progeny develop normally. However, judging from the results of HIPOD experiments using <italic>adm1</italic> and wild-type pollen donors (subsection “Polyspermy-induced polyploidization events are often insensitive to triploid block suppression by <italic>admetos</italic>”), it can be considered that the polyspermy occurs not only in egg cells, but also in central cells with nearly equal efficiency. Two-fold numbers of possible triploid progenies (seeds) were obtained when <italic>adm1</italic> donors were employed, compared with wild type donors. This may indicate the possibility that polyspermy occurs both in egg cell and central cell evenly also in case of using wild-type donors, and that, among these variable kinds of fertilized ovaries (seeds), only half of triploid seeds containing 1m:2p embryo and 2m:1p endosperm can survive to mature seeds but remaining half seeds possessing 2m:2p endosperms aborts. In this context, the reviewer feels that the terms 'selective polyploidization' will not be appropriate for presenting the polyspermy-situation in the study. 'Polyspermy-derived selective growth of triparental progeny via triploid block escape' may correctly sound.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study investigates a potential cause of whole genome duplication and polyploidy in plants as polyspermy (fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm cell). Polyploids in plants are known in many cases to arise from production of unreduced gametes, caused by a change in the progression of meiosis. However, fertilization by unreduced male gametes typically leads to triploid block caused by genome inbalance in the endosperm.</p><p>The authors develop a specialized assay HIPOD-sco1 to detect polyspermy. This uses a mutation called sco1 that causes seed to be pale green. This is complemented by two different transgenes; (i) RPS5a::GAL4 and (ii) UAS::Tomato-SCO1.

It is important to discriminate between the seeds generated by selective egg cell polyspermy/polyploidization and the polyploid plants recovered. The latter category commonly traces back to egg cell polyspermy only, because the category of egg and central cell polyspermy, is negatively selected during seed development by the triploid block. However, we understand the concern of this reviewer and agree that this can be misleading. We have accordingly adjusted title and text:</p><p>Title: &quot;Selective egg cell polyspermy bypasses the triploid block&quot;.</p><p>Abstract: We introduced &quot;can&quot; and modified the sentence describing the <italic>adm</italic> result: &quot;In fact, we here show that most polyspermy-derived seeds are insensitive to the triploid block suppressor <italic>admetos</italic>.&quot; In the remaining text we introduced &quot;can&quot; in the last paragraph of the Introduction and in the subheading “Polyspermy can selectively polyploidizes the egg cell”, and &quot;most&quot; in the last sentence of the subsection “Most Polyspermy-induced polyploidization events are often insensitive to the triploid block suppression suppressor by <italic>admetos</italic>”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The authors develop a specialized assay HIPOD-sco1 to detect polyspermy.

Until recently, hardly anybody expected triparental plants to inhabit our planet. In this study, we established a genetic detection assay that allows for the first time to determine the developmental origin of triparental plants. With this tool we were able to show selective polyploidization of the egg cell. This result is particularly unexpected as egg and central cell fertilization are coordinated during monospermy and because the egg cell block is stricter than the central cell block (Scott et al., 2008). Moreover, our finding that polyspermy can bypass the triploid block has important evolutionary and agricultural implications: First, it expands current polyploidization concepts, as it provides an explanation of how triploids can arise in the presence of a strict triploid block. Second, three-parent crosses might provide a means to overcome endosperm-induced hybrid incompatibilities by transmitting incompatible sperm along with compatible sperm through the egg cell only. We have rephrased two sentences in the Discussion in order to make this aspect clearer to the reader:</p><p>&quot;Not only do three parent crosses hold the potential to instantly combine beneficial traits of three rather than two cultivars. […] Scrutinizing the potential of this genetic hitchhiking approach opens up new avenues for future research.&quot;</p><p>We would also like to refer to the comments made by reviewer 1 and 2 on the implication of our work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
