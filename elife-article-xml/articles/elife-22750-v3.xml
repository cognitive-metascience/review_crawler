not been studied at the genomic scale. Here we report that Arabidopsis microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are distinctly partitioned between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cytosol. All miRNAs are associated with membrane-bound polysomes (MBPs) as opposed to polysomes in general. The MBP association is functionally linked to a deeply conserved and tightly regulated activity of miRNAs – production of phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs) from select target RNAs. The phasiRNA precursor RNAs, thought to be noncoding, are on MBPs and are occupied by ribosomes in a manner that supports miRNA-triggered phasiRNA production, suggesting that ribosomes on the rough ER impact siRNA biogenesis. This study reveals global patterns of cytoplasmic partitioning of small RNAs and expands the known functions of ribosomes and ER.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22750.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22750.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>polysome</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>rough ER</kwd><kwd>argonaute</kwd><kwd>siRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>A.thaliana</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shenzhen municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JCYJ20151116155209176</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Shengben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shenzhen municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KQCX2015033110464302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Shengben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31210103901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xiaofeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xuemei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GBMF3046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xuemei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM061146</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xuemei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Guangdong Innovation Research Team Funds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014ZT05S078</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xuemei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91440105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xuemei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Arabidopsis microRNAs and their effector protein ARGONAUTE1 associate with and act on polysomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA silencing is a conserved posttranscriptional gene regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes. At the core of RNA silencing are small RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and their effector ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins. Many observations document the membrane association of plant and animal AGO proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodersen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cikaluk et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibbings et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jouannet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stalder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), but the cytoplasmic location where miRNAs or siRNAs repress target RNAs is largely unexplored and is perhaps presumed to be the cytosol. The membrane-cytosol partitioning of small RNAs has not been studied at the genomic scale. Little is known about how the membrane-cytosol partitioning of small RNAs affects their activities.</p><p>A well-documented feature of RNA silencing in plants and <italic>C. elegans</italic> is signal amplification, in which primary siRNAs from transgenes or viruses guide the production of secondary siRNAs from target RNAs through the activities of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sijen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vaistij et al., 2002</xref>). This results in enhanced silencing and the spreading of the silencing signal into flanking sequences. Contrary to siRNAs, most miRNAs do not cause ‘signal amplification’ from their target RNAs. In fact, should miRNAs do so, the secondary siRNAs may cause unintended repression of genes homologous to miRNA targets.</p><p>However, for a small number of miRNAs and their targets, such ‘signal amplification’ occurs in plants. In fact, a widespread and deeply conserved phenomenon in diverse land plants is miRNA-triggered production of phased secondary siRNAs (phasiRNAs) from target transcripts (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fei et al., 2013</xref>]). Upon miRNA-guided cleavage of a target RNA, either the 5’ or 3’ cleavage fragment is converted by RdRP to double-stranded RNA, which is then successively diced into 21-nt phasiRNAs, with the phase determined by miRNA-guided cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axtell et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, eight noncoding <italic>TAS</italic> loci generate phasiRNAs in this manner and, as the phasiRNAs regulate target genes in trans, they are termed trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axtell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peragine et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajagopalan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vazquez et al., 2004b</xref>). Most miRNAs are 21 nt long and do not trigger phasiRNA production. A predominant mechanism (termed the ‘one hit model’) to trigger phasiRNA production is by a 22-nt miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuperus et al., 2010</xref>); the <italic>TAS1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, and 4 loci are examples of the ‘one-hit’ model with 22-nt miR173 or miR828 as the trigger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajagopalan et al., 2006</xref>). In a ‘two-hit’ model, a pair of 21-nt miRNAs target the same transcript to cause phasiRNA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axtell et al., 2006</xref>). The three <italic>TAS3</italic> loci are such examples, each containing two sites for miR390 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axtell et al., 2006</xref>), a miRNA that associates with AGO7 instead of AGO1 to trigger phasiRNA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montgomery et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to the noncoding <italic>TAS</italic> loci, a small number of protein-coding genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> such as immune receptor (<italic>NBS-LRR</italic>) and pentatricopeptide repeat (<italic>PPR</italic>) genes are targeted by 22-nt miRNAs and produce phasiRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howell et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Where phasiRNA biogenesis occurs in the cytoplasm is unknown. Intriguingly, SGS3 and RDR6, two proteins required for phasiRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peragine et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vazquez et al., 2004b</xref>), form cytoplasmic foci called siRNA bodies, which are often adjacent to vesicles marked by a cis-Golgi marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jouannet et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, both SGS3 and AGO7 are present in the microsomal fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jouannet et al., 2012</xref>), implicating that ta-siRNA biogenesis occurs on a cytoplasmic membrane structure. A recent study found that <italic>TAS3</italic> RNA is bound by ribosomes, and ribosomes on <italic>TAS3</italic> RNA are stalled by AGO7 at the miR390-binding site, implicating that ta-siRNA biogenesis from <italic>TAS3</italic> occurs on polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hou et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We combined genomic approaches with cellular fractionation to study the subcellular distribution of small RNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). We found an intriguing difference between miRNAs and siRNAs in their membrane-cytosol partitioning. We showed that all miRNAs, including 22-nt miRNAs, were associated with membrane-bound polysomes (MBPs) as opposed to polysomes in general. The plant miRNA effector AGO1 associated with membranes in part in an RNA-independent manner, recruited miRNAs to membranes, and exerted its endonuclease activity on MBPs. Reduced membrane-association of 22-nt miRNAs in an <italic>ago1</italic> mutant led to reduced levels, or loss of phasing, of phasiRNAs. The <italic>TAS</italic> transcripts, presumed to be noncoding, were actually bound by MBPs in a manner that supports phasiRNA production. These findings establish MBPs as the site of action of plant miRNAs and uncover a role of ribosomes and the ER in siRNA biogenesis, thus expanding the known functions of the rough ER.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differential partitioning of miRNAs and siRNAs between membranes and cytosol</title><p>We previously uncovered an integral ER membrane protein (named AMP1) as required for miRNA-mediated translational repression of target RNAs and showed that a few examined miRNAs and their target transcripts were present on MBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2013</xref>). To gain a global view of the membrane association of cellular small RNAs (sRNAs), we performed sRNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) for total (T) and microsomal (M; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) RNAs. Three biological replicates were highly reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For an initial analysis, we quantified sRNAs by normalizing against total reads. The T sRNA population was characterized by two prominent size classes, 21 nt and 24 nt, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kasschau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, the M sRNA population exhibited a larger 21-nt peak and a diminished 24-nt peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In both T and M sRNA populations, miRNAs were the major component in the 21-nt class while P4siRNAs (Pol IV-dependent siRNAs) were a major component of the 24-nt class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Notably, in the M fraction, the proportion of miRNAs was increased in 21-, 22-, and 24-nt classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22750.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Enrichment of miRNAs and a set of endogenous siRNAs in the microsomal (<bold>M</bold>) and membrane-bound polysome (MBP) fractions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A brief scheme of microsome and MBP isolation.

We found that if normalization was performed against 18–41-nt rRNA fragments (from 5.8S, 18S, and 25S rRNAs from 80S ribosomes), then the levels of 21-nt sRNAs and miRNAs were similar in WT and <italic>nrpd1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J,K</xref>), which better reflected the actual situation.

To evaluate the MBP enrichment of miRNAs and ta-siRNAs relative to other 21-nt or 22-nt sRNAs, we calculated 21-nt or 22-nt sRNA counts in 100 bp windows of the genome. Endogenous siRNAs constituted most of the 21-nt or 22-nt sRNA-generating regions of the genome. Only a small set of the windows produced MBP-enriched sRNAs (green circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>), suggesting that a small set of endogenous siRNAs was enriched on MBPs while the majority of siRNAs were not.</p><p>To identify MBP-enriched sRNAs, we compared the abundance of sRNAs in each 100 bp window for each sRNA size class (21, 22, 23, and 24 nt) between MBP and TP samples.

The canonical view is that transcripts encoding proteins that enter the secretary pathway are co-translationally recruited to the ER. Under such a scenario, many miRNA target transcripts, which encode transcription factors, are not expected to be on MBPs. However, we found that a few miRNA target transcripts were present on MBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2013</xref>). To gain a global view of MBP-associated mRNAs, we performed polyA+ RNA-seq of MBP RNAs and total RNAs. We found that the overall profiles of MBP and total RNAs were highly similar (data not shown), suggesting that all cellular mRNAs were represented on MBPs.</p><p>To further validate this, we switched to another method of fractionation that allowed for the simultaneous recovery of MBPs and cytosolic free polysomes (FPs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Note that this purification scheme could not result in MBPs as pure as the previous method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), but was used here to allow the comparison between MBP and FP RNAs. In brief, total extracts were first separated into microsome and cytosol fractions, from which MBPs and FPs were then isolated, respectively. The MBP and FP profiles on sucrose gradients were as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The microsome, cytosol, MBP, and FP RNAs were then subjected to polyA+ RNA-seq in three biological replicates (reproducibility is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Clustering analysis using the 5000 top varying transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3.1</xref>) showed that the microsome and MBP fractions clustered together and the cytosol and FP fractions clustered together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This indicated that the separation of these fractions was successful. We next examined transcripts encoding transmembrane domain-containing proteins; these transcripts were expected to be translated on MBPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3.2</xref>). Indeed, many of these transcripts showed higher abundance in microsome than cytosol (green circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and in MBP than FP (green circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This further validated the successful fractionation. Most cellular transcripts were similarly represented on MBPs and FPs, with a large fraction over-accumulated on MBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Likewise, the majority of predicted and known targets of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3.3</xref>) were equally represented on MBPs and FPs, with few being depleted from MBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Thus, reduced phasiRNA abundance, or loss of phasing, coincided with decreased membrane association of the triggering miRNAs in <italic>ago1-27</italic>. These data, together with the finding that miRNA-guided cleavage occurs in M and MBP fractions, suggested that phasiRNA production occurs, or at least starts, on MBPs.

A few miRNAs and their target transcripts were found to be associated with MBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2013</xref>), but the scale of the MBP-association of miRNAs and their target transcripts was unknown. In this study, we examined the ER- and rough ER-association of small RNAs as well as cellular mRNAs. We found that most cellular mRNAs were enriched on MBPs or equally partitioned between MBPs and FPs. This indicates that most mRNAs, including miRNA target transcripts, are translated both on the rough ER and in the cytosol. AGO1 was previously shown to associate with polysomes, thus implicating the presence of miRNAs on polysomes. In this study, we found that miRNAs are associated with MBPs rather than polysomes in general.</p><p>AMP1 is only required for the translational repression activity of plant miRNAs, thus it was not known whether miRNA-guided cleavage occurs on MBPs.

Our studies with the null allele <italic>ago1-36</italic> and the weak allele <italic>ago1-27</italic> showed that AGO1 is instrumental in recruiting miRNAs to the ER.

These findings indicate that phasiRNA production occurs, or is at least initiated, on MBPs. This is consistent with the finding that phasiRNA biogenesis factors reside in siRNA bodies that are in close proximity to a cis-Golgi marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jouannet et al., 2012</xref>).

We found that many <italic>MIR</italic> genes produce 22-nt isoforms due to imprecision in DCL1 processing, yet most 22-nt miRNA isoforms do not trigger phasiRNA production from their target RNAs. We propose that the sequestration of 22-nt miRNAs and miRNA target transcripts on MBPs prevents them from engaging in phasiRNA production. We propose that the rough ER is somehow capable of inhibiting the entry of most protein-coding transcripts into the phasiRNA biogenesis pathway. The <italic>TAS</italic> genes and a handful of protein-coding genes have evolutionarily adapted to the rough ER environment by having an optimal arrangement between the miRNA binding site and ribosome occupancy to enable phasiRNA biogenesis. Thus, ER and ribosomes have a previously unknown function in regulating the biogenesis of small RNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004618">SCR_004618</ext-link>) wild-type (Columbia accession), <italic>ago1-27</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vaucheret et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>hyl1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vazquez et al., 2004a</xref>), and <italic>SUC2:amiR-SUL</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Felippes et al., 2011</xref>) strains were used in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Microsome and MBP isolation</title><p>The isolation of microsomes and MBPs for small RNA sequencing was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Gary Ruvkun (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, you combined genomic approaches with cellular fractionation to investigate the global patterns of cytoplasmic partitioning of small RNAs and &quot;long&quot; RNAs. You show that miRNAs and their target RNAs are associated with membrane-bound polysomes (MBPs). Moreover, cleavage activity and products are detected in microsomes and MBPs. You propose that miRNA cleavage occurs on MBPs. You further show that phasiRNA-triggering 22-nt miRNAs and their targets including non-coding TAS transcripts are also present on MBPs and propose phasiRNA biogenesis is initiated on MBPs.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that such findings should in principle be published at the highest levels. While the reviewers furthermore agreed that the data presented are clear and thorough, they also agreed that a couple of additional experiments would be essential to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Use dcl1 mutants to test whether miRNAs are required for the membrane association of AGO1. Alternatively, examine whether small RNA binding-deficient AGO1 is associated with microsomes. Small RNA binding is required for AGO1 stability. It would be very interesting if AGO1 is still associated with microsomes in the absence of miRNAs.

Reviewer #2 had a few minor comments, we ask you to take them into account as well.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this paper, the authors examined patterns pf subcellular partitioning of small RNAs and &quot;big&quot; RNAs at the genomic scale, using cellular fractionation followed by RNA deep sequencing. They found that miRNAs and their targets were associated with membrane-bound polysomes (MBPs). They also found that the AGO1 complexes purified from microsomal fraction (M) had slicer activity and 3'cleavage products could be detected in M and MBP fractions. They thus conclude that MBPs are the places where miRNA-guided cleavage occurs. More interestingly, the authors found that the phasiRNA-triggering 22-nt miRNAs and their targets including non-coding TAS transcripts were present on MBPs, suggesting phasiRNA biogenesis may be initiated on MBPs. These findings provide new insights into miRNA-guided target cleavage and phasiRNA biogenesis. Detailed comments are listed below.</p><p>1) The authors used a hyl1 mutant to show that the association of AGO1 with M is mostly likely independent of miRNAs. The hyl1 mutations actually have relatively moderate effects on miRNA accumulation, compared to that caused by dcl1 mutations. I would suggest the authors use dcl1 mutant instead for this experiment. Alternatively, the authors could also examine whether sRNA binding deficient AGO1 associates with M. It would be nice to do the same experiment with MBPs.</p><p>2) The authors found that the association of miRNAs with M was greatly reduced in ago1-27 suggesting that membrane association of miRNAs depended on AGO1. As ago1-27 is a week allele and the mutation has no strong effects on miRNA accumulation and slicer activity, suggesting that the mutant AGO1-27 can still bind miRNAs. The authors can test this by AGO1 IP followed by small RNA Northern blot. This is confirmed. Then the next question is how the mutation affects miRNA association with M. Does this mutation affects AGO1 association with M? This can be easily addressed by an AGO1 Western blotting with M/MBP fractions in ago1-27.</p><p>3) The authors detected cleavage activity/products in M and MBP fractions. This only indicates that miRNA cleavage can occur on MBPs but does not exclude the possibility that cleavage can also occur in other places. It would be nice if the authors can try to detect cleavage activity/products in MBP-depleted fractions.</p><p>4) It is very interesting that ribosome occupancy may play a role in specifying a sequence for phasiRNA biogenesis. I would suggest the authors to examine the ribosome profiles of the transcripts targeted by 22-nt miRNAs that are not capable of triggering phasiRNA biogenesis.</p><p>5) It would be also interesting to examine whether the components in the phasiRNA biogenesis pathway including SGS3 and RDR6 are associated with M/MBP fractions.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Post-transcriptional gene silencing can occur via transcript cleavage or inhibition of translation. Currently there is little known about the mechanism of translational inhibition in plants. This manuscript builds on previous work from the Chen lab that indicated the ER is required for microRNA-mediated translational repression. The manuscript showed differential distribution of sRNA classes in the cytosol compared with those associated with microsomes, and that microRNAs were enriched in membrane-bound polysome preparations. This membrane association in part required AGO1. Interestingly, the ago1-27 mutant, which retains AGO1 cleavage activity, showed loss of phasing of miR168-mediated target cleavage. Furthermore, and unexpectedly, TAS transcripts were found to be associated with ribosomes. Ribosome-bound regions were not uniformly distributed across these transcripts and appeared to be confined to regions upstream of the miRNA binding site. These results hint at possible new roles for membrane-bound ribosomes as a control point in sRNA production. Overall the data are novel, interesting, clear and thorough.

Our understanding of miRNA regulation in plants has always been more advanced than animal miRNAs, mostly because the target mRNAs for plant miRNAs are so much easier to identify and study in depth. Rather than getting confused by the poorly predicted target mRNAs of animal miRNAs, the plant field has focused on the known targets and discovered amazing biology such as the phased siRNAs triggered by plant miRNAs on their target mRNAs. This paper takes another major step by purifying mRNAs and associated siRNAs from membrane fractions and finding a dramatic difference between ER polysomes and run of the mill cytoplasmic ribosome. The difference depends on how well the authors purify the various subcellular fractions and they use various compartment specific reagents to assess their purification schemes. It is convincing fractionation and the results are dramatic. The authors demonstrate step by step that AGO1 mediates the ER association of miRNAs with mRNAs, that this association is not tied to secretion of the encoded proteins, but that AGO1 is mediating the association with polysomes. And that these miRNAS cleave target mRNAs and thus trigger the production of phased siRNAs from the miRNA phase mark. The Discussion is stunningly short and to the point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22750.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Use dcl1 mutants to test whether miRNAs are required for the membrane association of AGO1.
