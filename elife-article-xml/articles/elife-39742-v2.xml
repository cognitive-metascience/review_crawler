In particular, the deeply conserved Wamide family of neuropeptides—shared across Bilateria (e.g. insects and worms) and its sister group Cnidaria (e.g. jellyfishes and corals)—has been implicated in mediating life-cycle transitions, yet their endogenous roles remain poorly understood. By using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated reverse genetics, we show that cnidarian Wamide—referred to as GLWamide—regulates the timing of life cycle transition in the sea anemone cnidarian <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>. We find that mutant planula larvae lacking GLWamides transform into morphologically normal polyps at a rate slower than that of the wildtype control larvae. Treatment of GLWamide null mutant larvae with synthetic GLWamide peptides is sufficient to restore a normal rate of metamorphosis. These results demonstrate that GLWamide plays a dispensable, modulatory role in accelerating metamorphosis in a sea anemone.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>metamorphosis</kwd><kwd>Cnidaria</kwd><kwd>Nematostella</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakanishi</surname><given-names>Nagayasu</given-names></name><name><surname>Martindale</surname><given-names>Mark Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007756</institution-id><institution>University of Arkansas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakanishi</surname><given-names>Nagayasu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of the endogenous function of deeply conserved neuropeptides in sea anemones sheds light on a primitive role of nervous systems in modulating developmental timing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuropeptides are evolutionarily ancient hormones—secreted, diffusible signaling-molecules—that are expressed in many cells of the nervous and neuroendocrine systems of Bilateria (e.g. vertebrates, insects and worms) and its sister group Cnidaria (e.g. jellyfishes, corals and sea anemones) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grimmelikhuijzen and Hauser, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grimmelikhuijzen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hartenstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walker et al., 2009</xref>). They are short polypeptides generated from larger precursor proteins through proteolytic cleavage, and are stored in membrane-bound secretory vesicles that are distributed throughout the neuron. For some, peptide α-amidation occurs via a post-translational, enzymatic conversion of a C-terminal glycine into an amide group, and is often critical for biological activity (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eipper et al., 1992</xref>]). Intercellular signaling occurs when neuropeptides are released from the secretory vesicles into the extracellular space and received by receptors of target cells. Neuropeptides have been implicated in regulating a wide range of biological processes—from behavior, physiology, and development—in animals with nervous systems (summarized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Strand, 1999</xref>]). Given that neuropeptides were early neurotransmitters in the evolution of nervous systems, testing hypotheses about the conserved roles of neuropeptides in extant animals is directly relevant to understanding how the primitive nervous system may have functioned.</p><p>Comparative genomic evidence suggests that several peptide hormones are shared across Bilateria and Cnidaria, namely an insulin-related peptide, glycoprotein hormone, prokineticin, and amidated peptides with carboxy-terminal sequences Wamide, RFamide and RYamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jékely, 2013</xref>). Among them, only amidated peptides have been shown to occur in neurons of both bilaterians and cnidarians (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Conzelmann and Jékely, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conzelmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grimmelikhuijzen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koizumi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmich et al., 1998a</xref>); see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walker et al., 2009</xref>) for a review of literature on RFamide), and thus are here considered <italic>bona fide</italic> conserved neuropeptides. The precursor protein of these neuropeptides typically encodes multiple copies of immature neuropeptides (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Conzelmann and Jékely, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Darmer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leviev and Grimmelikhuijzen, 1995</xref>), some of which can differ in amino acid sequence; this indicates that an immature neuropeptide sequence can duplicate and diverge within a gene. Paralogous neuropeptides can thus be generated from a single gene, or from different genes that emerged by gene duplication (i.e. paralogous genes). Neuropeptides can also be lost during evolution; for example, deuterostome bilaterians (e.g. chordates and echinoderms) lack Wamide precursor orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conzelmann et al., 2013</xref>), and the RYamide-encoding gene appears absent from the genome of anthozoan cnidarians (sea anemones and corals; e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anctil, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The ancestral function of the conserved neuropeptides is enigmatic, but a few lines of evidence suggest that Wamide may have conserved roles in metamorphosis regulation across Bilateria and Cnidaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conzelmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schoofs and Beets, 2013</xref>). First, Wamide is expressed in larval nervous systems in bilaterians (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conzelmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hua et al., 1999</xref>) and cnidarians (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leitz and Lay, 1995</xref>]). Second, exogenous Wamides have effects on molecular, behavioral and/or morphogenetic processes underlying life cycle transition across animals. For instance, Wamide neuropeptides (also known as allatostatin-B, prothoracicostatic peptides, myoinhibitory peptides (MIP), and GLWamide) can inhibit the synthesis of juvenile hormone in crickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lorenz et al., 1995</xref>) and that of ecdysteroids (the molting hormone) in a silkworm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hua et al., 1999</xref>). Also, they can induce larval settlement of trochophore larvae in annelids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conzelmann et al., 2013</xref>), and metamorphosis of planula larvae into polyps in hydrozoan and scleractinian (hard coral) cnidarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Erwin and Szmant, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iwao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leitz et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmich et al., 1998b</xref>). Third, Wamide signaling appears to be necessary for life cycle transition across Bilateria and Cnidaria. The evidence comes from the annelid bilaterian <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic>, where morpholino-mediated knockdown of MIP receptor expression blocked MIP-induced larval settlement behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conzelmann et al., 2013</xref>); but see Discussion), and the hydrozoan cnidarian <italic>Hydractinia echinate,</italic> where RNAi-mediated knockdown of GLWamide precursor expression can decrease rates of metamorphosis, and synthetic GLWamide could rescue metamorphosis-less phenotype that resulted from pharmacological inhibition of neuropeptide amidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Plickert et al., 2003</xref>). However, reduced rates of metamorphosis in GLWamide-deficient hydrozoan larvae were not consistently observed across independent experiments despite a near-complete loss of endogenous GLWamide precursor transcripts. It was therefore proposed that quantitatively small amounts of GLWamide might be sufficient for larvae to remain competent to metamorphosis induction. This hypothesis has yet to be directly confirmed by gene knockout approaches.</p><p>Here we used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis to generate knockout mutant lines for a Wamide precursor gene in the sea anemone cnidarian <italic>Nematostella vectensis,</italic> and examined the development of knockout mutants relative to the wildtype. In contrast to the hypothesis that Wamide is necessary for life cycle transition in <italic>H. echinate</italic>, we report that Wamide knockout mutant larvae can transform into morphologically normal polyps in <italic>N. vectensis</italic>. However, knockout mutant larvae undergo metamorphosis at slower rates than the wildtype control larvae, and this developmental phenotype could be rescued by treatment of the mutant larvae with synthetic GLWamide peptides.

This approach can create null mutant alleles at the target gene locus in two ways: (1) by introducing frameshift-causing indel mutations in the 5’ region of the gene via an error-prone, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair mechanism, so that the translated peptide sequence is altered, and (2) by deleting the protein-coding region of the gene upon cleavages at flanking sites (cf. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakayama et al., 2013</xref>]). However, injected animals--here referred to as 'F0' animals--were usually mosaic mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Servetnick et al., 2017</xref>]); mutagenesis occurred mosaically in an F0 embryo so that individual cells would carry different mutations, or no mutation at all. Therefore, it could not be assumed that every cell in an F0 animal harbored a null mutation at the locus of interest.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39742.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Generation of GLWamide null mutants by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis and F1 heterozygous mutant crosses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic views of the GLWamide locus and mutant alleles (<italic>glw<sup>-a</sup>, glw<sup>-b</sup></italic> and <italic>glw<sup>-c</sup></italic>).

Fertilized eggs were subsequently de-jellied, and animals were raised in constant darkness at 16°C; development at this temperature occurs slower than that at room temperature (20–25°C). At 2 dpf, healthy-appearing animals (i.e. without tissue damage) were transferred into wells of 24 well plates, each containing approximately 20 individuals in 1 ml of 1/3 seawater (wildtype, n = 6 experiments; mutants, n = 9 experiments). Half of the water in each well was replaced daily. For each experiment, we quantified the proportions of animals that were at the tentacle-bud or primary polyp stage from 6 dpf to 10 dpf. We observed no detectable difference in larval morphology at 5 dpf between null mutants and wildtype control animals, and thus we assume that larval development occurs normally at the morphological level. We used the number of polyps counted at 17 dpf as the total number of animals competent to become polyps for each experiment; the remaining animals that have not undergone metamorphosis by 17 dpf showed signs of abnormal development, and thus were excluded from the analysis. On average 17.5 animals, ranging from 14 to 20, were examined per experiment. We found that the wildtype control animals began to metamorphose at 6dpf, and the majority (~86%) had begun transforming by 8 dpf, while the null mutants began to metamorphose at 7dpf, and less than half (~42%) had begun metamorphosis by 8 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); the differences at 7 and 8 dpf were statistically significant (α = 0.05).

We report that in <italic>N. vectensis</italic> GLWamide neuropeptides are expressed in ectodermal and endodermal nervous systems of the planula larva, but are not essential for transformation of the planula into a polyp. Instead we find that GLWamides regulate the timing of polyp formation by accelerating the metamorphic process in <italic>N. vectensis</italic>. These results raise the possibility that the ancestral role of Wamide neuropeptides in animals may have been to regulate the timing of life cycle transition.</p><p>Indeed, several lines of evidence indicate that the Wamide neuropeptide is an accelerator, but not an essential regulator, of metamorphosis in animals. First, as described above, exogenous Wamides can trigger life cycle transition across annelids and cnidarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conzelmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Erwin and Szmant, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iwao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leitz et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmich et al., 1998b</xref>), and our results show slower rates of life cycle transition in GLWamide mutant larvae in sea anemones. These data support Wamide’s role as an accelerator of metamorphosis across animals.</p><p>Second, Wamides do not appear necessary for life cycle transition in animals where functional perturbation data are available. For instance, although in the annelid polychaete <italic>Platynereis,</italic> MIP (Wamide) receptor expression is necessary for MIP-induced larval settlement behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conzelmann et al., 2013</xref>), reducing the expression of MIP by morpholino antisense oligonucleotide inhibits feeding behavior in the juvenile, but not metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Williams et al., 2015</xref>). This could mean that there is a compensatory mechanism, possibly through as-yet-unknown ligands for the ‘MIP’ receptor. Alternative possibilities that silencing of the MIP gene was incomplete and the residual MIPs were sufficient for trigerring the transition, or that MIP does not endogenously regulate larval settlement and metamorphosis, cannot be ruled out, however; application of knockout approaches as employed in this study will be necessary to test these hypotheses. It is also possible that metamorphosis is decoupled from larval settlement so that MIP-regulated settlement behavior is not essential for metamorphosis in <italic>Platynereis</italic>. In the hydrozoan cnidarian <italic>Hydractinia echinata</italic> it is noteworthy that in one of the three experimental conditions where RNAi was used to knockdown GLWamide expression, the rate of metamorphosis was significantly reduced at 24 hr after induction (by CsCl), but it increased to a normal level 24 hr later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Plickert et al., 2003</xref>). This observation is consistent with a role of GLWamide as an accelerator, but not an essential regulator, of metamorphosis; however, an alternative possiblity that GLWamide expression recovered at later stages (due to reagent degradation and/or dilution) cannot be ruled out without gene knockout data. In the present study, our gene knockout data clearly demonstrate that GLWamides are not required for life cycle transition in the sea anemone cnidarian <italic>N. vectensis</italic>. We note that our data leave open the possibility that other amidated peptides could be necessary for metamorphosis in <italic>N. vectensis</italic>.</p><p>Third, animals that undergo metamorphosis do not necessarily have Wamide neuropeptides. For example, deuterostome bilaterians lack Wamide homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conzelmann et al., 2013</xref>) despite metamorphosis being common in some of the lineages (e.g. echinoderms, hemichordates, ascidians, and vertebrates). Similarly, members of Porifera (sponges)—an outgroup to Eumetazoa—typically undergo metamorphosis, and yet Wamides have not been found in a sponge genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Srivastava et al., 2010</xref>). Thus Wamide-independent mechanisms of metamorphosis must exist in some animal lineages.</p><p>Taken together, comparative evidence suggests that the ancestral Wamide neuropeptidergic signaling was not an indispensable component of the developmental regulatory system, but may have functioned to fine-tune the timing of life cycle transition by accelerating the developmental process—possibly in response to specific environmental cues—in the last common ancestor of Eumetazoa. Understanding how ancestral Wamides may have controlled developmental timing—the nature of the sensory stimuli that trigger a release of Wamides, and identities of Wamide receptors and target developmental regulatory genes, in particular—requires further investigation into Wamide function across Eumetazoa.</p><p>In addition to developmental timing, Wamides appear to be involved in regulating organismal behavior in extant animals. For instance, treatment with MIPs can suppress spontaneous contractions of the hindgut in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schoofs et al., 1991</xref>). In the annelid <italic>Platynereis,</italic> in contrast, MIPs increase gut peristalsis and are necessary for feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Williams et al., 2015</xref>). In cnidarians, exogenous GLWamides can induce muscle contractions in hydrozoan and anthozoan polyps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takahashi et al., 2003</xref>) and stimulate migration of planula larvae in <italic>Hydractinia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katsukura et al., 2004</xref>); however, it remains to be confirmed whether GLWamides endogenously control these behavioral processes. Demystifying the endogenous behavioral function(s) of deeply conserved neuropeptides—Wamides as well as others (e.g. RFamides)—across Eumetazoa will be important for illuminating how the primitive nervous system of the last common ancestor of Eumetazoa may have coordinated organismal behavior—another fundamental problem of neural evolution that remains enigmatic.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Biological sample <break/>(<italic>Nematostella vectensis)</italic></td><td>F2 glw-a/glw-c</td><td>this paper</td><td>Nv F2 glw-a/glw-c_ <break/>this paper</td><td>See the Results section of the <break/>paper for a description of the biological sample.</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-GLWamide <break/>(rabbit)</td><td>this paper</td><td>Anti-GLWamide_this <break/>paper:AB_2737386</td><td>(1:200) See the Materials and Methods <break/>section of the paper for a description <break/>of the antibody.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal culture</title><p><italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> were cultured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fritzenwanker and Technau, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hand and Uhlinger, 1992</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and gene cloning</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from a mixture of planulae and primary polyps using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNAs were synthesized using the BD SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

However, this antibody likely cross-reacts with GLWamides regardless of the N-terminal sequence, as immunohistochemistry in <italic>Aurelia</italic> ephyrae (larval medusae) shows a staining pattern consistent with that previously documented by using an antibody against EQPGLWamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakanishi et al., 2009</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis</title><p>Using the published method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakayama et al., 2013</xref>), sgRNAs were in vitro transcribed from PCR-amplified templates by using MEGAscript transcription kits (Ambion).

Nuclei were labeled using fluorescent dyes DAPI (1:1,000, Molecular Probes), and filamentous actin was labeled using AlexaFluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (1:25, Molecular Probes). For in situ hybridization, antisense digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were synthesized by using the MEGAscript transcription kits according to manufacturer’s recommendation (Ambion), and were used at the final concentration of 1 ng/μl.

Your article has been reviewed by Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor, Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado as the Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Nakanishi and Martindale use a knockout approach to study the role of GLWamide neuropeptides play in polyp morphogenesis in the Cnidarian, <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>. The authors find that GLWamides are not required for the polyp transition but significantly accelerate polyp morphogenesis. Because of the ancient origin of these peptides, the authors propose that Wamide peptides likely have an evolutionarily-conserved role in accelerating developmental transitions in both cnidarians and bilaterians. While many of the findings are not unexpected based on past studies and could, therefore, be viewed as incremental, we are enthusiastic and view the study as innovative and highly important because it: (1) uses modern, definitive genetic techniques to address this question for the first time; and (2) provides a roadmap for using <italic>Nematostella</italic> for complex reverse genetic experiments. In fact, this is one of the first studies that has used F2 and F3 non-mosaic CRISPR KO animals (rather than mosaic F0) in a cnidarian. As such, this work sets a new standard for cnidarian loss-of-function research. Progress in our understanding of the evolution of physiological systems has been hampered by lack of tractable cnidarian model organisms, so it is exciting to see this kind of study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Because of the importance of this study, we would like for the authors to address the following issues:</p><p>1) The results that were obtained from the experiments reported are interesting; however, the authors' conclusion is based on the assumption that the gene in question is the only GLWamide-encoding gene in <italic>Nematostella</italic>. What is the evidence that no other related peptide is present (i.e., very short seq: LWG followed by K or R; easy to overlook), given also that the current genome assembly isn't great (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1)?</p><p>2) The antibody they used was generated against CEAGAPGLWamide and would probably not detect other Wamide-like peptides. The delayed metamorphosis reported by the authors is also consistent with the presence of an additional XWamide/LWamide that may induce metamorphosis less effectively. Also, <italic>Nematostella</italic> metamorphosis is different from other studied cnidarians (hydrozoans and corals) in that it does not require an exogenous trigger. Hence, these findings could be true for <italic>Nematostella</italic> but not necessarily for other cnidarians, where a microbial film or LWamide change metamorphosis rates from &lt;5% in their absence to &gt;95% when applied. Our recommendation: either provide evidence to exclude other LWamide encoding genes in <italic>Nematostella</italic> or, adapt the conclusion to the actual findings.</p><p>3) The paper would benefit from a better discussion of previous work done on the role of LWamides in cnidarians. For example, McFarlane et al. (1987), Takahashi et al. (1997), and Katsukura et al. (2004) reported that LWamide peptides (also known in Hydra as hym-54) cause a rhythmic contraction in sea anemone and hydrozoan muscles (at lower concentrations). Has there been any defect in locomotion or phototaxis in KO animals?</p><p>4) The authors write that previous work suggested the Wamides are required for metamorphosis. This is not entirely correct, and the text should be carefully revised. Conzelmann et al. showed that exogenous MIP can 'induce' or 'trigger' larval settlement and that the effects on the cilia require the MIP-receptor. They did not claim that MIP is 'required' for settlement.</p><p>5) In the Discussion section, the authors refer to a study by Plickert et al. on the role of GLWamide peptides in regulating <italic>Hydractinia</italic> metamorphosis. Plickert et al. concluded that GLWamide was required for metamorphosis in <italic>Hydractinia</italic>. This was based on two lines of evidence. One was the RNAi knockdown of the proneuropeptide that led to a delay/reduced rate in metamorphosis. The other was the pharmacological inhibition of the α-amidating enzyme that is required to convert the C-terminal Gly into an amide group during neuropeptide maturation. Inhibition of this enzyme with the copper chelators diethyl-dithiocarbamate (DDC) or tetra-ethyl-thiuram-disulfide (TETD) completely blocked metamorphosis. This effect could be rescued by synthetic GLWamide. Nakanishi and Martindale only mention the RNAi results and argue that the data in the Plickert et al. paper are consistent with GLWamide having an accelerating role. However, they should also discuss the inhibitor results and the rescue by the peptide, which suggest a requirement of amidated peptides.</p><p>6) It may well be that there are species-specific differences in the involvement of GLWamides in the regulation of metamorphosis. The discussion presents the role of GLWamides and MIPs in general, assuming a conserved role. It should be made clear when the authors talk about the function of the peptide in <italic>Nematostella</italic> and when they suggest a conservation of function in other species.</p><p>7) The following two statements should be carefully reworded:</p><p>Introduction: the authors write that &quot;Contrary to the hypothesis that Wamide is necessary for life cycle transition, we report that Wamide knockout mutant larvae can transform into morphologically normal polyps.&quot;</p><p>and</p><p>Results section: &quot;The above results are incompatible with the previously proposed hypothesis that GLWamide is an indispensable component of the regulatory system controlling cnidarian metamorphosis (e.g. Plickert et al., 2003).&quot;</p><p>This work was done in <italic>Nematostella</italic> and the hypothesis that Wamide is necessary for lifecycle transition was proposed based on experiments in <italic>Hydractinia</italic>. The two diverged in or prior to the Cambrian. See also previous comments about the copper chelator experiments in <italic>Hydractinia</italic>.</p><p>8) The authors write that &quot;in the annelid polychaete <italic>Platynereis</italic>, MIP (Wamide) receptor expression is necessary for larval settlement behavior (Conzelmann et al., 2013) … reducing the expression of MIP by morpholino antisense oligonucleotide inhibits feeding behavior in the juvenile, but not metamorphosis (Williams, Conzelmann, and Jekely, 2015). This suggests the presence of as-yet-unknown ligands for the &quot;MIP&quot; receptor.&quot; The conclusion that the <italic>Platynereis</italic> MIP receptor has other ligands is not supported by the available data. First, the morpholino-mediated knockdown of the MIP receptor by Conzelmann et al. only abrogated the effect of MIP on ciliary closures. A longer-term effect on spontaneous settlement behavior (i.e. without extra MIP addition) was not investigated. So, the statement &quot;receptor expression is necessary for larval settlement&quot; is not precise. Likewise, the observation that MIP knockdown by morpholinos inhibits feeding behavior in the juvenile, but not metamorphosis, does not mean that the MIP receptor has other ligands. Instead, what has been shown recently, is that MIP peptides signal through two different receptors in <italic>Platynereis</italic>. One is the MIP GPCR, a sex-peptide-receptor ortholog, the other one is a peptide-gated channel. Peptide-gated channels are also present in the hydrozoan <italic>Hydra</italic>. The authors should rewrite this part of the Discussion section. In light of these studies, the authors may also want to discuss the potential nature of the <italic>Nematostella</italic> GLWamide receptor(s).</p><p>9) The raw data in Figure 5 should be supplied. In addition, the authors should replete the data to show the spread of the data points.</p><p>Some raw confocal image stack of the GLWamide in situs and immunos should be uploaded as source data files.</p><p>10) One final shared concern is with the interpretation of staining results, where it is suggested that GLWamide is expressed in sensory neurons. It is customary in the <italic>Nematostella</italic> community to refer to some neurons as sensory based on their position and potential similarity to putative cnidarian sensory cell types listed in the literature. However, we are not aware of any direct physiological or genetic evidence indicating that these cells play a sensory role in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, or what senses they may underlie. Furthermore, it is not known if such cells have non-sensory functions in neuronal signaling. It might, therefore, be best to say these cells are putative sensory cells or could be sensory cells and discuss the evidence for that in more detail. If there is indeed solid evidence, then perhaps that should be taken into account in the discussion: does the presence of GLWamide in specific sensory cells link specific environmental cues to polyp morphogenesis?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39742.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Because of the importance of this study, we would like for the authors to address the following issues:</p><p>1) The results that were obtained from the experiments reported are interesting; however, the authors' conclusion is based on the assumption that the gene in question is the only GLWamide-encoding gene in Nematostella.

First, this is a polyclonal antibody, and therefore the reactivity is expected to occur not only with the CEAGAPGLWamide-specific region not found in other GLWamide peptides, but also with the conserved C-terminal region. Second, the antibody was affinity-absorbed with non-amidated peptides KECPPGLWGC-cooh and KECLPGVWG-cooh to select for the antibody that would specifically react with the C-terminally amidated form of GLW peptides. Third, we have used this antibody to immunostain <italic>Aurelia</italic> ephyrae, and obtained a staining pattern consistent with that obtained by using an antibody against EQPGLWamide (Nakanishi et al., 2009), indicating that our antibody can cross-react with GLWamides from a different cnidarian; in the revised version of the manuscript we have included a supplemental figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) demonstrating this. We are therefore relatively confident that our GLWamide antibody should cross-react with GLWamides – irrespective of their N-terminal sequence – in <italic>Nematostella</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The paper would benefit from a better discussion of previous work done on the role of LWamides in cnidarians.

However, this is the case for the majority of cnidarian ‘sensory cells’ (except in rare cases such as an opsin-expressing photosensory cell of a cubozoan). In cnidarian neurobiology literature beyond that concerning <italic>Nematostella</italic>, the definition of a ‘sensory cell’ is primarily morphological – a bipolar epidermal cell that is oriented perpendicular to the mesoglea and has an apical cilium exposed to the external environment, as well as basal thin neurite extensions (e.g. Thomas and Edwards, 1991). We consider it appropriate to follow the convention of cnidarian literature given that <italic>Nematostella</italic> is a cnidarian.</p></body></sub-article></article>
