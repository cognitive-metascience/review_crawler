Oligodendrocytes near synapses detect and respond to neuronal activity, but their role in synapse development and plasticity remains largely unexplored. We show that oligodendrocytes modulate neurotransmitter release at presynaptic terminals through secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Oligodendrocyte-derived BDNF functions via presynaptic tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) to ensure fast, reliable neurotransmitter release and auditory transmission in the developing brain. In auditory brainstem slices from <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/–</sup> mice, reduction in endogenous BDNF significantly decreased vesicular glutamate release by reducing the readily releasable pool of glutamate vesicles, without altering presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation or release probability. Using conditional knockout mice, cell-specific ablation of BDNF in oligodendrocytes largely recapitulated this effect, which was recovered by BDNF or TrkB agonist application. This study highlights a novel function for oligodendrocytes in synaptic transmission and their potential role in the activity-dependent refinement of presynaptic properties.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory brainstem</kwd><kwd>presynaptic terminal</kwd><kwd>oligodendrocytes</kwd><kwd>BDNF</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC03157</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jun Hee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oligodendrocytes are actively engaged in the precise control of synaptic functions in the CNS through activity-dependent BDNF signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The formation of complex neuronal networks requires the experience-dependent establishment and remodeling of synapses. The precise control of synaptic function depends not only on neurons, but also on glial cells. Immature oligodendrocytes, located near synapses, make functional synapses with neurons, express neurotransmitter receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergles et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin and Bergles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berret et al., 2017</xref>), and secrete neurotrophic factors such as BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagayogo and Dreyfus, 2009</xref>). Thus, oligodendrocytes are in a prime position to participate in bi-directional communication. In this study, we address whether oligodendrocytes can modulate synaptic function through activity-dependent BDNF signaling.</p><p>BDNF regulates neuronal survival and growth in the developing central nervous system (CNS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alderson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hohn et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodriguez-Tébar et al., 1990</xref>) and is extensively involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity in various brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang and Schuman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levine et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carmignoto et al., 1997</xref>). For example, activity-dependent BDNF secretion is involved in long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harward et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vignoli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gärtner and Staiger, 2002</xref>). It is known that BDNF signaling regulates vesicular glutamate release at presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pozzo-Miller et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tyler and Pozzo-Miller, 2001</xref>), but, because of the low expression of both intracellular and extracellular BDNF in most brain areas, little is known regarding the source and the exact location of action of BDNF at synapses and, specifically, its presynaptic effects.</p><p>Glial cells modulate synaptic properties and activities through the secretion of BDNF. Astrocytes recycle BDNF and are involved in the stabilization of long-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vignoli et al., 2016</xref>). Microglial BDNF is also an important regulator of synaptic plasticity and function during early brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parkhurst et al., 2013</xref>). In the CNS, oligodendrocytes express and secrete BDNF, and BDNF secretion is regulated by activation of glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagayogo and Dreyfus, 2009</xref>). We recently showed that immature oligodendrocytes have the capacity to sense neuronal activity and receive glutamatergic inputs in the auditory brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berret et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that neuron-oligodendrocyte communication occurs through chemical signaling. BDNF may thus be a bi-directional signaling factor between oligodendrocytes and neurons.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effects of oligodendroglial BDNF on synaptic functions and the mechanisms whereby oligodendroglial BDNF regulates neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminal using mice with reduced BDNF levels (<italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/–</sup>) and with an oligodendrocyte-specific conditional knockout (cKO) of <italic>Bdnf</italic>. We studied the synaptic functions of oligodendroglial BDNF at the synapse between the calyx of Held terminal and the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) neuron in the auditory brainstem, which is an oligodendrocyte- and synapse-rich brain region. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, electrophysiology, electron microscopy, and in vivo auditory brainstem response (ABR) tests, we found that oligodendroglial BDNF is critical for determining the readily releasable pool (RRP) of glutamate vesicles and actively participates in glutamate release at the calyx terminals. The results suggest that oligodendrocytes are involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity specifically through BDNF signaling in the developing auditory brainstem region.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BDNF and glutamatergic synapses in the auditory brainstem</title><p>Immunostaining using the neuronal marker MAP2 and the oligodendroglial marker, Olig1, in brainstem sections from wild-type (WT) mice showed that BDNF is highly expressed in MNTB principal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It is of note that oligodendrocytes located close to the calyx–MNTB neuron synapse also expressed BDNF. BDNF expression was notably decreased in all cell types in the MNTB in <italic>Bdnf<sup>+/−</sup></italic>mice at P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To examine the effect of endogenous BDNF on fast glutamatergic transmission in the auditory brainstem, we recorded miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) from MNTB principal neurons in brainstem slices from P16–20 WT and <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). There was no significant difference in the amplitude or kinetics, including rise and decay times, of mEPSCs in WT and <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/–</sup> mice (amplitude: 39.9 ± 2.51 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 13 vs 33.4 ± 2.92 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 12, respectively, p=0.10; rise time: 0.3 ± 0.01 ms, <italic>n</italic> = 13 vs 0.3 ± 0.02 ms, <italic>n</italic> = 12, respectively, p=0.37; decay time: 0.6 ± 0.03 ms, <italic>n</italic> = 13 vs 0.7 ± 0.07 ms, <italic>n</italic> = 12, respectively, p=0.58, <italic>unpaired t-</italic>test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). In addition, the frequency of mEPSCs was not statistically different (2.7 ± 0.69 Hz, <italic>n</italic> = 8 vs 2.4 ± 0.41 Hz, <italic>n</italic> = 11 in WT and <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, respectively; p=0.76, <italic>unpaired t-test</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

This indicates that a reduction in endogenous BDNF does not alter the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release probability at presynaptic terminals. Next, we examined the short-term depression and the RRP size of available glutamate vesicles at presynaptic terminals in WT and <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. During a train of stimuli at 100 Hz (50 pulses), the amplitude of eEPSCs displayed strong depression, falling to ~20% of the initial amplitude near the end of the train in both WT and <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). There was no notable difference in short-term depression between WT and <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (<italic>n</italic> = 7 vs 12). To predict the RRP size, the release probability (<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>), and the synaptic vesicle replenishment rate, we used two variants of the cumulative analysis of EPSC trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). In the Elmqvist and Quastel (EQ) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elmqvist and Quastel, 1965</xref>), the RRP size was estimated by fitting a line to the linear portion of these data (corresponding to the second through the fourth EPSC) and extrapolating to the <italic>x</italic> axis, we measured the total equivalent EPSC at the beginning of the train, which indirectly indicates the available pool of vesicles for release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taschenberger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kushmerick et al., 2006</xref>). We plotted the eEPSC amplitudes during a train versus their cumulative amplitudes at the end of a train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which were 91.5 ± 9.46 nA (<italic>n</italic> = 6) in WT and 46.3 ± 6.89 nA (<italic>n</italic> = 13) in <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (p=0.0016, <italic>unpaired t-test</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The forward extrapolation linear fits revealed that calyces in <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice had a much smaller RRP of glutamate vesicles as compared with WT mice (17.6 ± 2.73 nA in <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, <italic>n</italic> = 11 vs 33.4 ± 3.31 nA in WT, <italic>n</italic> = 5; p=0.004, <italic>unpaired t-test</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

A line fit to the steady-state points (the last 10 of 50 points) is back-extrapolated to the y-axis, and the y-intercept divided by the mEPSC amplitude estimates the RRP size. This analysis also revealed that calyces in <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice had a much smaller RRP of glutamate vesicles as compared with WT mice (9.8 ± 1.29 nA in <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, <italic>n</italic> = 11 vs 19.4 ± 1.71 nA in WT, <italic>n</italic> = 5; p=0.0008, <italic>unpaired t-test</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Another interesting finding was the reduced replenishment rate of vesicles in <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, which was estimated by the slope of the linear fit (0.61 ± 0.10 in <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, <italic>n</italic> = 11 vs 1.39 ± 0.19 in WT, <italic>n</italic> = 5; p=0.0018, <italic>unpaired t-test</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating that BDNF signaling plays a role in the replenishment of vesicles at the calyx terminal. The values of RRP obtained by the SMN method were smaller than those obtained by the EQ method, because this RRP was measured as the pool decrement during stimulation, whereas the RRP estimated using the EQ Method indicates the size of a pre-existing pool of vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neher, 2015</xref>).

ΔC<sub>m</sub> in <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice was much smaller than that in WT (ΔC<sub>m</sub> after a 20 ms depolarization: 93.4 ± 8.82 fF, <italic>n</italic> = 11 in <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> vs 148 ± 11.32 fF, <italic>n</italic> = 11 in WT mice; p=0.0013, <italic>unpaired t-test</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>).

In addition, plotting ΔC<sub>m</sub> (for the 20 ms depolarization) as a function of the C<sub>m</sub> showed the distribution of C<sub>m</sub> as estimated by linear regression analysis (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.1 in WT, <italic>n</italic> = 9; <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.06 in <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/–</sup> mice, <italic>n</italic> = 9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Despite their similar resting values for C<sub>m</sub>, ΔC<sub>m</sub> was much smaller in calyces from <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice as compared with comparably sized calyces from WT. However, a positive correlation between the resting C<sub>m</sub> and ΔC<sub>m</sub> suggest that larger calyces release more vesicles in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Next, we examined the effects of BDNF reduction on presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> related to changes in exocytosis of glutamate vesicles. There was no significant difference in the presynaptic <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> charge (<italic>QI</italic><sub>Ca</sub>) in response to depolarizing pulses. The smaller ΔC<sub>m</sub> in calyces from <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice was not attributed to alterations in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents. In WT calyces, a 20 ms depolarization induced a <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> of 6.5 ± 0.53 pC/pF (<italic>n</italic> = 10), whereas in <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> calyces, <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> was 5.9 ± 0.96 pC/pF (<italic>n</italic> = 9; p=0.50, <italic>unpaired t-test</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, the current–voltage relationship (<italic>I–V</italic>) curve for these voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the calyx terminal in WT and <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (at P10-12) exhibited a similar pattern with the peak current of −625 ± 48.3 pA vs −614 ± 16.5 pA at −10 mV in WT and <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, respectively (n = 15 vs n = 15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Furthermore, we examined presynaptic action potential evoked by afferent fiber stimulation, and there was no significant difference in amplitude and half-with of presynaptic action potential, which is associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation and release probability (amplitude, 122.5 ± 7.8 mV in WT, n = 3 vs 124.6 ± 4.4 mV in <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup>, n = 4, p=0.8082 and half-width, 318 ± 41.2 μs in WT, n = 3 vs 283 ± 45.5 μs in <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/−</sup>, n = 4, p=0.6123, <italic>unpaired t-test</italic>, data not shown).

These conflicting findings may result from the differences between species, ages, or BDNF application method. In particular, the timing of the BDNF signal induction may differentially modulate synapse function as either acute or chronic applications of BDNF can differentially modulate synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sherwood and Lo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schildt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Exogenous administration of BDNF to brain slices has limitations. Depending on administration time, exogenous application could result in the non-specific binding effect of BDNF to presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, resulting in inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation rather than through BDNF-TrkB signaling. Further studies are required to determine the effect of exogenous BDNF on Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel subtypes expressed in the presynaptic terminal and what aspects of BDNF signaling generate differential responses.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the presynaptic effects of BDNF-TrkB signaling remain elusive. Activation of TrkB leads to the induction of a combination of downstream signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the PLC pathway, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, that could modulate synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoshii and Constantine-Paton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reichardt, 2006</xref>).

BDNF expression is observed in auditory brainstem nuclei in the mouse from P6, and its expression follows the protracted period of development in the auditory pathway, with expression beginning in the ventral cochlear nucleus and continuing to the MNTB and then to the medial superior olive and the lateral superior olive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiechers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hafidi, 1999</xref>). Glial cells may participate in modulating synaptic structure and function during the development of the auditory circuitry by providing a permissive environment through the secretion of BDNF. Oligodendrocytes populate the MNTB prior to astrocytes, indicating oligodendrocytes have a primary role in the maturation of synapses during MNTB development. During the early postnatal weeks, oligodendrocytes are present throughout the auditory brainstem including the MNTB nuclei (as they were at birth), whereas GFAP-positive astrocytes appear in the MNTB during the second postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dinh et al., 2014</xref>). Our immunostaining results, which are consistent with this previous study, showed that there is a greater oligodendrocyte population in the MNTB as compared with GFAP-positive astrocytes by P8 and that most oligodendrocytes are located in proximity to the calyx synapse (data not shown).</p><p>This study demonstrated the presence of BDNF in oligodendrocytes in the MNTB of mouse brainstem during early postnatal development. Oligodendrocytes expressed BDNF in the MNTB of the auditory brainstem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and isolated O1+ or <italic>Cnp<sup>cre</sup></italic>-driven GCaMP6f-GFP cells expressed a substantial amount of <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Previous study demonstrated that oligodendrocytes release BDNF in response to glutamate application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagayogo and Dreyfus, 2009</xref>). Oligodendrocyte processes contact the calyx terminal, which releases glutamate, before forming a myelin sheath during early development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This suggests that glutamate-mediated signaling between oligodendrocytes and the calyx synapses induces BDNF release from oligodendrocytes to increase synaptic strength. Due to the biochemical nature of BDNF, it is thought to act locally at the synapse with limited diffusion within the micrometer range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horch and Katz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sasi et al., 2017</xref>). Oligodendrocytes likely exert a direct impact through the localized secretion of BDNF to the calyx synapses.

Using two reporter lines, Rosa-GCaMP6f-GFP and Rosa-tdTomato, we identified that &lt;5% of neurons in the MNTB expressed <italic>Cnp<sup>cre</sup></italic>-driven reporter in early postnatal ages (P10- P20). In addition, using FACS, isolated GCaMP6f-GFP+ cell population contains high levels of Olig2 mRNA with very low levels of Kcc2 mRNA, a neuronal marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The majority (&gt;95%) of <italic>Cnp<sup>cre</sup></italic> expressing cells in the MNTB are oligodendrocytes as shown through immunohistochemistry.

There is the possibility that the small percentage of neurons, affected by <italic>Cnp<sup>cre</sup></italic>, is sufficient to reduce global levels of <italic>Bdnf</italic> and impact on the synaptic phenotype in the cKO. In cultured neurons, the effect of BDNF within a synapse has been observed to occur within a distance of 4.5 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horch and Katz, 2002</xref>). Thus, BDNF reduction in a small portion of neurons (&lt;5%) is unlikely to have widespread effects or global impact on the synaptic phenotype observed in the cKO. We interpret that functional alterations of the calyx synapse were caused by the loss of BDNF in oligodendrocytes, which constitute the majority of CNP-expressing cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Bidirectional signaling between oligodendrocytes and nerve terminals</title><p>In cultured oligodendrocytes, the activation of glutamate receptors and the phospholipase C pathway enhances the release of dense-core vesicles containing BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagayogo and Dreyfus, 2009</xref>), suggesting that release of BDNF from oligodendrocytes depends on neuronal activity and is mediated by neuron–oligodendrocyte interactions. Our recent study demonstrated that a sub-population of oligodendrocytes interacts with neurons via synapses and displays action potentials in response to intensive neuronal activities in the auditory brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berret et al., 2017</xref>). It is intriguing to speculate that bidirectional signaling occurs between oligodendrocytes and nerve terminals at synapses, in which glutamatergic inputs from neurons trigger oligodendrocytes to release BDNF, and then oligodendrocyte-derived BDNF binds to presynaptic TrkB, and finally modulates the glutamate vesicle pool at the nerve terminal. These findings indicate that oligodendrocytes may modulate synaptic plasticity in an activity-dependent manner. An increase in the RRP of vesicles could also contribute to short-term plasticity such as PTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Habets and Borst, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Regehr, 2012</xref>). We show that the reduction of global BDNF significantly impairs the induction of PTP at the calyx synapse in <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/–</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Oligodendrocytes can regulate synaptic strength and plasticity at the calyx synapse by modulating the RRP size through BDNF signaling. Oligodendrocytes that are closely apposed to synapses thus monitor and sense synaptic activity and modulate synaptic plasticity at the presynaptic terminals. In the case of the calyx synapse, this occurs through BDNF–TrkB signaling, which may represent an efficient way for oligodendrocytes to find active nerve terminals and to assist in maintaining synaptic activities. During this critical window of development, when activity-dependent synaptic refinement can occur along the auditory nervous system, oligodendrocytes actively participate in synaptic transmission and plasticity through BDNF signaling in the developing brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">B6.129S4-Bdnf<sup>tm1Jae</sup>/J</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>stock no.:002266</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8139657">8139657</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">Bdnf<sup>tm3Jae</sup>/J</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>stock no.:004339</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rios et al., 2001</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Cnp<sup>Cre</sup> mice</td><td>Dr. Klaus Nave (Max Planck Institute)</td><td>MGI no: 3051635</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lappe-Siefke et al., 2003</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>GCaMP6f</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>stock no.:024105</td><td>Dr. Paukert, UTHSCSA</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>tdTomato</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>stock no.:007909</td><td>Dr. Paukert, UTHSCSA</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-Olig1</td><td>Millipore</td><td>MAB5540</td><td>1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-MAP2</td><td>Millipore</td><td>MAB3418</td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN</td><td>Millipore</td><td>MAB377</td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP</td><td>DAKO</td><td>Z033429</td><td>1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-CC1</td><td>Millipore</td><td>OP80</td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit monoclonal anti-Olig2</td><td>Abcam</td><td valign="bottom">109186</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rat monoclonal anti-PDGFRa</td><td>Abcam</td><td>AB90967</td><td>1:300</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-BDNF</td><td>Bioss</td><td>BS4989R</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-TrkB</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>sc-136990</td><td>1:50</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Guinea pig <break/>polyclonal anti-VGluT1</td><td>Millipore</td><td>AB5905</td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF)</td><td>Sigma</td><td>D5446</td><td>20 μM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>BDNF</td><td>Millipore</td><td>GF301</td><td>100 ng/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>TEA-Cl</td><td>Sigma</td><td>T2265</td><td>10 mM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>4-AP</td><td>Sigma</td><td>275875</td><td>0.1 mM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>TTX</td><td>TOCRIS</td><td>1078</td><td>1 μM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>QX314 bromide</td><td>TOCRIS</td><td>1014</td><td>4 mM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Bicuculline</td><td>TOCRIS</td><td>130</td><td>10 µM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">Strychnine</td><td>Sigma</td><td>S8753</td><td>2 µM</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio (UTHSCSA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols.

To this solution, we added 4 mM QX-314 bromide to block the voltage-activated Na<sup>+</sup> current. Extracellular aCSF solution contained 10 µM bicuculline and 2 µM strychnine to block GABA and glycine receptors, respectively. The holding potential was –70 mV in the voltage-clamp mode. Patch electrodes had resistances of 4–5 MΩ. Series resistance was &lt;20 MΩ, with 80% compensation. Afferent fibers of the calyx of Held synapses were stimulated with a bipolar electrode (Frederic Haer, Bowdoinham, ME) placed near the midline of the MNTB. An Iso-Flex stimulator driven by a Master 10 pulse at 1.2-fold threshold (&lt;15 V constant voltage) was used. Data were analyzed off-line and displayed with Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR).

After three rinses with PBS, slices were coverslipped using mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vectashield; Vector Laboratories) to counterstain cell nuclei. Stained slices were viewed on a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM-510) at 488, 568, and 633 nm using 40 × or 60 × oil immersion objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Transmission EM</title><p>Animals were anesthetized and intracardially perfused with normal saline. Brains were removed and 400-μm-thick samples of brainstem MNTB area were dissected out followed by primary fixation in 1% glutaraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde. Further processing was performed by the UTHSCSA Electron Microscopy Lab. Briefly, each brainstem was post-fixed with 1% Zetterqvist’s buffered osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in PolyBed resin at 80°C in an oven. Tissue containing the MNTB, which is innervated by calyces of Held, was cut into 90 nm ultrathin sections and placed on copper grids. The sections were then stained with uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead citrate. The samples were imaged on a JEOL 1400 electron microscope using Advanced Microscopy Techniques software. The calyx of Held terminals contacting cell bodies of MNTB principal neurons were recognizable as a cluster of cells located medially in the superior olivary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taschenberger et al., 2002</xref>). A total of 166–196 synapses were analyzed from five animals for each group (control and <italic>Bdnf</italic> cKO). The number of docked vesicles per the active zone was measured for each synapse at a final magnification of 80,000×. The active zone was defined as the dark presynaptic density contacting the postsynaptic density. Docked and clustered vesicles were defined as those within 10 nm and 200 nm of the presynaptic active zone, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sätzler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taschenberger et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ABR recordings</title><p>ABR recordings were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and maintained with 2% isoflurane during recording (1 l/min O<sub>2</sub> flow rate). ABR recordings were carried out in a sound attenuation chamber (Med Associates, Albans, VT). Body temperature of mice was maintained at 37°C using a heating pad. Subdermal needle electrodes for recording were placed on the top of the head (active), ipsilateral mastoid (reference), and contralateral mastoid (ground). The electrical potential differences between the vertex and the mastoid electrodes were amplified and filtered (100–5000 Hz), and a recording window of 10 ms starting at the onset of click sound stimulation was distally sampled at 40-μs intervals. Acoustic stimuli were generated by the Auditory Evoked Potentials Workstation (Tucker-Davis Technologies [TDT], Alachua, FL). Closed-field click stimuli were delivered to the left ear using a series of square waves (0.1 ms duration) through TDT Multi-Field Magnetic Speakers placed 10 cm away from the left ear canal. A repetition rate of sound stimuli of 16/s was transmitted through a 10 cm length of plastic tubing (Tygon; 3.2 mm outer diameter). Sound intensities ranged from 90 to 20 dB with 5 dB decrements and responses to 512 sweeps were averaged. The lowest sound intensity that produced a reproducible waveform was interpreted as the threshold. Free-field pure tone stimuli were taken at frequencies of 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32 kHz at 70 to 20 dB in decrements of 5 dB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS)</title><p><italic>Bdnf</italic> cKO mice (<italic>Cnp<sup>Cre</sup>: Bdnf</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>, n = 3) and control mice (<italic>Cnp<sup>Cre</sup>: Bdnf</italic><sup>fl/+</sup>, n = 2) were used for FACS experiments. <italic>Cnp<sup>Cre</sup></italic>: Rosa-GCAMP6f-GFP<sup>+/-</sup> (n = 3) and <italic>Cnp<sup>Cre</sup></italic> heterozygous controls (n = 3) were used. A cell suspension was generated from the brainstem using enzymatic (papain, 48 U/mL, P1325, Sigma) and mechanical titration. Dissected brainstem was incubated in dissociation media (145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 20 mM Hepes, 1 mM Na-pyruvate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.2) with papain and DNase (10 μM, 10104159001, Sigma) for 20 min. The tissue was spun down at 300 x g for 5 min and resuspended in 1 ml of dissociation media with DNase (10 μM). Mechanical titration was performed using a 1000 ul pipette tip followed by a 200 ul pipette tip. After dissociation, the suspension was filtered and spun down at 300x g for 7 min. The cells were resuspended in 400 μl of dissociation media. 50 μl were set aside for a no primary antibody control. 1 μl anti-O1 antibody (MAB1327, R and D systems) was added to the remaining 350 μl cell suspension (dilution 1:350) and cells were incubated on ice for 25 min. Cells were washed with 1 ml of dissociation media and spun at 300x g for 7 min.

Purity was assessed by A260/A280 ratios with values ranging from 1.83 to 1.98. 100 ng of RNA was utilized for each reverse transcription (RT) reaction. RT was performed using Superscript III First-strand synthesis with 1 μl Oligo (dT) primers, 1 μl 10 mM dNTP mix (180180–051, Invitrogen). cDNA was stored at −20C for up to 48 hr. qPCR was performed using the PowerUp SYBR green master mix (A25742, Thermofisher). Primers were used at 0.25 μM. Reactions were manually loaded into optical plates with covers (plates:4309849, covers:4360954, Applied Biosystems). The plate was spun for 30 s. qPCR was performed using 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), data was analyzed using SDS v2.4 (Applied Biosystems) and the determined CT was used for analysis. No outliers were removed. No template controls (NTC) as well as no RT controls did not produce determinable CT values. Gapdh was chosen as a reference. Technical replicates were done in triplicate.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Oligodendrocytes regulate presynaptic properties and neurotransmission through BDNF signaling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Lu-Yang Wang (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All reviewers commented on the importance of understanding the interactions between oligodendrocytes and axons during development and the skill with which the physiological studies were carried out. The studies are clearly novel and interesting. However, as outlined below, major concerns were raised about the congruence between that ages of the mice subjected to the different manipulations and the veracity of the conclusions based on the analysis, in particular the voltage-dependence of Ca channels and the estimates of RRP. In addition, there is insufficient evidence provided that the genetic manipulations designed to delete BDNF from oligodendrocytes was selective and effective. Overall, these issues would have to be addressed before the study is considered sufficiently impactful to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript from Kim and colleagues addresses an important question in developmental neuroscience – the role that myelinating glia play in shaping the maturation of neuronal excitability and synaptic connectivity. The authors exploit the extraordinary accessibility of the calyx synapse in the auditory brainstem to define how BDNF release from oligodendrocytes influences maturation of these synapses. The studies point to a role of this growth factor in altering the RRP, although the mechanism remains to be determined.</p><p>1) The authors generate CNPase-Cre; <italic>bdnf</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>;Ai9 (tdTomato reporter) mice to achieve oligodendrocyte selective depletion of BDNF. It is crucial for the interpretation that they demonstrate both the selectivity and efficiency of gene deletion. Figure 5—figure supplement 1 evaluates co-localization between tdTomato and Olig1, which is used as a marker for oligodendrocytes. While there is some co-localization between Olig1 and tdTomato in panel A, many of the Olig1+ cells are not tdTomoto immunoreactive, and there appears to be widespread expression of tdTomato in vascular cells (perhaps pericytes). These panels are labeled as &quot;CNPase&quot;, however they appear to show the distribution of tdTomato, as an indication of which cells experienced Cre dependent recombination. It is unusual to use Olig1 as a marker for oligodendrocyte cell bodies, rather than CNPase, CC1, or GSTPi, as Olig1 is expressed by other glial cells. The promiscuous expression of tdTomato in these mice raise concerns about specificity of the recombination, which is an issue, given the widespread expression of BDNF (see Figure 1). In addition, they have not provided evidence that this manipulation resulted in depletion of <italic>bdnf</italic> from oligodendrocytes. The standard experiment would be to isolate oligodendrocytes in this region by FACS and then perform qPCR to show that the mRNA is no longer detected. Immunolabeling for BDNF with the markers described above would unlikely to be sufficient, unless the co-localization were unambiguous.</p><p>2) The ABR measurements in Figure 8 indicate that there was a remarkable change in latency to the first peak in the <italic>bdnf</italic> cKO mice. This would suggest that conduction along the auditory nerve is slowed in these animals. This issue should be discussed, in light of the fact that CNPase-Cre will also induce recombination in peripheral Schwann cells.</p><p>3) There is no evaluation of whether loss of <italic>bdnf</italic> affects the density of oligodendrocyte progenitors or myelination (or Schwann cells). There are numerous reports that BDNF signaling through TrkB alters progenitor dynamics and the process of myelination. If myelination is altered, it could affect activity propagating along GBC axons and therefore maturation of their terminals. It is possible that there is sufficient BDNF coming from other sources to compensate, but if that is true, why don't these other sources compensate for the loss of oligodendrocyte-derived <italic>bdnf</italic>?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>By a combination of immunofluorescence labeling, patch-clamp electrophysiology, electron microscopy, and in vivo auditory brainstem response (ABR) tests in transgenic mice with conventional knockout (BDNF<sup>+/-</sup>) or oligodendrocyte-specific conditional knockout of BDNF (cKO), Jang et al. showed that oligodendrocyte derived BDNF is critical for boosting the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles (SVs) and actively promoting glutamate release from the calyx of Held terminals.</p><p>Overall this study presents compelling evidence to support the novel role of BDNF from oligodendrocytes to regulate synaptic transmission by targeting specific quantal parameter with advanced molecular and cellular tools. Conceptually, this study is important for the field of development plasticity in central synapses. This reviewer has no major objections to the main conclusion that the authors have drawn from their data but would like to make a few suggestions for the author to consider for tightening up the loose ends.</p><p>1) The authors framed the entire story that BDNF released specifically from oligodendrocytes are critical for modulating the RRP in the context of the critical period of development. However, the choice of age group for different experiments is quite confusing. For example, patch-clamp recordings of EPSCs were from P16-20 mice (mature or nearly mature synapses); immunofluorescence labeling and EM were done in P20-25 mice; and calcium currents and capacitance measurements were done in P9-13 mice (immature synapses). Given that dramatic changes in presynaptic spike waveform, calcium channel-SV coupling distance and morphological remodeling all occur during this period, it is difficult to discern if oligodendrocyte derived BDNF is specifically important for developmental remodeling of immature synapses and/or synaptic signaling in mature synapses. It would impart readers with more confidence if the authors can show the results from the experiments in parallel age groups.</p><p>2) With the entirely opposite results from Baydyuk et al., 2015, it is essential to show and validate the expression patterns of BDNF/TrkB for P9-13 age group in order to strengthen the arguments made in this paper against the previous paper.</p><p>3) In the capacitance jump experiments, it was stated that there is no difference in the basal membrane capacitance between WT and BDNF(+/-) calyces (Figure 3), but the calyx volume is significantly smaller in morphological analyses (Figure 6). There is an obvious conflict here which needs some explanation.</p><p>4) Given the abundant expression of TrkB in MNTB neurons, it is essential to analyze the effects of exogenous ligands on the amplitude and frequency of mEPSCs to ensure the observed effects is purely presynaptic as claimed (Figure 4). It is puzzling in fact that BDNF is not doing anything to postsynaptic neurons with much more abundant TrkB expression to detect BDNF than presynaptic terminals. It is probably too hasty to rule out the role of BDNF in postsynaptic signaling at this stage.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript &quot;Oligodendrocytes regulate presynaptic properties and neurotransmission through BDNF signaling&quot;, by Jian et al. examines the role of BDNF signaling on presynaptic function at the p8 -P25 mouse calyx of Held. Using the combination of mouse genetics, patch clamp electrophysiology, ultrastructural analysis, and tests of auditory function the authors make a novel and interesting finding that oligodendrocytes are a critical source of BDNF which is essential for proper synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held synapse. In addition, findings run counter to previous findings that BDNF is a negative regulator of synaptic transmission. In addition, their ability to carry out direct presynaptic recordings and measure calcium currents in combination with capacitance measurements allows for clear mechanistic interpretations of how BDNF regulation of synaptic transmission. Despite the novelty of the findings there are some issues that need to be resolved before acceptable for publication.</p><p>1) The mechanism by which BDNF rescues the RRP is unclear. The authors clearly show that with their capacitance measurements there is a reduction in the readily releasable pool at the calyx and that this can be rescued by application of BDNF. In addition, in the absence of BDNF their EM data clearly demonstrates a reduction in docked SV. Therefore, two possible interpretations can be made. Either each calyx contains the same number of active zones (AZs), but in the absence of each AZ has less docked SVs or absence of BDNF during development results in a reduction in the number of AZs. In both cases application of BDNF would result in an increase of docked SVs which would result in an increase on the RRP. The authors should show with EM that BDNF rescues the docking defect seen. In addition, the authors should carry out nonstationary EPSC variance analysis to determine the number of functional AZs in the presence and absence of BDNF.</p><p>2) The data concerning BDNF effects on the voltage dependence of activation on Calcium channels is not convincing. These measurements are highly dependent on the pipette series resistance in whole cell voltage clamp. There is no mention of the pipette series resistance during the actual recordings. Based on the example traces presented there appears to be differences in the tail current decay between WT and BDNF<sup>+/-</sup>. This could be due to differences in the quality of the voltage clamp or that reductions in BDNF do impact tail currents. In addition, it is not known if a leak subtraction protocol was performed. The authors should redo their IV analysis with better lower residual patch clamp pipette resistance. Furthermore, they should perform the IV analysis in 1.0 mM external Ca<sup>2+</sup> to also offset potential issues with voltage clamp quality.</p><p>3) The authors demonstrate a reduction in AP evoked release and RRP as defined trains of APs at 100 Hz. It has been well established at the age groups p9-11 that a 3ms step depolarization corresponds to the RRP that can be released by action potentials. In Figure 5 which utilized p9-13, there appears to be no difference between the amount of exocytosis with a 2ms step pulse. Therefore, it is unclear why there is a dramatic effect in the AP RRP measurement and RRP as measured by the step depolarizations. It would be helpful if the authors did a 3ms Cm measurement to directly compare. Additionally, the authors should compare data collected at P9-11 vs P12-13 as mice begin to hear at P12. To accurate determine effects on BDNF regulation of the calyx RRP paired recordings at P9-11 would be ideal but not critical to their interpretations. Finally, why did they not carry out fiber stimulation at this age group too?</p><p>4) The calyx of Held goes through structural changes after hearing onset. The volumetric reconstruction of the P20-25 age group revealed significant reductions in calyx volume. However, the Capacitance measurements revealed no change in calyx volume as measured as pF. However, this comes from a different age group compared to the group in volume reconstructions. I am more inclined to trust the volumetric reconstructions since it is very difficult to accurately determine the calyx size with the patch clamp experiments. The authors should carry out volumetric reconstructions as the same age group or measure the calyx volume via a capacitance measurement in the P20-25 age group. Otherwise it is difficult to know why there is such a difference between the two measurements of calyx volume.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Oligodendrocytes regulate presynaptic properties and neurotransmission through BDNF signalling&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, the additional data provided to address concerns about the specificity of recombination in CNPase mice are not sufficient.</p><p>1) In Figure 5—figure supplement 1, the authors show immunostaining for NeuN, GFAP, Pdgfra, CC1 and GFP to assess which cell types exhibit recombination. In these panels, GFP refers to GCaMP6f in CNPase-Cre x R26-lsl-GCaMP6f mice. There is diffuse GFP immunoreactivity throughout the GFP panels that is unaccounted for and unexpected if expression were restricted to oligodendrocytes. In addition, these images reveal intense regions of GFP immunoreactivity that co-localize with NeuN (cell in the center left of panel A) and co-localize with Pdgfra (panel C). Perhaps most significantly, in the GFP image of panel C there are several long processes and one cell body (center left) that is much larger than one would expect for an oligodendrocyte. For some reason, although this cell looks like a neuron, it also exhibits weak immunoreactivity to CC1. However, the CC1 immunoreactivity in panel C is very unusual, with several long processes visible (this is not normally observed with CC1 – see panel B) and many of the CC1+ cell bodies have unusual morphologies. Since orthogonal projections are not shown in this figure, it is difficult to assess whether labeling patterns show proximity or true co-localization. Thus, these immunostaining data to not provide strong support for the conclusion that CNPase-Cre mice exhibit selective recombination in oligodendrocytes. A minor point, in the figure legend, the mice are referred to as &quot;CNPase-GCaMP6f-GFP mice&quot;. Please indicate the exact genotype of the mice for clarity.</p><p>2) The authors also perform PCR analysis on isolated cells to determine the specificity of recombination. However, no experimental details are provided for the FACS and PCR analysis shown in Figure 5. There is insufficient information provided that the isolation procedure was able to isolate a representative population of cells from the brainstem (astrocytes, neurons, oligos, etc.). Procedures used to preserve glia often result in widespread death of neurons, so it is important to assess what types of cells are in this pool.</p><p>3) The criteria used to determine positive versus negative O1 cells in Figure 5—figure supplement 2A is not indicated. From the second panel in A, it looks like there is a clear break between the blue/magenta cells and the green cells. However only the O1+ cells that exhibited the highest immunoreactivity were selected for the PCR analysis. This analysis should be repeated by including the blue cells, to provide a more representative sample of the population. It is unclear why GFP was not used to isolate cells in this example, as this would provide a more direct assessment of what types of cells experienced cre-dependent recombination. Because there is concern about neuronal recombination, neurons from this region should be isolated and GFP and BDNF expression assessed selectively in this pool.</p><p>4) The authors indicate that &gt;27 cycles were necessary to detect BDNF message in the O1+ population. 27 cycles is typically used as a cutoff, with any product observed with more cycles being attributed to noise/non-specific amplification. This suggests that the amount of BDNF in O1+ cells is at the limit, or below the limit, of detection. Although more cycles were required to detect a product in the cKO O1+ cells, confidence in these data are low for this reason.</p><p>5) In Figure 5—figure supplement 2D immunostaining is performed in the cKO mice. The panels show that BDNF immunoreactivity is somewhat lower in O1+ cells in the cKO mice. As a constitutive cre was used, it is surprising that BDNF expression was not abolished. It also appears that BDNF immunoreactivity is also lower in neurons in the cKO mice. Thus, these data raise further questions about the specificity of recombination in these mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript &quot;Oligodendrocytes regulate presynaptic properties and neurotransmission through BDNF signaling&quot; is a revision in response to previous comments. In this revision, they have performed new experiments and reanalyzed data. They have performed FACS and isolated oligodendrocytes to demonstrate that BDNF mRNA is knocked down specifically in oligodendrocytes in the BDNF cKO animal. They examined the loss of BDNF on calyx MNTB synaptic transmission and morphology at two developmental times point before hearing P10-12 calyces, and mature calyces P16-20. There data demonstrates that loss of BDNF impacts RRP size and release kinetics and presynaptic ultrastructure in a similar manner at both developmental time points. The authors have redone IV experiments and demonstrate that lack of BDNF does not impact calyx Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents. Finally, they have analyzed RRP pool estimates using SMN plot in addition to their original EQ plots. These new data and analysis in addition to their previous novel findings on allows the authors to draw clear mechanistic conclusions on how oligodendrocytes BDNF signaling regulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release. These data are significant and represent a significant advancement in our understanding of synaptic plasticity. However, there are a few minor points in regards figures and data that the authors should correct and consider to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) In general, for all bar graphs it would be ideal if the authors also provided a dot plot on top of the bar graphs. This would allow the reader to get an idea of the distribution of the date for the experiments.</p><p>2) In Figure 2 it would be ideal to also report the release probability measurements as determined by EQ plot measurement. Please report release probability measurements for EQ and SMN in Figure 6.</p><p>3) Figure 3 graphs appear to be missing the 3ms data point on all Panel B and Panel D. There are 5 measurements corresponding to the different depolarization times but only 4 data points on these graphs. In addition, in Panel F of the IV data it appears there is a shift in voltage dependence of activation. There is a lot of variance at the -40 mV point but the mean looks different. The authors should make a simple statement to address this potential issue as it could be due to differences in voltage clamp.</p><p>4) Figure 5 appears to be missing plotted IV data. In fact, I am confused by these traces. In the figure legend, it states traces showing 100 ms depolarizations from -80 mV to 0 mV. But there is no panel lettering to these traces.</p><p>5) Figure 7 is missing representative EM images from the immature calyx synapse. They need to be added.</p><p>6) Figure 7—figure supplement 1 is missing. Also, the volumetric data on the P20-25 calyces that was included in the previous version of the manuscript is now missing.</p><p>6) Figure 9.

The effects on glutamate release are profound and well described through paired recordings and anatomical studies. The primary limitation of the study is that one mouse line, Cnp-Cre, was used to alter BDNF levels in oligodendrocytes. Because there is concern about the specificity of recombination in this mouse line, the study would be stronger if a subset of the effects were also assessed in a second oligodendrocyte specific Cre line. The authors did not include a reporter in the Cnp-Cre x Bdnfflox/flox cross to allow assessment of BDNF levels in the recombined cells and the selectivity of the recombination, instead relying on the surface antigen O1 for isolation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells for subsequent qPCR analysis. The authors show that samples enriched in oligodendrocyte lineage cells (O1+) have detectable <italic>bdnf</italic> mRNA by qPCR and that this level is reduced in the cKO mice. Although there is a trend towards lower <italic>bdnf</italic> mRNA in the O1- fraction, the value was not significantly lower (n=3). However, they did not specifically measure whether <italic>bdnf</italic> was lower in neurons (the O1- population presumably contains other cells, such as astrocytes which could mask any effects on neuron <italic>bdnf</italic> levels, as levels are typically higher in those cells). In addition, there is no quantification of BDNF protein in oligodendrocytes at this age, and no immuno-localization or in situ hybridization indicating the presence of BDNF protein or <italic>bdnf</italic> mRNA message in oligodendrocytes in this region. The authors find a small proportion of neurons in the brainstem exhibit evidence of recombination in this mouse line, and recombination outside the oligodendrocyte lineage (e.g. Schwann cells, immune cells) in Cnp-Cre mice has been described by others. This is significant, because BDNF levels are much higher in neurons than oligodendrocytes in cortical regions, although to our knowledge this hasn't been explored in the brainstem at this developmental stage. As BDNF is a secreted protein, any reduction in other cells could therefore contribute to the effects observed. At a minimum, the authors need to thoroughly address these limitations in the Discussion.</p><p>Additional concerns:</p><p>1) All data points should be added to the histograms, so that the readers can assess the distribution of values from individual experiments.</p><p>2) It would be helpful if the authors determined the identity of the tdTomato+ cells in Figure 5—figure supplement 1G by immunostaining.</p><p>3) There are numerous typographical errors that need to be corrected (e.g. Figure 5—figure supplement 1 – &quot;Nuen&quot;), the labels in some panels are unclear, and some formatting is off (e.g. Figure 5—figure supplement 2D). Throughout the study the authors used GCaMP6F as a reporter to show the specificity of recombination in the CNP-Cre line, but indicate &quot;GFP&quot; or GCaMP6f-GFP in the graphs and panels. This needs to be corrected throughout, for example, by indicating anti-GFP when indicating the antibody (rather than the protein) or GCaMP6F when indicating the protein.</p><p>4) The qPCR primer design should be changed so that the primers span across exons to reduce the possibility of genomic signal contamination.</p><p>5) The species should be indicated in the title.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42156.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>All reviewers commented on the importance of understanding the interactions between oligodendrocytes and axons during development and the skill with which the physiological studies were carried out.

We examine two different age groups from control and <italic>Bdnf</italic> cKO mice: Immature calyx synapses at P10-12 before hearing, and mature calyx synapse at P16-20 after hearing onset. At both time points, we examine presynaptic structural alterations with ultra-structural analysis using EM, and synaptic functions with EPSC recordings using whole-cell patch-clamp from each genotypes. At P10-12, before hearing onset, presynaptic recordings and EPSC recordings clearly demonstrate a reduction in vesicular neurotransmitter release in <italic>Bdnf</italic> cKO mice, and EM analysis shows that the number of docked vesicles is decreased in cKO mice. At P16-20, after hearing onset, EPSC recordings also show a reduction of vesicular neurotransmitter release in cKO mice, and EM analysis reveals that the number of docked vesicles is decreased in cKO mice. The EPSC and EM data are consistent between the two time points. Thus, we demonstrate that cKO continue to show altered synaptic function after hearing onset. These studies consistently show that OL-driven BDNF critically impacts mobilization of glutamate vesicles to the active zone to form the RRP during postnatal development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And the veracity of the conclusions based on the analysis, in particular the voltage-dependence of Ca channels and the estimates of RRP.</p></disp-quote><p>As recommended in the reviewers’ comments, we re-analyze the voltage-dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel currents and revise the <italic>I-V</italic> curve in the calyx terminals from WT, <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, control, and BDNF cKO mice using whole-cell voltage clamp with a lower series resistance (&lt;20 MOhm before compensation and &lt;10 MOhm after compensation) and analyze them after leak subtraction using HEKA EPC10 and Patchmaster.

It is crucial for the interpretation that they demonstrate both the selectivity and efficiency of gene deletion. Figure 5—figure supplement 1 evaluates co-localization between tdTomato and Olig1, which is used as a marker for oligodendrocytes. While there is some co-localization between Olig1 and tdTomato in panel A, many of the Olig1+ cells are not tdTomoto immunoreactive, and there appears to be widespread expression of tdTomato in vascular cells (perhaps pericytes). These panels are labeled as &quot;CNPase&quot;, however they appear to show the distribution of tdTomato, as an indication of which cells experienced Cre dependent recombination. It is unusual to use Olig1 as a marker for oligodendrocyte cell bodies, rather than CNPase, CC1, or GSTPi, as Olig1 is expressed by other glial cells. The promiscuous expression of tdTomato in these mice raise concerns about specificity of the recombination, which is an issue, given the widespread expression of BDNF (see Figure 1). In addition, they have not provided evidence that this manipulation resulted in depletion of bdnf from oligodendrocytes. The standard experiment would be to isolate oligodendrocytes in this region by FACS and then perform qPCR to show that the mRNA is no longer detected. Immunolabeling for BDNF with the markers described above would unlikely to be sufficient, unless the co-localization were unambiguous.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we added new data to confirm that Cre-dependent recombination in <italic>CNPCre</italic> mice is specific to OLs (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). In addition, we perform FACS to isolate O1+ OLs and utilize qPCR to show the level of BDNF mRNA in OLs, as reviewer’s suggested. O1 is a commonly used marker for OLs and recognizes galactocerebroside. O1 recognizes an external epitope that enables FACS with live stained cells. To validate that we successfully isolated OLs, we compared the relative gene expression of Olig2 in the O1- and O1+ fraction from control mice. The O1+ fraction has Olig2 levels that were 6.73x greater than the O1- fraction (O1- = 100.1 ± 5.2, O1+ = 673.3 ± 17.6, p&lt;0.0001, n = 3 mice). BDNF RNA is detected in the O1+ OLs isolated from control mice (mean cycle threshold (CT) = 27.8 ± 0.08, n = 3 mice). Importantly, BDNF levels in the O1+ fraction of <italic>Bdnf</italic> cKO mice are significantly reduced compared to control mice (Control = 33.4 ± 8.4 vs. cKO = 14.67 ± 0.6, p = 0.0054, n = 3 mice/genotype).

There are numerous reports that BDNF signaling through TrkB alters progenitor dynamics and the process of myelination. If myelination is altered, it could affect activity propagating along GBC axons and therefore maturation of their terminals. It is possible that there is sufficient BDNF coming from other sources to compensate, but if that is true, why don't these other sources compensate for the loss of oligodendrocyte-derived bdnf?</p></disp-quote><p>This manuscript addresses the role of OL-driven BDNF in synaptic transmission. We are studying the effect of BDNF on myelination in the auditory nervous system in another project.

However, the choice of age group for different experiments is quite confusing. For example, patch-clamp recordings of EPSCs were from P16-20 mice (mature or nearly mature synapses); immunofluorescence labeling and EM were done in P20-25 mice; and calcium currents and capacitance measurements were done in P9-13 mice (immature synapses). Given that dramatic changes in presynaptic spike waveform, calcium channel-SV coupling distance and morphological remodeling all occur during this period, it is difficult to discern if oligodendrocyte derived BDNF is specifically important for developmental remodeling of immature synapses and/or synaptic signaling in mature synapses. It would impart readers with more confidence if the authors can show the results from the experiments in parallel age groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive comments.

We compared the data from postsynaptic EPSC recordings, presynaptic capacitance measurements, and EM in the immature calyx synapse (at P10-P12), and we demonstrated EPSC recordings and EM at the mature calyx synapse (at P16-P20) in parallel. The data from both EPSC recordings and EM indicate a sustained effect of reduced OL BDNF at P16-P20. Taken together, OL-derived BDNF regulates presynaptic RRP in both the immature and mature synapses.

In Baydyuk et al., 2015, the authors show BNDF and TrkB expression in calyces using BDNF and TrkB knock-in mouse strains, but BDNF and TrkB expression were not shown in WT animals. However, all electrophysiological experiments had been done in the brainstem of Wistar rats. Thus BDNF effects could be influenced by species or strain of experimental animals. Another possibility is the BDNF application method influences the results as acute exposure likely differs from in vivo knockout. In our current study, we detected TrkB signals from calyces in both control and cKO mice in the same tissue used for electrophysiology. BDNF expression was detected in OLs as well as MNTB neurons in control, whereas OL BDNF expression was significantly reduced in cKO mice. We added BDNF and TrkB immunostaining in the MNTB from control and cKO mice to the manuscript (Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the capacitance jump experiments, it was stated that there is no difference in the basal membrane capacitance between WT and BDNF(+/-) calyces (Figure 3), but the calyx volume is significantly smaller in morphological analyses (Figure 6).

It is puzzling in fact that BDNF is not doing anything to postsynaptic neurons with much more abundant TrkB expression to detect BDNF than presynaptic terminals. It is probably too hasty to rule out the role of BDNF in postsynaptic signaling at this stage.</p></disp-quote><p>It is well known that BDNF regulates neuronal survival and growth in the developing brain. Thus BDNF could be involved in postsynaptic modulation and cellular signaling. In this study, we focus on studying the role of oligodendroglial BDNF in presynaptic properties and neurotransmitter release. In our exclusive experimental design using the <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/-</sup> or cKO mice, we did not observe postsynaptic alterations although we could not rule out the role of BDNF in postsynaptic signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) The mechanism by which BDNF rescues the RRP is unclear. The authors clearly show that with their capacitance measurements there is a reduction in the readily releasable pool at the calyx and that this can be rescued by application of BDNF. In addition, in the absence of BDNF their EM data clearly demonstrates a reduction in docked SV. Therefore, two possible interpretations can be made. Either each calyx contains the same number of active zones (AZs), but in the absence of each AZ has less docked SVs or absence of BDNF during development results in a reduction in the number of AZs. In both cases application of BDNF would result in an increase of docked SVs which would result in an increase on the RRP. The authors should show with EM that BDNF rescues the docking defect seen. In addition, the authors should carry out nonstationary EPSC variance analysis to determine the number of functional AZs in the presence and absence of BDNF.</p></disp-quote><p>As it was mentioned above, we added new data for the rescue of the docking deficit using EM, which show that the TrkB agonist (7,8-DHF) rescues the deficit in docked vesicles at the calyx terminal shown in cKO mice (Figure 7). We did not include the number of AZs in this manuscript, and mentioned the possibility of changes in the number of AZs in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data concerning BDNF effects on the voltage dependence of activation on Calcium channels is not convincing. These measurements are highly dependent on the pipette series resistance in whole cell voltage clamp. There is no mention of the pipette series resistance during the actual recordings. Based on the example traces presented there appears to be differences in the tail current decay between WT and BDNF<sup>+/-</sup>. This could be due to differences in the quality of the voltage clamp or that reductions in BDNF do impact tail currents. In addition, it is not known if a leak subtraction protocol was performed. The authors should redo their IV analysis with better lower residual patch clamp pipette resistance. Furthermore, they should perform the IV analysis in 1.0 mM external Ca<sup>2+</sup> to also offset potential issues with voltage clamp quality.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revision, we re-examined the voltage-dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel currents in the calyx terminals from WT, <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, control, and <italic>Bdnf</italic> cKO in whole-cell voltage clamp with a lower series resistance and re-analyzed them after leak subtraction using the “traditional” p/4 stimulus train in EPC10-Patchmaster. We addressed the series resistance during the recordings in the Materials and methods; the series resistance was 15 ± 3.1 MOhm before compensation (n=10), adjusted to &lt;10 MOhm after compensation of ~ 50%. When the patch recordings maintain a lower series resistance to avoid potential issues with voltage clamp quality, there is no difference in the voltage dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels between WT and <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. The <italic>I</italic>-V curve was newly updated in Figure 3. We added the newly analyzed data and representative traces in Figures 3 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors demonstrate a reduction in AP evoked release and RRP as defined trains of APs at 100 Hz. It has been well established at the age groups p9-11 that a 3ms step depolarization corresponds to the RRP that can be released by action potentials. In Figure 5 which utilized p9-13, there appears to be no difference between the amount of exocytosis with a 2ms step pulse. Therefore, it is unclear why there is a dramatic effect in the AP RRP measurement and RRP as measured by the step depolarizations. It would be helpful if the authors did a 3ms Cm measurement to directly compare. Additionally, the authors should compare data collected at P9-11 vs P12-13 as mice begin to hear at P12. To accurate determine effects on BDNF regulation of the calyx RRP paired recordings at P9-11 would be ideal but not critical to their interpretations. Finally, why did they not carry out fiber stimulation at this age group too?</p></disp-quote><p>We added data with the 3 ms step pulse at P9-12 in Figure 5. In control, 2- and 3-ms depolarizing pulses induced a capacitance jump (ΔC<sub>m</sub>) of 51 ± 8.6 fF and 72 ± 16.5 fF, n=12, respectively, which are comparable to those in age-matched mouse calyces, previously describe in Lin and Taschenberger, 2011. In <italic>Bdnf</italic> cKO calyces, ΔC<sub>m</sub> in response to 2-ms depolarization was difficult to resolve, and 3-ms depolarization induced a ΔC<sub>m</sub> of 27 ± 10.5 fF, n=10. A longer depolarization induced a larger ΔC<sub>m</sub>, and pulse durations &gt; 40 ms exhibited saturation of ΔC<sub>m</sub> in both control and cKO calyces (Figure 5E, Lin et al., 2011).</p><p>For the fiber stimulation, we added new data for evoked EPSCs in immature (P10-12, before hearing onset) and mature (P16-20, after hearing onset, Figure 6) MNTB neurons from control and cKO mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The calyx of Held goes through structural changes after hearing onset. The volumetric reconstruction of the P20-25 age group revealed significant reductions in calyx volume. However, the Capacitance measurements revealed no change in calyx volume as measured as pF. However, this comes from a different age group compared to the group in volume reconstructions. I am more inclined to trust the volumetric reconstructions since it is very difficult to accurately determine the calyx size with the patch clamp experiments. The authors should carry out volumetric reconstructions as the same age group or measure the calyx volume via a capacitance measurement in the P20-25 age group. Otherwise it is difficult to know why there is such a difference between the two measurements of calyx volume.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer’s thoughtful comments. The volumetric reconstruction from P10-12 calyces after presynaptic capacitance measurement was reanalyzed. There was no difference in the membrane capacitance and the volume of the calyx from 3D reconstruction between control and cKO (at P10-12). The volume of the calyx terminal was not significantly different in <italic>Bdnf</italic> cKO mice (1,378 ± 143.7 mm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 7 for control and 1,199 ± 146 mm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 6 for <italic>Bdnf</italic> cKO;<italic>P</italic> = 0.3308, Figure 7—figure supplement 1).

However, the additional data provided to address concerns about the specificity of recombination in CNPase mice are not sufficient.</p><p>1) In Figure 5—figure supplement 1, the authors show immunostaining for NeuN, GFAP, Pdgfra, CC1 and GFP to assess which cell types exhibit recombination. In these panels, GFP refers to GCaMP6f in CNPase-Cre x R26-lsl-GCaMP6f mice. There is diffuse GFP immunoreactivity throughout the GFP panels that is unaccounted for and unexpected if expression were restricted to oligodendrocytes. In addition, these images reveal intense regions of GFP immunoreactivity that co-localize with NeuN (cell in the center left of panel A) and co-localize with Pdgfra (panel C). Perhaps most significantly, in the GFP image of panel C there are several long processes and one cell body (center left) that is much larger than one would expect for an oligodendrocyte. For some reason, although this cell looks like a neuron, it also exhibits weak immunoreactivity to CC1. However, the CC1 immunoreactivity in panel C is very unusual, with several long processes visible (this is not normally observed with CC1 – see panel B) and many of the CC1+ cell bodies have unusual morphologies. Since orthogonal projections are not shown in this figure, it is difficult to assess whether labeling patterns show proximity or true co-localization. Thus, these immunostaining data to not provide strong support for the conclusion that CNPase-Cre mice exhibit selective recombination in oligodendrocytes. A minor point, in the figure legend, the mice are referred to as &quot;CNPase-GCaMP6f-GFP mice&quot;. Please indicate the exact genotype of the mice for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the concerns about the immunohistochemical analysis we have added a new representative image with orthogonal views orthogonal views to aid in the visualization of the colocalized cells. In addition we added quantitative analysis of co-localization using two different neuronal markers (NeuN and Map2) and two reporter lines (GCaMP6f and tdTomato reporter lines). The quantitative analysis demonstrates that &gt;97% of the recombined cells are OLs with a very small portion of neurons showing positive staining (&lt; 3%, See <italic>the Figure 5—figure supplement 1</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors also perform PCR analysis on isolated cells to determine the specificity of recombination. However, no experimental details are provided for the FACS and PCR analysis shown in Figure 5. There is insufficient information provided that the isolation procedure was able to isolate a representative population of cells from the brainstem (astrocytes, neurons, oligos, etc.). Procedures used to preserve glia often result in widespread death of neurons, so it is important to assess what types of cells are in this pool.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional qPCR analysis to include the neuronal marker, Kcc2. There is no reduction of the Kcc2 in sorted neuronal populations. Experimental details have been added to the Materials and methods section. We carefully verified the isolated cells. Isolated cells from <italic>Cnp<sup>cre+/-</sup></italic>; GCAMP6f-GFP+ cells versus GFP- cells demonstrated an enrichment of Olig2 RNA quantified by qPCR. Kcc2, was depleted from the GFP+ population, indicating that GFP+ cells are Olig2+ and Kcc2 negative OLs (see <italic>the Figure 5—figure supplement 2</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The criteria used to determine positive versus negative O1 cells in Figure 5—figure supplement 2A is not indicated. From the second panel in A, it looks like there is a clear break between the blue/magenta cells and the green cells. However only the O1+ cells that exhibited the highest immunoreactivity were selected for the PCR analysis. This analysis should be repeated by including the blue cells, to provide a more representative sample of the population. It is unclear why GFP was not used to isolate cells in this example, as this would provide a more direct assessment of what types of cells experienced cre-dependent recombination. Because there is concern about neuronal recombination, neurons from this region should be isolated and GFP and BDNF expression assessed selectively in this pool.</p></disp-quote><p>The selection of the positive population in FACS was performed using scatter, histogram analysis, and the expertise of the FACS CORE. We have added data from <italic>Cnp<sup>cre</sup></italic>: R26-lsl-GCaMP6f mice that demonstrate an enrichment of Olig2 in the GFP+ cells and an absence of Kcc2. We have not yet crossed these mice with the <italic>Bdnf <sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>, thus do not provide data from those mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors indicate that &gt;27 cycles were necessary to detect BDNF message in the O1+ population. 27 cycles is typically used as a cutoff, with any product observed with more cycles being attributed to noise/non-specific amplification. This suggests that the amount of BDNF in O1+ cells is at the limit, or below the limit, of detection. Although more cycles were required to detect a product in the cKO O1+ cells, confidence in these data are low for this reason.</p></disp-quote><p>We demonstrate that the <italic>Bdnf</italic> primers detect a reduction in <italic>Bdnf</italic> RNA and thus are specific using <italic>Bdnf</italic> heterozygous mice compared to littermate controls. We show that the <italic>Bdnf</italic> primers linearly amplify even with low amounts of input RNA and cycles &gt;27, indicating that the <italic>Bdnf</italic> primers can detect differences in RNA within the CT range observed in these studies (see the Materials and methods section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 5—figure supplement 2D immunostaining is performed in the cKO mice. The panels show that BDNF immunoreactivity is somewhat lower in O1+ cells in the cKO mice. As a constitutive cre was used, it is surprising that BDNF expression was not abolished. It also appears that BDNF immunoreactivity is also lower in neurons in the cKO mice. Thus, these data raise further questions about the specificity of recombination in these mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to concerns about the specificity of the BDNF antibody, we have removed the immunostaining.

In addition, in Panel F of the IV data it appears there is a shift in voltage dependence of activation. There is a lot of variance at the -40 mV point but the mean looks different.

The effects on glutamate release are profound and well described through paired recordings and anatomical studies. The primary limitation of the study is that one mouse line, Cnp-Cre, was used to alter BDNF levels in oligodendrocytes. Because there is concern about the specificity of recombination in this mouse line, the study would be stronger if a subset of the effects were also assessed in a second oligodendrocyte specific Cre line.</p></disp-quote><p>We recently established a second <italic>Bdnf</italic> cKO mouse (<italic>Sox10-</italic>creER: <italic>Bdnf</italic><sup>f/f</sup>) using a second oligodendrocyte-specific Cre line (Sox10-creER mice, provided by Dr. Shin Kang, Temple University).

The authors show that samples enriched in oligodendrocyte lineage cells (O1+) have detectable bdnf mRNA by qPCR and that this level is reduced in the cKO mice. Although there is a trend towards lower bdnf mRNA in the O1- fraction, the value was not significantly lower (n=3).

The authors find a small proportion of neurons in the brainstem exhibit evidence of recombination in this mouse line, and recombination outside the oligodendrocyte lineage (e.g. Schwann cells, immune cells) in Cnp-Cre mice has been described by others. This is significant, because BDNF levels are much higher in neurons than oligodendrocytes in cortical regions, although to our knowledge this hasn't been explored in the brainstem at this developmental stage. As BDNF is a secreted protein, any reduction in other cells could therefore contribute to the effects observed.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results showed the presence of BDNF in oligodendrocytes in the MNTB of the mouse brainstem during early postnatal development. ~ 50% of Olig1+ oligodendrocytes were positive for BDNF immunostaining (Figure 1A). Using FACS and qPCR, we demonstrated that O1+ cells have detectable <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA, which was significantly reduced in <italic>Bdnf</italic> cKO mice. In addition, GCaMP6f-GFP+ cells also showed a substantial amount of <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA in control, which was significantly reduced in <italic>Bdnf</italic> cKO mice (newly added to Figure 5—figure supplement 2).

The sorting likely did not completely isolate the oligodendrocytes and the remaining population could contribute to the slight reduction in <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA. Another possibility is the small percentage of neurons that are affected is contributing to this trend. However, it is unlikely that BDNF reduction in &lt;5% neurons have a global and major impact on the synaptic function in the MNTB. Due to the biochemical nature of BDNF, it is thought to act locally at the synapse with limited diffusion (Sasi, 2017). The effect of BDNF within a synapse has been observed to occur with the low micrometer range (within a distance of 4.5 µm, Horch, 2002). Thus, BDNF reduction in the small portion of neurons (&lt;5%) may not critically contribute to the synaptic phenotype observed in the cKO. We interpret that functional alterations of the calyx synapse were caused by the loss of BDNF in oligodendrocytes, which constitute the majority of CNP-expressing cells.
