unclear. Here, we report that <italic>Rice dwarf virus</italic> (RDV) triggers ethylene production by stimulating the activity of S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase (SAMS), a key component of the ethylene synthesis pathway, resulting in elevated susceptibility to RDV. RDV-encoded Pns11 protein specifically interacted with OsSAMS1 to enhance its enzymatic activity, leading to higher ethylene levels in both RDV-infected and Pns11-overexpressing rice. Consistent with a counter-defense role for ethylene, Pns11-overexpressing rice, as well as those overexpressing <italic>OsSAMS1</italic>, were substantially more susceptible to RDV infection, and a similar effect was observed in rice plants treated with an ethylene precursor. Conversely, <italic>OsSAMS1-</italic>knockout mutants, as well as an <italic>osein2</italic> mutant defective in ethylene signaling, resisted RDV infection more robustly. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism which RDV manipulates ethylene biosynthesis in the host plants to achieve efficient infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27529.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rice provides food for billions of people all over the world, but diseases caused by plant-infecting viruses cause serious risks to the production of rice. As a result, there is an urgent demand for developing new and impactful ways to help defend rice plants from harmful viruses. Toward this goal, it will be important to better understand how viruses actually cause diseases in plants.</p><p>Plants make chemicals known as hormones to control their own development, and hormone production is often disturbed when viruses infect rice plants. Many viruses cause infected plants to make more of a gaseous hormone called ethylene, which benefits the viruses. Yet, it is still not known how virus infection induces the production of more ethylene.</p><p>Zhao, Hong et al. have exposed rice plants to infection with a virus called rice dwarf virus. Infected plants made more ethylene than normal, which did indeed help the virus to infect. Further experiments then showed that an enzyme that makes one of the building blocks needed to produce ethylene became more active after infection with this virus. Next, Zhao, Hong et al. engineered rice plants to make more or less of this building block – which is known as S-adenosyl-L-methionine or SAM for short. Plants with too much SAM were less able to defend themselves against the virus, while plants that lacked SAM were better able to fight off viral infection.</p><p>Zhao, Hong et al. suggest that engineering rice plants to make less of the SAM-producing enzyme could make them more resistant to viruses. Further work will also be needed to find out why ethylene benefits viral infection, and to confirm whether ethylene also performs similar roles when rice is infected with other viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Oryza sativa</kwd><kwd>rice virus</kwd><kwd>RDV</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31530062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31420103904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Basic Research Program 973, 2014CB138400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004573</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Transgenic Research Program 2016ZX08010-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rice dwarf virus Pns11 protein increases rice susceptibility to virus infection by enhancing OsSAMS1 enzymatic activity and ethylene production.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice is a staple food crop in many regions, a model monocot plant for research, and a host to many viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2017</xref>).

RDV is transovarially transmitted by the green rice leafhopper (<italic>Nephotettix cincticeps</italic>) in a persistent-propagative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wei and Li, 2016</xref>). RDV infection greatly inhibits rice growth and causes severe symptoms including dwarfism, increased tillering, and white chlorotic specks and dark-green discoloration on the leaves. RDV has a double-stranded RNA genome consisting of 12 segments (<italic>S1</italic> to <italic>S12</italic>). Seven segments, <italic>S1</italic>, <italic>S2</italic>, <italic>S3</italic>, <italic>S5</italic>, <italic>S7</italic>, <italic>S8</italic>, and <italic>S9</italic>, encode structural proteins P1, P2, P3, P5, P7, P8, and P9, respectively, which form double-layered virions; the remaining segments, <italic>S4</italic>, <italic>S6</italic>, <italic>S10</italic>, <italic>S11</italic>, and <italic>S12,</italic> encode the nonstructural proteins Pns4, Pns6, Pns10, Pns11, and Pns12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wei and Li, 2016</xref>).</p><p>To survive under the continuous threat of viral infection, plants have evolved multiple defense mechanisms that are activated via different signal transduction pathways. The intensively studied pathways, based on dicot model plants, include nucleotide-binding-site leucine-rich-repeat dominant resistance genes (<italic>R</italic>-genes), recessive resistance genes (eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs)), RNA interference (RNAi) antiviral immunity, and phytohormone-mediated resistance pathways; these pathways interact synergistically or antagonistically and result in a highly complex three-dimensional defense signaling network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kasschau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baulcombe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soosaar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Endres et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mandadi and Scholthof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nicaise, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carbonell and Carrington, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collum and Culver, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). As a counter-defense, plant viruses often manipulate plant responses for their own benefit. For example, viruses have evolved strategies to target hormone pathways, often exploiting the antagonistic interactions mediated by phytohormones such as salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soosaar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broekaert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pieterse et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Santner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denancé et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mandadi and Scholthof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alazem and Lin, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The gaseous phytohormone ethylene functions in seed germination and organ senescence, as well as in the response of plants to abiotic and biotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broekaert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Loon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alazem and Lin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kazan, 2015</xref>). However, the functions of ethylene in the plant response to viral infection remain poorly understood. Previous studies found that ethylene could modulate host defense in both positive and negative manners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Knoester et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Love et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pieterse et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Santner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casteel et al., 2015</xref>). The P6 protein encoded by <italic>Cauliflower mosaic virus</italic> (CaMV) was found to interact with components of the ethylene-signaling pathway, and transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> expressing P6 became less responsive to ethylene treatment and more resistant to CaMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geri et al., 2004</xref>). Another study used <italic>ein2</italic> (<italic>ethylene insensitive 2</italic>) and <italic>etr1</italic> (<italic>ethylene response 1</italic>) mutants and found that the ethylene-signaling pathway is required for <italic>Turnip mosaic virus</italic> (TuMV)-mediated suppression of resistance to the green aphid, <italic>Myzus persicae,</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> and that TuMV may modulate ethylene responses to increase plant susceptibility to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casteel et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al. (2013b)</xref> reported that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants with mutations of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway, such as <italic>acs1</italic> (<italic>1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase</italic>), <italic>erf106</italic> (<italic>ethylene responsive transcription factor 106</italic>), and <italic>ein2</italic>, were resistant to <italic>Tobacco mosaic virus</italic> (TMVcg). Exogenous application of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC, a precursor in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway) enhanced TMVcg accumulation in the infected plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013a</xref>). By contrast, ethylene signaling was shown to be essential for systemic resistance to <italic>Chilli veinal mottle virus</italic> in tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the molecular mechanisms by which ethylene affects host defenses and counter-defenses remain unclear.</p><p>In plants, S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase (SAMS) [EC 2.5.1.6] catalyzes the conversion of L-methionine (L-Met) and ATP into S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet, SAM), which serves as a precursor of ethylene and polyamines. The SAMS enzyme is induced by biotic and abiotic stress and is involved in the regulation of development through the histone and DNA methylation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roje, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that RDV infection perturbed the expression of several ethylene-response genes such as ERFs (Ethylene Response Factors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Satoh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abiri et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that ethylene is involved in the interaction between RDV and rice. However, it is unclear how the ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathway functions in this interaction.</p><p>In the current study, we report that the RDV-encoded non-structural protein Pns11 enhances rice susceptibility to RDV by interacting with OsSAMS1, enhancing its enzymatic activity and leading to increasing production of SAM, ACC, and ethylene. As SAMS and ethylene are key regulators of many biological processes, the capability of RDV-encoded Pns11 to interact specifically with OsSAMS1 and to regulate the ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathway may represent a novel mechanism by which RDV maximizes its own infection. This study provides a novel mechanism through which ethylene biosynthesis and signaling respond to viral infection. These findings significantly broaden our knowledge of virus–host interactions and provide novel targets for engineered resistance to viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overexpression of Pns11 in rice enhances susceptibility to RDV infection</title><p>RDV-encoded Pns11 protein was previously found to function as a component of viroplasms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wei et al., 2006</xref>).

To elucidate the mechanism behind this, we tried to identify rice factors that interact with Pns11 by conducting a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rice cDNA library, with RDV-encoded Pns11 as the bait. This screen identified OsSAMS1 as a strong interaction partner of Pns11.

This set of experiments confirmed the highly specific interaction between Pns11 and OsSAMS1. We further verified this interaction using a firefly luciferase (LUC) complementation imaging assay. Constructs encoding Pns11 fused with the N-terminus of LUC (Pns11-nLUC) and the C-terminus of LUC fused with OsSAMS1 (cLUC-OsSAMS1) were co-infiltrated into <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves for transient co-expression of these two fusion proteins.

Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis also demonstrated that Pns11 and OsSAMS1 interacted and were co-localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, our data strongly suggest that Pns11 specifically interacts with OsSAMS1 in <italic>vitro</italic> and in <italic>vivo</italic>.</p><p>To evaluate the biological significance of this specific interaction, we tested the level of OsSAMS1 in <italic>S11</italic> OX lines. We used <italic>S11</italic> OX rice tissues at three stages (5-leaf, 6-leaf, and 10-leaf stage) for real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) measurements and western blot. The <italic>OsSAMS1</italic> mRNA and OsSAMS1 protein level did not change in response to Pns11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). We then designed an assay to detect the enzymatic activity of OsSAMS1 in <italic>vitro</italic>. SAMS catalyzes the two-step reaction that produces SAM, pyrophosphate (PPi), and orthophosphate (Pi) from ATP and L-Met (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Pns11 fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) (MBP-Pns11) and OsSAMS1 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-OsSAMS1) were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 cells and partially purified. To rule out the effect of the tags, the GST tag was cleaved to obtain pure OsSAMS1. For unknown reasons, the yield of Pns11 was extremely low if the MBP tag was removed. Therefore, we used MBP-GFP and MBP-P9 (a structural protein of RDV), which did not interact with OsSAMS1, as negative controls; we also used OsSAMS2, which did not interact with Pns11, as another negative control. The addition of L-[<sup>35</sup>S]-Met mimics the natural substrate and allowed us to quantify the enzymatic activity of OsSAMS1 by measuring the amount of labeled SAM produced. OsSAMS1 was pre-incubated for 20 min with varying amounts of Pns11 (no Pns11 to a six-fold molar excess of Pns11:OsSAMS1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Solutions containing ATP, L-[<sup>35</sup>S]-Met, KCl, and MgCl<sub>2</sub> were then added to the reaction mixtures and the reactions were allowed to proceed for another 20 min at 30°C. The reaction was blocked by the addition of EDTA. A reaction with excess OsSAMS1 and no Pns11 was used to label the location of the SAM, another reaction lacking OsSAMS1 and Pns11 was used to label the location of free L-[<sup>35</sup>S]-Met. Production of SAM and the remaining L-[<sup>35</sup>S]-Met were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The enzymatic activity of OsSAMS1 was enhanced by nearly 60% at a 6:1 molar ratio of Pns11:OsSAMS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In the two negative control reactions with the same molar ratio of Pns11:OsSAMS1, neither P9 nor GFP affected OsSAMS1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, Pns11 did not affect OsSAMS2 enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

During biotic stress, ethylene is mainly responsible for defense against necrotrophic pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pieterse et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broekgaarden et al., 2015</xref>) and plays a dual role in the plant defense signaling pathway. In some cases, ethylene is used by pathogens as a virulence factor to enhance pathogenesis, whereas in other cases, ethylene aids in the alleviation of stress. Generally, the plant defense responses regulated by ethylene depend on the specific host-pathogen interaction and the crosstalk between multiple signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broekaert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Loon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denancé et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alazem and Lin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang, 2015</xref>).

Expression of the <italic>SAMS</italic> gene is induced by a number of biotic and abiotic stresses and confers increased tolerance to various stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawalleck et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boerjan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gómez-Gómez and Carrasco, 1998</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>SAMS</italic> genes in plants alters development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boerjan et al., 1994</xref>) and confers increased tolerance to abiotic stress. Knockdown of <italic>SAMS</italic> genes affects plant development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boerjan et al., 1994</xref>), leading to late flowering and abnormal methylation in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2011</xref>), and is also related to viral RNA stabilization and accumulation in <italic>N. benthamiana (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ivanov et al., 2016</xref>). We found that knockdown or knockout of <italic>OsSAMS1</italic> resulted in abnormal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These studies indicate that SAMS is a broad-spectrum signaling molecule that regulates plant responses to various stresses. SAM acts as the precursor in the biosynthesis of polyamines (PAs) and ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roje, 2006</xref>). The involvement of PAs and their metabolism in defense responses against diverse viruses has also been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitsuya et al., 2009</xref>). We provide strong evidence that RDV infection activates OsSAMS1 and increases the production of SAM and ethylene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), and that disruption of the ethylene signaling pathway enhances rice tolerance to RDV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). GO analysis of our RNA-seq data also showed that the class of ethylene-activated pathway genes were highly enriched in both RDV-infected and <italic>OsSAMS1</italic> OX transgenic rice, and that knockout of <italic>Ossams1</italic> significantly affected the ethylene biosynthetic process. Interestingly, although genes in the hormone-mediated signaling pathway category were enriched in <italic>S11</italic> OX transgenic lines, those in the ethylene-activated pathway were not. This is consistent with the observation that Pns11 overexpression enhances OsSAMS1 activity without upregulating its mRNA. In addition, relative to the Pns11 expression level in RDV infection, the transgenically expressed Pns11 level in <italic>S11</italic> OX lines was probably low and insufficient to induce significant changes in ethylene pathway genes. Results from early microarray analyses and our RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Satoh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Do et al., 2013</xref>) showed no obvious changes in the polyamine pathway in RDV-infected rice compared to the control. These results indicated that the ethylene pathway regulated by Pns11 and OsSAMS1 interaction may be the major determinant of RDV pathogenesis, but an additional mechanism involving other RDV proteins cannot be ruled out at this point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that Pns11 enhances OsSAMS1 activity in <italic>vitro</italic> and in <italic>vivo</italic>, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. A previous study suggested that enhanced substrate affinity may increase enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Toroser et al., 1999</xref>); but we found that Pns11 did not alter the affinity of OsSAMS1 to the substrate L-Met or ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Crystal structures of SAMS have been elucidated from other non-plant organisms, and SAMS isoenzymes appear as homotetramers, dimers, or heterooligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Markham and Pajares, 2009</xref>). Although the crystal structure of plant SAMS has not been reported to date, the high sequence similarity of plant SAMS to the known SAMS sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2013</xref>) suggests that OsSAMS1 may function as dimers or tetramers. We found that OsSAMS1 exists in a high molecular weight form in RDV-infected rice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>), and we propose that the interaction of Pns11 with OsSAMS1 may promote oligomerization of OsSAMS1 to the most active form, which may increase its enzymatic activity and lead to the production of more SAM. The mechanism through which Pns11 activates OsSAMS1 remains unknown and requires further exploration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant growth and virus inoculation</title><p>Plant growth and virus inoculation were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin et al., 2016</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors studied the pathogenesis of rice dwarf virus (RDV), which infects the major crop rice through the green rice leafhopper and causes significant economic losses every year. The authors focused on the functional characterization of the RDV non-structural protein Pns11, a protein that is found in the viroplasm, and has previously been reported to bind to nucleic acids in a Zn-dependent and sequence-unspecific manner. Pns11 has been implicated in the RDV virulence.</p><p>To study the function of Pns11, the authors generated transgenic rice plants that express Pns11 and performed RDV infection assays to assess the role of Pns11 in pathogenesis. For this, the authors used the green leafhopper inoculation system, which reproduces the natural infection conditions. Their analysis lead them to propose that ethylene functions as a susceptibility factor for RDV pathogenesis in rice. They identified OsSAMS1 as a Pns11-interacting protein, which could mean that the ethylene pathway is involved (something that is supported by the use of an ethylene inhibitor and an EIN2 overexpressor).</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were concerned that the authors did not consider alternative explanations for their data. For example, the SAM cycle affects multiple pathways; the ethylene pathway may not be specifically involved here or there may be an effect of the synthesis of polyamines (in addition to the effect on ethylene). It’s important not to overinterpret or bias the explanations of the data. A number of questions arose that require experiments to answer.</p><p>1) What is the mechanism of a potential effect on ethylene production?</p><p>Virus infection appears to result in the increase in SAM, ACC, and ethylene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, whether this is due to the interaction of PNS11 with the SAM synthase OsSAMS1 has not been addressed.</p><p>To show the causal relationship the authors should use their Ossams1 KO lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and show that there is no longer an effect on the ethylene pathway when infection occurs.</p><p>2) Is there an interaction between Pns11 and osSAMS1 during RDV infection? This needs to be addressed using a time course. The necessary antibody reagents seem to be available for performing these experiments.</p><p>3) Are there gene expression changes that reflect activation of the ethylene pathway? This could be addressed using RNA-seq data from osSAMS1 and Pns11 transgenic plants. Changes in gene expression in the ethylene pathway may show a similar pattern as that seen during the virus infection. If not, the model should be revised.</p><p>4) The authors repeatedly cite Satoh et al., (2011) as showing that ethylene related genes are induced following RDV infection (Introduction, Abstract). But that cited paper actually says the opposite: &quot;However, the genes for ET and SA synthesis were not strongly activated by RDV infection.&quot; The authors finding that SAMS1 is regulated post-transcriptionally is consistent with the lack of transcriptional changes noted by Satoh et al.,. The rationale for stating that Satoh et al., demonstrate the induction of ethylene related genes needs to be justified (GO analysis of microarray data?) or else interpretation of these earlier results revised and discussed accordingly.</p><p>5) The authors cannot state that virus accumulation 'significantly' increased (subsection “RDV infection”) as they do not provide statistics. Also, they cannot state &quot;the infection rates were much higher in the S11 OX lines compared to Wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>)&quot; as the difference is actually rather small, and line OX#3 is the same as Wt.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A</xref> data suggests that the effect is observed before 2-3 wpi; but at later time points there is no difference between wild type and OX plants. Authors should comment on this; because it is not providing complete resistance to RDV, it is providing tolerance to the RDV suggesting ethylene is not the only factor required for RDV pathogenesis.</p><p>7) Figure legends – lack details on timing of tissue collection and days after infection, etc.</p><p>8) Text in terms resistance should be toned down; it is really tolerance, not resistant. &quot;Inhibits RDV infection&quot; – is misleading because it reduces infection compared to the wild type plants. subsection “Ethylene is induced by viral infection and ethylene accumulation increases host susceptibility”: &quot;RDV infection triggers ethylene synthesis and accumulation through the interaction of Pns11 and OsSAMS1, and resultant activation of OsSAMS1&quot;.

To address this concern, we first carried out experiments to confirm the loss of Pns11-OsSAMS1 interaction in Ossams1 KO lines, with or without RDV infection. This is done through a pull-down assay, the results of which are described in subsection “Ethylene is induced by viral infection andethylene accumulation increases host susceptibility” of the revised manuscript, and shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 2A. Specifically, mock-inoculated WT and Ossams1 KO plants, as well as RDV-infected WT and Ossams1 KO plants, were subjected to protein extraction, followed by immune pull-down with an anti-OsSAMS1 antibody. Pns11 was pulled down from RDV-infected WT extracts, but not Ossams1 KO extracts.</p><p>We then measured the SAM, ACC and ethylene levels in the same set of plants, and found that the RDV-induced increase of SAM, ACC and ethylene levels disappeared in Ossams1 KO plants (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B-D). These results are exactly as predicted by the reviewer, thus addresses his/her concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is there an interaction between Pns11 and osSAMS1 during RDV infection? This needs to be addressed using a time course. The necessary antibody reagents seem to be available for performing these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>This concern is addressed in part by the pull-down assay described above. We further bolstered this conclusion by performing the time course pull-down experiments recommended by this reviewer, which showed a consistent OsSAMS1-Pns11 interaction starting three weeks post inoculation (subsection “Ethylene is induced by viral infection andethylene accumulation increases host susceptibility” in the revised manuscript and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Are there gene expression changes that reflect activation of the ethylene pathway? This could be addressed using RNA-seq data from osSAMS1 and Pns11 transgenic plants. Changes in gene expression in the ethylene pathway may show a similar pattern as that seen during the virus infection. If not, the model should be revised.</p></disp-quote><p>RNA-seq experiments have now been carried out and the results of which incorporated in the revised manuscript (See subsection “Ethylene is induced by viral infection andethylene accumulation increases host susceptibility” in the revised manuscript). Specifically, the gene expression profiles of RDV-infected rice, OsSAMS1 OX lines, Ossams1 KO lines and S11 OX lines were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes in all comparable pairs (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). To determine whether the ethylene pathway was activated by RDV infection, Gene Ontology (GO) was used for analysis (See Figure 6—figure supplement 3). Known ethylene-activated pathway genes were highly enriched in both RDV-infected and OsSAMS1 OX transgenic rice, and depleted in Ossams1 KO plants. Interestingly, although genes in the hormone mediated signaling pathway category were enriched in S11 OX transgenic lines, those in the ethylene-activated pathway were not. This is consistent with the observation that Pns11 overexpression enhances OsSAMS1 activity without up-regulating its mRNA. Additionally, relative to the Pns11 expression level in RDV infection, the transgenically expressed Pns11 level in S11 OX lines was probably low and insufficient to induce significant changes in ethylene pathway genes. Nevertheless, these results indicate that the ethylene pathway genes are regulated by RDV infection, most likely through Pns11-OsSAMS1 interaction. However, additional mechanisms involving other RDV proteins cannot be ruled out at this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors repeatedly cite Satoh et al., (2011) as showing that ethylene related genes are induced following RDV infection (Introduction, Abstract).

The rationale for stating that Satoh et al., demonstrate the induction of ethylene related genes needs to be justified (GO analysis of microarray data?) or else interpretation of these earlier results revised and discussed accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for misquoting the published work by Satoh et al., (2011). We have revised the phrase “RDV infection induced expression of ethylene-related genes” into “RDV infection perturbed the expression of several ethylene response genes like ERFs (Ethylene response factors)” in the revised manuscript, please see Introduction and subsection “SAM, ACC, and ethylene contents increased in <italic>S11</italic>and <italic>OsSAMS1</italic>overexpression lines and decreased in <italic>OsSAMS1</italic> CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and RNAi lines”</p><p>Satoh et al., (2011) stated “[…] the genes for ET and SA synthesis were not strongly activated by RDV infection”. We also found no strong induction of ET synthesis genes in our own RNA-seq dataset (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Instead, OsSAMS1, the main subject of the current study, is post-transcriptionally modified by Pns11 to become enzymatically more active, leading to increased production of ethylene. However, we did detect a significant transcriptional change in a set of genes that respond to increase ethylene availability (see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors cannot state that virus accumulation 'significantly' increased (subsection “RDV infection”) as they do not provide statistics. Also, they cannot state &quot;the infection rates were much higher in the S11 OX lines compared to Wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>)&quot; as the difference is actually rather small, and line OX#3 is the same as Wt.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the misleading statements. We have corrected these in the revised manuscript. Please see subsection “Overexpression of Pns11in rice enhances susceptibility to RDV infection”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A</xref> data suggests that the effect is observed before 2-3 wpi; but at later time points there is no difference between wild type and OX plants. Authors should comment on this; because it is not providing complete resistance to RDV, it is providing tolerance to the RDV suggesting ethylene is not the only factor required for RDV pathogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We have addressed this issue and discussed in the revised manuscript in the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>“We didn’t find a strong difference between WT and <italic>S11</italic> OX#3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), especially in virus accumulation and infection rate. This is probably due to the relatively low expression level of Pns11 in this particular line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), which may be insufficient to induce a significant increase in ACC and ethylene production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Furthermore, the hyper-susceptibility to RDV in Pns11 overexpressing plants was more prominent prior to 3 wpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A</xref>). This is easily explained by the fact that enhanced susceptibility allowed more Pns11 transgenic plants to show more conspicuous symptoms at earlier time points. This however does not prevent WT plants from becoming symptomatic at later time points, thus catching up with the transgenic plants in the rate of infected plants.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure legends – lack details on timing of tissue collection and days after infection, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments.

We have replaced “resistance” with “tolerance”; “inhibits RDV infection” with “reduces infection”.</p><p>We have performed a new assay (See subsection “Ethylene is induced by viral infection andethylene accumulation increases host susceptibility” in the revised manuscript) to confirm that Pns11 interacted with OsSAMS1 during RDV infection (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) but not in RDV-infected Ossams1 KO lines (See Figure 6—figure supplement 2A). We also measured the contents of SAM, ACC and ethylene in RDV-infected Ossams1 KO lines and mock infected Ossams1 KO lines, and found that the RDV-induced increase SAM, ACC and ethylene disappeared in these lines (See Figure 6—figure supplement 2B-D). These data indicated that RDV infection triggers ethylene synthesis and accumulation through the interaction of Pns11 and OsSAMS1 and resultant activation of OsSAMS1.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>You should revise the text (subsection “OsSAMS1 enzymatic activity”).
