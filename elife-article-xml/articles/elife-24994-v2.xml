unexplored. Using umbilical cord fibroblasts, we have determined by genome-wide association how common genetic variation impacts upon cellular circadian function. Gene set enrichment points to differences in protein catabolism as one major source of clock variation in humans. The two most significant alleles regulated expression of COPS7B, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome. We further show that the signalosome complex is imported into the nucleus in timed fashion to stabilize the essential circadian protein BMAL1, a novel mechanism to oppose its proteasome-mediated degradation. Thus, circadian clock properties depend in part upon a genetically-encoded competition between stabilizing and destabilizing forces, and genetic alterations in these mechanisms provide one explanation for human chronotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circadian</kwd><kwd>fibroblast</kwd><kwd>signalosome</kwd><kwd>genetic variation</kwd><kwd>genome-wide association</kwd><kwd>protein stability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII3_160741</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Zurich Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRPPSleep&amp;Health</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008397</institution-id><institution>Velux Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>923</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2010-StG-260988</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gachon</surname><given-names>Frederic</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006387</institution-id><institution>Fondation Leenaards</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gachon</surname><given-names>Frederic</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Immanuel Kant Baltic University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5 Top 100 Russian Academic Excellence Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Popadin</surname><given-names>Konstantin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cellular genetics highlights differences in protein catabolism in general, and the COP9 signalosome in particular, as one major source of human cellular circadian variation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A biological ‘circadian’ clock governs nearly all aspects of human behavior and physiology in synchrony with the geophysical day. Although the basic mechanism of this clock is highly conserved across evolution, humans show widely varying phases of behavior (chronotypes) ranging from very early (so-called ‘larks’) to very late (‘owls’). In rare instances of familial circadian disorders such as advanced sleep phase syndrome, it has been possible to identify specific mutations in dedicated ‘clock proteins’ that affect human circadian behavior and the period of the underlying clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Toh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). More recently, these investigations have been complemented by genome-wide association (GWAS) studies using questionnaire-based methods to interrogate genotyped cohorts about diurnal preference. These strategies have unearthed significant polymorphisms in regions containing known clock genes as well as other loci, but linking novel loci to biological mechanisms remains challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allebrandt and Roenneberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jones et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lane et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In cell- and tissue-based studies, it has been possible to link GWAS-based insights to biochemical mechanisms using eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci) based upon transcript levels or other cellular parameters. Typically, because of the labor involved in collecting and analyzing cellular material, the cohorts used in such investigations are much smaller (hundreds of samples rather than &gt;10,000 in conventional GWAS). Partially compensating for this deficiency is the relative simplicity of the analytical system and the precision of expression trait measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nica and Dermitzakis, 2013</xref>). Such approaches have been used successfully in a variety of contexts, identifying susceptibility loci for autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kochi, 2016</xref>), for HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loeuillet et al., 2008</xref>), and multiple other diseases. Since individual common alleles typically have rather small effect sizes, eQTL analysis provides a cellular methodology to analyse disease-relevant molecular phenotypes in simple systems that can amplify their effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hou and Zhao, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Since circadian clock function is cell-autonomous, it would be ideally suited to eQTL-based investigations. The fundamental unit of circadian timekeeping is comprised of feedback loops of transcription and translation of dedicated ‘clock genes’, coupled to parallel and perhaps even independent cycles of post-translational modification. These highly conserved clocks are hierarchically organized in mammals including man, with a ‘master’ clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus driving diurnal behavior and physiology both directly and indirectly via ‘slave’ oscillators of similar mechanism elsewhere in the brain and body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Azzi, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the recent past, circadian clocks in cultured fibroblast cells have been used as a workhorse for understanding circadian function. Importantly, interfering with these clocks produces clock phenotypes similar to those present in a corresponding whole-animal context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2005</xref>). Questionnaires about human daily behavior are even predictive of fibroblast clock properties from the same individuals: in general, cells from ‘larks’ show a short period, and those from ‘owls’ a longer period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2008</xref>). Herein, we have exploited these cellular proxies to explore the genetic basis of variation in human circadian clock function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>eQTL GWAS identifies polymorphisms influencing cellular circadian function</title><p>To assay circadian clock function in cultured cells, differently-phased clocks in the cells of the culture dish are synchronized by rapid chemical induction of a clock gene, and then circadian gene expression is monitored for several days, typically via a synthetic reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaspar and Brown, 2015</xref>). With this aim, we transduced the 159 umbilical cord fibroblasts of the Genecord II library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dimas et al., 2009</xref>) – each genotyped for 2.5 million common single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs -- with a lentiviral <italic>BMAL1-luciferase</italic> circadian reporter, then synchronized clocks with dexamethasone, and measured acute induction of <italic>PER1</italic> and <italic>PER2</italic> gene expression via qPCR, as well as the period, phase, and amplitude of subsequent circadian oscillation via real-time in vitro bioluminescence recording.

Given the close homology and overlapping function of the PER proteins, and the known correlation between period length and phase, these correlations are expected. Surprisingly, however, the most significant alleles in any one category are not among the most significant alleles in another, suggesting relatively independent genetic regulation of key circadian clock parameters (‘state variables’) for small changes, and the resilience of the overall circadian mechanism to small perturbations.</p><p>While multiple suggestive alleles were identified, it should be noted that none achieved ‘genome wide’ significance (often reckoned at p&lt;5×10<sup>−8</sup>), as might be expected from a cell-based study of moderate sample size and 2.5 million SNPs tested. Therefore, we undertook further experiments to demonstrate the relevance of our results.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Putative significant alleles are enriched in extreme chronotypes</title><p>To explore the significance of our results for human behavior and to probe the confidence levels required to elicit meaningful data, we examined the enrichment of SNP alleles in individuals of extreme chronotype after genotyping a previously-characterized cohort of 35 ‘larks’ and ‘owls” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2008</xref>). We reasoned that for SNPs identified at increasing stringency of p-value, those affecting behavior would show an allelic frequency that varied between larks and owls. Consistent with this hypothesis, allele enrichment analysis shows that differential allelic frequency among SNPs identified at relaxed confidence levels up to p&gt;10<sup>−4</sup> is very low, and then increases at p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup> or p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>, plotted either for all significant SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), or as single tag-SNPs per hapblock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

Therefore, to verify the significance of our findings, we conducted RNA interference (RNAi) targeting each of the genes that we identified using the human model circadian cell line U2OS, and looked for changes in circadian period and amplitude in vitro. Of these 60 genes, depletion of 28 genes showed a significant difference in circadian period of at least one standard deviation from the Z-scored mean, and 29 genes showed similar alterations in circadian amplitude. (Data for all genes tested and representative circadian profiles are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). To quantify the significance of these results, we used Redundant siRNA Activity (RSA) scores to attribute an overall p-value to siRNAs tested for each gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">König et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, for each clock trait – period and amplitude – we obtained two distributions: p-value probability of increase, and p-value probability of decrease of these traits for each gene identified in our screen. We then compared these to probabilities obtained for the transcriptome as a whole. Overall, the distribution of p-values for period obtained from hairpins targeting genes identified in our screen shifts outward (toward greater significance) and broadens, that is these genes have an increased probability of affecting the circadian clock compared to random genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, Kruskal-Wallis Test p=0.14 reduced and p=0.0016 increased period; the combined cumulative distribution is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test p=0.07).

Thus, both rodent and cellular studies support the idea that changes in COP9 expression could alter circadian function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A salient feature of human circadian behavior is its difference across individuals.</p><p>Previous studies have focused upon the importance of ‘canonical’ clock genes – core members of the circadian transcription-translation feedback loop – in these variations. Specific clock gene mutations been identified both in families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Toh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2005</xref>) and in the broader population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allebrandt and Roenneberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">von Schantz, 2008</xref>) that could affect human behavior. Moreover, three recently-published large questionnaire-based GWAS studies of circadian behavior have also highlighted polymorphisms in the region of known clock genes as a sizeable portion of the signals they observe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones, 2015</xref>). Taking a cellular rather than a behavior-based GWAS approach to circadian variation, we find evidence of a wider biochemical truth: a major source for differences in clock function at a cellular level is in fact based upon the broad mechanism of protein catabolism. Surprisingly, there is no overlap between top candidate alleles in their studies and ours. Moreover, among these three studies, so far only meta-analysis of grouped data has been performed, and no evidence was seen for other previously implicated alleles. Thus, the possible space for novel discovery remains large. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent any given QTL affecting cellular clock properties such as those that we investigate would propagate directly to effects upon human behavior.</p><p>As a feedback loop, the circadian clock is critically dependent upon protein stability to time its oscillations. Therefore, our conclusions make mechanistic sense. Indeed, both genetic linkage studies cited above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Toh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2005</xref>) have highlighted the importance of post-translational modification of clock proteins to regulate ubiquitin-proteasome pathway-dependent protein stability. RNAi screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sathyanarayanan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) and mouse mutant analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Godinho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Siepka et al., 2007</xref>) have also emphasized the global importance of proteasome-mediated degradation to circadian function. Here, by using human genetics as a tool for mechanistic discovery, we have demonstrated a novel role for the COP9 signalosome in the stability of the essential circadian clock protein BMAL1, a transcriptional activator of the <italic>PER2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gekakis et al., 1998</xref>) and a critical player in the circadian process. In fact, the entire signalosome is imported into the nucleus both in vitro and in vivo in time with the maximal abundance of BMAL1, enhancing its stability. Thus, the primary effect is a competition between signalosome and proteasome to stabilize or destabilize BMAL1, the former in time-specific fashion. Although we could detect interactions with multiple transfected clock proteins in nonrhythmic HEK cells, in rhythmic U2OS cells only BMAL1 interaction was detectable, suggesting further that other time-of-day-specific factors might be required for this interaction.</p><p>For the ‘negative limb’ of the circadian clock, such a phenomenon has already proven essential to the regulation of circadian period. Competition between two different E3 ubiquitin ligases, FBXL3 and FBXL21, respectively destabilize and stabilize CRY proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoo et al., 2013</xref>). Analogous effects can be observed for PER2 protein, this time via competition between different phosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vanselow et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Competition for phosphorylation sites and ubiquitin ligases is also a key determinant of the speed of the Drosophila circadian oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiu et al., 2008</xref>). With these genetic studies, we have unearthed evidence of a conceptually similar but mechanistically different regulation of the ‘positive limb’ via BMAL1 stability.</p><p>It is worth noting that although knockdown of COP9 subunits altered circadian period, phase, and <italic>PER2</italic> expression, the <italic>COPS7B</italic>-associated alleles rs920400 and rs10195385 that we genetically identified were associated significantly only with <italic>PER2</italic> expression in vitro: rs920400/PER2: p=1.0677E<sup>−7</sup>, rs10195385/PER2: p=1.9463E<sup>−7</sup>. For the same SNPs, association with other clock properties was not significant -- <italic>rs920400/PER1: p=</italic>0.202572306<italic>, rs10195385/PER1: p=</italic>0.198630802<italic>; rs920400/AMPLITUDE: p=</italic>0.791990033<italic>, rs10195385/AMPLITUDE: p=</italic>0.944165947<italic>; rs920400/PHASE: p=</italic>0.489070695<italic>, rs10195385/PHASE: p=</italic>0.522821404<italic>; rs920400/PERIOD: p=</italic>0.602715502<italic>, rs10195385/PERIOD: p=</italic>0.700789177. More generally, although there was detectable and significant genotypic correlation between period and phase, and <italic>PER1</italic> and <italic>PER2</italic> expression in our screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), genetic correlation among these different phenotypes was nevertheless weaker than we expected. We attribute this weakness to the idea that small changes in cellular clock properties can be robustly tolerated without affecting other clock parameters. Such an idea has also been supported by cellular dosage studies individual clock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baggs et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The COP9 signalosome has been shown previously to inactivate many cullin-RING-ubiquitin E3 ligases, probably by removing ubiquitin-like NEDD8 from cullins (so-called ‘de-neddylation’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubiel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cope et al., 2002</xref>). It has also been demonstrated to interact with casein kinase 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Uhle et al., 2003</xref>), which itself has a circadian role in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maier et al., 2009</xref>). Since the proteasome itself is constitutively present in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>) but the signalosome is circadian, it could thereby provide a more general mechanism for circadian regulation of nuclear protein stability. For example, in other eukaryotes, it has been suggested that the COP9 signalosome plays a role in the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the clock protein TIMELESS in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Knowles et al., 2009</xref>), and Frequency in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2005</xref>). Notably, the role of COP9 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is also stabilizing, but opposite in effect: by stabilizing the ubiquitin ligase itself, COP9 thereby promotes degradation of TIMELESS.</p><p>Mechanisms related to protein stability are the most prominent identified here -- not only the signalosome, but also kinases, phosphatases, ubiquitin ligases, and regulatory proteins. However, it was not the only one. For example, the Hedgehog signaling pathway is represented at high significance, not only through casein kinase 1 homologs – a protein family known to have circadian function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheong and Virshup, 2011</xref>) – but also through WNT secreted signaling molecules. These were recently shown to play a role in cell cycle-circadian clock synchronization in intestinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsu-Ura et al., 2016</xref>). Cell cycle proteins are also represented – logically, since the cell division and circadian clock cycles are robustly coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bieler et al., 2014</xref>), but nevertheless mechanistically not well understood. Likewise, cellular redox has come to recent attention in the context of circadian clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Putker and O'Neill, 2016</xref>), but specific mechanisms remain to be defined. Overall, human genetic studies have considerable power to discover novel physiologically relevant circadian mechanisms, and cell-based approaches make this discovery process even easier. In the case of circadian biology, such investigations could both provide new targets directly relevant to human health, and help to explain clock connections to disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>All human samples used in these studies were obtained after approval of all protocols and procedures by the relevant responsible authorities (of the University Hospital Geneva, CH; and Charité Universitätsmedezin, Berlin, DE), and prior written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Tissue isolation, cell culture and genotyping</title><p>Umbilical cord fibroblasts were collected from 159 newborns of Western European origin as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dimas et al., 2009</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Patrick Nolan (Reviewer #1), served as Guest Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mark McCarthy as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Yoshitaka Fukada (Reviewer #2) and Michael McCarthy (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Gaspar et al. present their findings on circadian variation in human umbilical cord fibroblasts. They used a GWAS study and identified SNPs associated with a number of molecular circadian phenotypes. The authors claim the genetic variants they identified show greater than expected differences in allele frequency in a group of subjects with extreme chronotypes. Based on GWAS data, they focused on COPS7B, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome, for a number of mechanistic investigations into period determination. The authors use a number of approaches, including RNAi, Co-IP of FLAG-tagged proteins and SILAC, to validate their initial findings and propose some interesting and novel molecular mechanisms. Specifically, they argue that COPS7B may promote the stability of the circadian transcriptional regulator, BMAL1. Based on these observations, they posit that clock protein half-life is determined by contributions both from destabilising factors via the ubiquitin proteasome and stabilising factors via the signalosome. The latter would represent a significant addition to our understanding of the molecular basis of circadian period determination.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>GWAS:</p><p>Conducting a GWAS study with such a small number of samples (140-147) is ambitious and this probably underlies the high p-values for the data described throughout the manuscript. Although such datasets usually require higher power, the reviewers understand the limitations here. It is not reasonable to expect numbers in a cell-based experiment to go much larger, or equal to those seen in GWAS (N&gt;10,000). Both points should be discussed and justified.</p><p>Please justify multiple testing using a threshold of FDR 0.1. Why choose this threshold? An FDR of q&lt;0.05 is reasonable for a GWAS study, even a cell based study. An FDR of 0.1 seems unusually high. If not justifiable, then perhaps gene list should be modified.</p><p>In subsequent text, the authors quote the p value for the two most significant SNPs affecting PER2 expression, not the q value. Why?</p><p>It would be helpful to know the degree of phenotypic correlation across the 5 rhythm parameters, and to estimate their genetic overlap. Do any of the markers associate with more than one parameter (as expected)? Or if not, why? For example, in comparing Manhattan plots, PER2 expression is the only variable where the Chr2 SNPs show anything near a threshold. Given the eventual mechanistic validation (BMAL1 stability), shouldn't we expect a similar pattern in the Manhattan plot for PER1 expression? Please provide this information and justify.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the statistical method is not well described, nor is a citation provided that validates the approach. The reviewers have concerns that simply calculating the difference in allele frequency between groups may not be valid across the entire range of allele frequencies. Why wasn't a more standard approach employed (e.g. chi square analysis, or for selected SNPs, trait morningness vs. genotype association)? If possible, these analyses should be included. Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, is it appropriate to study all association with chronotype equally? For instance, SNP associations with phase may be predicted to have stronger contribution to chronotype than amplitude. This approach should be justified, especially in light of the small sample size and the multiple comparisons problem.</p><p>RNAi:</p><p>Aspects of the RNAi experiments are hard to interpret. Of the 28 genes affecting period and 29 affecting amplitude, is there overlap (i.e. genes that affect both)? Of the control RNAis, the results should more clearly state how many control RNAis were used, and what proportion affected period or amplitude. Does a chi-square test indicate this proportion is significantly different?</p><p>In subsection “Genes associated with positive SNPs affect circadian clock function”, when assessing the probability that the genes affect the circadian clock when compared to random genesets, it is unclear why the authors have used one test to assess the reduced &amp; increased period/amplitude and a different test for the combined cumulative distribution. Presumably this is from analysis of the same data so the same tests should be used, please change or justify.</p><p>Gene enrichment analysis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>:</p><p>The authors state that they 'applied gene ontology enrichment analysis to the list that we obtained'. There is a bit of confusion here. Was this applied to the 59 genes from 3C or the 76 genes from the original eQTL? What threshold was used for the GSEA? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and 3B</xref> should be amalgamated into a graph with clear p-values added to the graph. As written in subsection “Positive SNPs highlight protein catabolism as essential to human circadian variation”, paragraph 2, authors then go on to pick the genes from 5 of the top 6 pathways for further analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-F</xref>. Is this somehow relevant to what is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>? Only some of the pathways shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> are significant and included in the top 6 pathways. For example, oxidoreductase activity (included) is not in the top 6 pathways in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> while macromolecule catabolic process (not included) is? Finally, given that the resulting genes are not significant in the GWAS and are not from a random sample, please provide evidence that the significant increase/decrease in period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) is not by chance.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and associated text:</p><p>Is the rs920400 AA genotype associated with long or short period in fibroblasts? How can this be reconciled with 'average PER2 expression' being higher? Is it justifiable to use a single timepoint here to look at PER2 expression? Do the genetic association findings of COPS7B share any association with the BMAL-Luc parameters? As the main result, the COPS7B association should be reported for all of the 5 parameters selected. If the genetic association does not match the RNAi experiment, the discrepancy should be discussed. It is difficult to accept that COPS4 knockdown lengthens period (by 9.9 hrs!) as it appears to completely obliterate the bioluminescence rhythm. What is the condition of the cells after knockdown? Labelling in Figure (COP4) is incorrect.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and associated text:</p><p>The authors claim direct binding of COP9 signalosome with several clock proteins, but the data need to be polished in order to fully support this conclusion. The immunoprecipitation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B, D</xref>) lacks essential experimental controls: in the FLAG-IP experiment, COPS7b signal should be no longer be detected in the absence of co-expression of FLAG-proteins in the same gel. These controls should be included in Western Blots. In the FLAG IP (a) the COPS7B antibody appears to cross-react with both PER2-FLAG and CRY1-FLAG. This confound should be addressed and justified. Both panels seem to show that interaction of COPS7B with PER2-FLAG and CRY1-FLAG is greater than with BMAL1-FLAG, yet the authors are proposing a direct interaction with BMAL1, how is this so? Authors should address this as it affects their arguments in the paper. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. What does the * signify and how was it measured? Presumably this should be a repeated measures ANOVA determination. Statistical methods should be included. How does this translate into 'the half-life of BMAL1 was reduced twofold'? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. Shouldn't you be seeing some protein degradation in these graphs, there is nothing evident here, particularly so in the CRY1 experiment. Some explanation is required in the text. How is this related to 'The half lives of CRY1 and PER2 remained unchanged'? Neither levels approach anything near 50% of the time-0 timepoint. What does 'even if their absolute abundance varied' mean?</p><p>Subsection “COPS7B and the COP9 signalosome are rhythmically imported into the nucleus”:</p><p>The argument the authors make about the conflicting phases of expression of PER/CRY with COPS7B in U2OS cells might hold for native protein interactions but this should not hold when constitutively ovexpressing recombinant PER-FLAG and CRY-FLAG proteins. There must be some other cause for the discrepancy seen in protein interactions in the two cell lines. Please address these issues in Results and Discussion.</p><p>Presentation and style:</p><p>There are numerous instances of errors in cross-referencing of Figures, referencing citations and overall flow of text in Results section.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>Given that the Abstract is the first port-of-call for many readers, it should be a realistic reflection of the main findings and conclusions in the manuscript. Some text such as 'Overwhelmingly gene set enrichment points to differences in protein catabolism as the major source of clock variation in humans' is rather strong. The reviewers request that this be toned down appropriately.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24994.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>GWAS:</p><p>Conducting a GWAS study with such a small number of samples (140-147) is ambitious and this probably underlies the high p-values for the data described throughout the manuscript.

(Even as it stands, ours was a story close to a decade in the making.) We have now discussed the points raised by this reviewer:</p><p>“Typically, because of the labor involved in collecting and analyzing cellular material, the cohorts used in such investigations are much smaller (hundreds of samples rather than &gt;10,000 in conventional GWAS). Partially compensating for this deficiency is the relative simplicity of the analytical system and the precision of expression trait measurement.”</p><p>and again:</p><p>“While multiple suggestive alleles were identified, it should be noted that none achieved “genome wide” significance, as might be expected from a cell-based study of moderate sample size and 2.5million SNPs tested. Therefore, we undertook further experiments to demonstrate the relevance of our results.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please justify multiple testing using a threshold of FDR 0.1. Why choose this threshold? An FDR of q&lt;0.05 is reasonable for a GWAS study, even a cell based study. An FDR of 0.1 seems unusually high. If not justifiable, then perhaps gene list should be modified.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the multistep selection process we used, we preferred to tolerate a larger rate of false positives initially (1/10 vs. 1/20) that would be screened out later. It should be noted that “suggestive” significance for GWAS is generally defined at 10e-5, and this corresponds in our study to an FDR of 0.1. It should further be noted that our FDR is based upon a strict correction for the 2.5million SNPs tested, and for European genomes the 2.5M SNP chip that we used is in fact “far too dense”: it is estimated that only 260,000 “tag-SNPs” are sufficient to capture variance in all common SNPs in the Phase I Hapmap project for European genomes. Thus, a Bonferroni-based correction is in reality 10x too severe! An excellent discussion of this point can be found here: Nature. 2005 Oct 27; 437(7063): 1299– 1320.</p><p>Finally, the validation of this strategy is in our opinion visible by the success of the GSEA approach, which demonstrated the functionally related significance of these hits.</p><p>We now discuss our rationale explicitly in the text:</p><p>“We chose this threshold to correspond to “suggestive” significance (uncorrected p&lt;1x10<sup>-5</sup>) in genome-wide association: since it is estimated that only a tenth of the SNPs on the high-density chip that we used would be necessary to capture all common variation in individuals of European origin, a corrected FDR is therefore up to tenfold “over-corrected”. We therefore preferred to select genes at a relaxed FDR, and subsequently apply further criteria.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In subsequent text, the authors quote the p value for the two most significant SNPs affecting PER2 expression, not the q value. Why?</p></disp-quote><p>For the “raw” GWAS, we wanted the values to be immediately comparable across other genetic studies, and p values have been reported much longer than q values. The main reason for the persistence in the use of p-values in GWAS is that correction for multiple testing after genotyping with high-density arrays is highly disputable. Essentially, the 2.5million SNPs on a modern chip are not independent. In fact, the Hapmap project shows that the oversampling rate is tenfold for Europeans. By leaving these values as p-values, anyone can easily correct however they want.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful to know the degree of phenotypic correlation across the 5 rhythm parameters, and to estimate their genetic overlap. Do any of the markers associate with more than one parameter (as expected)? Or if not, why?

Given the eventual mechanistic validation (BMAL1 stability), shouldn't we expect a similar pattern in the Manhattan plot for PER1 expression? Please provide this information and justify.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include the Spearman correlation pairwise across all phenotypes as a way of estimating genetic overlap. We observe varying degrees of global correlation across parameters – i.e. a nonrandom association of p values across the different phenotypes assayed. As might be expected, in particular <italic>PER2</italic> expression correlates with <italic>PER1</italic> expression, and period correlates with phase (a new Table 1). However, this reviewer correctly notes that correlation across top hits is surprisingly absent – i.e. wouldn’t a top hit for <italic>PER2</italic> expression also be one for <italic>PER1</italic> or period length? Apparently not.</p><p>We now note this explicitly in the text:</p><p>“We next compared SNPs across the traits that we identified. Considering only alleles achieving “suggestive” genome-wide significance (p&lt;10<sup>-5</sup>), we see correlation between multiple pairs of traits, notably PER1 and PER2 expression, and period and phase (Table 1). Given the close homology and overlapping function of the PER proteins, and the known correlation between period length and phase, these correlations are expected. Surprisingly, however, the most significant alleles in any one category are not among the most significant alleles in another, suggesting relatively independent genetic regulation of key circadian clock parameters (“state variables”) for small changes, and the resilience of the overall circadian mechanism to small perturbations.”</p><p>We continue the theme in our Discussion:</p><p>“It is worth noting that although knockdown of COP9 subunits altered circadian period, phase, and PER2 expression, the COPS7B-associated alleles rs920400 and rs10195385 that we genetically identified were associated significantly only with PER2 expression in vitro. More generally, although there was detectable and significant genotypic correlation between period and phase, and PER1 and PER2 expression in our screen, global genetic correlation among these different phenotypes was surprisingly weak. We attribute these differences to the idea that small changes in cellular clock properties can be robustly tolerated without affecting other clock parameters. Such an idea has also been supported by cellular dosage studies individual clock proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the statistical method is not well described, nor is a citation provided that validates the approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We thought long and hard about how to demonstrate an enrichment that would be valid in a moderately-sized pool of only 40 individuals of extreme chronotype, and invented this method for the task. The method is analogous to those that verify individual eQTL hits in biochemical pathways by validating unequal allele penetrance in individuals with diseases affecting that pathway (e.g. Loeuillet et al., 2008).</p><p>We now describe it in better detail in a new section of the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have concerns that simply calculating the difference in allele frequency between groups may not be valid across the entire range of allele frequencies.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important issue that we considered carefully – e.g. an extremely rare allele, present in only one subject who was an extreme early or late type, would skew the results at stringent p values where relatively few alleles were present. We combated this in multiple ways: first, our study already removed rare alleles (minor allele &lt;5%) from consideration. Secondly, we included these data in two different versions: one with all SNPs, and one with common tag-SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref> and Figure 1—figure supplement 4). This corrects for the multiple comparison problem – the tag-SNP approach counts all alleles in a hapblock only once – and also by definition eliminates very rare alleles). Finally, to fully satisfy this concern, we have gone back and looked specifically at all SNPs p&lt;10-6. The rarest minor allele among all these SNPs is 0.1524. Therefore, we believe that this concern, though valid, is not a problem in our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why wasn't a more standard approach employed (e.g. chi square analysis, or for selected SNPs, trait morningness vs. genotype association)? If possible, these analyses should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with this idea. Because of the limited number of extreme chronotypes in our pool, we do not think that it is fair to pick single alleles and show their enrichment. This is something that would be easy to do, but we do not think it would be valid. The whole strength of the method we devised is that it avoids singling out any particular allele, and shows that on the whole alleles considered at more stringent p values have greater influence upon chronotype than those at lesser.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, is it appropriate to study all association with chronotype equally? For instance, SNP associations with phase may be predicted to have stronger contribution to chronotype than amplitude. This approach should be justified, especially in light of the small sample size and the multiple comparisons problem.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the limited number of alleles we obtain, we think that it is important to consider them collectively in order to add power to subsequent pathway analyses. Moreover, while it is commonly predicted that some clock properties affect chronotype more than others, this relationship is far from clear in the literature. For example, we ourselves have shown that amplitude directly affects entrained phase, because a clock of high amplitude will show a smaller phase shift response. Thus, humans with high amplitude tend to be later chronotypes (Brown, PNAS 2008).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>RNAi:</p><p>Aspects of the RNAi experiments are hard to interpret. Of the 28 genes affecting period and 29 affecting amplitude, is there overlap (i.e. genes that affect both)?</p></disp-quote><p>At the biochemical level, absolutely – COP9 subunits are one particularly relevant example. At the genetic level, mostly not – i.e., as already mentioned in the context of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we do not find highly significant polymorphisms affecting both parameters. However, we do not find this so surprising: in vitro, black-and- white changes in one circadian parameter definitely affect another. However, with smaller changes, these parameters behave much more independently. A good example of this can be seen in the dose-dependent RNAi against clock genes seen in Baggs et al., 2009.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Of the control RNAis, the results should more clearly state how many control RNAis were used, and what proportion affected period or amplitude. Does a chi-square test indicate this proportion is significantly different?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that a misunderstanding occurred here, and we have therefore rewritten our description of this experiment in subsection “Positive SNPs highlight protein catabolism as essential to human circadian variation” and in the corresponding figure legends. Although only a subset of randomly chosen control RNAis were shown as discrete black circles, the underlying curves represented the entire genome, and the statistical tests described were against this control. However, it is impossible to plot aesthetically so many individual values. Statistical tests for all comparisons except one are significant (as noted in the text), and all exact p-values are cited in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In subsection “Genes associated with positive SNPs affect circadian clock function”, when assessing the probability that the genes affect the circadian clock when compared to random genesets, it is unclear why the authors have used one test to assess the reduced &amp; increased period/amplitude and a different test for the combined cumulative distribution. Presumably this is from analysis of the same data so the same tests should be used, please change or justify.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now homogenized our presentation here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E, F</xref>). In fact, both types of analyses were already present in both comparisons (against the whole genome, not random genesets as mentioned above), but one was in the main figure and the other in supplements. We chose two different representations so that the reader could see in one case the change in magnitude of phenotype, and in the other case a directional shift in the distribution. That is also why two different statistical tests were cited. We think that this approach is valid, but in any case both approaches and both tests were used in both cases, and now the figures look homogenous.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Gene enrichment analysis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>:</p><p>The authors state that they 'applied gene ontology enrichment analysis to the list that we obtained'.
