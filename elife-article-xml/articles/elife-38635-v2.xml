lifespan and proteostasis at the organismal level. Here, we utilized the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to examine whether the alteration of aging, by reducing the activity of the Insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) cascade, affects protein SUMOylation. We found that IIS activity promotes the SUMOylation of the germline protein, CAR-1, thereby shortening lifespan and impairing proteostasis. In contrast, the expression of mutated CAR-1, that cannot be SUMOylated at residue 185, extends lifespan and enhances proteostasis. A mechanistic analysis indicated that CAR-1 mediates its aging-altering functions, at least partially, through the notch-like receptor <italic>glp-1</italic>. Our findings unveil a novel regulatory axis in which SUMOylation is utilized to integrate the aging-controlling functions of the IIS and of the germline and provide new insights into the roles of SUMOylation in the regulation of organismal aging.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38635.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Aging may seem inescapable, but there are many factors, from diet to genetic mutations, that can affect this process. In fact, scientists have started to uncover the mechanisms that control and influence this slow decline. For example, in the small worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> removing the germs cells – which give rise to eggs – extends the lifespan. Similarly, interfering with the activity of the Insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway leads to a longer life for the animals. However, it is unclear whether these two mechanisms work together, or if they operate in parallel.</p><p>To explore this, Moll, Roitenberg et al. first looked at how the IIS pathway regulates a type of protein modification known as SUMOylation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Reducing the activity of the IIS pathway slowed down aging in the worms. It also decreased the levels of SUMOylation of certain proteins, including CAR-1, which is found in the structures that produce germ cells. Further experiments showed that stopping the SUMOylation of CAR-1 extended the lifespan of the animals. In fact, replacing the protein with a mutated version of CAR-1 that cannot accept the SUMO element makes the worms live longer and resist a toxic protein that causes Alzheimer’s disease in humans. These results therefore show that, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the IIS pathway and a mechanism that involves CAR-1 in germ cells work together to determine the pace of aging. Further studies are now needed to dissect how the IIS pathway influences SUMOylation, and whether the findings hold true in mammals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>insulin/IGF signaling</kwd><kwd>SUMOylation</kwd><kwd>germline</kwd><kwd>lifespan</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EC 981/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boocholez</surname><given-names>Hana</given-names></name><name><surname>Grushko</surname><given-names>Danielle</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Ehud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>YBT 2090/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lampert</surname><given-names>Bar</given-names></name><name><surname>Tzur</surname><given-names>Yonatan B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>YBT 1283/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lampert</surname><given-names>Bar</given-names></name><name><surname>Tzur</surname><given-names>Yonatan B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EC 281010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moll</surname><given-names>Lorna</given-names></name><name><surname>Roitenberg</surname><given-names>Noa</given-names></name><name><surname>Bejerano-Sagie</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name><name><surname>Carvalhal Marques</surname><given-names>Filipa</given-names></name><name><surname>Volovik</surname><given-names>Yuli</given-names></name><name><surname>Elami</surname><given-names>Tayir</given-names></name><name><surname>Grushko</surname><given-names>Danielle</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Ehud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By controlling the SUMOylation of the protein CAR-1, the aging-regulating pathways downstream of the Insulin/IGF signaling cascade and of the germ cells of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> are integrated.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The view that aging is solely driven by stochastic events has changed as mounting evidences showed that certain, apparently independent, genetic and metabolic modulations, slow aging and extend lifespans of various organisms. Dietary restriction (DR), reduced activity of the insulin/IGF signaling pathway (IIS) or of the mitochondrial <italic>e</italic>lectron <italic>t</italic>ransport <italic>c</italic>hain (ETC), and removal of germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kenyon, 2005</xref>), all slow the pace of aging. Among these, most prominent is IIS reduction, which extends lifespan and elevates stress resistance of worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>), mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holzenberger et al., 2003</xref>), and presumably humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suh et al., 2008</xref>). In the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)</italic>, the sole insulin/IGF receptor, DAF-2, initiates a signaling cascade that negatively regulates the activity of at least three transcription factors by modulating phosphorylation. Direct phosphorylation of DAF-16/FOXO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2001</xref>) and of SKN-1/NRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tullet et al., 2008</xref>) prevents these factors from entering the nucleus and from regulating their target genes. Similarly, the IIS inhibits the phosphorylation of DDL-1, which retains the Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF-1) in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiang et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, IIS reduction by <italic>daf-2</italic> RNA interference (RNAi) or by mutation, hyperactivates its downstream transcription factors, creating long-lived worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kenyon, 2005</xref>). IIS reduction also elevates resistance to a variety of stresses including heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lithgow et al., 1995</xref>), ultraviolet (UV) radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murakami and Johnson, 1996</xref>), and pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh and Aballay, 2006</xref>). In addition, IIS reduction protects worms and mice from toxic aggregation (proteotoxicity) of various neurodegeneration-causing proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalhal Marques et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, IIS reduction also modulates reproduction and egg-laying patterns, as knocking down <italic>daf-2</italic> by RNAi, reduces the worm’s brood size but extends the reproduction period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dillin et al., 2002</xref>). Although it was shown that the IIS is locally neutralized in germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Narbonne et al., 2015</xref>) and that DAF-2 responds to food availability by modulating oogenesis through RAS-ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lopez et al., 2013</xref>), whether changes in post-translational modifications are involved in the IIS-mediated control of reproduction, is only partially understood. Moreover, despite the evidences that the ablation of germ cells extends lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsin and Kenyon, 1999</xref>) and promotes proteostasis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shemesh et al., 2013</xref>), it is unclear how the aging-regulating mechanisms downstream of the IIS and those that are activated by the reproduction system are linked, and whether post-translational modifications play roles in the orchestration of these mechanisms.</p><p>SUMOylation is a post-translational modification involving a reversible covalent attachment of a <italic>s</italic>mall <italic>u</italic>biquitin-like <italic>mo</italic>difier (SUMO) to specific lysine residues of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Melchior, 2000</xref>). While mammals ubiquitously express three forms of SUMO (SUMO-1, 2, and 3), <italic>C. elegans</italic> expresses only one SUMO-encoding gene, <italic>smo-1</italic> that encodes a polypeptide of 91 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 10.2 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choudhury and Li, 1997</xref>). SUMOylation controls various biological processes and plays important roles in development and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnson, 2004</xref>). Among other functions, <italic>smo-1</italic> is critically needed for germline development and fertility of the nematode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broday, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we examined whether IIS activity controls SUMOylation of <italic>C. elegans</italic>’ proteins and if this post-translational modification plays roles in aging-associated functions of this pathway. To address this, we compared global SUMOylation patterns of proteins that were extracted from untreated and from <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi-treated animals, and found that among other modulations, IIS reduction lowers the SUMOylation rate of the protein CAR-1 (Cytokinesis/Apoptosis/RNA-binding protein 1) but has no effect on the expression level of <italic>car-1</italic>. CAR-1 is an RNA-binding protein, which acts in association with the RNA helicase, CGH-1 in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audhya et al., 2005</xref>). The knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> increases the levels of GLP-1 during late oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noble et al., 2008</xref>), thereby leading to germ cell death and to defective embryonic cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boag et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Squirrell et al., 2006</xref>). We show that knocking down <italic>car-1</italic> shortens lifespan and enhances proteotoxicity in model worms. On the contrary, the expression of a mutant CAR-1, which cannot be SUMOylated on lysine residue 185 (K185), extends lifespan and promotes proteostasis. These effects are conferred, at least partially, through the GLP-1 axis in a DAF-16-dependent manner, but probably also through an additional, DAF-16-independent pathway. Interestingly, we found that GLP-1 positively controls the expression of <italic>car-1</italic> establishing a regulatory circuit. Our findings unveil a novel link between the reproductive system and the IIS, demonstrating that one downstream arm of this pathway regulates certain aspects of aging through the SUMOylation of CAR-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IIS reduction results in differential protein SUMOylation in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>In order to test whether IIS reduction affects global protein SUMOylation in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> we employed three worm strains: wild-type animals (strain N2) and two conditionally sterile nematode strains: CF512 and CF1903, all exhibit natural IIS activity. CF512 animals become sterile when exposed to 25°C during development, as they cannot produce sperm. CF1903 animals harbor a temperature-sensitive <italic>glp-1</italic> mutant that renders them sterile upon exposure to 25°C during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arantes-Oliveira et al., 2002</xref>). Using these conditionally sterile worm strains, we could compare protein SUMOylation in adult tissues with no background from developing embryos. Eggs of all worm strains were extracted from animals that were grown in 15°C, and placed on plates that were seeded with either control bacteria, harboring the empty RNAi vector (EV), or with <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi expressing bacteria. The plates were incubated at 25°C for 48 hr, transferred to 20°C for additional 24 hr and the worms were harvested at day 1 of adulthood.

However, since DAF-16 is involved in several longevity-controlling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsin and Kenyon, 1999</xref>), we further tested whether CAR-1 is mechanistically linked to IIS.</p><p>Since IIS reduction lowers CAR-1 SUMOylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we sought to test whether the SUMOylation state of CAR-1 affects lifespan. To directly address this, we used the computational tool GPS-SUMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), for identifying SUMOylation consensus motifs in the sequence of CAR-1. Two lysine residues, K185 and K257 were found to be located within predicted SUMOylation motifs. Among the two, K185 is more likely to serve as a SUMOylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). If SUMOylation of K185 or K257 reduces CAR-1 activity and shortens lifespan, it was expected that the overexpression of a SUMOylation-resistant CAR-1 mutant would extend lifespan. To test this hypothesis, we created worms that over-express mutated <italic>car-1</italic> genes in which either K185 or K257 were substituted with arginine (CAR-1 K185R (EHC118) and CAR-1 K257R (EHC121), both strains also express the endogenous, wild-type <italic>car-1</italic>). These mutations prevent potential SUMOylation but maintain the hydrophobicity of the protein. To control for the effect of <italic>car-1</italic> over-expression on lifespan, we also created worms that over-express the wild-type <italic>car-1</italic> gene (strain EHC117). The three exogenous <italic>car-1</italic> genes were fused to an N-terminal double HA tag, and their expression levels were controlled by the <italic>car-1</italic> promoter. To compare the levels of SUMOylated CAR-1 in these worm strains, we homogenized young adult worms of the three strains and subjected equal amounts of protein to IP. Using an HA antibody, we pulled down CAR-1, separated total proteins of each worm strain and blotted SUMOylated CAR-1 by a SUMO antibody. Our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) show that worms that express the WT CAR-1 contain much higher levels of SUMOylated CAR-1 compared to their counterparts that overexpress either CAR-1 K185R or CAR-1 K257R, indicating that these are SUMOylation sites. Our results also show that CAR-1 is SUMOylated on more than one site, as the substitution of either K185 or of K257 with arginine, did not abolish SUMOylation of the protein.</p><p>Performing lifespan assays we found that the over-expression of CAR-1 K185R significantly extended the worms’ lifespans compared to those of wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, mean LS of 22.51 ± 0.60 and 14.70 ± 0.59, p&lt;0.001).

Thus, we asked whether the modulation of <italic>car-1</italic> expression and activity modifies the amount of germ cells. To test this, we compared the numbers of germ cells in gonads of four groups of worms: (i) untreated, wild-type worms (strain N2), (ii) <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi-treated wild-type animals, (iii) worms that over-express the natural <italic>car-1</italic> (EHC117), and (iv) nematodes that over-express the CAR-1 K185R mutant (EHC118). Nuclei were stained with DAPI and germ cells were counted. We found that the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> by RNAi had no significant effect on the number of germ cells as untreated and <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi-treated animals had similar numbers of germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, C and D; average of 724 ± 45.25 and 719 ± 32.36 cells, respectively).

The over-expression of CAR-1 K185R resulted in further reduction in the number of germ cells (average of 324.8 ± 21.37 germ cells/gonad, p&lt;0.01 compared to EHC117).</p><p>The observation that the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> shows no effect on the number of germ cells may emanate from an efficient SUMOylation-mediated inactivation of CAR-1 in wild-type worms. Thus, CAR-1 is less active and its knockdown has a small effect on the number of germ cells. In contrast, the over-expression of CAR-1 (in EHC117 worms), may exceeds the capacity of the SUMOylation mechanism and thus, hyper-activates CAR-1, which in turn lowers the activity of GLP-1, thereby reducing the number of germ cells. According to this explanation, the over-expression of the hyper-active CAR-1 K185R (EHC118) further suppresses the activity of GLP-1, resulting in an even lower number of germ cells.</p><p>The knockdown of <italic>car-</italic>1 by RNAi was reported to enhance physiological apoptosis in hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boag et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, we examined how knocking down <italic>car-1</italic>, or over expressing wild-type or the mutant CAR-1 K185R, affect the rate of apoptosis in the gonads. Our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) indicate that, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boag et al., 2005</xref>), the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> elevates the number of apoptotic nuclei in the gonad by approximately 2.5 fold. A similar increase in the rate of apoptosis was seen in EHC118 worms, but not in EHC117 animals. These observations raise the question of how the effects of CAR-1 and its SUMOylation on the number of germ cells and of apoptotic nuclei, affect reproduction.</p><p>To address this we tested how the expression of wild-type or of CAR-1 K185R affects brood size by comparing the egg laying capabilities of N2, EHC117 and EHC118 worms. The animals were grown from hatching on control bacteria. At L4 larval stage, 12 animals of each strain were transferred onto new plates, one animal per plate. The worms were transferred onto new plates in 12 hr intervals and viable progeny were counted 48 hr thereafter. We found that EHC118 animals lay fewer eggs than control worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, F and G). While in total, N2 worms had an average of 271.1 progeny, each CAR-1 K185R worm had an average of 104.8 living offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). A small but not significant difference was observed among EHC117 and N2 worms, as on average EHC117 worms had 171.4 viable offspring and N2 worms had 201.9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p><p>Our observations indicate that SUMOylation of CAR-1 on residue 185 is involved in the modulation of reproduction and suggest that this phenotype may be associated with the effects of IIS reduction on egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dillin et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, we examined how the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> affects the egg-laying pattern of worms that exhibit impaired IIS. To test this, we employed <italic>daf-2</italic> (<italic>e1370</italic>) mutant and <italic>daf-16</italic> mutant (<italic>mu86</italic>, strain CF1038) worms. <italic>e1370</italic> worms were treated with either <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi, <italic>daf-16</italic> RNAi, or were left untreated (EV), while CF1038 animals were treated with <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi or fed on control bacteria (EV). Egg-laying patterns were followed as described above. Our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2, A and B</xref>) confirmed that untreated <italic>e1370</italic> worms had a much longer reproductive period compared to wild-type animals. However, the total number of progeny per untreated <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant worm was on average 95.7, much lower than that of wild-type nematodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Both phenotypes were largely rescued by the knockdown of <italic>daf-16,</italic> which shifted egg laying to early adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and restored the total number of eggs to the average of 255.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> resulted in nearly complete sterility of both <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>daf-16</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2, A and B</xref>). These observations show that worms that have impaired IIS activity are much more sensitive to the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> than wild-type animals, implying that this gene is involved in the control of reproduction by the IIS. Yet, this reduction in brood size may be partially due to additive effects of IIS reduction and knocking down <italic>car-1</italic>.</p><p>We also tested whether knocking down <italic>car-1</italic> influences the egg-laying patterns of <italic>kri-1</italic> mutant (CF2052) nematodes. As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dillin et al., 2002</xref>), untreated wild-type worms laid the highest number of eggs between day 1 and 1.5 of adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast, N2 worms that were treated with <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi laid the highest number of eggs at the beginning of their reproductive stage (day 0 to 0.5), and the number of eggs declined thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2, C and D</xref>). While untreated N2 worms laid on average 244 eggs in total, their <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi-treated counterparts laid only 133 eggs (a reduction of ~ 45% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>)). The reduced reproduction was surprising, as the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> by RNAi had no effect on the number of germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, C and D). Nevertheless, this reduction, which is consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boag et al., 2005</xref>), may be explained by the increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the gonads of these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). <italic>kri-1</italic> mutant worms (CF2052) laid fewer eggs than N2 animals, but <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi treatment further reduced the number of progeny of both strains. While untreated <italic>kri-1</italic> mutant worms laid an average of 116 eggs, <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi-treated worms of the same strain laid merely 10 eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2, C and D</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> affects neither egg-laying patterns, nor brood size of <italic>daf-9</italic> and <italic>daf-12</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2, E and F</xref>).

The worms were grown from hatching on EV or on <italic>car-</italic>1 RNAi bacteria, harvested at day 1 of adulthood and gene expression levels were compared by qPCR. If CAR-1 is a negative regulator of GLP-1 that is negatively controlled by IIS-mediated SUMOylation, it is expected that CAR-1 is hyperactive in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant worms. Accordingly, the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> by RNAi is predicted to activate GLP-1 and elevate the expression of <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic>.

These findings imply that CAR-1 is needed for proteostasis-maintenance, downstream of the IIS however, the reduced paralysis rates that we observed in worms that were concomitantly treated with <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>car-</italic>1 RNAi imply that the knockdown of <italic>daf-2</italic> protects from proteotoxicity by additional, CAR-1-independent mechanisms. Yet, it is also possible that knocking down <italic>car-1,</italic> may inflict damage by an IIS-independent mechanism. According to this notion, the observed cumulative paralytic effect results from both, <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi-mediated protection and <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi-promoted damage. To directly address this hypothesis, we expressed CAR-1 K185R in Aβ worms (strain EHC124). If SUMOylation on K185 reduces the activity of CAR-1, it was expected that the expression of the SUMOylation-resistant CAR-1 K185R mutant would protect the animals from Aβ toxicity. Indeed, we found that Aβ worms expressing CAR-1 K185R are largely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, from day 7 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.004) protected from proteotoxicity. The protective effect of CAR-1 K185R is DAF-16-dependent, since no protection was seen when EHC124 worms were treated with <italic>daf-16</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These <italic>daf-16</italic> RNAi-treated worm population exhibited similar rates of paralysis to these of CL2006 worms that were treated with the same RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen et al., 2010</xref>). The observation that Aβ worms expressing CAR-1 K257R (strain EHC125) and Aβ worms (CL2006) exhibit indistinguishable rates of paralysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) indicates that the counter-proteotoxic effect that is conferred by CAR-1, is suppressed by the SUMOylation of lysine 185. Finally, the more efficient protection from Aβ proteotoxicity that is conferred by <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), supports the idea that the protective mechanisms that are activated by IIS reduction and by CAR-1 K185R only partially overlap.</p><p>We further examined whether CAR-1 modulates proteotoxicity by employing worms that express fluorescently tagged, poly-glutamine stretches of 67 repeats in their neurons (polyQ67-YFP, strain AM716).

First, knocking down <italic>daf-2</italic> extends lifespan solely during reproductive adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dillin et al., 2002</xref>). This finding is particularly interesting as other functions of the IIS are regulated at other stages of the nematode’s lifecycle; egg laying is controlled during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dillin et al., 2002</xref>) and proteostasis is governed by the IIS during early and late adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the key roles of DAF-16 in the longevity phenotype that results from both, IIS reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>) and loss of germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berman and Kenyon, 2006</xref>), further support the idea that the IIS and germline are inter-related. Indeed, DAF-2 signaling was reported to govern oogenesis through the RAS-ERK pathway according to food availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lopez et al., 2013</xref>) and the phosphatase DAF-18/PTEN locally antagonizes IIS activity in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Narbonne et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, germline signaling synergizes the longevity mechanisms downstream of the IIS and of the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, whether the IIS and the germline coordinate aging and proteostasis in an orchestrated manner and if so, how this coordination is achieved, remained largely unexplored. Here, we show that IIS reduction lessens the SUMOylation of CAR-1, a germline protein that is involved in mRNA processing and negatively regulates the levels of <italic>glp-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noble et al., 2008</xref>). Our data suggest that by SUMOylating CAR-1, the IIS suppresses its activity, thereby activating <italic>glp-1</italic> to shorten lifespan and impair proteostasis. This notion is supported by several observations. First, the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> shortens the lifespans of CF512 and of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1, A–B</xref>), but not of animals that lack functional <italic>glp-1</italic> or <italic>kri-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, A and B). On the other hand, the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> exhibits similar shortening effects on the lifespans of CF512 and <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant animals, questioning the role of <italic>car-1</italic> in the lifespan-controlling functions of the IIS. Nevertheless, the expression of CAR-1 K185R which lacks a putative SUMOylation site, extends lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, D and E) and protects model worms from proteotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, E and F) (it is important to note that it is not clear whether this mutated CAR-1 restores the natural functions of the protein or activate another lifespan extending mechanism). In addition, the simultaneous knockdown of <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>car-1</italic> prevents IIS reduction from conferring its full protective effect on Aβ worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, C and D). These results argue that CAR-1 is needed for IIS reduction to fully protect the worm from proteotoxicity. Finally, using <italic>daf-</italic>2 mutant worms and qPCR we found that the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> by RNAi elevates the expression of <italic>sygl-1</italic> and lessens the levels of <italic>lst-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), which are regulated by GLP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3, A and B</xref>). These results indicate that CAR-1 is a co-regulator of GLP-1 activity, however, while in the case of <italic>sygl-1</italic> the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> activates GLP-1-mediated transcription, <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi treatment reduces the expression of <italic>lst-1.</italic> These results show that CAR-1 can function as either negative or positive regulator of GLP-1 and show that the relations between CAR-1 and GLP-1 require further elucidation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>CAR-1 and SUMOylation coordinate signaling of the IIS and the germline but probably affect lifespan through an additional mechanism</title><p>Post-translational modifications are known to have various biological functions, including the regulation of aging. Phosphorylation regulates the activities of DAF-16, SKN-1, and HSF-1 downstream of the IIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tullet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiang et al., 2012</xref>) and SUMOylation controls the localization of the IGF-1 receptor and its signaling activity in mammalian tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sehat et al., 2010</xref>). SUMOylation is also critical for aging-associated modulation of mevalonate biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sapir et al., 2014</xref>), a metabolite that has been implicated in the development of clinical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mokarram et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we unveiled a novel role of SUMOylation in the regulation of aging, serving as a functional switch of CAR-1, which is governed by the IIS. This raises the question of how the IIS controls the SUMOylation state of CAR-1. One possible explanation stems from the correlation between AKT function, the stability of SUMO, and the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC-9 in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). According to this theme, reduced IIS lowers AKT activity, resulting in SMO-1 destabilization and in reduction of UBC-9 activity. This cascade of events may lower the rate of global protein SUMOylation. This possibility appears less likely as our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) indicate that while <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi leads to lower SUMOylation of some proteins others proteins exhibit increased SUMOylation upon IIS reduction. Alternatively, the expression of specific genes that encode for proteins involved in CAR-1 SUMOylation may be positively regulated by the IIS, which lowers the expression of these genes and reduces the rate of CAR-1 SUMOylation. Future research is needed to clarify this issue.</p><p>Although SUMOylation appears to be a pivotal post-translational modification that influences aging, a simultaneous knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> and <italic>daf-2</italic> only partially protects worms from proteotoxicity and only partially shortens lifespans of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant worms. On one hand, these observations suggest that IIS reduction also protects from proteotoxicity and extends lifespan by additional, CAR-1-independent mechanisms. However, on the other hand, the knockdown of <italic>daf-16</italic> in CAR-1 K185R-expressing worms did not shorten lifespan below those of wild-type nematodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting that CAR-1 also governs lifespan by an additional, DAF-16-independent mechanism (the lack of functional <italic>daf-16</italic> shorten the lifespan of N2 worms by approximately 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>]). Nevertheless, the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> has not further shortened the lifespan of <italic>daf-16</italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The lack of additive effect may be a result of the very short lifespan of <italic>daf-16</italic> mutant worms, which does not allow the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> to further shorten lifespan or perhaps by the limited efficiency of RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Opposing effects of car-1 on stress resistance and proteostasis</title><p>An additional interesting aspect of this study is the differential effects of <italic>car-1</italic> on distinct environmental insults. While the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> has no effect on heat stress resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, A-C), the expression of CAR-1 K185R, mildly but significantly elevates the survival of heat-stressed worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In contrast, the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> has a small but reproducible protective effect on resistance to UV radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) and to pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In agreement, the over expression of either the wild-type CAR-1 or the mutated CAR-1 K185R is deleterious to worms that were exposed to these insults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, F and H). The observed protection from UV radiation, conferred by <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi, is consistent with a previous report that CAR-1 and CGH-1 negatively regulate DNA-damage-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tomazella et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, despite its protective effect when the worm is exposed to stress conditions, the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> shortens lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results support the theme that the ability to resist stresses such as heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Volovik et al., 2014b</xref>) and oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Van Raamsdonk and Hekimi, 2012</xref>) are not necessarily coupled with lifespan determination. They also coincide with the reports that IIS-regulated factors may be involved in the regulation of certain stress resistance mechanisms but not of others. For instance, the transcription factor SMK-1 is needed for the worm to resist UV radiation and pathogenic bacteria but is dispensable for coping with heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolff et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, we recently reported that the knockdown of caveolin-1 extends lifespan and provides partial protection from pathogenic bacteria, but has no role in heat stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roitenberg et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi-mediated protection from certain stresses appears to be contradictive to the observation that knocking down this gene exposes the animal to proteotoxicity. However, it has been already shown that abolishing the nematode’s ability to resist heat by knocking down neuronal components, provides the worm with partial protection from proteotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prahlad and Morimoto, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Volovik et al., 2014b</xref>). Our findings show that manipulating the activity of a germline protein can also confer opposing effects on stress resistance and proteostasis, and raise the question of how CAR-1 promotes these opposing effects. One possible explanation suggests that CAR-1 may differentially affect the expression levels of different GLP-1-controlled genes. Such differential effects of transcriptional co-regulators have been reported. For instance, the knockdown of the DAF-16 transcriptional co-factor <italic>nhl-1,</italic> lowers the expression level of <italic>sod-3</italic> and of <italic>sip-1</italic>, but has no effect on the expression of <italic>mtl-1</italic>, which are all known target genes of DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Volovik et al., 2014b</xref>). The opposing effects of <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi on the expression levels of <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic> propose a similar mechanism of differential effects on the expression of distinct genes. How this mechanism functions and what cellular components are involved in the mediation of proteostasis by the SUMOylation-resistant CAR-1, are questions that require further elucidation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The post debris supernatants were collected, protein amounts were measured by a BCA kit (Thermo Fisher #23225), supplemented with loading buffer (10% glycerol, 125 mM Tris base, 1% SDS) and heated at 95°C for 10 min. For each treatment, equal protein quantities were loaded and separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica MA) and probed with the indicated antibody: GFP antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA cat #2956), anti-SUMO-1 antibody (Millipore, #09–409), anti-HA.11 antibody (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, #901501) or anti-actin antibody (Simga, #A5441). HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and a luminescent image analyzer (ChemiDoc XRS + BioRad) were used to detect protein signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Lifespan and paralysis assays</title><p>Synchronized worm eggs were placed on master NG-Ampicillin plates seeded with the indicated RNAi bacterial strain and supplemented with 100 mM IPTG. The eggs were incubated at 20°C until transferred onto small NG- Ampicillin plates, 12 animals per plate (CF1903 and CF512 were incubated throughout development at 25°C, to induce sterility). Adult worms were transferred onto freshly seeded plates every 3 days. Worms that failed to move their noses when tapped twice with a platinum wire were scored as dead. Dead worms were scored daily. Lifespan analyses were conducted at 20°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Heat, UV and innate immunity stress assays</title><p>For all stress assays synchronized eggs were placed on NG plates seeded with the RNAi bacteria (as indicated). For heat-stress assays, 120 day one adult animals were transferred onto fresh plates (12 animals per plate) spotted with RNAi bacteria and exposed to 35°C (N2, EHC117, EHC118, EHC121 and CF512 worms for 11 hr and CB1370 worms for 19 hr) and survival rates were recorded. To assess resistance to ultra-violet (UV) radiation, day 1 adult CF512 worms were exposed to sub-lethal UV dose (800 j/cm<sup>2</sup>). Survival rates were scored daily. To evaluate resistance to pathogenic bacteria (innate immunity), eggs of <italic>CF512</italic> worms were placed on plates seeded with the indicated RNAi bacteria, grown to day 1 of adulthood, and transferred onto plates seeded with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Survival rates were followed daily.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Germ cells number quantification</title><p>20–24 hr post L4 worms were dissected in egg buffer (0.025 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 118 mM NaCl, 48 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% Tween 20), transferred to superfrost plus slide and freeze cracked. Gonads were fixed in −20°C MeOH for 1 min, and 4% PFA for 30 min. Slides were washed twice in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) for 5 min, and incubated in PBST with 0.5 µg/ml DAPI for 10’. Finally, the slides were washed for 10 min in PBST, again in 10 mM Tris 7.5% and 0.1% Tween 20 for 5 min, and sealed with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, # H-1000). Imaging was done with Olympus IX81 inverted fluorescent microscope, and 3D images we collected and deconvolved with AutoQuant X3.

Your article has been reviewed by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Veena Prahlad (Reviewer #1); Andrew Dillin (Reviewer #2). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;The Insulin/IGF Signaling Cascade Modulates SUMOylation to Regulate Aging and Proteostasis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; by Moll et al., presents a very detailed description of one of the molecular mechanisms downstream of IIS-mediated proteotoxicity and lifespan extension. The Cohen group have done an extraordinary amount of work highlighting the molecular mechanism of CAR-1, which is described as a protein downstream of the IIS cascade and upstream of GLP-1 in regulation of this highly studied, but still poorly understood, paradigm of lifespan extension. The experimental methods are elegant and there is a lot of data presented, but the style of the data presentation and writing invite a lot of questions and potential experiments, all of which are listed below. Most of the comments can be addressed textually, and many of the experiments are perhaps not necessary should the writing be made more concise and informative. Again, a majority of the experimental suggestions and questions came up due to the presentation style, which had a major lack of descriptive reasoning behind the experiments, the methods by which the experiments were performed, and conclusions drawn from the data. Either the text needs to be cleaned up considerably to remove the confusions drawn out below, or perhaps the experiments suggested need to actually be performed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Is the increased sumoylation found in CF512 (Figure 1A) due to differences that result in growth at 25 °C? Were the N2 worms also grown at 25 °C for this assay to control for this difference? The Materials and methods do not make it clear – it looks like it was performed at different temperatures. Several studies have shown that 25 °C can cause dramatic differences in proteostasis, so this needs to be re-evaluated or made clearer in the text. The authors are also urged to check other reproduction-deficient mutants, such as glp-1 and glp-4, or via chemical sterilization, such as FUDR, to see if these major differences are due to the lack of germline, or specific to CF512. If it is specific to CF512 and the reasoning behind why there are such major differences in sumoylation cannot be rectified, this begs the question of whether this is an appropriate model to use. Another question that comes up is whether CAR-1 protein itself is differentially sumoylated in CF512 background.</p><p>2) Figure 1C-D are confusing. How do we know that 1C is showing SUMOylated-GFP-CAR-1 and not other protein that gets pulled down with an anti-SUMO antibody? Is this actually a double-IP where it is pulled down with SUMO antibodies, then GFP antibodies? This is especially confusing if probing with GFP-antibodies cannot visualize the larger, SUMOylated versions of the proteins – does SUMOylation prevent the GFP antibody from binding? Please clear up the experimental details and the conclusions drawn from the data.</p><p>3) Since car-1 RNAi/KO decreases lifespan of wild-type and daf-2 mutants to a similar extent, is this just an additive phenotype? (Figure 2A-B)</p><p>4) A single copy rescue experiment of the CAR-1 K185R should be performed in the car-1 KO to ensure that this CAR-1 still maintains the normal (albeit hyperactive) functions of the protein (e.g. rescues sterility) and isn't a completely mutant form of the protein with brand new functions.</p><p>5) The lifespan decrease of car-1 RNAi on daf-9 mutants seems much milder than in wild-type or other mutant worms. Does this suggest daf-9 and car-1 is partially overlapping/interdependent? (Compare Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>6) If CAR-1 drives lifespan extension by inhibiting GLP-1, why does a CAR-1 (WT) overexpression, which has a dramatic effect on number of germ cells have no effect on lifespan, and the very modest change in germ cells of CAR-1 (WT) overexpression versus CAR-1 K185R overexpression (this is a very modest decline compared to the dramatic decline versus wild-type) have such a profound effect on lifespan? (Compare Figure 3C-D to Figure 2—figure supplement 4A/C).</p><p>7) What was the purpose of measuring the effect of car-1 RNAi on egg laying of kri-1 mutant worms? It seems unsurprising that car-1 RNAi and kri-1 mutants, both of which decrease egg laying, have an additive phenotype. Moreover, the initial car-1 mutant experiments expressed that ¬car-1 mutant animals are sterile, so why would it be surprising that car-1 RNAi decreases egg-laying? Perhaps it would be less confusing if this section is removed, as it doesn't seem to add any additional benefits to the story. Alternatively, it can be moved into supplements as a control for the overexpression data (Figure 3E-F).</p><p>8) Is it surprising that EHC117 worms have no significant decrease in egg-laying when they have such a dramatic decline in germ cells? This should be textually addressed. This sentence can be added in the text where the differences in car-1 RNAi gonad versus egg-laying is compared – subsection “The roles of CAR-1 in GLP-1-mediated functions” (Compare Figure 3C-D to Figure 3I).</p><p>9) How do we know that the decreased egg-laying of CB1370 and car-1 RNAi are not just additive since both decrease egg-laying in otherwise WT animals? (Figure 3—figure supplement 2Figure)</p><p>10) Can you show that car-1 RNAi on its own does not affect sygl-1 activity? Why is this only done in the daf-2 mutant and not in WT animals? The authors should either include these controls, or explicitly state in the text why these experiments are not significant. The reviewers think that showing that overexpression of CAR-1 (WT or K185R) can decrease sygl-1 transcripts shows more direct evidence that CAR-1 negatively regulates transcriptional activity of GLP-1 (Figure 3J). Another suggestion is to stain for GLP-1 instead of measuring sygl-1 levels. K185R mutants should have decreased GLP-1 levels and car-1 RNAi should have decreased GLP-1 levels based on the model.</p><p>11) If car-1's effects are through GLP-1, car-1 RNAi should lead to an increase in GLP-1 protein. This should yield glp-1 gain of function phenotypes (e.g. persistent mitosis, increase in mitotic cells and fewer meiotic cells). Conversely, CAR-1 K185R should yield larger meiotic germ line cells causing a premature entry into meiosis (e.g. Pepper et al., 2003; Maine and Kimble, 1993). The absence of the phenotype in car-1 RNAi animals could suggests alternative mechanisms.</p><p>12) To further support the hypothesis that CAR-1 K185R that cannot be SUMOylated acts to increase longevity by decreasing GLP-1 would be to examine whether animals harboring CAR-1 K185R suppress glp-1 gain of function phenotypes (e.g. Pepper et al., 2003; Maine and Kimble, 1993), by sequestering glp-1 mRNA and decreasing its translation into protein.</p><p>13) Is the daf-16 CAR-1 K185 overexpression similar to daf-16 RNAi? This seems like an extremely important control to show that the two are not simply an additive effect if daf-16 RNAi has higher proteotoxicity. (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). It would also be stronger argument that CAR-1 activity is falling within the daf-2 cascade if daf-2 RNAi/mutants do not have an additive effect with CAR-1 K185.</p><p>14) Why are all the paralysis experiments done with car-1 RNAi, which is an indirect way to show that car-1 is affecting proteoxicity through GLP-1? All of these experiments should be done with the CAR-1 K185 to show directly that hyperactive CAR-1 can actually protect against proteoxicity. Minimally, the text should explain why these experiments are done with RNAi to increase proteotoxicity (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-B).</p><p>15) For Figure 6A-C, why was CF512 worms used? Were these grown at 15, 20, or 25 C? Growth at 25 C can mildly stress worms and can affect HSR or thermotolerance. The actual growth conditions should be specified, and experiments should be repeated if worms were developed at 25 C. Moreover, the thermotolerance and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> data seems to suggest that hsf-1 may be activated. It is recommended that the role of HSF-1 in these paradigms be tested.</p><p>16) For Figure 6D, if car-1 RNAi normally decreases lifespan, then the mild increase in lifespan is actually pretty substantial if normalized for this fact. Maybe something on this should be added in the text.</p><p>17) The experiments in Figure 6 really spark the curiosity of whether all of these phenotypes are truly due to car-1 or through non-specific pleotropic effects of car-1 RNAi. All of these experiments should be performed with the CAR-1 K185 strain to directly test whether these phenotypes are truly due to CAR-1. Moreover, would CAR-1 overexpression make worms more sensitive to pathogenic bacteria or UV (opposite of car-1 RNAi data), despite extending lifespan? Seems counter to the entire argument of the paper. These issues need to be addressed.</p><p>18) The article conflates fundamentally distinct concepts/roles, and in two cases that impact the overall conclusions. One, the role of Car1 in reproduction vs its role in longevity are considered interchangeably. The authors use effects on fertility to draw conclusions about longevity functions and vice versa and it is incorrect and confusing. Two, the function of GLP1 protein in germline development is substituted with the glp1 temperature sensitive mutant phenotype that is a surrogate for longevity brought on by germline loss. They use some results to directly implicate GLP1 protein function (e.g. sygl-1 expression) and others to deduce roles in germline eliminated longevity pathway (kri1, daf12 tests). This is also misleading and makes the article difficult to follow.</p><p>Car1's genetic interaction with Glp1 protein is published so if the premise is that it acts with/through Glp1 to modulate germline events that impact longevity, the experiments conducted here (Figure 3) do not test it or offer evidence for or against it. That requires examining the effect of CAR1 modulation on GLP1 (and the very well-characterized Notch pathway for translation control in the germline) within the germline and the fertility and lifespan consequences thereof. Similarly, if the hypothesis is that the Car1-Glp1 relationship operates in the context of germline-less longevity paradigm, the evidence provided is insufficient to infer any conclusions. The daf16/kri1/daf12/daf36 pathway is activated upon germline loss and solely impacts somatic Daf16. The relationships of these proteins within the germline are different (indeed, even in germline development these relationships change based on developmental state and/or environmental conditions). The effects of Car1 manipulations on reproduction of kri1 or daf12 mutants do not reveal their relationship in determining longevity, especially of sterile glp1 mutants. The germline-less longevity pathway has been shown by numerous studies to be genetically parallel to IIS and the authors overlook this concept while concluding that Car1 integrates 'aging controlling functions of IIS and germline'.</p><p>19) An alternative hypothesis that has not been addressed and would be consistent with much of the data such as the observed effects of overexpressing both wild-type CAR-1 and CAR-1 K185R on the number of germ line nuclei, is the role of CAR-1 on germline apoptosis (Boag et al., 2005). Programmed cell death mutations in <italic>C. elegans</italic> affect stress resistance, albeit reports show that the mechanisms are rather complex (e.g. Judy et al., 2013). It would strengthen the manuscript if this were directly examined, but this point needs to be addressed, at the very least in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38635.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Is the increased sumoylation found in CF512 (Figure 1A) due to differences that result in growth at 25 °C?

To clarify this issue, we first reproduced the experiment that is depicted as Figure 1A and modified the text to better explain the rationale. In the new experiment, we added a third worm strain that lack functional <italic>glp-1</italic> when exposed to 25ᵒC during development (strain CF1903). Similarly, to CF512 worms, the exposure of CF1903 worms to 25ᵒC renders the animals sterile. The experiment was conducted according to a revised protocol in which all worm strains were cultured in identical temperatures. All three parental (F0) worm populations (N2, CF512, and CF1903) were grown at 15ᵒC to ensure fertility, eggs were extracted and placed on plates that were seeded with either control bacteria (EV) or on <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi bacteria. All plates were incubated for 48 hours at 25ᵒC and transferred to 20ᵒC for additional 24 hours, until all worms completed their development and reached day 1 of adulthood. As expected, CF512 and CF1903 worm populations, but not N2 animals, were sterile as displayed in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript. The worms were homogenized and total proteins were separated on a 10% PAA gel and blotted with a SUMO antibody.</p><p>We have modified the text (subsection “IIS reduction results in differential protein SUMOylation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>”) and the Materials and methods section to accurately explain how the experiment was performed.

At day 1 of adulthood, the worms (~300,000 per treatment) were homogenized and GFP-CAR-1 was pulled down by a GFP antibody. The sediment proteins were separated on a gel and blotted with a SUMO antibody. The large number of worms was needed due to the relative weak signal of SUMOylated proteins. In Figure 1D we display the same pulldown experiment as in 1C after reblotting it with a GFP antibody. Thus, Figure 1D serves as a loading control for Figure 1C. Since the signal of GFP antibody is much stronger than that of the SUMO antibody, the short exposure of the blot was not sufficient to detect SUMOylated proteins. To better analyze the total amounts of GFP-CAR-1 in these worms, we added Figure 1E, which displays another experiment in which we used a smaller number of worms (~4000 per treatment) and whole worm homogenates were loaded onto the gel. This result supports the conclusion that the knockdown of <italic>daf-2</italic> does not affect the levels of GFP-CAR-1. In addition, we labelled Figure 1C-E to indicate what is displayed in each panel, modified the text to clearly explain these experiments and changed the figure legend accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Since car-1 RNAi/KO decreases lifespan of wild-type and daf-2 mutants to a similar extent, is this just an additive phenotype? (Figure 2A-B.)</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point. We agree with the referees, tested how the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> by RNAi affects the lifespan of an additional <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant strain (<italic>e1368</italic>, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B), and modified the text to explain this issue. We added the sentence: “Yet, the lifespan reduction that we observed among untreated and <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi-treated <italic>daf-2 (e1370</italic>) mutant worms, which was similar to the difference observed among wild-type and <italic>car-1</italic> knockout animals (Figure 2A), questioned the notion that CAR-1 is involved in IIS-mediated regulation of lifespan” to subsection “The roles of CAR-1 in the regulation of lifespan”, to reflect this issue. We also suggest that various longevity mechanisms are regulated by the insulin/IGF signaling cascade, and thus, the SUMOylation of CAR-1 is only one such IIS-controlled mechanism. Accordingly, the effect of <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi on the lifespan of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant worms is partial but may be related to the activity of this pathway. Please also see the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>We thank the referees for highlighting this important issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A single copy rescue experiment of the CAR-1 K185R should be performed in the car-1 KO to ensure that this CAR-1 still maintains the normal (albeit hyperactive) functions of the protein (e.g. rescues sterility) and isn't a completely mutant form of the protein with brand new functions.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that we tried addressing by injecting <italic>car-1</italic> heterozygous worms (strain WH377) with the CAR-1 K185 construct and searched for fertile worms that lack the endogenous <italic>car-1</italic> and express the CAR-1 K185R protein. Unfortunately, we could not identify such worms. This was plausibly due to the impaired fertility of worms that over-express the mutated <italic>car-1</italic> K185R (Figure 3G). Although we could not solve this issue experimentally within the time devoted for revision, we mentioned this important issue in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript: “(it is important to note that it is not clear whether this mutated CAR-1 restores the natural functions of the protein or activate another lifespan extending mechanism)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The lifespan decrease of car-1 RNAi on daf-9 mutants seems much milder than in wild-type or other mutant worms. Does this suggest daf-9 and car-1 is partially overlapping/interdependent? (Compare Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A).</p></disp-quote><p>We kindly disagree with the reviewers here, as the average differences in mean lifespans are similar. Each lifespan experiment was conducted three independent times. When <italic>daf-2 (e1370</italic>) mutant worms were fed with <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi the average shortening in mean lifespan following <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi treatment was 12.53% and <italic>car-1</italic> KO animals exhibited 15.32% lifespan shortening compared to their wild-type counterparts (see Supplementary file 2). Similarly, the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> by RNAi shortened the mean lifespan of <italic>daf-9</italic> mutant worms (CF2531) in 10.47% and of <italic>daf-12</italic> mutant animals (strain AA86) in 12.31% (see Supplementary file 4 for details). These differences are not significant and thus, we think that the shortening in mean lifespans are comparable and do not suggest an overlap in the pathways’ activities.</p><p>To better clarify this, we modified the text (please see subsection “The mechanisms of CAR-1-mediated lifespan regulation”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) If CAR-1 drives lifespan extension by inhibiting GLP-1, why does a CAR-1 (WT) overexpression, which has a dramatic effect on number of germ cells have no effect on lifespan, and the very modest change in germ cells of CAR-1 (WT) overexpression versus CAR-1 K185R overexpression (this is a very modest decline compared to the dramatic decline versus wild-type) have such a profound effect on lifespan? (Compare Figure 3C-D to Figure 2—figure supplement 4A/C).</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree that this is an important issue, which requires clarification. It is likely that the over-expression of wild-type CAR-1 has only a little effect on lifespan, as the IIS promotes an efficient SUMOylation of the exogenous wtCAR-1 molecules and prevents them from affecting lifespan (Figure 2—figure supplement 4C). This may be similar to the case of DAF-16, which is efficiently phosphorylated by the IIS-regulated kinases and thus, <italic>daf-</italic>16 RNAi treatment has a small effect on the lifespan of wild-type worms. Since the CAR-1 K185R protein is SUMOylation-resistant, this mutant is not (or less) affected by the IIS and thus, the over-expression of this construct efficiently suppresses the activity of GLP-1 and extend lifespan (Figure 2D and E). Nevertheless, as noted accurately by the referees, the remarkable reducing effect of over-expressing wtCAR-1 on the number of germ cells is interesting and surprising (Figure 3D). This observation suggests that germ cells are more sensitive to perturbations in the levels of CAR-1 than lifespan. Accordingly, it is possible that although most exogenous CAR-1 molecules are SUMOylated by the IIS, a residual amount of non-SUMOylated CAR-1 molecules, could be sufficient to reduce the number of germ cells but not to extend lifespan. Importantly, the over-expression of the SUMOylation-resistant CAR-1 K185R further reduces the number of germ cells (Figure 3D). We further discussed this in subsection “The roles of CAR-1 in GLP-1-mediated functions” of the revised manuscript.</p><p>To further address the question why the over-expression of the wtCAR-1 reduces the number of germ cells (Figure 3D) but have a limited effect on the number of progeny (Figure 3H) we conducted an additional experiment. One possible explanation to this puzzling observation suggests that the over-expression of wtCAR-1 does not affect the number of apoptotic nuclei while expressing the mutated CAR-1 K185R does. If this is correct, the enhanced apoptosis may explain the different effects of the brood sizes. We tested this by comparing the number of apoptotic nuclei and found that indeed, the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> by RNAi, or the over-expression of the SUMOylation resistant CAR-1 K185R, but not of the wtCAR-1, elevate the number of apoptotic nuclei (Figure 3E). This new experiment is described in subsection “The roles of CAR-1 in GLP-1-mediated functions” of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) What was the purpose of measuring the effect of car-1 RNAi on egg laying of kri-1 mutant worms? It seems unsurprising that car-1 RNAi and kri-1 mutants, both of which decrease egg laying, have an additive phenotype. Moreover, the initial car-1 mutant experiments expressed that ¬car-1 mutant animals are sterile, so why would it be surprising that car-1 RNAi decreases egg-laying? Perhaps it would be less confusing if this section is removed, as it doesn't seem to add any additional benefits to the story. Alternatively, it can be moved into supplements as a control for the overexpression data (Figure 3E-F).</p></disp-quote><p>The rationale behind this experiment was to examine whether the knockdown of <italic>kri-1</italic> and <italic>car-1</italic> have an additive effect. Yet, we agree with the referees that this rationale is not easy to follow and thus, we moved these results to the supplemental section as suggested. This experiment is now depicted as Figure 3—figure supplement 2C and D of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Is it surprising that EHC117 worms have no significant decrease in egg-laying when they have such a dramatic decline in germ cells? This should be textually addressed. This sentence can be added in the text where the differences in car-1 RNAi gonad versus egg-laying is compared – subsection “The roles of CAR-1 in GLP-1-mediated functions” (Compare Figure 3C-D to Figure 3I).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important suggestion and followed their guidance. As explained above, in the revised manuscript we also compared the number of apoptotic nuclei in the gonads of wild-type, EHC117 and EHC118 worms and found that the expression of the SUMOylation resistant CAR-1 K185R mutant, but not of the wtCAR-1 protein, elevates the numbers of apoptotic nuclei. This apparent contradiction between the number of germ cells and the brood size of worms that over-express the wtCAR-1 as well as the new experiment are described in subsection “The roles of CAR-1 in GLP-1-mediated functions” of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) How do we know that the decreased egg-laying of CB1370 and car-1 RNAi are not just additive since both decrease egg-laying in otherwise WT animals? (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these effects could be additive and modified the text to reflect this issue. The sentence: “Yet, this reduction in brood size may be partially due to additive effects of IIS reduction and knocking down <italic>car-1</italic>” was added to subsection “The roles of CAR-1 in GLP-1-mediated functions”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Can you show that car-1 RNAi on its own does not affect sygl-1 activity? Why is this only done in the daf-2 mutant and not in WT animals? The authors should either include these controls, or explicitly state in the text why these experiments are not significant. The reviewers think that showing that overexpression of CAR-1 (WT or K185R) can decrease sygl-1 transcripts shows more direct evidence that CAR-1 negatively regulates transcriptional activity of GLP-1 (Figure 3J). Another suggestion is to stain for GLP-1 instead of measuring sygl-1 levels. K185R mutants should have decreased GLP-1 levels and car-1 RNAi should have decreased GLP-1 levels based on the model.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. We used here <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant worms as we expect that in these animals CAR-1 is much less SUMOylated (due to the low IIS activity), thereby should be more active. Thus, the effect of <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi is expected to be more prominent than in wild-type animals in which CAR-1 activity is suppressed by SUMOylation. However, we agree with the referee that a control experiment showing the effect of <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi on the levels of <italic>sygl-1</italic> in wild-type worms, is critical here. Accordingly, we used qPCR using N2 worms and <italic>sygl-1</italic> primers (Figure 3—figure supplement 4 of the revised manuscript). The results of five independent experiments show that, as expected, the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> by RNAi elevates the levels of <italic>sygl-1</italic> in N2 worms, however, this effect is not significant. This observation suggests that in wild-type worms CAR-1 is less active than in <italic>daf-</italic>2 mutant animals and thus, the effect of knocking down this gene on the expression of <italic>sygl-1</italic> is smaller than in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant animals. This experiment is delineated in subsection “The levels of car-1 modulate the transcriptional activity of the GLP-1 pathway”.</p><p>The reviewers think that showing that overexpression of CAR-1 (WT or K185R) can decrease sygl-1 transcripts shows more direct evidence that CAR-1 negatively regulates transcriptional activity of GLP-1 (Figure 3J).

K185R mutants should have decreased GLP-1 levels and car-1 RNAi should have decreased GLP-1 levels based on the model.</p><p>We addressed this important issue by measuring the expression levels of an additional GLP-1 target gene, <italic>lst-1.</italic> While the exposure of CF1903 worms to 25ᵒC remarkably reduced the expression levels of <italic>lst-1</italic> (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B), this gene showed reduced expression upon the knockdown of <italic>car-1.</italic> This shows that the relations between CAR-1 and GLP-1 are complex and probably depends on additional factors. We modified the text to discuss this important issue and thank the referees for their scientific guidance. Please see subsection “The levels of car-1 modulate the transcriptional activity of the GLP-1 pathway” and the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) If car-1's effects are through GLP-1, car-1 RNAi should lead to an increase in GLP-1 protein. This should yield glp-1 gain of function phenotypes (e.g. persistent mitosis, increase in mitotic cells and fewer meiotic cells). Conversely, CAR-1 K185R should yield larger meiotic germ line cells causing a premature entry into meiosis (e.g. Pepper et al., 2003; Maine and Kimble, 1993). The absence of the phenotype in car-1 RNAi animals could suggests alternative mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We took two measures to expand our analysis of the relations between CAR-1 and GLP-1. First, we compared the number of apoptotic nuclei in the gonads of wild type, EHC117 and EHC118 worms. In addition, we followed the expression levels of an additional GLP-1 target gene, <italic>lst-1.</italic> The comparison of apoptotic nuclei in the gonads of EHC117, EHC118 and wild-type animals is now displayed as Figure 3E and discussed in subsection “The roles of CAR-1 in GLP-1-mediated functions”. The complex relations of CAR-1 and GLP-1 are demonstrated by the opposing effects of <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi on the expression levels of sygl-1 and lst-1 and explained in subsection “The levels of car-1 modulate the transcriptional activity of the GLP-1 pathway” and the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) To further support the hypothesis that CAR-1 K185R that cannot be SUMOylated acts to increase longevity by decreasing GLP-1 would be to examine whether animals harboring CAR-1 K185R suppress glp-1 gain of function phenotypes (e.g. Pepper et al., 2003; Maine and Kimble, 1993), by sequestering glp-1 mRNA and decreasing its translation into protein.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important comment. We tried to adopt a functional approach and injected GC833 worms ((<italic>glp-1</italic>(ar202) III), that develop tumor due to the activation of GLP-1 (Pepper et al., Genetics 2003)) with the CAR-1 K185R plasmid. However, this rendered the animals sterile and we could not isolate rescued animals.</p><p>Thus, we modified the text to explain the complex relations between CAR-1 and GLP-1 (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Is the daf-16 CAR-1 K185 overexpression similar to daf-16 RNAi? This seems like an extremely important control to show that the two are not simply an additive effect if daf-16 RNAi has higher proteotoxicity. (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). It would also be stronger argument that CAR-1 activity is falling within the daf-2 cascade if daf-2 RNAi/mutants do not have an additive effect with CAR-1 K185.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important comment. We modified the text to add a comparison of the rates of paralysis in <italic>daf-16</italic> RNAi-treated CL2006 worms in published articles (Cohen et al., 2006, Cohen et al., 2010) to the rate seen in EHC124 animals that were grown on <italic>daf-16</italic> RNAi bacteria (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). The similar rates of paralysis suggest that the protective effect of CAR-1 K185R is <italic>daf-16</italic> dependent. This is described in subsection “CAR-1 is involved in maintaining proteostasis”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Why are all the paralysis experiments done with car-1 RNAi, which is an indirect way to show that car-1 is affecting proteoxicity through GLP-1? All of these experiments should be done with the CAR-1 K185 to show directly that hyperactive CAR-1 can actually protect against proteoxicity. Minimally, the text should explain why these experiments are done with RNAi to increase proteotoxicity (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-B).</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4 we tested whether CAR-1 is a modulator of proteotoxicity. To address this we used: (i) <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi (Figure 4A and B), (ii) mixes of <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi with other RNAi bacterial strains (Figure 4C and D) and (iii) Aβ worms which express the CAR-1 K185R proteins (Figure 4E and F). We also tested whether the protection that is conferred by CAR-1 K185R is <italic>daf-16</italic> dependent and whether the CAR-1 K257R affects Aβ toxicity (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B). The results of all of these experiments culminate to show that the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> expose the worms to Aβ proteotoxicity, the over-expression of the hyper-active CAR-1 K185R, but not of the CAR-1 K257R, protects the animals from Aβ toxicity in a <italic>daf-16</italic> dependent manner.</p><p>The rationale behind the experiments that we display in Figure 5A and B, Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 3 is different. Here we addressed two questions. First, we asked whether CAR-1 also modulates proteotoxicity of an additional disease-linked, aggregation-prone protein, polyQ-YFP. We found that similarly to the effect seen in Aβ worms, the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> exposes the worms to proteotoxicity in a <italic>glp-1</italic> dependent manner. Secondly, we asked whether the RNA helicase CGH-1, is also a modulator of proteotoxicity. Our results (Figure 5C-D and Figure 5—figure supplement 3) show that it indeed modulates proteotoxicity.</p><p>We modified the text as suggested, to better explain the experiments of Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 3 (Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) For Figure 6A-C, why was CF512 worms used? Were these grown at 15, 20, or 25 C? Growth at 25 C can mildly stress worms and can affect HSR or thermotolerance. The actual growth conditions should be specified, and experiments should be repeated if worms were developed at 25 C. Moreover, the thermotolerance and Pseudomonas data seems to suggest that hsf-1 may be activated. It is recommended that the role of HSF-1 in these paradigms be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referees and repeated the heat tolerance experiment that is presented as Figure 6A using N2 worms. Our new results (Figure 6B) show that similarly to the observations that we obtained using CF512 worms, the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> by RNAi has no significant effect on heat tolerance of wild-type worms. In addition, in our previous study (Volovik et al., 2012) we have shown no HSF-1 activation in CF512 animals that were developed in 25ᵒC and transferred to 20ᵒC at day 1 of adulthood (as judged by the lack of induction of the HSF-1-target gene <italic>hsp-16.2</italic>). To clarify this issue we cited our 2012 Aging Cell paper and to describe the new experiment (Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) For Figure 6D, if car-1 RNAi normally decreases lifespan, then the mild increase in lifespan is actually pretty substantial if normalized for this fact. Maybe something on this should be added in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referees, conducted additional experiments and modified the text to better explain the slight increase in resistance to <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</italic> First, we examined whether the over-expression of wtCAR-1 (strain EHC117) and/or of CAR-1 K185R (strain EHC118) affect the survival of worms that were exposed to <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</italic> We found that the over-expression of <italic>car-1</italic> (wild-type or mutant) slightly shortens the worms’ survival. These results (Figure 6F) support the notion that CAR-1 activity is deleterious when the animals are exposed to pathogenic bacteria. We also expanded the textual explanation to better discuss this important issue (please see Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) The experiments in Figure 6 really spark the curiosity of whether all of these phenotypes are truly due to car-1 or through non-specific pleotropic effects of car-1 RNAi. All of these experiments should be performed with the CAR-1 K185 strain to directly test whether these phenotypes are truly due to CAR-1. Moreover, would CAR-1 overexpression make worms more sensitive to pathogenic bacteria or UV (opposite of car-1 RNAi data), despite extending lifespan? Seems counter to the entire argument of the paper. These issues need to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referees for highlighting this important issue and conducted the suggested experiment. We compared the survival of N2, EH117, and EHC118 worms (over-expressing the wild-type or K185R car-1 mutant respectively) that were exposed to heat (Figure 6D). We also tested whether EHC118 worms are more sensitive to pathogenic bacteria (Figure 6F) and to sub-lethal dose of UV radiation (Figure 6H). Our results show that, as predicted by the referees, the over-expression of the CAR-1 K185R acts in opposite to the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> by RNAi as it lowers survival of stressed animals.</p><p>These new experiments are described in the Results section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>It is important to note that lifespan, stress resistance and proteostasis were shown by multiple studies to be separable. For instance, the ability to respond to heat stress comes at the expense of the worms capacity to cope with proteotoxicity (Prahlad and Morimoto, 2011). Similarly, we have shown (Maman et al., 2013) that the knockdown of <italic>gtr-</italic>1 elevates heat sensitivity but has no effect on lifespan. Thus, in the light of these insights, the opposing effects of <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi on lifespan and stress resistance are not surprising.</p><p>We further discussed the relations between lifespan and stress resistance in the revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) The article conflates fundamentally distinct concepts/roles, and in two cases that impact the overall conclusions. One, the role of Car1 in reproduction vs its role in longevity are considered interchangeably. The authors use effects on fertility to draw conclusions about longevity functions and vice versa and it is incorrect and confusing. Two, the function of GLP1 protein in germline development is substituted with the glp1 temperature sensitive mutant phenotype that is a surrogate for longevity brought on by germline loss. They use some results to directly implicate GLP1 protein function (eg., sygl-1 expression) and others to deduce roles in germline eliminated longevity pathway (kri1, daf12 tests). This is also misleading and makes the article difficult to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We see the point here and took several measures to clarify the manuscript and avoid confusion.</p><p>First, since theoretically it possible that, in addition to the reported link between CAR-1 and GLP-1 (Noble et al., 2008), CAR-1 influences additional cellular pathways, we sought to directly test if the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> affects the transcriptional activity of the GLP-1-controlled pathway. To address this, we tested whether the knockdown of <italic>car-</italic>1 by RNAi affects the expression of <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic>, both well-defined targets of the GLP-1 pathway. Our results (Figure 3I) provide a direct evidence to the negative regulation of CAR-1 on the transcriptional activity of GLP-1 on <italic>sygl-1</italic> but not on <italic>lst-1</italic>. This highlights the complex relations of CAR-1 and GLP-1 that are now explained in the Results section and the Discussion section.</p><p>Secondly, to further examine the roles of CAR-1 of GLP-1 mediated functions, we tested how CAR-1 germ cell proliferation (Figure 3, C and D) and egg laying (Figure 3, F-H). In addition, since GLP-1 regulates the activity of DAF-16 through a well-defined set of components, including KRI-1 (Berman and Kenyon, 2006), we tested whether <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi affects egg laying patterns and lifespan of worms that lack functional <italic>kri-1.</italic> We found that it reduces the brood size of <italic>kri-1</italic> mutant worms (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C and D) but does not affect the lifespan of these animals (Figure 3B).</p><p>Finally, in the revised manuscript we tested how GLP-1 affects the expression level of <italic>car-1</italic> (Figure 3J) and found that the expression of <italic>car-1</italic> is lower in worms that lack functional GLP-1 compared to their counterparts the harbor functional GLP-1.</p><p>Together, these results describe the complex relations of CAR-1 and of GLP-1. The text has been modified to further discuss these relations (Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Car1's genetic interaction with Glp1 protein is published so if the premise is that it acts with/through Glp1 to modulate germline events that impact longevity, the experiments conducted here (Figure 3) do not test it or offer evidence for or against it. That requires examining the effect of CAR1 modulation on GLP1 (and the very well-characterized Notch pathway for translation control in the germline) within the germline and the fertility and lifespan consequences thereof.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results show that the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> shortens lifespan of wild-type and <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant worms (Figure 2A-B) but not of worms that lack functional GLP-1 (Figure 3A). This shows that the effect of CAR-1 on lifespan is GLP-1 dependent. Moreover, the knockdown of <italic>car-1</italic> modulates the transcription of GLP-1-target genes (<italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic>), showing that CAR-1 regulates at least some of the activities of GLP-1.</p><p>We also tested how the knockdown and over-expression of <italic>car-1</italic> affect the number of germ cells, reproduction profile, and number of apoptotic nuclei (Figures 3C-E and G-J).</p><p>We hope that the modified text (Results section) as well as the wealth of new results further clarify these issues raised here by the referees.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, if the hypothesis is that the Car1-Glp1 relationship operates in the context of germline-less longevity paradigm, the evidence provided is insufficient to infer any conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Our hypothesis suggests that since CAR-1 regulates the activity of GLP-1, as the CAR-1-GLP-1 relationship should have no effect on lifespan of worms that lack functional GLP-1 (Figure 3A) or functional DAF-16 (Figure 2C). In addition, the expression of CAR-1 K185R extends lifespan. These results clearly show that CAR-1 is a lifespan regulator, probably through the GLP-1 controlled mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The daf16/kri1/daf12/daf36 pathway is activated upon germline loss and solely impacts somatic Daf16. The relationships of these proteins within the germline are different (indeed, even in germline development these relationships change based on developmental state and/or environmental conditions). The effects of Car1 manipulations on reproduction of kri1 or daf12 mutants do not reveal their relationship in determining longevity, especially of sterile glp1 mutants. The germline-less longevity pathway has been shown by numerous studies to be genetically parallel to IIS and the authors overlook this concept while concluding that Car1 integrates 'aging controlling functions of IIS and germline'.</p></disp-quote><p>The key conclusion of this work is that indeed, the aging-regulating pathways, not necessarily longevity, but stress resistance and proteostasis, downstream of the IIS and the germ cells are inter-related through the SUMOylation of CAR-1. Our data challenge the conclusion of previous studies that claimed that these two pathways are independent. Nevertheless, we expanded the Discussion section to better discuss this paradigm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) An alternative hypothesis that has not been addressed and would be consistent with much of the data such as the observed effects of overexpressing both wild-type CAR-1 and CAR-1 K185R on the number of germ line nuclei, is the role of CAR-1 on germline apoptosis (Boag et al., 2005). Programmed cell death mutations in C. elegans affect stress resistance, albeit reports show that the mechanisms are rather complex (e.g. Judy et al., 2013). It would strengthen the manuscript if this were directly examined, but this point needs to be addressed, at the very least in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the referee’s guidance and tested the proposed hypothesis by comparing the number of apoptotic nuclei in the gonads of untreated and <italic>car-1</italic> RNAi-treated wild-type worms, as well as in EHC117 and EHC118 animals. Our results (Figure 3E of the revised manuscript) show that the knockdown of <italic>car-</italic>1 by RNAi, and the over-expression of the SUMOylation resistant CAR-1 K185R elevate the numbers of apoptotic nuclei in the gonad. No such effect was seen when the wtCAR-1 was over-expressed. These results provide a possible explanation to the lack of significant difference in the brood sizes of N2 and EHC117 worms (Figure 3H). We thank the referee for this important comment and agree that this mechanism is complex. Accordingly, we expanded the Discussion section to explain the roles of CAR-1 in controlling germ cells apoptosis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
