catalyze transport of Cl<sup>-</sup> with K<sup>+</sup> and/or Na<sup>+</sup>across cellular membranes. CCCs play roles in cellular volume regulation, neural development and function, audition, regulation of blood pressure, and renal function. CCCs are targets of clinically important drugs including loop diuretics and their disruption has been implicated in pathophysiology including epilepsy, hearing loss, and the genetic disorders Andermann, Gitelman, and Bartter syndromes. Here we present the structure of a CCC, the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter (KCC) KCC4, in lipid nanodiscs determined by cryo-EM. The structure, captured in an inside-open conformation, reveals the architecture of KCCs including an extracellular domain poised to regulate transport activity through an outer gate. We identify binding sites for substrate K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions, demonstrate the importance of key coordinating residues for transporter activity, and provide a structural explanation for varied substrate specificity and ion transport ratio among CCCs. These results provide mechanistic insight into the function and regulation of a physiologically important transporter family.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ion transport</kwd><kwd>potassium chloride cotransporter</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>nanodisc</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003194</institution-id><institution>New York Stem Cell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NYSCF-R-N145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brohawn</surname><given-names>Stephen Graf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2GM123496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brohawn</surname><given-names>Stephen Graf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000872</institution-id><institution>McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>043108</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brohawn</surname><given-names>Stephen Graf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006211</institution-id><institution>Klingenstein Third Generation Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brohawn</surname><given-names>Stephen Graf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM128263</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kern</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006978</institution-id><institution>University of California, Berkeley</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Chancellor’s Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reid</surname><given-names>Michelle S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC4 provides insight into the basis of ion specificity, transport stoichiometry, and activity regulation for a broadly physiologically and clinically important transporter family.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CCCs in mammals include the potassium-chloride cotransporters KCC1-4, the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporters NKCC1-2, the sodium-chloride cotransporter NCC, and CCC8-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arroyo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marcoux et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gamba, 2005</xref>). First characterized as modulators of red blood cell volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunham et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lauf and Theg, 1980</xref>), CCCs are now appreciated to play critical roles in cellular volume regulation, modulation of neuronal excitability, renal function, auditory system function, transepithelial transport, and blood pressure regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marcoux et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gamba, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singhvi et al., 2016</xref>).

Among KCCs, KCC4 is most strongly activated by cell swelling and high internal [Cl<sup>-</sup>] and is uniquely active in acidic external environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marcoux et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergeron et al., 2003</xref>). KCC4 is expressed in tissues including the heart, nervous system, kidney, and inner ear and mice lacking KCC4 display progressive deafness and renal tubular acidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marcoux et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mount et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karadsheh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boettger et al., 2002</xref>). Hearing loss in these animals is due to disrupted K<sup>+</sup> recycling by Dieter’s cells in the cochlea and hair cell excitotoxicity, while renal tubular acidosis is due to impaired Cl<sup>-</sup> recycling by α-intercalated cells in the kidney distal nephron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boettger et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>CCCs display varied substrate specificity and transport stoichiometry despite sharing a common amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) superfamily fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Payne, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartmann and Nothwang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi, 2013</xref>). KCCs cotransport K<sup>+</sup>:Cl<sup>-</sup> in a 1:1 ratio, NKCCs cotransport 1K<sup>+</sup>:1Na<sup>+</sup>:2Cl<sup>-</sup>, and NCCs cotransport 1Na<sup>+</sup>:1Cl<sup>-</sup>. One consequence of this difference is that under typical conditions (with [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>:[K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>out</sub> &gt; [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>out</sub>:[Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>in</sub>), transport by KCCs is outwardly directed while transport by NKCCs/NCCs is directed into cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marcoux et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gamba, 2005</xref>).</p><p>CCCs have two distinctive elaborations on the APC fold. First, the scaffold is followed by a C-terminal domain (CTD) important for regulating expression, trafficking, and activity including through phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of CTD sites in response to cell swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rinehart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergeron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frenette-Cotton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Melo et al., 2013</xref>). Second, CCCs contain a ‘long extracellular loop’ with predicted disulfide bonds and glycosylation sites that differs in position and structure between CCCs; it is formed by the region between TM5-TM6 in KCCs and between TM7-TM8 in NKCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartmann and Nothwang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartmann et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>KCCs are present as monomers and dimers in cells and modulation of quaternary state has been implicated in transporter regulation. A shift from monomeric to dimeric KCC2 during development coincides with an increase in its activity that results in chloride extrusion from neurons (the excitatory-to-inhibitory GABA switch) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rivera et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blaesse et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Puskarjov et al., 2012</xref>). Homodimerization is thought to be largely mediated through CTD interactions, as observed in the recent cryo-EM structure of NKCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chew et al., 2019</xref>), and calpain-mediated proteolysis of the KCC2 CTD is associated with a decrease in transporter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Puskarjov et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to self-associating, KCCs heterodimerize with other CCCs and interact with other membrane proteins including ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blaesse et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simard et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here we report the structure of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> KCC4 in lipid nanodiscs determined by cryo-EM.

It is formed by EL3 (the long extracellular loop; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartmann et al., 2010</xref>) and EL4, which pack together and cover ~2/3 of the transporter outer surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). Sequence comparison suggests it is conserved in all KCCs and not found in other CCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The structure consists of a short three-stranded antiparallel beta sheet (EL4 S1-3), five short helices (EL3 HA-C and EL4 HA,B), and regions without regular secondary structure. It is stabilized by two disulfide bonds (C308-C323 and C343-C352) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartmann et al., 2010</xref>) and decorated with N-linked glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marcoux et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weng et al., 2013</xref>) conserved among KCCs.

Notably, the carbohydrate chain at N312 projects from the EH3 S1-S2 loop underneath an extended segment that leads to TM6A. This arrangement may stabilize the extracellular domain and couple it to movements in TM6A, which moves between functional states in other APC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>). Indeed, mutation of this site (N312Q) to prevent glycosylation severely reduces KCC4 activity (by an average of 84%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These results provide a structural explanation for functional defects associated with non-glycosylated mutants of KCC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weng et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The position of the extracellular domain suggests its involvement in conformational changes during the KCC transport cycle. A segment of the extracellular domain close to the membrane forms a constriction that seals the internal vestibule from the extracellular solution. This is likely the extracellular gate based on comparison to other APC transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi, 2013</xref>). In KCC4, residues in EL4, TM1, TM3, and TM10 form an electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction network that seals the gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). R140 on TM1B extends towards the extracellular solution to interact with D575 on TM10 and E222 on TM3. The extracellular domain is positioned immediately above through an interaction between K485 on EL4 and D575. The outer portion of TM1B contributes W143 which, together with F486, surrounds K485 as it projects towards TM10. This is reminiscent of the extracellular gate in LeuT formed by an electrostatic interaction between TM1 and TM10 (R30 and D404) and capped by EL4 through an interaction with TM10 (D401 and A319) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>).</p><p>We generated mutations at sites in this interaction network to assess its importance for KCC4 function. Disruption of the interaction from the extracellular domain (K485D, K485E, and F486A) or the TM region (R140E) significantly reduced KCC4 transport activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The functional effects of these mutations are likely due to specific disruption of the interaction between the TM region and extracellular domain because a more subtle change (K485A) or mutation of a nearby, but less conformationally restricted, residue (E222R) had no effect on activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). By analogy to LeuT and other APC transporters, these data suggest opening of the KCC4 extracellular gate likely requires ‘unzipping’ of the electrostatic network and rotation of EL4 and the extracellular domain away from the surface of the TM region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Penmatsa and Gouaux, 2014</xref>).</p><p>On the intracellular side of KCC4, a hydrophilic cavity is formed by TM1, TM3, TM6, and TM8 that exposes the inside of the transporter to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). At the top of this cavity are Cl<sup>-</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> binding sites. The cavity forms a bifurcated pathway for ion access to these sites, splitting into two routes approximately halfway through the tunnel due to the position of side chains of N439, R440, and R528. Both sides are open to an essentially equivalent degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The only constriction outside of the local area surrounding the ions is formed at the position of N439 (from TM6B), G525, and L529 (from TM8) where the cavity narrows to ~3.6 Å in diameter, still sufficiently large for passage of K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions. Within ~3 Å of each ion, the cavity narrows such that it would require at least partial ion dehydration.</p><p>The cavity surface is markedly electropositive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). From the intracellular solution up to the position of the Cl<sup>-</sup>, charged and polar side chains (from R440, R528, R535, N131, N274, N439, and N521), backbone amides (from IL1), and a helical dipole (from TM6B) contribute electropositive character. Since intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> ions are typically present at lower concentrations than K<sup>+</sup> ions, this may serve to favor accumulation of the less abundant substrate near its binding site within transporter. Above the Cl<sup>-</sup> site and around the K<sup>+</sup> site, the accessible surface becomes electronegative and would favor cation binding. The extracellular surface of the transporter outside of the sealed gate is markedly electronegative. How this relates to mechanisms for ion binding and release in outward-open states awaits additional structural information.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ion binding sites</title><p>The central discontinuities in TM1 and TM6 result in protein backbone carbonyls and amides not involved in regular hydrogen bonding that are utilized in other APC transporters for substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi, 2013</xref>).

However, comparison to the NKCC1 homodimerization interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chew et al., 2019</xref>) suggest KCC4 could similarly self-interact and mutational data suggests this interaction increases KCC4 activity. A recently posted report of KCC2 and KCC3 structures appears to show a homodimeric interaction through the CTDs very similar to that observed in NKCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chi, 2020</xref>). If monomeric and dimeric KCC4 are functionally distinct, regulated oligomerization in cells would be an opportunity to modulate transport activity. In addition to an increase in basal activity, dimerization involving a close juxtaposition of CTDs and transmembrane regions could enable regulation of transporter activity through CTD posttranslational modifications that may not be possible in monomeric KCC4 with a flexibly attached CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartmann and Nothwang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blaesse et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Puskarjov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Watanabe et al., 2009</xref>). In support of the in vivo relevance of this regulatory mode, a monomeric to dimeric transition in KCC2 has been correlated with an increase in transporter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blaesse et al., 2006</xref>) and is influenced by phosphorylation of the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Watanabe et al., 2009</xref>), while proteolytic cleavage of the KCC2 CTD correlates with a decrease in activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Puskarjov et al., 2012</xref>). The ability of KCC4 to hetero-oligomerize with CCCs and other membrane proteins may be associated with weaker self-interaction compared to other CCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mahadevan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goutierre et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ivakine et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The structure of KCC4 provides insight into the architecture of KCCs and the mechanistic basis for coupled K<sup>+</sup>:Cl<sup>-</sup> transport. KCC4 is observed in an inward-open conformation that exposes the inside of the transporter to the cytoplasm through a wide and electropositive tunnel that may serve to concentrate the less abundant intracellular substrate Cl<sup>-</sup>. This conformation is similar to that observed in NKCC1 and KCC1 and presumably represents the lowest energy state for CCCs in symmetrical salt concentrations and the absence of a transmembrane electrical gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chew et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chi, 2020</xref>). We identify K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions around central discontinuities in TM1 and TM6. A Na<sup>+</sup> site in the 1:1:2 Na<sup>+</sup>:K<sup>+</sup>:Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter NKCC1 is reorganized in KCC4 due to TM-TM displacement and loss of specific coordinating side chains, explaining Na<sup>+</sup>-independence in KCCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

The sequence for KCC4 and KCC1 from <italic>Mus musculus</italic> were codon optimized for <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> and synthesized (Thermo Fisher, Cambridge, MA). Sequences were cloned into a custom vector based on the pACEBAC1 backbone (MultiBac; Geneva Biotech, Geneva, Switzerland) with an added C-terminal PreScission protease (PPX) cleavage site, linker sequence, superfolder GFP (sfGFP), and 7xHis tag, generating a construct for expression of mmKCC4-SNS-LEVLFQGP-SRGGSGAAAGSGSGS-sfGFP-GSS-7xHis. Mutations were introduced using standard PCR techniques with partially overlapping primers. MultiBac cells were used to generate bacmids according to manufacturer’s instructions. <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (Sf9) cells were cultured in ESF 921 medium (Expression Systems, Davis, CA) and P1 virus was generated from cells transfected with Escort IV Transfection Reagent (Sigma, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. P2 virus was generated by infecting cells at 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL with P1 virus at a MOI ~ 0.1. Infection monitored by fluorescence of sfGFP-tagged protein and P2 virus was harvested at 72 hr post infection. P3 virus was generated in a similar manner to expand the viral stock. The P3 viral stock was then used to infect 1 L of Sf9 cells at 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL at a MOI ~ 2–5. At 60 hr post-infection, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2500 x g and frozen at −80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Transporter assay</title><p>The FluxOR-Red Potassium Ion Channel Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was adapted for transport assays in Sf9 insect cells by adjusting the osmolarity of all buffers to 380 mOsm (by addition of sodium methylsulfonate). Cells were infected at a density of 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and grown in suspension for 60–72 hr for robust KCC4-GFP expression. 100 uL of cells at 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml were plated and allowed to adhere for 1 hr before the assay. For experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, 100 uL of cells at 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml were plated and allowed to adhere for 1 hr before viral infection. Cells were grown for 60–72 hr for robust transporter expression prior to assay. Growth media was replaced with 1X Loading Buffer and incubated at 27°C away from light for 1 hr. The FluxOR Red reagent is a non-fluorescent indicator dye which is loaded into cells as a membrane-permeable acetoxymethyl (AM)-ester. The non-fluorescent AM ester of the FluxOR Red reagent is cleaved by endogenous esterases into a fluorogenic Tl<sup>+</sup>-sensitive indicator. 1X Loading Buffer was subsequently removed and replaced with Dye-free Assay Buffer and FluxOR Background Suppressor. The assay was performed in 96-well, black-walled, clear-bottom plates (Costar). For data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, fluorescence was measured on a Perkin-Elmer Envision Multilabel Plate Reader using bottom read fluorescence and a BODIPY TMR FP filter set (excitation 531 nm and 25 nm bandwidth, emission 595 nm and 60 nm bandwidth). For data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, Fluorescence was measured on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax M3 using bottom read fluorescence and an excitation 560 nm with auto cutoff at 590 nm and emission 590 nm. The recordings were baseline corrected by subtracting the average fluorescence from 180 s prior to the addition of Basal Potassium Stimulus buffer and time zero is defined as the first data point recorded after the addition of stimulus. Global fits of all data to a one phase association model Y=(Plateau)*(1-e<sup>(-x/𝜏)</sup>) are displayed with 95% confidence interval bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Alternatively, the final 50 counts were averaged as a measure of final fluorescence increase and normalized to wild-type KCC4 fluorescence increase from experiments performed on the same day. In some experiments, average GFP fluorescence was measured between FluxOR fluorescence measurements and used to normalize FluxOR fluorescence values to account for differences in expression level. This normalization did not change results in a significant way and so was not performed for the final data presented.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Protein purification</title><p>Cells from 1 L of culture (~7–12.5 mL of cell pellet) were thawed in 100 mL of Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0).

We used Cryosparc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>) for initial model generation and refinement until reconstructions reached 4–5 Å resolution. Bayesian polishing and nanodisc subtraction in Relion 3.0.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zivanov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>) were used to achieve highest resolution reconstructions. While the contribution of disordered or flexible N- and C-terminal regions to alignments is unknown, the remaining 55 kDa asymmetric membrane protein is among the smallest in terms of resolved mass resolved by cryo-EM to date.</p><p>A total of 1572 movie stacks were collected, motion-corrected and binned to 1.137 Å/pixel using MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>), and CTF-corrected using Ctffind 4.1.13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Micrographs with a Ctffind reported resolution estimate worse than 5 Å were discarded. A small number of particles (~1000) were picked manually and subjected to two-dimensional classification to generate references for autopicking in Relion. 1,826,000 particles were autopicked and extracted at 2.274 Å/pixel (2x binned) for initial cleanup. Non-particle picks and apparent junk particles were removed by several rounds of two-dimensional class averaging. The remaining 887,132 particles were extracted at 1.137 Å/pixel and imported into Cryosparc. An additional round of 2D classification generated a particle set of 491,111. These particles were the input of an ab initio reconstruction (non-default values: four classes, 0.1 class similarity, 4 Å max resolution, per-image optimal scales). 2D classification of particles (160,868) that contributed to the most featured volume resulted in a set of 125,593 particles which were the input of an ab initio reconstruction. Alignments were iteratively improved using non-uniform (NU) refinement (0.89 window inner radius, 120 voxel box size, 10 extra final passes, 10 Å low-pass filter, 0.01 batch epsilon, minimize over per-particle scale, 1–4 Å dynamic mask near, 3–8 Å dynamic mask far, 6–10 Å dynamic mask start resolution, 4–6 Å local processing start resolution). Two separate NU refinement output volumes were input into a heterogeneous refinement job of the 886,528 particle set (forced hard classification, 10 Å initial resolution, five final full iterations). The more featured class (538,280 particles) was heterogeneously refined (forced hard classification, 10 Å initial resolution, five final full iterations) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The particles and volume from one output (354,234 particles) were input into the first of three iterative NU refinements (10 extra final passes for the second and third iteration).</p><p>Particle positions and angles from the final cryoSPARC2 refinement job were input into Relion (using csparc2relion.py from the UCSF PyEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asarnow, 2016</xref>]) and 3D refined to generate a 4.18 Å map (6 Å low-pass filter, 0.9 degrees initial sampling, 0.9 degrees local searches) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). A second 3D refinement following Bayesian particle polishing improved the map and reported resolution (4.01 Å) (6 Å low-pass filter, 0.9 degrees initial sampling, 0.9 degrees local searches). CTF refinement with beam tilt group estimation and per-particle defocus was performed, although subsequent 3D refinement did not markedly improve the map. Particle subtraction was performed to remove the contribution of the nanodisc density from alignments and subsequent 3D refinement markedly improved the map (reported resolution 3.86 Å or 3.72 Å after postprocessing) (6 Å low-pass filter, 0.9 degrees initial sampling, 0.9 degrees local searches). A final improvement in map quality and reported resolution and was obtained by removing poor particles with a 3D classification job (two classes, 10 Å initial low-pass filter, 16 tau fudge, no angular sampling). The final particle set (110,143) was subjected to 3D refinement to generate a final map at 3.72 Å resolution (3.65 Å after postprocessing) (6 Å low-pass filter, 0.9 degrees initial sampling, 0.9 degrees local searches).

solute carriers, which play a fundamental role in regulating cellular ion homeostasis. Here, Reid et al. report the cryo-EM structure of KCC4, a member of the electroneutral potassium-chloride cotransporter subfamily, from <italic>Mus musculus</italic> in lipid nanodiscs. The structural data reveal differences in the ion-binding sites between KCC and NKCC members, explaining differences in stoichiometry and ion preferences in the larger SLC12 family. Analysis of the extracellular domain in KCC4 builds on previous structures from KCC1, and highlights an intriguing role for glycosylation in regulating transport function. Functional studies demonstrated that KCC4 could function as both monomer and dimer in the cell, with dimerization increasing activity and possibly linked to activation during cell swelling.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Cryo-EM structure of the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC4 in lipid nanodiscs&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jue Chen (Reviewer #1) and Etana Padan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that we cannot consider your work for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this stage. We would be happy to consider a resubmission, if you revise your manuscript along the lines suggested below.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Reid et al. reports the structure of the mammalian potassium chloride cotransporter KCC4, determined by single-particle cryo-EM in lipid nanodiscs. KCC4 is member of the larger Cation Chloride Cotransporter superfamily, which plays essential roles in regulating ion homeostasis in the cell. The structure comes hot on the heels of other CCC family members, NKCC1 and KCC1, which makes it potentially a valuable addition to the study of these physiologically important antiporters. As it stands, the manuscript does however not present a sufficient advance over recently published work.</p><p>Our main concerns were as follows:</p><p>1) While all reviewers find the paper interesting and potentially important, they are concerned that this is the third structure of this family of transporters. The other two, which were published earlier this year, are human KCC1 and DrNKCC1. In your structure, the transmembrane domain is nearly identical to the other two, including the ion binding sites. The major difference is that KCC4 is a monomer and the others are dimers. This would be an opportunity to understand dimerization as a new aspect of these transporters. Unfortunately this difference is only addressed superficially in the discussion but without data or analysis. If you can provide evidence that the monomeric form of KCC4 is active, for example by ITC, it would be a valuable addition. If you could show that the ion transport or ion binding kinetics for the monomer and dimer are different, this would add considerable weight to your study.</p><p>2) A related concern was that your study provides little in the way of insight into the regulation of the protein. While you propose that monomer-dimer transitions may occur during regulation of the protein in cells, no evidence is provided that this is actually the case.</p><p>3) The fact that KCC4 is a monomer is surprising, given that the KCC1 structure, which is closely related, was determined as a dimer using a similar technique. Could the use of 1% DDM be responsible for disrupting the dimer during isolation? Native mass spectrometry might be a good way of analyzing this important aspect of KCC structure and regulation.</p><p>4) A further point that would benefit from additional analysis is the role of the extracellular domain. You describe this domain as novel, but without investigating its function, either in cells or in vitro. You describe glycosylation, including what appears to be an interesting link between glycosylation at N312 and TM6A, which forms part of the transport machinery in APC proteins. Yet, the significance of this interaction is not clear. Is it an artifact or an important part of the mechanism?</p><p>5) We also wondered about the extracellular gate, where you describe a salt bridge network that may function in a similar way to LeuT (and other APC transporters), but no analysis is provided. It would be good to characterize these interactions, for example through transport assays with variants at these sites and charge-swapped mutants. Such experiments would illuminate the mechanism of KCC4 and help to put the structure into a functional context.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper describes the cryo-EM structure of KCC4, a K<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter from <italic>Mus musculus</italic>.

This structure comes hot on the heels of other CCC family members, NKCC1 and KCC1, which makes the current structure a valuable addition to the literature on these physiologically important antiporters. The structure appears to be of good quality and is accompanied by cross linking and mass spectrometry data to investigate the oligomeric state and cell based transport assays to understand mechanism. The manuscript is clearly written and the figures are of good quality and appropriate for the description.</p><p>My main concern with the current manuscript is that apart from reporting the structure the study provides little else in the way of insight into the mechanism or regulation of the protein. I felt the manuscript was very descriptive in format but without any significant interpretation. The cross linking analysis appears to have provided little in the way of insight in to the oligomeric state for example. While the authors propose that monomer dimer transitions may occur during regulation of the protein in cells, no evidence is provided that this protein is capable of dimerization. This is rather odd, especially given that the KCC1 structure, which is closely related, was determined as a dimer using a similar technique. I wondered whether the use of 1% DDM might be responsible for disrupting the dimer interaction?

Yet, the study leaves the reader wondering what the significance of this interaction is. Is it an artifact or an important part of the mechanism? I wondered the same when reading the section that describes the extracellular gate. Here the authors describe a set of salt bridge networks that appear to function similar to LeuT (and other APC transporters), but no analysis is provided. I would have liked to see an attempt made to functionally characterize these interactions, either through transport assays with variants at these sites and charge swapped mutants.

The same could be said of the bifurcated pathway – artifact or interesting mechanistic observation. Here mutations and molecular dynamics could shed more insight.</p><p>In relation to the comparison between KCC4 and NKCC4, the latter protein binds to Na<sup>+</sup> in addition to K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>, I was interested to know what compensatory interactions are made that enables KCC4 to dispense with sodium binding. In the APC transporters that move protons for example, the second Na<sup>+</sup> site is substituted with a lysine. I felt this part of the analysis was also less in depth that warranted.</p><p>Overall the manuscript reports the structure of an important membrane protein that will be of interest to a wide range of researchers. However, the study for me was let down by a lack of functional analysis of the protein, starting with the oligomeric state and leading into analysis of the interesting structural features observed. Analysis of the ion binding sites is useful, but ultimately could be seen as fairly obvious and confirmatory, especially given the number of similar APC structures in the literature and the in-depth biochemical analysis conducted on these proteins.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes the structure of the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC4 (of <italic>Mus musculus</italic>) in lipid nanodiscs using single particle Cryo-EM. This cotransporter belongs to the CCCs family of which members play important roles in many human physiological functions. Several of these transporters are drug targets because their disruptions are involved in pathological cases. Hence, the KCC4 structure is important both for understanding the structure and function of an important group of mammal's transporters as well as for drug design.</p><p>1) KCC4 induced Tl<sup>+</sup> uptake activity has been demonstrated in intact cells.

First, NKCC1 and KCC1 are dimers (albeit through different interfaces), while KCC4 is a monomer (Figure 3). We show that monomeric KCC4 is active and that its dimerization (through an interface analogous to NKCC1, but not KCC1) increases activity (Figure 3F, more below). Second, substantial rearrangement in the TM region between KCC4 and NKCC1 results in loss of a Na<sup>+</sup> binding site in KCC4, providing a structural explanation for the difference in substrate specificity and stoichiometry between these transporters (Figure 5C). Third, two Cl<sup>-</sup> ions are observed in the NKCC1 and KCC1 structures, while one Cl<sup>-</sup> ion is observed bound to KCC4. Mutations around both sites impair transport activity, suggesting they are both involved in the KCC4 transport cycle (Figure 5F,G). Fourth, the extracellular domains in NKCC1 and KCC1/KCC4 are completely distinct: they are divergent in position within the transporter fold, in sequence, and in structure. Interactions unique to KCCs between the extracellular domain and TM region around the extracellular gate are functionally important (Figure 4C, more below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major difference is that KCC4 is a monomer and the others are dimers. This would be an opportunity to understand dimerization as a new aspect of these transporters. Unfortunately this difference is only addressed superficially in the discussion but without data or analysis. If you can provide evidence that the monomeric form of KCC4 is active, for example by ITC, it would be a valuable addition. If you could show that the ion transport or ion binding kinetics for the monomer and dimer are different, this would add considerable weight to your study.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed mutational analysis to assess whether dimerization through either of the distinct interfaces observed in KCC1 and NKCC1 is required for activity in cells (Figure 3). We found that monomeric KCC4 is active and that dimerization through an interface analogous to that observed in NKCC1 increases KCC4 activity (Figure 3F).</p><p>KCC1 dimerization predominantly involves protein-detergent interactions between TM regions and protein-protein interactions in an extracellular loop (Figure 3A,B). The extracellular loop is poorly conserved among KCCs (Figure 3E) and in KCC4 its structure is likely incompatible with dimerization due to steric clashes with a second protomer (Figure 3B). Consistently, introduction of three negative charges in the loop in KCC4 has no effect on transport activity. We conclude dimerization as observed in KCC1 is not functionally relevant for KCC4. In contrast, NKCC1 dimerization predominantly involves well conserved protein-protein interactions between CTDs (Figure 3C-E). Three separate pairs of mutations designed to disrupt an analogous interface in KCC4 result in a partial (~40%) reduction in activity. KCC4 retained activity even when the entire C-terminus was deleted (Figure 3F). Expression and folding were assessed for each mutant in the paper to ensure differences in these factors did not account for activity differences (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We conclude that monomeric KCC4 is active and that dimerization increases KCC4 activity. This suggests the possibility of regulated dimerization in cells as a means for modulating transport activity in cells. Further exploring this possibility will be a focus of further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A related concern was that your study provides little in the way of insight into the regulation of the protein. While you propose that monomer-dimer transitions may occur during regulation of the protein in cells, no evidence is provided that this is actually the case.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the structures and mutational studies, we can conclude that monomeric KCC4 is active and that dimerization (in a manner analogous to NKCC1) increases activity (Figure 3F). We believe a study of when this is utilized in cells or in vivo, while certainly very interesting, is outside the realm of this study. We reference a prior report suggesting regulated dimerization of KCC2 occurs in vivo and is associated with an increase in transport activity in conjunction with the neurodevelopmental excitatory-to-inhibitory GABA switch (Blaesse et al., 2006).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The fact that KCC4 is a monomer is surprising, given that the KCC1 structure, which is closely related, was determined as a dimer using a similar technique. Could the use of 1% DDM be responsible for disrupting the dimer during isolation? Native mass spectrometry might be a good way of analyzing this important aspect of KCC structure and regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Differences in expression host cells or detergents used in the structures of CCCs do not appear to account for differences in oligomeric state between KCC4 and KCC1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). KCC4 and KCC1 displayed similar apparent size (judged by retention time during gel filtration) under all conditions tested (expression in HEK293T or SF9 cells and use of the three detergent combinations used in each CCC structure study (extraction: gel filtration detergents are DDM/CHS:DDM/CHS from KCC4, DDM/CHS:GDN from KCC1, and LMNG/CHS:digitonin from NKCC1).</p><p>Since KCC1 and KCC4 behave similarly in these experiments, why is there a difference in oligomeric state in the two structures? One possibility is that KCC1 and KCC4 dimerization interactions are weak and dimeric species are not significantly populated at the low concentrations used for FSEC or, in the case of KCC4, the μM concentrations used for cryo-EM. Regardless, our data suggests an analogous interface is not functionally important for KCC4 as mutation of the extracellular loop that forms the KCC1 dimer interface in a manner predicted to prevent dimerization has no effect on KCC4 function (Figure 3B,F).</p><p>In contrast, our data suggests dimerization of KCC4 through the CTDs (as observed in NKCC1) is functionally important and increases KCC4 activity (Figure 3D,F). Consistent with this mode of dimerization in KCCs, structures of KCC2 and KCC3 posted on bioRxiv show an apparently similar CTD-CTD interaction to that observed in NKCC1 (bioRxiv 2020.02.22.960815; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.22.960815). This study also used DDM/CHS and GDN detergents, so detergent differences cannot account for the oligomeric differences between different KCCs observed to date. We speculate differences in KCC oligomeric state and organization could have functional consequences and this will be a focus of future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A further point that would benefit from additional analysis is the role of the extracellular domain. You describe this domain as novel, but without investigating its function, either in cells or in vitro. You describe glycosylation, including what appears to be an interesting link between glycosylation at N312 and TM6A, which forms part of the transport machinery in APC proteins. Yet, the significance of this interaction is not clear. Is it an artifact or an important part of the mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided additional mutational analysis of this domain as suggested. Glycosylation at N312 has been observed (at analogous sites) in KCCs in prior reports referenced. We show that glycosylation of N312 is functionally important, consistent with a link between the structure of this region and the extracellular gate around TM6A. KCC4 mutant N312Q results in a severe reduction in transport activity (Figure 4C) without obvious defects in folding or expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) We also wondered about the extracellular gate, where you describe a salt bridge network that may function in a similar way to LeuT (and other APC transporters), but no analysis is provided.
