How any cell actually senses its own size remains poorly understood. The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> are rod-shaped cells that grow to ∼14 µm in length before entering mitosis. In this study, we provide evidence that these cells sense their surface area as part of this size control mechanism. We show that cells enter mitosis at a certain surface area, as opposed to a certain volume or length. A peripheral membrane protein kinase cdr2p has properties of a dose-dependent ‘sizer’ that controls mitotic entry. As cells grow, the local cdr2p concentration in nodes at the medial cortex accumulates as a measure of cell surface area. Our findings, which challenge a previously proposed pom1p gradient model, lead to a new model in which cells sense their size by using cdr2p to probe the surface area over the whole cell and relay this information to the medial cortex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02040.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02040.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02040.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Although different types of cells come in a variety of shapes and sizes, most cells are able to maintain a fairly consistent size and shape as they grow and divide. For example, the rod-shaped cells of the fission yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic> grow to be 14 microns long before dividing in the middle to form two new cells. This prevents any single cell becoming too large or small.</p><p>A similar phenomenon has been observed in other types of cells, so it is clear that cells must be able to measure their own size, and then use that information to trigger cell division. A number of proteins that regulate cell size and cell division in fission yeast have now been identified. These proteins form a pathway in which a protein called pom1p inhibits another protein, cdr2p, which in turn causes a third protein, cdk1p, to start the process of cell division. However, the details of the measurement process and the property that the cells are actually measuring—surface area, volume, mass or something else—remain mysterious.</p><p>Pan et al. have now used imaging techniques and mathematical modeling to probe the distribution and movements of proteins in fission yeast cells. Their results do not support a previous model in which the cell uses the gradient of pom1p as a ruler to measure cell length. Rather, Pan et al. propose a new model in which the level of cdr2p is used to sense the size of the cell. Individual molecules of cdr2p come together to from clusters called nodes on the cell membrane. As the cell grows larger, more and more cdr2p proteins accumulate in these nodes, which are found in a band around the middle of the cell. When the cells reaches a critical cell size, the increased concentration of cdr2p at these nodes may help to trigger the start of cell division.</p><p>By examining cells that grow at different rates, Pan et al. show that the rate of accumulation of cdr2p in the nodes depends on how big the cells are, rather than on the length of time that has elapsed. Analysis of fission yeast cells of different shapes shows that cell division starts when the surface area of the cell grows to a certain value, as opposed to starting when the volume or length reach a given value.</p><p>Pan et al. also show that cdr2p binds to all parts of the cell membrane, not just to the nodes near the middle, and go on to provide a simple mathematical model showing how this property can allow cells to measure their surface area. However, as Pan et al. point out, this is probably just one component of a larger mechanism that tells cells when they need to divide.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02040.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02040.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cell size control</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM056836</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J004588/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EMBL Interdisciplinary Postdoc Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saunders</surname><given-names>Timothy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Singapore National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saunders</surname><given-names>Timothy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MEC/ Fulbright Postdoctoral Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flor-Parra</surname><given-names>Ignacio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>It is shown that fission yeast cells sense their size by measuring their surface area through a membrane-associated sizer protein cdr2p.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The fundamental process by which a cell controls its own size is not understood for any cell type. In actively dividing cells, growth, and size need to be coordinated for cells to maintain their size. In several cell types, cells have been shown to have a size threshold, in which they need to grow to a minimal cell size before committing to cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Turner et al., 2012</xref>). This mechanism however requires that cells somehow monitor their own size. The molecular mechanism for how size is sensed, and what aspect of size—surface area, volume, mass, linear dimensions etc—is monitored remains unknown.</p><p>The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is an attractive eukaryotic model for cell size studies because of its highly regular dimensions, simple rod-shape, and growth patterns. During interphase, these cells grow from the cell tips at a nearly constant rate to approximately 14 µm in length before entering mitosis, when cell growth ceases until the next cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mitchison and Nurse, 1985</xref>). Genetic analyses in fission yeast have identified a pathway of conserved protein kinases for cell size control: the DYRK kinase pom1p is an inhibitor of the SAD family kinase cdr2p, which inhibits wee1p, which in turn inhibits the cell division kinase cdk1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Russell and Nurse, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breeding et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). Loss of function of <italic>pom1</italic> and <italic>wee1</italic> leads to abnormally short cells, whereas loss of function of <italic>cdr2</italic> leads to abnormally long ones. Interestingly, these factors largely localize to different sites in the cell. Pom1p localizes in cortical gradients emanating from cell tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahler and Pringle, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Padte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). Cdr2p localizes to a medial band of plasma membrane protein complexes termed ‘nodes’, which overlie the medial nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morrell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). Wee1p, Cdk1p, and other regulators of mitotic entry localize primarily to the spindle pole body and nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfa et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Masuda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grallert et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>How this pathway may be used to sense cell size remains unclear. A current model for cell size control is based on pom1p concentration gradients as ‘rulers’ to sense cell length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vilela et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tostevin, 2011</xref>). This gradient model postulates that as these cells grow in length from their tips, pom1p gradients are moved away from cdr2p nodes at mid-cell, causing decreased pom1p levels at the medial cortex. This putative decrease would then allow for activation of cdr2p, leading to cdk1p activation and entry into mitosis when cells reach a critical length.</p><p>Here, we use quantitative imaging and modeling to examine the relationships of pom1p and cdr2p with cell size. We find that core assumptions of the previous pom1p gradient model are not consistent with experimental findings. We further develop a novel model in which cells monitor their size using cdr2p itself as a cortical sizer molecule to probe the surface area of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Testing the pom1p gradient model for size control</title><p>To test the pom1p gradient model, we quantitatively analyzed pom1p in living cells expressing a functional pom1-tomato-dimer fusion protein at near-endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Padte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). Pom1p cortical gradients exhibit large cell-to-cell variability in intensity and distribution, fluctuate over time in individual cells, and show little consistent change with cell length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). This variability, plus a short decay length relative to cell length, led us to question whether these gradients can function reliably as ‘rulers’. One of the key predictions of the gradient-based model is that pom1p levels decrease on the medial cortex as cells grow. We measured pom1p concentration in a 3-µm region along the medial cortex, where cdr2p nodes are located. Using time-averaged data (reducing fluctuations in the gradient over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>]), we detected low but measurable intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, measurements of pom1-tomato at the medial cortex showed no detectable decrease with cell length in a population of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), or in individual cells imaged over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These cortical measurements improve on previously reported pom1p measurements that integrate intensities over the whole cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>), which have artifacts stemming from the normal exclusion of pom1p from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2 fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 2,3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02040.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gradient distribution of pom1p is not the basis for cell size control.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time-averaged spinning disc confocal images of fission yeast cells expressing pom1-tomato in a medial focal plane (60 frames over 3 min).

(2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean (2009)</xref> showed, in contrast to what we see, that pom1p levels in the middle of the cell decrease with cell length. In the measurements of these papers, pom1p fluorescence in the whole cell was collapsed onto a single line. This method of image analysis differs from our approach of measuring pom1p intensity only on the cortex, where the gradient distribution is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. We plotted measurements of pom1p in the middle of the cell as a function of cell length using different methods and data sets. The data from Moseley et al. (Figure S12 of that publication) is presented here (after normalization to the value for cells with length &lt;8.5 μm) as the black bars. We found a similar trend using the same whole cell analysis on our own images of pom1-tomato cells (blue bars), n &gt; 20 in each binning of cell lengths. pom1p is detectable at a low constant level all through the cytoplasm, but is not detectable in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether this difference between whole cell and cortical measurements may be due to lack of pom1p in the nucleus. We adjusted for the effect of the nucleus by filling the nucleus with the average cytoplasmic pom1p intensity in silico. This adjustment largely abrogated the length-dependent decrease of pom1p intensity (red bars). We speculate that the decrease seen in the whole cell measurements may be due to the slightly larger size of the nucleus in larger cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neumann and Nurse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the decrease seen in the previous publications may (partially) be an artifact of including cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence in addition to the cortical distribution. Strain used: FC2054.

Based on our experiments, this model postulates that: (1) the concentration of cdr2p in the cytoplasm is homogeneous and changes only slightly with cell length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>); (2) cytoplasmic cdr2p molecules can bind all over the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>), and subsequently move rapidly by diffusion on the cortex; (3) cortical cdr2p molecules can transition to associate with a nodal region on the medial cortex. Note that the details of the formation and growth of individual nodes are beyond the scope of the model. Rather, we simply model the overall number of cdr2p molecules in the nodal region. (4) Both cortical and nodal cdr2p can then unbind and return cdr2p to the cytoplasm; (5) cytoplasmic cdr2p can then diffuse rapidly before rebinding to the membrane. As the timescale of cell growth (hours) is much slower than the timescale of the cdr2p dynamics (minutes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), we assumed that the molecular system is, at any given time, effectively in steady state. This steady-state assumption is also consistent with experimental findings that cdr2p levels at nodes are stable over time when cells are not growing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) was implemented by two mass-action equations for cortical and nodal cdr2p, and solved analytically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the model reveals how the cdr2p dynamics ensure a nodal cdr2p density that scales with cell size, or more specifically, with the surface area of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The simplicity of the model allowed us to clarify the two key elements important for this area sensing. The first is that the area of the nodal region must not scale proportionally with the total cell membrane area as the cell size increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We then have one process (cdr2p membrane association) that scales proportionally with cell area, with a second process (uptake of cortical cdr2p into the nodes), which does not. The second key element is that the nodal region receives information via cdr2p about the entire surface area of the cell. In this model, cdr2p needs to be able bind the membrane long enough to move on the membrane to reach the nodal region. The outcome is then a rising cdr2p nodal density with increasing cell area. Using the experimentally determined nodal/cortical areas, and with other parameters measured/constrained from our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’), we fitted the cdr2p density in the medial nodes as a function of cell length to that measured experimentally, with good results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Note that wild-type <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells are rod-shaped and have an approximately constant width, so that surface area and cell length are proportional to one another. A more sophisticated version of the same underlying model, including spatially varying cdr2p on the cortex, generated similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–F</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>In addition, alternative models in which cdr2p does not need to diffuse long distances on the plasma membrane to the nodes are also consistent with the current findings. We analyzed a model in which cdr2p was now modified (e.g., phosphorylated) at the cortex and remains modified for a period even if it returns into the cytoplasm, from where it then can diffuse to and accumulate at the nodal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The underlying area-sensing mechanism was nevertheless conserved in this alternative model, with similar key elements as discussed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Cdr2p scales with cell surface area not volume</title><p>A central prediction of the modeling is that cdr2p is sensing the surface area of the cell: cdr2p at nodes should scale with surface area, and not, for instance, cell volume. To experimentally test if cdr2p scales with surface area or volume, we analyzed cdr2p levels in <italic>S. pombe</italic> mutants with different widths, so that surface area and volume are uncoupled.

Conversely, in considering cells of similar volume but with a range of different surface areas, cdr2-GFP nodal intensity correlated with surface area and not volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

In <italic>pom1Δ</italic> cells, cdr2-GFP is spread in dots throughout much of the cortex, except for the growing cell tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Celton-Morizur et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Padte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). The total amount of cdr2p in the cell was similar in wild-type and <italic>pom1Δ</italic> mutant cells over a range of cell lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Cortical profiles showed that in <italic>pom1Δ</italic> cells, cdr2p was still enriched over the medial cortex and that the non-growing end had levels roughly half that of the medial region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The fraction of cdr2p that is cortical and the area of nodal cdr2p were both substantially increased in <italic>pom1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). Interestingly, the increase of cortical cdr2p with cell length was similar in <italic>pom1</italic>Δ vs wild-type cells, but the curve was shifted slightly upwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). In contrast, in the medial cortical region, cdr2p levels were lower than wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). A simple interpretation is that cdr2p is able to signal to promote entry into mitosis from nodes on non-medial sites in this mutant. However, another factor to consider is that cdr2p kinase activity may also be altered in these cells. Time-lapse imaging showed that cdr2p nodes are more motile in <italic>pom1Δ</italic> cells than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media3">Videos 1, 3</xref>), suggesting a defect in the anchoring of these nodes in the membrane. At the growing end, there are also the dim cortical motile cdr2p dots, similar to those present at cell ends in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

We provide evidence that cells sense a critical cell size by measuring cell surface area rather than, for example, cell volume or absolute length, a mechanism that could function regardless of the cell shape. As the cell grows, the concentration of cdr2p at the medial cortex increases. We have developed models explaining how cdr2p probes the surface area of the cell, and conveys this information to the medial cortex. There, cdr2p may signal to cell cycle regulators located on the nearby spindle pole body and nucleus (see below). When the cell reaches a critical size, cdr2p at the nodes may reach a critical local concentration that promotes mitotic entry.</p><p>Our quantitative models show how cdr2p can convey information about global cell area and deliver it in the form of a local (nodal) concentration. This size-sensing model shares elements with a proposed microtubule length control mechanism termed the ‘antenna model’. In the microtubule model, longer microtubules bind more motor proteins, which then accumulate at the microtubule end in a length-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Varga et al., 2006</xref>). In the cell size sensing case, the whole surface area of the plasma membrane may be regarded as an ‘antenna’. Similar to the microtubule model, the property of cdr2p to first bind to the plasma membrane ‘antenna’ (as opposed to merely binding the nodes directly) is critical for this mechanism to read out cell size. This membrane cdr2p must then transit to the nodal region, where the cdr2p nodal density serves as a read-out of cell area. Although cdr2p may not exhibit directed motor-driven movements, this movement can still occur by diffusion along the membrane. We also considered an alternative model, where cdr2p is modified on the membrane, but after unbinding is able to diffuse through the cytoplasm to the nodes. The modification allows information about membrane area to be preserved in the cytoplasm, from where it can be relayed to the nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, as the amount of nodal cdr2p reflects cell size rather than time, we postulate that the system is effectively in a dynamic steady state at a given cell size, with fast cdr2p dynamics compared to the timescales of cell growth.</p><p>The localization of a cdr2p sizer at cortical nodes provides several key advantages over other locales. First, it allows the local concentration of nodal cdr2p to increase as the cell grows. Previously proposed mechanisms have been based upon nuclear concentration or the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of a sizer, but in many cell types (including fission yeast), nuclear volume also increases as cells grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neumann and Nurse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Second, we speculate that medial cortical placement of nodes surrounding the medial nucleus may allow cdr2p to communicate its local concentration to presumed targets such as wee1p and cdk1p on the nucleus. Although wee1p can be observed at some nodes upon overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>), its localization in late G2-phase is clear in the nucleus, and at the spindle pole body (SPB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Masuda et al., 2011</xref>), a structure on the nuclear envelope situated close (often &lt;0.5 μm) to the nodes. Cdk1/cyclin B and polo kinase are also located at the SPB and nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfa et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Masuda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grallert et al., 2013</xref>). Potentially, the SPB could detect local gradients of cdr2p (or other molecules) emanating from nearby cortical nodes. However, as a simple cdr2p concentration gradient in the cytoplasm is expected to be very shallow (due to rapid diffusion), it is likely that additional layers of regulation such as through phosphorylation states or diffusion barriers would be needed to generate suitably steep gradients. The potential importance of the geometric relationship between the nodes and SPB/nucleus remains to be tested.</p><p>The localization of these nodes to the medial cortical region involves multiple inputs. One important contributor is pom1p. Although pom1p clearly regulates cdr2p function and phosphorylation, our data indicate that the pom1p gradient distribution may not be the primary size sensing mechanism as previously proposed. Indeed, our data are consistent with a recent report that size correction still occurs in <italic>pom1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wood and Nurse, 2013</xref>). Rather, a primary role of pom1p may be to ensure the medial localization of nodes. Thus, pom1p may affect cdr2p nodes in part by affecting distribution and general properties (such as its mobility in the membrane) of the nodes. Recent studies (published while this work was in press) suggest that cdr2p activity is also regulated by phosphorylation by pom1p and ssp1p protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6a">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14a">Deng et al., 2014</xref>). Another important factor in cdr2p localization is likely to be the nucleus that is situated in the cell interior with roughly the same width as the nodal region. Studies on mid1p, another component of the nodes, suggest that the nucleus governs dynamic nodal localization, in a mechanism that may involve nuclear shuttling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paoletti and Chang, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daga and Chang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almonacid et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the organization of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum also influences nodal stability and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). There are also likely to be additional (or alternative) inputs into size control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coudreuse and Nurse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Navarro and Nurse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wood and Nurse, 2013</xref>). Additional cell size regulators include the cell tip protein nif1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wood and Nurse, 2013</xref>), and skb1p, which localizes to cortical patches distinct from the nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng and Moseley, 2013</xref>). Cells expressing a cdk1p–cyclinB fusion still exhibit apparently near-normal size control in the absence of wee1p/mik1p or cdk1p-tyrosine phosphorylation control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coudreuse and Nurse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Navarro and Nurse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wood and Nurse, 2013</xref>), suggesting the existence of controls that are entirely independent of cdk1–tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, this simple cdr2p-based mechanism is likely to be a core component of a larger network responsible for cell size control.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>S. pombe</italic> strain construction</title><p>Standard methods for <italic>S. pombe</italic> growth and genetics were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moreno et al., 1991</xref>).

(A) Maximum projections were made of 13 slices of confocal sections taken 0.4 μm apart. A region of interest (ROI) was selected in ImageJ by hand around the cdr2p nodes, excluding as much background as possible. The area and total intensity of the ROI was recorded, and the ROI width was determined by the spread of cdr2p nodes along the long axis of the cell. (B) Similar to (A) but the maximum projection was taken from the top three slices consisting of the ‘top’ cortical section of the cell. (C) Similar to (A), except the ROI was selected by an image analysis program in Matlab (custom-written) which selected only pixels over a predetermined threshold (approximately two times the mean background intensity). In this case, the width was not determined. (D) Maximum projections were taken similar to (A). We used the Find Maxima macro function in ImageJ to find the brightest pixel from a local intensity source (likely nodes), counting their number and totaling their intensity to estimate total intensity levels. In this case, width was also not determined. (E) We used a single confocal section through the middle of the cell and acquired images over 30 s. A region was then chosen for each time-averaged data set that overlapped the nodal region (now seen as a line on the perimeter of the cell) in a single pixel wide line that was 3 µm long. The intensity was measured from that line and summed. (F) Maximum projections were made of 13 slices of confocal sections taken 0.4 μm apart. Individual cells were then taken and rotated so their long axis was horizontal. A rectangular ROI was fixed at 3 μm wide and 3.72 μm tall for all cells and placed at the center of the nodal region. The mean intensity was then recorded in this fixed area.</p><p>In all these instances, the mean background intensity from an area outside of the cells was subtracted for each pixel. These different methods all resulted in the same linear increase of cdr2-GFP intensity levels in the nodal region as a function of increasing cell length. However, due to the fact that each method measured cdr2-GFP levels in different ways, the exact slope and variance of the correlation differed from method to method.</p><p>The single cell analyses of cdr2-GFP in the wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>) used 13 confocal sections 0.4 µm apart.

The rate of change in nodal cdr2p intensity with time was also calculated by a least squares linear fitting. In both the cases, the error on the fit was found for each cell. To test whether a positive correlation between growth and cdr2p accumulation rates was robust, we performed numerical simulations using the distributions of the measured rates, and their errors, to create in silico data. Corresponding to each pair of values in the measured data set, we created a new in silico pair by drawing from Gaussian distributions with widths given by the measured errors in growth rate and cdr2p accumulation rate. We then performed a linear least squares fitting on each in silico data set to find the level of correlation and test whether it was greater than zero—that is whether a positive correlation existed between cdr2p accumulation rate and cell growth rate. Repeating this process 10<sup>6</sup> times, we found a probability of ∼0.0005 that a positive correlation would be absent. Hence, our conclusion of a positive correlation between the cdr2p accumulation rate and cell growth rate is robust.

The rate of cdr2p disassociation from the nodes back into the cytoplasm, η, can be estimated from our FRAP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We find that the cdr2p has a nodal occupancy time of around 3 min. We can therefore estimate <italic>η</italic> = 5 × 10<sup>−3</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>.</p><p>Much higher concentrations of cdr2p in the nodes are experimentally observed than elsewhere on the cortex.

This constraint places a lower bound on <italic>α</italic>, and consistently we choose <italic>α</italic> = 1.0 s<sup>−1</sup>.</p><p>Experimentally, we observe significant scaling of <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>nod</italic></sub> with increasing <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>cor</italic></sub> (or equivalently with cell length in the wild type). For this to occur, our model requires that two key criteria be met. First, the cortical cdr2p must be much more likely to be taken up into the nodes than disassociate from the cortex, that is from above <italic>ν/α</italic> ≪ 1. Since <italic>α</italic> is already constrained, we have a further restriction on <italic>ν</italic>. Accordingly, we choose <italic>ν</italic> = 5 × 10<sup>−3</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, meaning that the cdr2p disassociation rates from the nodes and cortex are the same. Second, A<sub><italic>nod</italic></sub>, the area of the nodal region, must not scale proportionally with <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>cor</italic></sub>, the total cell area, as the cell size increases. Importantly, this model requirement was verified experimentally, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. Although the cdr2p does spread to an extent during growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the majority of nodal cdr2p is localized to the center of the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, we take A<sub><italic>nod</italic></sub> to be constant in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> fitting. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, we also include the effect of A<sub><italic>nod</italic></sub> increasing with cell length (see below).</p><p>Finally, the model also included the experimentally observed (slight) decrease in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> as a function of cell length, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref> black line (gradient = −0.01 µm<sup>−1</sup> after normalization to the average cytoplasmic intensity).

The concentration of nodal cdr2p is now independent of cell size, assuming <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>cyt</italic></sub> is constant. A similar conclusion is reached if the nodes can form anywhere on the cortex by direct association of cdr2p from the cytoplasm. In both cases, the system cannot sense cell area because both association and disassociation occur over the same region. To sense cell area we require one process, which here is the association of cdr2p anywhere onto the membrane, to scale proportionally with cell area. However, the second process, which here is the uptake of cortical cdr2p into the nodes, must be localized over a region whose size does not scale proportionally with the total cell area as the cell grows.

The value of ν is also not important for the behavior of <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>nod</italic></sub> (see above), though we use a value of ν = 0.5 s<sup>−1</sup> to ensure low levels of cortical cdr2p, as observed experimentally. We again use the FRAP data to estimate <italic>η</italic> = 5 × 10<sup>−3</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>. Since <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>nod</italic></sub> = <italic>(α/η) ρ</italic><sup><italic>*</italic></sup><sub><italic>cyt</italic></sub>, we take <italic>α</italic> = 0.5 µms<sup>−1</sup> so that the concentration of modified cdr2p in the nodal region is relatively large compared to that in the cytoplasm (required since there is no observed scaling of cytoplasmic cdr2p concentration with cell length). Further, we use a low rate of spontaneous modification loss µ = 0.03 s<sup>−1</sup>, so that the lifetime of modified, cytoplasmic cdr2p is relatively long. The fitting of this model to the experimental scaling of cdr2p is shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>In this model, the mechanism of size scaling is similar to that of model I. One process, the unbinding of cortical cdr2p can occur from anywhere on the membrane, and so scales proportionally with cell area. However, a second process, in this case the uptake of modified, cytoplasmic cdr2p into the nodes, occurs over a region whose area does not scale proportionally with the total cell area as the cell grows. The outcome is again a density (for both <italic>ρ</italic><sup><italic>*</italic></sup><sub><italic>cyt</italic></sub> and <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>nod</italic></sub>) that scales with total cell membrane area. The presence of the modified form of cdr2p is vital, so that information about membrane area can be protected and relayed to the nodes without being lost into the general cytoplasmic cdr2p population, which does not show size scaling characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Role of pom1p in nodal cdr2p scaling</title><p>The model does not explicitly include pom1p. However, this does not mean that pom1p is unimportant in the regulation of nodal cdr2p. As the <italic>pom1</italic>Δ experiments demonstrate, without pom1p acting as a tip inhibitor for cdr2p, nodal cdr2p can form in an extended part of the cell, with such cells observed to divide at shorter lengths. Conversely, in pom1p mutants where pom1p is mistargeted all over the plasma membrane, cdr2p does not form localized regions of high nodal concentration, with such cells dividing at longer lengths. Therefore, pom1p appears to play an important role in defining the region of nodal cdr2p accumulation, without which the cdr2p-dependent control of cell length is perturbed. Accordingly, pom1p is implicitly included in the model by defining a spatially limited region that can be occupied by the cdr2p nodes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

This referee has pointed out ways in which image analysis can be improved.</p><p>Below are a number of points the referees have raised (reproduced verbatim), addressing which will make the paper potentially suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Pan et al. addresses the interesting and important question of how cell size homeostasis is established using fission yeast as a model, since fission yeast cells divide uniformly at a fixed size. The size at division is a manifestation of the size at which cells enter M phase. Influential previous work from Martin and Nurse laboratories have argued that a gradient of the protein kianse Pom1 serves to inhibit the medially localized Cdr2 until the Pom1 concentration reaches a low level in the Cdr2 containing zone and causing Cdr2 activation. This in turn fixes cell size at division and links growth to division.</p><p>The main claim of the Chang paper is that Pom1 cannot function in a gradient, since using improved image analysis tools such gradients are not seen in the current study. Pan et al. attribute the gradients observed by Nurse and Martin groups as a consequence of Z-projection of the entire cell fluorescence into a single line, whereas Pan et al. are only looking at cortical Cdr2.</p><p>I am not entirely sold on the Nurse/Martin models and I believe thus an alternative mechanism for cell size control is certainly welcome. That said, the authors do not advance their model (i.e., the number of Cdr2 nodes themselves function as a ruler) sufficiently to merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Some of the main issues:</p><p>1) It will be important for the authors to provide a mechanism of how increased Cdr2 node numbers contributes to mitotic entry. One scenario that can be imagined is that Cdr2 is constitutively active and its concentration in the cell middle regulates mitotic entry. Is this the case? Other scenarios can be imagined as well.</p><p>2) The overexpression of <italic>cdr2</italic> and its shut down should be done with GFP tagged versions to see if the model Pan et al. are advancing holds up. i.e the reduced size at division is a direct effect of increased Cdr2 nodes and vice versa (as opposed to protein levels directly affecting division length).</p><p>3) The Nurse and Martin studies have performed a vast array of genetic epistasis experiments. How is the model proposed by Pan et al. reconciled with the published epistasis data.</p><p>4) It will be important for Pan et al. to express either the PMT1-Pom1 fusion (Nurse paper) or Tea1-Pom1 fusion (Martin paper) and see whether node numbers are reduced the way Pan et al. carry out image processing. This was a key experiment in the Nurse and Martin lab papers.</p><p>5) The <italic>for3</italic> experiment is interesting, but cell size at birth has not been factored into the experiment, which can complicate interpretation.</p><p>6) The relationship between <italic>cdr2</italic> and <italic>pom1</italic> needs to be established better. For example is there a precocious accumulation of Cdr2 nodes (albeit at wrong locations) at premature mitotic entry. If so, this says that the Pan et al. mechanism needs to be modified since the proximity of Cdr2 nodes to the cell middle does not seem to influence timing of mitotic entry.</p><p>In summary, an interesting alternative model that needs to be developed a lot further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript uses the fission yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic> to investigate how cells divide at a precise size. Two previous papers from the Moseley/Nurse and Martin labs proposed a model for how <italic>S. pombe</italic> measures size. The model is based on the observed spatial separation of two antagonistic regulators of cell size (Cdr2 and Pom1). Cdr2 promotes mitotic entry and localizes to medial cortical nodes and Pom1 antagonizes Cdr2 and localizes in a gradient emanating from cell tips. The model proposes that increase in cell length causes reduction in medial Pom1 and activation of Cdr2/mitotic entry. This manuscript challenges the existing model by showing that the concentration of Pom1 at the medial cortex does not change as cells elongate. Based on their data showing that the concentration of Cdr2 at nodes increases with cell size (even though the overall concentration of the protein does not change significantly) the authors propose that cells “measure” size through levels of medial Cdr2. A mathematical model is described to explain the size dependent increase in Cdr2 node concentration. Central to this model is the assumption that Cdr2 must first load onto the membrane from where it can laterally diffuse to medial nodes and be incorporated into node structures. In this way, the concentration of Cdr2 in medial nodes would depend on the surface area of the cell.</p><p>The strength of the paper is its data challenging the central premise of the existing model, and the discovery of length dependent increase in Cdr2 levels. The major weakness of the paper is the lack of data supporting their alternative model. I am sure that there are many other alternative models that (in absence of supporting data) could be mathematically modeled. Thus I think that for the manuscript to constitute a major advance, there needs to be some test of the model. Listed below are several questions I have about the model and potential ways to test it.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) The assumption that Cdr2 must bind membrane and then diffuse “rapidly” to medial nodes does not make sense to me. Why couldn't Cdr2 go directly from the cytoplasm to nodes, since diffusion is much faster in the cytoplasm than in the plasma membrane.</p><p>2) Comparison of Cdr2 node levels in round cells to that in cylindrical cells of the same volume should be informative. Because the surface area is greater in cylindrical cells, the levels of Cdr2 in nodes should be higher in the cylindrical cells.</p><p>3) Although Cdr2 levels in medial nodes increase with cell size, the increase is quite small, and I wonder whether such a small increase is sufficient to trigger mitotic entry.</p><p>4) Because nodal Cdr2 spreads away from the cell middle in <italic>pom1Δ</italic> mutants, the proposed model would predict that these cells should enter mitosis at a larger size because Cdr2 is farther away from its target Wee1 at the SPB. In fact <italic>pom1Δ</italic> cells divide at reduced cell size. Some effort to incorporate Pom1 into the model seems warranted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#3:</italic></p><p>This paper by Pan et al. describes a new model for cell-size control in fission yeast. Cell-size control is a fundamental and difficult question for all cell types. The fission yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic> has a regular rod shape and divides at a reproducible cell length and a constant cell diameter. Combined with other advantages as a model system, the fission yeast is one of the best systems to study the molecular mechanisms of cell-size control. Previous studies have proposed an elegant and simple model for the regulation of cell size: Pom1 polar gradient and Cdr2 kinase-based interphase nodes work together to control mitotic entry and cell size. One line of key evidence of the model is that the Pom1 polar gradient has highest concentration at the cell pole and lowest concentration in cell middle, which decreases as cells grow. When cells reach a certain length, Pom1 gradient cannot inhibit Cdr2 kinase activity in the nodes, then Cdk1 kinase becomes active and cells enter mitosis.</p><p>The new work from Pan et al. proposes a new Cdr2-based model based on rigorous data analyses and mathematical modeling. They find that Pom1 concentration at cell middle does not change during cell growth, instead the Cdr2 concentration increases with cell length. They pointed out that nuclear exclusion of Pom1 accounts for the differences. The data in this high quality work are very convincing and well supported by the careful controls. I do not have major concerns for this elegant study.</p><p>The minor concerns listed below are not essential for the main conclusion of this paper.</p><p>1) I do not understand why the mean background outside the cells was subtracted when measuring fluorescence intensity. When measuring cortical Pom1 and Cdr2 intensity, most background in the ROI should come from diffused molecules within the cells. Thus, it might be better to use the cytoplasm as background. This will not affect the main conclusion of this study. Instead, it will make the increase of Cdr2 intensity at cell middle more obvious since Cdr2 global concentration decreases slightly when cells grow longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>2) It is impressive that six methods were used to measure Cdr2 fluorescence in cortical nodes. However, five of them are based on maximum-intensity projections. The sum-intensity projections are more suitable since the total proteins in each nodes instead of maximum pixel intensity might be most important for cell-size control. This may explain the steeper slopes of all other panel except E in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, each cell has only about 30 to 40 nodes. This might be an underestimation due to large z spacing (∼0.4 μm). To count node number accurately, much smaller slice spacing, like 0.05 or 0.1 μm, is needed.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Cortical regulation of cell size by a sizer cdr2p” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. Based on these discussions, we would like you to address the two points raised below.</p><p>1) One of the reviewers (#2) has made a point about computing Cdr2 gradients near the SPB and it seems reasonable to attempt this given that you have the relevant information on Cdr2 concentration. The referee's point is provided verbatim below:</p><p>“Whether increased medial Cdr2 is in fact what triggers mitotic entry is still not clear. The authors suggest that Cdr2 localization at the medial cortex could generate a concentration gradient that extends to the SPB where the Cdr2 target Wee1 resides. As Cdr2 medial concentration increases with cell elongation, it is proposed that the Cdr2 concentration at the SPB would increase until it is sufficient to inactivate Wee1. I have some concern about this idea because cytoplasmic gradients are likely to be very steep given the high rates of diffusion. Given that the authors know both the Cdr2 concentration at the medial cortex and the turnover rate they could calculate how steep the gradient from the cortex is likely to be and whether the concentration of Cdr2 around the SPB would actually change significantly as cells elongate.

The size at division is a manifestation of the size at which cells enter M phase. Influential previous work from Martin and Nurse laboratories have argued that a gradient of the protein kianse Pom1 serves to inhibit the medially localized Cdr2 until the Pom1 concentration reaches a low level in the Cdr2 containing zone and causing Cdr2 activation. This in turn fixes cell size at division and links growth to division</italic>.</p><p><italic>The main claim of the Chang paper is that Pom1 cannot function in a gradient, since using improved image analysis tools such gradients are not seen in the current study. Pan et al. attribute the gradients observed by Nurse and Martin groups as a consequence of Z-projection of the entire cell fluorescence into a single line, whereas Pan et al. are only looking at cortical Cdr2</italic>.</p><p><italic>I am not entirely sold on the Nurse/Martin models and I believe thus an alternative mechanism for cell size control is certainly welcome. That said, the authors do not advance their model (i.e., the number of Cdr2 nodes themselves function as a ruler) sufficiently to merit publication in</italic> eLife<italic>.</italic></p><p><italic>Some of the</italic> <italic>main issues:</italic></p><p><italic>1) It will be important for the authors to provide a mechanism of how increased Cdr2 node numbers contributes to mitotic entry. One scenario that can be imagined is that Cdr2 is constitutively active and its concentration in the cell middle regulates mitotic entry. Is this the case? Other scenarios can be imagined as well</italic>.</p><p>The events downstream of Cdr2 are conceptually a different problem, and are beyond the scope of this work. Our study aims to understand how the concentration of Cdr2 at the medial cortex is able to act as a cell size sensor. Given our data ruling out Pom1-based mechanisms, resolving this issue is, we believe, by far the most pressing question. How this information is subsequently read out is a separate issue. We also note that this read out was not addressed by the earlier Martin/Nurse studies. In the Discussion, we simply point out that some of the downstream targets such as Wee1 and Cdc2 are located at the spindle pole body, so that communication between Cdr2 and these targets, perhaps by concentration gradients, may be occurring. Providing additional understanding of this step, through study of Cdr2 biochemical activity, would constitute a different study.</p><p><italic>2) The overexpression of</italic> cdr2 <italic>and its shut down should be done with GFP tagged versions to see if the model Pan et al. are advancing holds up. i.e the reduced size at division is a direct effect of increased Cdr2 nodes and vice versa (as opposed to protein levels directly affecting division length)</italic>.</p><p>Our experiments were performed with untagged Cdr2 in which mRNA measurements showed a 1.6 fold increase. We agree that it would be good to visualize Cdr2 in these cells. However, no Cdr2 antibody is available. We did try similar experiments with a Cdr2-GFP construct. This construct did not, however, show consistent cell shortening. We are concerned that this construct produces dominant negative effects when overexpressed, which cause some cell lengthening effects on top of the predicted cell shortening effects.</p><p><italic>3) The Nurse and Martin studies have performed a vast array of genetic epistasis experiments. How is the model proposed by Pan et al. reconciled with the published epistasis data</italic>.</p><p>Our model is consistent with all the genetic epistasis data. We do not dispute that Pom1 is an inhibitor of Cdr2. We have included new data on quantitating Cdr2 in pom1Δ and PMT-pom1C mutants (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) It will be important for Pan et al. to express either the PMT1-Pom1 fusion (Nurse paper) or Tea1-Pom1 fusion (Martin paper) and see whether node numbers are reduced the way Pan et al. carry out image processing. This was a key experiment in the Nurse and Martin lab papers</italic>.</p><p>We have performed this experiment with PMT-Pom1C fusion from the Moseley paper. We find that the cortical Cdr2 intensity levels are reduced in these strains, and that these cells divide at long lengths. These data provide support for our model that the levels of Cdr2 at the medial nodes are important for its ability to regulate cell size.</p><p><italic>5) The</italic> for3 <italic>experiment is interesting, but cell size at birth has not been factored into the experiment, which can complicate interpretation</italic>.</p><p>The cell sizes are initially very similar, as these cells divide largely medially. Moreover, we show time lapse images of some representative cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Growth rates are generally not dependent on cell size in fission yeast (as shown by near-linear growth curves). Overall we do not believe the cell size at birth issue is a concern for our <italic>for3</italic> experiment analysis.</p><p><italic>6) The relationship between</italic> cdr2 <italic>and</italic> pom1 <italic>needs to be established better. For example is there a precocious accumulation of Cdr2 nodes (albeit at wrong locations) at premature mitotic entry. If so, this says that the Pan et al. mechanism needs to be modified since the proximity of Cdr2 nodes to the cell middle does not seem to influence timing of mitotic entry</italic>.</p><p>To address this point, we have added new data that quantitate Cdr2 in <italic>pom1Δ</italic> mutants and in a mutant where Pom1 is mis-targeted. In the <italic>pom1Δ</italic> cells, there are more cortical Cdr2 nodes all around half the cortex. The levels of Cdr2 in the medial region are actually decreased. Thus, the small size of <italic>pom1Δ</italic> cells suggests that Cdr2 may signal, at least to an extent, from all over the cortex. This is not inconsistent with the notion that Cdr2 coming off from the nodes is activating the downstream steps on the nucleus in this</p><p><italic>In summary, an interesting alternative model that needs to be developed a lot further for publication in</italic> eLife<italic>.</italic></p><p>We have also added important new data showing that Cdr2 and cell size at mitosis scale with cell surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), rather than, for example, volume. This was done in part in response to Reviewer 2 (see responses to the Editor and Reviewer 2). This data not only significantly supports our modeling, it also strengthens the broader concept that cells may sense their surface area. We feel that we have now significantly improved the manuscript and believe that it is now suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>This manuscript uses the fission yeast</italic> S. pombe <italic>to investigate how cells divide at a precise size. Two previous papers from the Moseley/Nurse and Martin labs proposed a model for how</italic> S. pombe <italic>measures size. The model is based on the observed spatial separation of two antagonistic regulators of cell size (Cdr2 and Pom1). Cdr2 promotes mitotic entry and localizes to medial cortical nodes and Pom1 antagonizes Cdr2 and localizes in a gradient emanating from cell tips. The model proposes that increase in cell length causes reduction in medial Pom1 and activation of Cdr2/mitotic entry. This manuscript challenges the existing model by showing that the concentration of Pom1 at the medial cortex does not change as cells elongate. Based on their data showing that the concentration of Cdr2 at nodes increases with cell size (even though the overall concentration of the protein does not change significantly) the authors propose that cells “measure” size through levels of medial Cdr2. A mathematical model is described to explain the size dependent increase in Cdr2 node concentration. Central to this model is the assumption that Cdr2 must first load onto the membrane from where it can laterally diffuse to medial nodes and be incorporated into node structures. In this way, the concentration of Cdr2 in medial nodes would depend on the surface area of the cell</italic>.</p><p><italic>The strength of the paper is its data challenging the central premise of the existing model, and the discovery of length dependent increase in Cdr2 levels. The major weakness of the paper is the lack of data supporting their alternative model. I am sure that there are many other alternative models that (in absence of supporting data) could be mathematically modeled. Thus I think that for the manuscript to constitute a major advance, there needs to be some test of the model. Listed below are several questions I have about the model and potential ways to test it</italic>.</p><p>We have added important new data that tests our modeling, as requested by the reviewer. The most important test is that by measuring cells with different shapes, we show that Cdr2 scales with surface area and not volume, and that cell size at division also correlates with surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is an interesting and highly significant validation of a key model prediction. We also note that even if details of the models are not completely correct, our result that surface area may be being sensed will have broad impact. We thank this reviewer for encouraging this very productive and interesting line of experiments.</p><p>We agree that there are always ever more complex models that can be imagined to work. The aim of this work was to propose and then test simple models that have provided us with a conceptual breakthrough of how size sensing could function. It has not been at all intuitive how such size sensing might work, and we were delighted that our simple models have proven sufficient to explain the data.</p><p><italic>Specific</italic> <italic>points:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The assumption that Cdr2 must bind membrane and then diffuse “rapidly” to medial nodes does not make sense to me. Why couldn't Cdr2 go directly from the cytoplasm to nodes, since diffusion is much faster in the cytoplasm than in the plasma membrane</italic>.</p><p>A simple model in which Cdr2 only diffuses from the cytoplasm directly to the nodes would not result in scaling (described in the modeling section in the Materials and methods). Rather, to act as a size sensor, Cdr2 needs to bind to the membrane. In principle, subsequent transport of Cdr2 to the nodes could be either along the membrane (as in the original model) or through the cytoplasm. Accordingly, in this revision, we have added a slightly more complicated alternative model in which Cdr2 is modified on the membrane, and then may diffuse through the cytoplasm to arrive at the nodes. This model also provides scaling, and illustrates another way to think about how surface area may be sensed. However, we emphasize that the underlying mechanisms of both models are very similar, a point we make both in the main manuscript and the model discussion in the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>2) Comparison of Cdr2 node levels in round cells to that in cylindrical cells of the same volume should be informative. Because the surface area is greater in cylindrical cells, the levels of Cdr2 in nodes should be higher in the cylindrical cells</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We have done this experiment with “fat” and “thin” mutants. These new data, which are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, show that Cdr2 scales with surface area and not volume. We also added a similar experiment to show that cell size at division may also be dictated by surface area and not volume or length. Together, these data give important support for our model prediction that cells are sensing surface area, and may be doing so using Cdr2.</p><p><italic>3) Although Cdr2 levels in medial nodes increase with cell size, the increase is quite small, and I wonder whether such a small increase is sufficient to trigger mitotic entry</italic>.</p><p>We do not agree that the increase is small: it is up to a factor of two, which is what would be expected for a mechanism that is essentially probing membrane area. We do, however, acknowledge that there are likely to be other factors contributing to mitotic entry that may help to form a switch-like behavior.</p><p><italic>4) Because nodal Cdr2 spreads away from the cell middle in pom1Δ mutants, the proposed model would predict that these cells should enter mitosis at a larger size because Cdr2 is farther away from its target Wee1 at the SPB. In fact pom1Δ cells divide at reduced cell size. Some effort to incorporate Pom1 into the model seems warranted</italic>.</p><p>We have measured Cdr2 levels in <italic>pom1</italic> mutant cells and in mutants in which pom1 is spread throughout the cortex (now presented in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In pom1Δ cells, we see increased levels of cortical Cdr2 all over the cortex away from medial regions. One simple interpretation of our data is that cortical cdr2p nodes all over the cell can to an extent regulate the cell cycle. Another factor, though, may be that pom1 also regulates some aspect of cdr2p activity by direct phosphorylation. We have also added an analysis of Cdr2 in PMC-Pom1C expressing cells, which exhibit low levels of cdr2p all over the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We did not include pom1p explicitly in the modeling because our understanding of pom1p is not complete, and, more importantly, because it is not explicitly needed to explain nodal cdr2 scaling. However, we have now included a discussion of the role of pom1 in the model within the model description in the Materials and Methods section to specifically address this point.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>This paper by Pan et al. describes a new model for cell-size control in fission yeast. Cell-size control is a fundamental and difficult question for all cell types. The fission yeast</italic> S. pombe <italic>has a regular rod shape and divides at a reproducible cell length and a constant cell diameter. Combined with other advantages as a model system, the fission yeast is one of the best systems to study the molecular mechanisms of cell-size control. Previous studies have proposed an elegant and simple model for the regulation of cell size: Pom1 polar gradient and Cdr2 kinase-based interphase nodes work together to control mitotic entry and cell size. One line of key evidence of the model is that the Pom1 polar gradient has highest concentration at the cell pole and lowest concentration in cell middle, which decreases as cells grow. When cells reach a certain length, Pom1 gradient cannot inhibit Cdr2 kinase activity in the nodes, then Cdk1 kinase becomes active and cells enter mitosis</italic>.</p><p><italic>The new work from Pan et al. proposes a new Cdr2-based model based on rigorous data analyses and mathematical modeling. They find that Pom1 concentration at cell middle does not change during cell growth, instead the Cdr2 concentration increases with cell length. They pointed out that nuclear exclusion of Pom1 accounts for the differences. The data in this high quality work are very convincing and well supported by the careful controls. I do not have major concerns for this elegant study</italic>.</p><p>We thank this reviewer for appreciating the high quality and considerable care that has gone into this work. We point out for this reviewer that we have added significant new data on scaling with cell surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and the effects of Pom1 on Cdr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We believe these have added greatly to the significance of this work.</p><p><italic>The minor concerns listed below are not essential for the main conclusion of this paper</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) I do not understand why the mean background outside the cells was subtracted when measuring fluorescence intensity. When measuring cortical Pom1 and Cdr2 intensity, most background in the ROI should come from diffused molecules within the cells. Thus, it might be better to use the cytoplasm as background. This will not affect the main conclusion of this study. Instead, it will make the increase of Cdr2 intensity at cell middle more obvious since Cdr2 global concentration decreases slightly when cells grow longer (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>We have tried the analysis both ways, and use the cytoplasmic background in most of our analyses.</p><p><italic>2) It is impressive that six methods were used to measure Cdr2 fluorescence in cortical nodes. However, five of them are based on maximum-intensity projections. The sum-intensity projections are more suitable since the total proteins in each nodes instead of maximum pixel intensity might be most important for cell-size control. This may explain the steeper slopes of all other panel except E in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 3</italic></xref>.</p><p>We have carefully considered these different methods of measuring fluorescence intensity. The maximum intensity measurements make sense when the nodes are considered as point sources on the cortex. The sum projections take into account the cytoplasmic and out of focus information that are less relevant here. Therefore, sum projections are considerably noisier than maximum intensity projections. The important point is that the same increasing trend in Cdr2 density is found using all the different approaches. In general, we analyzed data using both maximum and sum projections to confirm that our results were not significantly altered by the choice of method. For the reasons stated above, we typically show the results from maximum intensity projections, although we do use sum projections in measurements of whole cell intensities. We emphasize that our key conclusions are replicable with different analysis methods.</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2G</italic></xref><italic>, each cell has only about 30 to 40 nodes. This might be an underestimation due to large z spacing (∼0.4 μm). To count node number accurately, much smaller slice spacing, like 0.05 or 0.1 μm, is needed</italic>.</p><p>As suggested, we compared imaging using 0.1 µm vs. 0.4 µm Z spacing. There were no differences in the number of nodes observed. The node number might seem smaller than previous counts, because we used a thresholding approach to count the bright, mature nodes in an objective automated manner. By eye, there are many smaller nodes that are missed in this analysis, but it is difficult to objectively count their number. By eye, we can discern around 60-70, as previously reported (originally by our lab). However, we preferred the automated method to measure the increase in the number of nodes (rather than the absolute number), as the analysis is objective and easier to perform in a large number of cells.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The Reviewing editor and reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. Based on these discussions, we would like you to address the two points raised below</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) One of the reviewers (#2) has made a point about computing Cdr2 gradients near the SPB and it seems reasonable to attempt this given that you have the relevant information on Cdr2 concentration. The referee's point is provided verbatim</italic> <italic>below:</italic></p><p><italic>“Whether increased medial Cdr2 is in fact what triggers mitotic entry is still not clear. The authors suggest that Cdr2 localization at the medial cortex could generate a concentration gradient that extends to the SPB where the Cdr2 target Wee1 resides. As Cdr2 medial concentration increases with cell elongation, it is proposed that the Cdr2 concentration at the SPB would increase until it is sufficient to inactivate Wee1. I have some concern about this idea because cytoplasmic gradients are likely to be very steep given the high rates of diffusion. Given that the authors know both the Cdr2 concentration at the medial cortex and the turnover rate they could calculate how steep the gradient from the cortex is likely to be and whether the concentration of Cdr2 around the SPB would actually change significantly as cells elongate. This would at least say whether this notion made sense. If so, it would be interesting (in future studies) to examine mutants that caused the SPB to be positioned further away from the cell cortex to see if this changed the timing of mitotic entry</italic>.</p><p>This point is in regards to one sentence in the Discussion speculating on how the nodes might communicate to downstream targets. This downstream event is not a major focus of the paper, and our statement in the text is just a suggestion of how this might work; we do not claim that it works in this way, and other possibilities can be imagined.</p><p>Prompted by this question, we have however considered carefully if a cytoplasmic gradient is a credible means of communicating information about cell size from the nodes to the SPB.</p><p>We first note that the SPB can often be situated very close to the cortex. Images of the SPB in G2 phase frequently show that it is positioned very close to the medial cortex. Indeed, some EMs show the SPB within 50-100 nm of the plasma membrane, and so it is possible that the SPB may directly contact the cortex.</p><p>We have considered quantitatively what sort of gradient of cdr2p might be produced given the numbers obtained from our experiments. Our calculations predict a very shallow gradient, due to the high rate of cytoplasmic diffusion. Our FRAP results show t<sub>1/2</sub> is ∼3 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Fig 2–figure supplement 4</xref>), which gives an off rate of ∼4x10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. With ∼3000 cdr2p molecules in the nodes, the total rate of cdr2p molecules released from all the nodes is ∼10 s<sup>-1</sup>. Assuming a reasonable diffusion constant, it would take only ∼10s for a cdr2p molecule to diffuse across the cell, before becoming homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm. Hence, the number of molecules making up the entire cytoplasmic gradient would only be about 100. This is a very low number in comparison with the overall number of cytoplasmic cdr2p molecules, making for a very shallow gradient. Moreover, the localized SPB would only be able to sample a fraction of these gradient molecules, which would increase the noise still further. Thus, it is unlikely that this simplest mechanism based on sensing the number of freely diffusing cdr2p molecules emitted by the nodes would work.</p><p>This gradient mechanism could plausibly work, however, if some features are added. First, the gradient may be improved by phospho-regulation; in this case cdr2p emanating from the nodes may be active only for a short time, while the rest of the cytoplasmic pool is not active. Second, there could also be diffusion barriers that prevent mixing of the cdp2p from the nodes and the cytoplasmic pool. This situation may arise if the SPB and nodes were basically “touching” or surrounded by ER membranes.</p><p>For this paper, we have added to the Discussion a sentence that gradient fidelity could be improved significantly through the use of a phospho-gradient or diffusion barriers, with noise further reduced through time-averaging.</p><p>Further investigation of this process will require future experiments and modelling. We agree that it would be interesting to test the effect of microtubule-dependent SPB positioning on cell size control in the future. We have done some initial simulations of this process, but given the many unknowns here we think it best to leave a more extensive analysis for the future.</p><p><italic>It is not clear from the main text if the model explains the existence of medial nodes, how they are distributed, and how new ones form with</italic> <italic>cell length”</italic></p><p>We have added 2 sentences to the paragraph ‘Mathematical models for size-dependent accumulation of Cdr2p nodes’ in the main paper to make it clear that the model does not specifically incorporate the details of nodal formation/growth. Rather we model the total number of cdr2p molecules in the nodal region. Currently we lack sufficient information on the detailed dynamics of individual nodes in order to more precisely model their formation and growth.</p><p><italic>2) Please also address the following point from</italic> <italic>referee #3:</italic></p><p><italic>“One minor improvement required for new figures (and some old figures) is that most Y-axes in the graphs should</italic> <italic>start from zero.”</italic></p><p>We have re-plotted many of the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and corresponding supplement, to amend the Y-axes, as requested.
