Splicing is carried out by a multi-megadalton molecular machinery called the spliceosome of which two distinct complexes exist. The more abundant major spliceosome that consists of the U1, U2, U4, U5, U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and multiple non-snRNP splicing factors. Additionally, the cells of most eukaryotes contain the minor spliceosome, which is composed of the minor-specific snRNPs U11, U12, U4atac, U6atac, and the shared U5 snRNP. While the major spliceosome catalyzes splicing of around 99.5% of all introns, mainly so-called U2-type introns with the characteristic GT-AG splice sites, the minor spliceosome recognizes introns of the U12-type containing non-consensus AT-AC splice sites and distinct branch point and polypyrimidine sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Jackson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Turunen et al., 2013</xref>). However, despite its low abundance, the minor spliceosome plays a fundamental role in ontogenesis, as deficiencies in minor spliceosome activity or minor intron splicing are lethal or result in developmental defects and disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Doggett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Verma et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>AS is highly regulated by <italic>cis</italic>-acting splicing enhancer and silencer elements, which are recognized by various RNA binding proteins, such as SR proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hastings et al., 2001</xref>). The protein family of SR proteins, with 13 canonical members in humans, is characterized by an arginine and serine rich domain (RS domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Manley and Krainer, 2010</xref>). Aside from their role in mRNA nuclear export and GE they are essential regulators of AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Long and Caceres, 2009</xref>). Every SR protein contains ultraconserved elements in alternative exons that control the presence of premature translation termination codons (PTC). This allows them to regulate their own abundance through nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lareau et al., 2007</xref>). While many SR proteins and RBPs use autoregulation to maintain a stable expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Müller-McNicoll et al., 2019</xref>), their expression level changes in a tissue-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Olthof et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, mechanisms aside from autoregulation are most likely employed to control SR protein levels under different conditions, for instance in different tissues or during differentiation. However, the mechanisms that coordinately regulate SR protein expression levels remain elusive.</p><p>SRSF10 is a unique SR protein, as it activates splicing in its phosphorylated state but becomes a general splicing inhibitor upon dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Feng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). We used SRSF10 as a case study of how tissue-specific differences in SR protein levels can be achieved by employing an autoregulatory feedback loop. We show that Srsf10 recognizes a highly conserved splicing enhancer element within its own pre-mRNA, which results in the production of a non-protein coding mRNA isoform and thereby the regulation of its own expression level. An additional layer of <italic>Srsf10</italic> regulation is added by the presence of competing major and minor splice sites which control this autoregulatory AS event. The minor splice site leads to the formation of the protein-coding mRNA, whereas splicing mediated by the major spliceosome leads to the non-protein-coding mRNA. Consequently, <italic>Srsf10</italic> levels correlate with the level of the minor spliceosome in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner. Surprisingly, we also found that the expression levels of most other SR proteins correlate with <italic>Srsf10</italic> expression. This is directly mediated through the levels of <italic>Srsf10</italic> and the competition between major and minor splice sites, as CRISPR/Cas9-mediated removal of the autoregulatory exon 3 of <italic>Srsf10</italic> increases not only the expression of <italic>Srsf10</italic>, but also the expression of the other SR proteins. These data connect the minor spliceosome with <italic>Srsf10</italic> and SR protein expression in a tissue- and differentiation state-specific manner. We thus reveal a mechanism that coordinately controls SR protein expression in different cellular conditions and that connects the minor spliceosome with global (alternative) splicing of major introns.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Srsf10 autoregulates its own splicing and expression</title><p>Autoregulation has been described for many RBPs including most SR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lejeune et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sureau, 2001</xref>), but not for Srsf10. <italic>Srsf10</italic> represents a particularly interesting example as its conserved region contains two competing 5’ splice sites in exon 2 (E2), which are recognized by either the minor or the major spliceosome. The upstream (up) minor splice site is coupled to E4 inclusion and production of a protein coding mRNA, while use of the downstream (dn) major splice site is coupled to E3 inclusion, the presence of a PTC and the use of an alternative polyadenylation site in E3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The dn-E3 variant is not a canonical NMD target, as the stop codon in E2 is less than 50 nucleotides upstream of the E2/3 junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nagy and Maquat, 1998</xref>) and could thus encode for a hypothetical short protein (Srsf10-s, see below). To investigate whether AS of the competing minor and major splice site in exon 2 of <italic>Srsf10</italic> depends on an autoregulatory feedback loop, we generated an <italic>Srsf10</italic> minigene containing mouse exons 2 to 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top). We transfected this minigene into human HeLa cells and investigated AS after knocking down the endogenous <italic>SRSF10</italic>. These experiments revealed strong autoregulation, as <italic>SRSF10</italic> knockdown decreased the dn-E3 isoform and increased the up-E4 product and retention of intron 2 (IR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom). We confirmed the knockdown of <italic>SRSF10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) and observed a reduced E3/E4 ratio for endogenous <italic>SRSF10</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), consistent with SRSF10 activating E3 inclusion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Srsf10 autoregulates its own splicing through a conserved enhancer in exon 3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the exon/intron structure of Srsf10. Usage of the downstream (dn) major splice site in Srsf10 exon 2 (GT.AG, U2-type) leads to exon 3 inclusion and a non-protein coding isoform, while usage of the upstream minor splice site (AT.AC, U12-type) results in exon 4 inclusion.

To investigate the activity of these protein isoforms in regulating AS, we performed rescue experiments with GFP-tagged Srsf10 mouse variants (not targeted by the human-specific siRNA). A Western blot against Srsf10 shows expression of GFP-Srsf10-fl and GFP-Srsf10-2 close to endogenous levels, while GFP-Srsf10-s was not detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, top). Consistently, Srsf10-fl and Srsf10-2 clearly rescue exon 3 mis-splicing caused by the knockdown of endogenous <italic>SRSF10</italic>, while transfecting Srsf10-s has no effect on <italic>Srsf10</italic> AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We obtained the same result when overexpressing the different Srsf10 variants with no knockdown of the endogenous protein, confirming Srsf10-fl and Srsf10-2 as activators of exon 3 inclusion and Srsf10-s as a barely expressed protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Since the presence of Srsf10-s is hardly detectable, even with a stabilizing GFP tag, we assume that this protein variant is highly instable and does not have a biological function. To compare the activities of Srsf10-fl and Srsf10-2, we performed titration experiments. This demonstrated highly sensitive <italic>Srsf10</italic> autoregulation, with Srsf10-fl, despite its lower expression levels, being a more potent activator of E3 inclusion than Srsf10-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data identify Srsf10 as an activator of the major intron between exons 2 and 3 and suggest that Srsf10 autoregulates its own expression level via a negative feedback loop, as higher Srsf10 levels result in the formation of the non-protein-coding dn-E3 isoform.</p><p>To identify the cis-regulatory element required for autoregulation, we used systematic mutational analysis of the <italic>Srsf10</italic> minigene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2, A–D</xref>). First, we replaced sequences downstream of exon 3 by human Gmfb sequences from exons 4 to 5, including a minor intron (mutant I3, see ‘Material and Methods’ for details). This reflects the endogenous situation, as <italic>Srsf10</italic> exon 3 contains a minor 5’ splice site, which, however, is rarely used, since the polyadenylation site in exon 3 appears to be dominant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The resulting minigene clearly remains responsive to <italic>SRSF10</italic> knockdown and overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, I3). In contrast, replacing sequences starting from exon 3 (E3) or in intron 2 (I2) by <italic>Gmfb</italic> sequences results in splicing unresponsive to <italic>SRSF10</italic> knockdown and barely responsive to SRSF10 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; mutants E3 and I2). These data suggest that SRSF10 controls its own splicing via binding to exon 3, which, indeed, contains a GA-rich element representing the previously identified SRSF10 consensus binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shin and Manley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Replacing nucleotides 17 to 60 of exon 3 by <italic>GMFB</italic> exon ﻿4 sequence was sufficient to abolish SRSF10-mediated AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, ESE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), thus identifying this GA-rich element as an SRSF10-dependent exonic splicing enhancer (ESE). Together, these data identify a highly conserved element in <italic>Srsf10</italic> exon 3 which is necessary for an autoregulatory feedback loop that controls Srsf10 expression levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The minor spliceosome controls Srsf10 expression</title><p>Exon 2 of <italic>Srsf10</italic> contains two competing 5’ splice sites, which are specifically recognized by either the minor or the major spliceosome.

Mutated minigenes remained clearly responsive to SRSF10 knockdown and rescue, demonstrating that SRSF10 can regulate AS through both major and minor spliceosomes. However, in the control conditions (siCtrl), we observed that both minor-only or major-only minigenes show a strong increase in the use of exon 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Exon 3 is hardly included at all in any of the two minigenes. Additionally, in the presence of a directly competing upstream splice site in exon 2, the downstream splice site is no longer used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data indicate that, in vivo, the use of the minor splice site that leads to productive <italic>Srsf10</italic> splicing, is reduced through the presence of a competing major splice site. This arrangement could render <italic>Srsf10</italic> expression susceptible to dynamic control through alterations in the activity of the minor spliceosome. To directly investigate this hypothesis, we inhibited minor spliceosome activity by performing an siRNA-mediated knockdown of the essential U11/U12 snRNP component <italic>RNPC3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Indeed, the expression of the coding <italic>SRSF10</italic> mRNA (up-E4) was significantly decreased, while the levels of the non-coding dn-E3 mRNA are unaffected or slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This result indicates that the abundance of the minor spliceosome directly correlates with <italic>Srsf10</italic> GE through controlling productive vs. non-productive AS. Furthermore, regulation through the activity of the minor spliceosome appears to, at least partially, overrule the autoregulatory feedback loop. This suggests a model in which the activity of the minor spliceosome sets the expression level of <italic>Srsf10</italic>, which is then maintained through autoregulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The minor spliceosome controls Srsf10 expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the exon/intron structure of the Srsf10 WT and mutated minigenes harboring only major (GT.AG, blue) or minor (AT.AC, red) splice sites.

Calculated transcripts per million (tpm) values using Whippet Quant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sterne-Weiler et al., 2018</xref>) revealed clear tissue-specific expression patterns for both <italic>Srsf10</italic> and <italic>Rnpc3</italic>. Both genes show the lowest GE in blood cells and the highest in thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Notably, a linear regression fit revealed an almost perfect correlation of <italic>Srsf10</italic> and <italic>Rnpc3</italic> expression across the 25 investigated tissues (R²=0.85, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, <italic>SRSF10</italic> and <italic>RNPC3</italic> GE levels correlate across 31 human tissues (R²=0.33, p=0.0006, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, the levels of the housekeeping gene <italic>Gapdh</italic>, which contains no minor intron, do not correlate with <italic>Rnpc3</italic> (R²=0.01, p=0.4071, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similar correlation coefficients were obtained with gene expression values determined independently using Salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Patro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Globally, minor intron-containing genes correlate much more strongly with <italic>Rnpc3</italic> levels than a randomly chosen group of expression level-matched genes containing only major introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating that <italic>Rnpc3</italic> levels represent an adequate indicator for minor spliceosome activity. Consistently, <italic>Rnpc3</italic> levels, and therefore <italic>Srsf10</italic> levels, also correlate with the expression levels of two other minor spliceosome components, namely <italic>Snrnp25</italic> and <italic>Snrp48</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). These in vivo GE data are consistent with our model that minor spliceosome activity controls <italic>Srsf10</italic> levels. As an additional model system, we compared <italic>Rnpc3</italic> and <italic>Srsf10</italic> levels during neuronal differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells). GE levels correlate significantly (R²=0.34, p=0.0006, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), while <italic>Gapdh</italic> levels do not correlate with <italic>Rnpc3</italic> (R²=0.02, p=0.4365, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Again, globally, minor intron-containing genes show a stronger correlation with <italic>Rnpc3</italic> levels than genes containing only major introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). The <italic>Srsf10</italic>/<italic>Rnpc3</italic> correlation in ES cell differentiation is less pronounced – also with Salmon derived tpm values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>) – indicating other factors influencing gene expression. Normalization of gene expression using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Love et al., 2014</xref>) strongly increases this correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>), which is consistent with a direct role of the minor spliceosome in regulating <italic>Srsf10</italic> levels across different tissues and development stages. In summary, together with our minigene and knockdown results, these data indicate that the activity of the minor spliceosome controls productive vs unproductive <italic>Srsf10</italic> splicing and expression levels during development and in a tissue-specific manner.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Minor spliceosome and Srsf10 expression correlate in a tissue-specific manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative GE levels of Srsf10 and Rnpc3 across 25 mouse tissues (x-axis). Transcripts per million (tpm) values were calculated using Whippet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sterne-Weiler et al., 2018</xref>) (n ≥ 2, mean +/- SEM).

Surprisingly, we found that the expression of all SR proteins correlates with the minor spliceosome, represented by <italic>Rnpc3</italic>, in the 25 investigated tissues (R²&gt;0.42, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, we observed a highly similar expression pattern for all SR proteins during neuronal differentiation of mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and a significant correlation with <italic>Rnpc3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To experimentally confirm these results in vivo, we isolated RNA from mouse cerebral cortices from embryonic days (E) 12.5 and 15.5. RT-qPCR <italic>analysis</italic> revealed a significant increase of <italic>Rnpc3</italic> GE from E 12.5 to E 15.5 and, in parallel, Srsf10 levels also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). This is consistent with our model that higher minor spliceosome activity (indicated by higher <italic>Rnpc3</italic> abundance) results in preferential usage of the <italic>Srsf10</italic> up-E4 minor splice site, which leads to an increase in protein coding <italic>Srsf10</italic> mRNA. Consistent with SR protein expression patterns from different tissues or stem cell development in RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), all other tested SR proteins are also upregulated during the transition from E 12.5 to E 15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which, again, indicates a co-regulation of SR proteins, even though <italic>Srsf10</italic> is the only SR protein that contains a minor intron. As SR proteins are known to cross-regulate each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bradley et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesized that a change in <italic>Srsf10</italic> levels could directly influence the levels of other SR proteins. To test this, we generated a CRISPR/Cas9-edited cell line lacking the non-productive <italic>SRSF10</italic> exon 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, left). Homozygous removal of exon 3 was confirmed by PCRs at the genomic level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, right) and, as expected, we observe increased <italic>SRSF10</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref> for protein expression). Interestingly, we observe a stronger increase in the less active SRSF10-2 isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that AS of the last exon could be used to partially compensate for the loss of autoregulation via exon 3. Next, to examine whether manipulation of <italic>SRSF10</italic> autoregulation is sufficient to change the overall activity of SRSF10, we analyzed AS of SRSF10 target exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with increased <italic>SRSF10</italic> expression, the inclusion of alternative exons in <italic>BCLAF1</italic>, <italic>PTBP2</italic> and <italic>ZFP207</italic> is promoted in the CRISPR/Cas9-edited cells, and the opposite is observed by knockdown of <italic>SRSF10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Notably, increased SRSF10 in our CRISPR/Cas9-edited cell line was sufficient for subtle upregulation of the mRNA levels of all other SR proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In addition, reduced <italic>SRSF10</italic> expression upon <italic>RNPC3</italic> knockdown also correlates with slightly decreased expression of most other SR proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In summary, these data suggest a model where minor spliceosome activity directly controls <italic>SRSF10</italic> levels, which is sufficient to change expression levels of the other SR proteins in a tissue- and differentiation state-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). An exciting question that remains is how SRSF10 is able to coordinately regulate the abundance of the other SR proteins. Cross-regulatory mechanisms are known for many RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kumar and Lopez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rossbach et al., 2009</xref>) and we therefore speculate that SRSF10 could regulate other SR proteins (and potentially other RBPs) by repressing the formation of NMD-targeted isoforms from their pre-mRNAs. This could be mediated either directly, by binding to the respective pre-mRNAs, or indirectly, through interactions with other SR proteins. Additionally, differences in SR protein abundance could be achieved by changing their activity. Higher mRNA abundance could be the consequence of reduced SR protein activity, resulting in reduced autoregulatory NMD exon inclusion and therefore higher mRNA expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ni et al., 2007</xref>). The activity of SR proteins is, amongst others, controlled by their phosphorylation level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Goldammer et al., 2018</xref>), and could be controlled by a direct or indirect effect of SRSF10 on the regulating kinases and phosphatases. While these mechanistic details remain to be investigated, the control of SR protein levels through the minor spliceosome and SRSF10 is of fundamental importance, as SR protein levels will have consequences for the splicing of most major introns. Our data thus reveal a mechanism through which the activity of the minor spliceosome controls major intron splicing in a tissue- and differentiation state-specific manner. This may also be relevant for diseases caused by minor spliceosome deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jutzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Verma et al., 2018</xref>), as misregulation of SR proteins and consequently, defects in major intron splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cologne et al., 2019</xref>), may contribute to the observed phenotypes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>SRSF10 and the minor spliceosome control tissue-specific and dynamic SR protein expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Linear regression analysis of calculated tpm values for SR proteins against Rnpc3 in 25 different mouse tissues. R<sup>2</sup> and p-values are shown on the right.

Transfections were done with Rotifect according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For siRNA sequences see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Minigenes were transfected 24 hr after knockdown and RNAs were isolated 48 hr later. For overexpression and rescue experiments, cells were transfected using 0.4 µg of minigenes and 0.4 µg expression vectors for GFP-tagged Srsf10-fl, Srsf10-2 or Srsf10-s (or GFP alone). 48 hr after transfection cells were harvested for protein and/or RNA preparation. We perform monthly test for mycoplasms using PCR. Cell have been tested negative in all tests during the experiments performed for the present study. The cells morphologically appear as expected for Hek293 and HeLa cells respectively. We have used these Hek293 cells in several RNA-Seq experiments and compared gene expression with published Hek293 datasets and found very good correlation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Preparation of embryonic mouse cortices for RNA extraction</title><p>Colonies of wild type mice of the NMRI strain were maintained in the animal facilities of Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin. Tissue collection was performed in compliance with German Animal Welfare Law and regulations imposed by the State Office for Health and Social Affairs Council in Berlin/Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales (LAGeSo).</p><p>Mice were bred for timed pregnancies, and the date of vaginal plug detection was considered embryonic day 0.5. Pregnancies were timed accordingly, and embryos prepared at the indicated embryonic days. Prior to the preparation of embryos, all tools were thoroughly cleaned with RNAse AWAY solution (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 10328011). The uteri were dissected into DEPC-treated PBS, and the embryonic brains quickly transferred to a solution of 2M NaCl in PBS for RNA stabilization. Cortices were dissected and then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Molecular cloning</title><p>For cloning of the different Srsf10 overexpression constructs inserts were amplified from mouse cDNA and cloned into pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) using XhoI and BamHI restriction sites introduced through PCR primers. For minigene cloning, mouse genomic DNA was used as template to amplify <italic>Srsf10</italic> exons 2 to 4 and the product was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for cloning primer sequences. For mutational analysis <italic>Srsf10</italic> exons/introns were replaced by sequences from the human <italic>GMFB</italic> gene: exons 4 to 5, intron 4 is a minor intron. New inserts were amplified by 1-step or 2-step PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) using BamHI and XhoI or into the WT minigene using internal restrictions sites (BsrGI for exon 3 and XbaI for intron 3). In the I3 mutant 356 nt of Srsf10 exon 3 were maintained, the downstream sequence was replaced by the 5’ splice site of <italic>GMFB</italic> exon 4 (<named-content content-type="sequence">TCGatatcc</named-content>…) and downstream sequence. For the E3 mutant sequences downstream of the BsrGI site (+16 in exon 3) were replaced by <italic>GMFB</italic> exon 4 to 5 sequence starting with (5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">CACCAGA</named-content>…). For the ESE mutant nucleotids 17 to 60 of exon 3 were replaced by <italic>GMFB</italic> exon 4 sequence. For the minigene containing only minor splice sites we replaced the major splice sites of <italic>Srsf10</italic> intron 2 by minor splice sites of <italic>GMFB</italic> intron 4 (5’ splice site: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TCGatatcc</named-content>; 3’ splice site: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">ttctttaacttgagaaaaacCTT</named-content>). In the minigene containing only major splice sites the upstream 5’ splice site of exon 2 and the 3’ splice site of exon 4 were replaced by major splice sites from <italic>GMFB</italic> intron 5 or 3, respectively (5’ splice site: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TTGgtaagt</named-content>; 3’ splice site: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">gcttttctctgtggtgccagGGC</named-content>).

Data for mouse tissues were obtained from WT control samples from SRA study DRP003641 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tanikawa et al., 2017</xref>), data for neuronal differentiation of mouse ES cells from SRA study SRP017778 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hubbard et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, skin samples from SRP115206 were analyzed. For comparison, transcript abundances were additionally quantified using salmon version 1.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Patro et al., 2017</xref>). To obtain normalized expression counts, transcripts were imported to R using TxImport version 1.14.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Soneson et al., 2015</xref>) and count normalization was performed using DESeq2 version 1.26.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Love et al., 2014</xref>). DESeq2 based normalized expression counts dramatically increased the variance of replicate tissue samples (but not of ES cell differentiation), which is why we chose to analyze only the un-normalized values for the tissue comparisons. To investigate GE levels from different human tissues, fpkm values were directly used from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Uhlén et al. (2015)</xref>. Linear regression fits were performed in GraphPad Prism 7.05. A list of minor intron containing genes is based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Olthof et al. (2019)</xref>. Genes with a comparable distribution of GE levels were randomly chosen from the remaining only major intron containing genes. The GE of each gene was compared to Rnpc3 levels across tissues or development stages. Unexpressed genes were excluded from the analysis. Downstream analyses were performed using standard Python 2 code and GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Generation of CRISPR/Cas9-edited cell lines</title><p>For CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <italic>SRSF10</italic> exon 3 sgRNAs were designed using the Benchling tool (for sequences see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and cloned into the PX459 vector.

expression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Timothy Nilsen, and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>As you will see, the reviewers were quite positive about the work and reviewer 3 was very enthusiastic. The reviewing editor was also enthusiastic about the manuscript. Nevertheless, the reviewers have raised some concerns regarding the data and its interpretation. Please address these points as thoroughly as possible via revision. It is not necessary to delete the impact of <italic>Srsf10</italic> expression on other SR proteins.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper describes an unusual regulatory feedback process in the alternative splicing of the <italic>Srsf10</italic> gene involving competition between major and minor intron splice sites. Several RNA binding proteins self-regulate their protein levels by inclusion of alternative &quot;poison exons&quot; that include premature stop codons. <italic>Srsf10</italic> appears to have a poison exon 3 who's exclusion requires minor spliceosome activity. This part of the paper seems solid. They then show that there is a general correlation of the expression levels of many SR proteins including <italic>Srsf10</italic>. This has been described before and similar correlations can be seen in ribosomal protein genes indicating that they are under coordinate regulation. The authors then remove the poison exon from the <italic>Srsf10</italic> gene and argue that the results support a key role for <italic>Srsf10</italic> and, by extension, the minor spliceosome in controlling the mRNA levels of SR genes in general. The key results shown in Figure 4E do not, to me, support this idea. The authors speculate that alterations in mRNA levels are due to NMD. A direct demonstration would be more convincing. With the data they show, I think they should focus on the <italic>Srsf10</italic> case alone rather than pushing for a more global mechanism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this work, Meinke et al. demonstrate that alternative splicing of <italic>Srsf10</italic> is formed via competition between the major and the minor spliceosome using different splice sites. These in turn lead to functional isoforms that skip exon 3 (minor spliceosome) or inclusion of exon 3 (major spliceosome) in a mostly non functional isoform which encodes a PTC and utilizes an alternative 3' end. The authors show that similar to other Sr proteins Srsf10 regulates its own levels via the inclusion of exon 3 and find a short site in that exon that is sufficient to achieve that regulation. They also perform rescue experiments with SRSF10 mouse variants in human HeLa cells, and a titration experiment with the different isoforms detected (Figure 1). KD of <italic>Rnpc3</italic> of the minor spliceosome changes the splicing and expression of <italic>Srsf10</italic> as expected (Figure 2). Expression of <italic>Srsf10</italic> correlates well with expression of <italic>Rnpc3</italic> across diverse mouse tissues, and as expected <italic>Rnpc3</italic> levels correlate much better with expression of intron containing genes than matched expression levels of genes with only major introns (Figure 3). When removing exon3 control of <italic>Srsf10</italic> levels via CRISPR the expression of <italic>Srsf10</italic> increase by ~3.5fold but six other SR genes expression levels rises significantly, and these too correlate well with expression of <italic>Rnpc3</italic> (Figure 4). The overall regulatory model is summarized in Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Overall, we really liked this work. The authors should be congratulated for a thorough line of thoughtful experiments in support of their regulatory model as mentioned above. The manuscript is clearly written and we enjoyed reading it.

However, we find it quite remarkable that the expression of all SR proteins is increased in the Crispr cell line and for 8/12 this is statistically significant. We would therefore like to keep this figure, but have modified the text to say “…was sufficient for subtle upregulation…”. We have also weakened the conclusion, which now reads: “…which is sufficient to change expression levels of the other SR proteins in a tissue- and differentiation state-specific manner.” In the previous version it was “of all other SR proteins”. We hope that these adjustments address the reviewer’s concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Overall, we really liked this work.

First, the Whippet Quant function also calculates weighted TPM values on gene level (see Sterne-Weiler, 2018 and the GitHub documentation). This is a great advantage of the Whippet tool, as it allows alignment, splicing, and gene expression analysis in one step/one pipeline.</p><p>However, to be more confident with our results we repeated the analyses using Salmon to determine GE levels and DESeq2 to obtain normalized expression counts. These analyses were performed by an additional bioinformatician, Alexander Neumann, who is now included as co-author. Comparing expression across different tissues, we observe comparable correlations using Salmon derived gene expression levels, which are now included as Figure 3—figure supplement 1B (<italic>Srsf10</italic>) and 1C (<italic>Gapdh</italic>). When removing a single outlier value, we also observe a significant correlation between <italic>Rnpc3</italic> and <italic>Srsf10</italic> in the DESeq2 normalized values (R² = 0.7509, p &lt; 0.0001) but as we observe large variations (e.g. the three <italic>Rnpc3</italic> values in epididymis 1: 222; 2: 17921; 3: 2655 and <italic>Srsf10</italic> 1: 2522; 2: 28859; 3: 6516) we would rather not include these into our manuscript. This is also mentioned in the Materials and methods part: “DESeq2 based normalized expression counts dramatically increased the variance of replicate tissue samples (but not of ES cell differentiation), which is why we chose to analyze only the un-normalized values for the tissue comparisons.”</p><p>In ES cell differentiation, we also observe comparable correlations using Salmon derived gene expression levels (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1I). Here however, normalization via DESeq2 strongly increases the correlation (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1J), making us confident that the DeSeq2 analysis in principle works (but is not suitable for the different tissue samples). Taken together, these additional analyses are fully consistent with the conclusion that <italic>Rnpc3</italic> and <italic>Srsf10</italic> expression indeed correlate across different tissues and development stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4: We understand where these p-values come from, but we are still worried about possible artifacts in the normalization procedures that might affect the results (also see above).

These correlations are slightly reduced with Salmon derived correlations (R² average 0.6) but remain always highly significant (each p-value &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, we would like to point out that in Figure 3D we have calculated correlation coefficients for 587 minor intron containing genes and 629 only major intron containing genes using the same procedure. This resulted in mean R² values of 0.24 and 0.16, respectively. We are therefore confident that the correlation coefficients for SR proteins are indeed true, as they stand out from only major intron containing genes and also from other minor intron containing genes. Also in ES cell differentiation a mean R² of 0.37 for SR proteins is clearly higher than the correlation for all major intron genes (0.16).</p></body></sub-article></article>
