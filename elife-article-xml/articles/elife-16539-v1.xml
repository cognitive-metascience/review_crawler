have key roles during mitotic exit. Previously, we showed that Ki-67 organizes the mitotic chromosome periphery and recruits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to chromatin at anaphase onset, in a similar manner as RepoMan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>). Here we show how Ki-67 and RepoMan form mitotic exit phosphatases by recruiting PP1, how they distinguish between distinct PP1 isoforms and how the assembly of these two holoenzymes are dynamically regulated by Aurora B kinase during mitosis. Unexpectedly, our data also reveal that Ki-67 and RepoMan bind PP1 using an identical, yet novel mechanism, interacting with a PP1 pocket that is engaged only by these two PP1 regulators. These findings not only show how two distinct mitotic exit phosphatases are recruited to their substrates, but also provide immediate opportunities for the design of novel cancer therapeutics that selectively target the Ki-67:PP1 and RepoMan:PP1 holoenzymes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16539.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16539.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Ki-67</kwd><kwd>RepoMan</kwd><kwd>protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>structural biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Flanders - G.0473.12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bollen</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Flanders - G.0482.12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bollen</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Flemish Concerted Research Action</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GOA 15/016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bollen</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/K017632/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vagnarelli</surname><given-names>Paola</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS091336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peti</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM098482</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Page</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Booth et al, 2014), we show how two mitotic phosphatases are formed, how they are regulated by opposing kinases during the cell cycle and reveal a novel opportunity for the development of cancer therapeutics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitotic exit comprises a complex series of events that includes sister chromatid segregation, mitotic spindle disassembly, nuclear-envelope re-assembly and chromosome decondensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wurzenberger and Gerlich, 2011</xref>). How these events are coordinated during mitotic exit is still an open question. The emerging picture is that exiting mitosis requires the specific engagement and activation of protein phosphatases, including ser/thr phosphatase protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Funabiki and Wynne, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rosenberg et al., 2011</xref>). While PP1 exhibits broad specificity, it acts in a highly specific manner by forming stable complexes, known as holoenzymes, with a host of regulatory proteins that direct PP1 activity towards specific substrates and localize PP1 to specific regions of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hendrickx et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bollen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peti and Page, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Choy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">O'Connell et al., 2012</xref>). A detailed understanding of how key PP1 regulators bind and direct PP1 activity during distinct stages of the cell cycle is still largely missing.</p><p>Ki-67 is widely used as a prognostic marker for many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dowsett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sobecki et al., 2016</xref>), yet for decades, its molecular function remained largely unknown. Recently, it was shown that one role of Ki-67 is to function as a âDNA surfactantâ, preventing individual chromosomes from collapsing into a single chromatin mass upon nuclear envelope disassembly by binding directly to the surface of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cuylen et al., 2016</xref>). A second recently discovered function is that it binds and regulates the activity of PP1 during mitosis using the canonical PP1 RVxF small linear motif (SLiM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>). The only other protein that exhibits any sequence similarity with Ki-67 near its RVxF motif is RepoMan (recruits PP1Î³ onto mitotic chromatin at anaphase, also known as cell division cycle associated 2, CDCA2), a nuclear-specific protein that was discovered for its ability to specifically recruit PP1Î³ to chromosomes at anaphase onset and, like Ki-67, is upregulated in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vagnarelli, 2014</xref>). During mitotic exit, PP1, in particular PP1Î³ (PP1 isoforms include PP1Î±, PP1Î², PP1Î³ and PP1Î³2; â¥ 85% identity between isoforms), is essential for histone dephosphorylation, nuclear-envelope reassembly and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Qian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vagnarelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wurzenberger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vagnarelli et al., 2011</xref>). These PP1Î³-specific processes are mediated largely by the Ki-67:PP1Î³ and RepoMan:PP1Î³ holoenzymes. Two key unresolved questions are how do these regulators assemble mitotic phosphatases and how are these interactions dynamically regulated in both space and time? Answers to these questions will provide novel opportunities for the development ofÂ Ki-67:PP1 and RepoMan:PP1 specific therapeutics for cancer. In this report, we demonstrate how Ki-67 and RepoMan form mitotic exit phosphatases, how they distinguish between distinct PP1 isoforms and how the assembly of these two holoenzymes is dynamically regulated by Aurora B kinase during mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Ki-67 and RepoMan PP1 interaction domain</title><p>Ki-67 (3256 aa) and RepoMan (1023 aa) bind PP1Î³ to form isoform-specific holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006</xref>). Previously, we showed that these proteins exhibit sequence similarity in only a very short region, of about 40 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>). This region includes the canonical RVxF SLiM that is critical for PP1 binding (<sup>505</sup>RVSF<sup>508</sup>, Ki-67; <sup>392</sup>RVTF<sup>395</sup>, RepoMan; more than 70% of PP1 regulators contain the RVxF SLiM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vagnarelli et al., 2011</xref>). Because recent efforts to understand how PP1 activity is directed by its &gt;200 distinct regulators has revealed that residues outside the RVxF motif are also essential for PP1 holoenzyme formation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">O'Connell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Terrak et al., 2004</xref>), we reasoned that this entire region was critical for PP1 binding. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we showed that Ki-67<sub>496-536</sub> and RepoMan<sub>383-423</sub> bind PP1Î³<sub>7â323</sub> with a 1:1 stoichiometry and with nearly equivalent affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>; K<sub>D</sub> = 193 Â± 16 nM and 133 Â± 5 nM; respectively; all ITC experiments are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We also showed that extending this domain does not enhance binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Finally, NMR spectroscopy experiments with RepoMan confirmed that all residues in this conserved region interact with PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplements 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Ki-67<sub>496-536</sub> and RepoMan<sub>383-423</sub> bind PP1 using identical mechanisms and that this conserved region, which extends beyond the RVxF SLiM, constitutes the full PP1 interaction domain.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16539.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The RepoMan:PP1 holoenzyme complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depicting Ki-67 and RepoMan domains.

To identify this mechanism, we determined the crystal structures of the Ki-67<sub>496-536</sub>:PP1Î³<sub>7â308</sub> and RepoMan<sub>383-423</sub>:PP1Î³<sub>7â308</sub> holoenzymes complexes to 2.0 Ã and 1.3 Ã, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). As predicted by the ITC and NMR studies, Ki-67 and RepoMan bind PP1 using an identical mechanism.

However, as predicted, the Ki-67/RepoMan residues C-terminal to these SLiMs (aa 517â535/404â422) also bind PP1 and do so in a manner never observed for any other PP1 regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Residues F517<sub>Ki-67</sub>/F404<sub>RM</sub> and P523<sub>Ki-67</sub>/A410<sub>RM</sub> are anchored to PP1Î³ via two hydrophobic pockets while multiple residues in Ki-67/RepoMan bind the side chains of R74<sub>PP1</sub>, Y78<sub>PP1</sub> and Q294<sub>PP1</sub> via polar and salt bridge interactions. This orders PP1Î³ L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), a loop that is generally more dynamic in most free PP1 and PP1 holoenzyme structures as evidenced by its higher B-factors and less well-defined electron density. Although F517<sub>Ki-67</sub>/F404<sub>RM</sub> are the most buried residues in both complexes, mutating this residue to an alanine does not negatively affect RepoMan function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Because these residues are critical for binding (removing them decreases the affinity ~five-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right), we termed this novel PP1 interaction SLiM the <italic>KiR-SLiM</italic> (<underline>Ki</underline>-67-<underline>R</underline>epoMan SLiM).

PP1 has three isoformsâÎ±, Î² and Î³âthat differ primarily in the last ~30 residues of their C-termini; because of this, it has been generally assumed that regulators that bind preferentially to one isoform interact directly with the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Takagi et al., 2014</xref>). In vivo, Ki-67 and RepoMan bind specifically to the Î²- and Î³-isoforms, but not the Î±-isoform, of PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vagnarelli et al., 2011</xref>). As PP1Î³ is recruited more efficiently than PP1Î² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>), we focused our study on the PP1Î± and PP1Î³ isoforms. We confirmed this in vitro using ITC, which showed that the affinity of both Ki-67<sub>496-536</sub> and RepoMan<sub>383-423</sub> for PP1Î±<sub>7â330</sub> is ~fourâsix-fold weaker than for PP1Î³<sub>7â323</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To elucidate the molecular basis of isoform selectivity, we first tested the role of the PP1Î³ C-terminal residues. Deleting the last 15 residues of PP1Î³ had no impact on binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We then tested if RepoMan binds PP1Î± differently by determining the structure of the RepoMan<sub>383-441</sub>:PP1Î±<sub>7â300</sub> holoenzyme (2.6 Ã; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). The structures are identical (backbone RMSD = 0.22 Ã), demonstrating that the isoform selectivity is due to one or more of the six amino acid differences in the PP1 catalytic domain (residues 7â300). Only two of these differing residues are located near the Ki-67/RepoMan:PP1 interface, Arg20/Gln20 (Î³/Î±) and Lys23/Arg23 (Î³/Î±; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We generated variants of both isoforms in which one or both of these residues were mutated to that of the other (PP1Î³<sup>R20Q</sup>, PP1Î³<sup>R20Q/K23R</sup> and PP1Î±<sup>Q20R</sup>) and determined their affinities for Ki-67<sub>496-536</sub> and RepoMan<sub>383-423</sub> using ITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The change of only a single amino acid, R20/Q20, switches PP1Î³ into a âPP1Î±â-like isoform (PP1Î³<sup>R20Q</sup>; K<sub>D</sub> = 2239 Â± 124 nM; tenÂ fold weaker binding) and PP1Î± into a âPP1Î³â-like isoform (PP1Î±<sub>Q20R</sub>; K<sub>D</sub> = 199 Â± 46 nM; similar binding to that of PP1Î³). Although R20 does not interact with Ki-67Â orÂ RepoMan directly, it confers selectively through its interactions with PP1 which order the L1 loop. Namely, theÂ Arg20 sidechain forms a salt bridge with PP1 residue Glu77 and makes a planar stacking interaction (cation/Ï interaction) with Phe81. Neither interaction isÂ possible with Q20, as the side chain is both uncharged and too short. Thus, only in PP1Î³ is this pocket ordered and readily available for binding, which allows for the isoform specific interaction of Ki-67Â andÂ RepoMan.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16539.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ki-67/RepoMan isoform specificity isÂ defined by PP1 residue 20.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overlay of PP1 from the Ki-67<sub>496-536</sub>:PP1Î³<sub>7â308</sub> (magenta:yellow), RepoMan<sub>383-423</sub>:PP1Î³<sub>7â308</sub> (blue:orange) and RepoMan<sub>383-423</sub>:PP1Î±<sub>7â300</sub> (lavender:pink) complexes.

To confirm that the observed isoform specificity was due to a direct interaction between Ki-67/RepoMan and PP1, we used GFP-Trap and tethering experiments. GFP-traps showed that GFP-PP1Î³ and GFP-PP1Î±<sup>Q20R</sup> bind endogenous Ki-67 in prometaphase-arrested cells, while GFP-PP1Î± and GFP-PP1Î³<sup>R20Q</sup> bind much more weakly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Remarkably, the R20Q mutation abolishes PP1Î³ localization as effectively as mutating the canonical RVxF motif in RepoMan to RATA. Together, these data reveal that the isoform specificity of Ki-67 and RepoMan is not defined by residues in the PP1 C-terminus, but instead by a single residue in the PP1 catalytic domain, R20/Q20 (Î³/Î±). This is a fundamental result, as it demonstrates that regulator-specific isoform selectively is not only achieved through interactions with the C-terminus, but also through interactions with the structured catalytic domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Dynamic regulation of PP1Î³ recruitment to chromosomes by Aurora B Kinase</title><p>Unlike PP1Î±, the localization of PP1Î³ changes dramatically during mitosis, with the bulk of PP1Î³ relocalizing to chromosomes at anaphase onset.

These are key advances as, until this work, there was essentially no molecular data on mitotic phosphatase assembly and function. Our data now explains why the phosphorylation of RepoMan at three distinct sites (S400, S412 and S419) by Cdk1 inhibits PP1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Qian et al., 2015</xref>). Namely, it is similar to the mechanism by which Aurora B kinase inhibits Ki-67:PP1 and RepoMan:PP1 holoenzyme formation. All three residues, like the Aurora B targets S507<sub>Ki-67</sub> and T394<sub>RM</sub>, are part of the PP1 interaction motif and their phosphorylation blocks the interaction with PP1, which, in turn, prevents the premature targeting of PP1 to chromatin. This regulation of holoenzyme assembly is critical as the premature targeting of PP1 to chromosomes leads to an increase in chromosome misalignment and a weakened spindle assembly checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Qian et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the expression of a PP1-binding mutant of RepoMan in HeLa cells results in extensive cell death, demonstrating the importance of the RepoMan-PP1 interaction for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>This work also expands the diversity of SLiMs used by PP1 regulators to bind PP1 and demonstrates a novel mechanism by which isoform selectivity is achieved in PP1 holoenzymes, a question that has been under investigation for the last 20 years. That is, Ki-67 and RepoMan selectively assemble with PP1Î³ because the KiR-SLiM distinguishes between a single residue in PP1: Arg20<sub>PP1Î³</sub> and Gln20<sub>PP1Î±</sub>. Finally, since the KiR-SLiM is present in just two regulators, the newly discovered KiR-SLiM binding pocket defines a novel surface on PP1 that is targetable for the development of drugs that inhibit only 1% of the distinct PP1 holoenzymes in the cell (2 of ~200) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hendrickx et al., 2009</xref>). This is of profound interest because both Ki-67 and RepoMan are highly upregulated in multiple cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dowsett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vagnarelli, 2014</xref>). Targeting unique regulator binding pockets is a powerful approach as we recently discovered that the newly discovered LxVP SLiM substrate interaction surface is a well-known drug target site in the ser/thr phosphatase Calcineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grigoriu et al., 2013</xref>). Given the diversity of unique interactions that are now being revealed between PSPs and their plethora of regulators, it is now clear that these novel, unique protein:protein interaction sites, especially that defined by the KiR-SLiM, provide immediate opportunities for the design of novel, highly specific therapeutics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cloning and expression</title><p>The coding sequences of human Ki-67<sub>496-536</sub>, RepoMan<sub>303-515</sub>, RepoMan<sub>348-450</sub>, RepoMan<sub>383-441</sub> andÂ RepoMan<sub>383-423</sub> were sub-cloned from pGEX4-T3-Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>) and pEGFP-Repoman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qian et al., 2013</xref>) into the pET-M30-MBP vector containing a N-terminal his<sub>6</sub>-tag followed by maltose binding protein (MBP) and a TEV (tobacco etch virus) protease cleavage site. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) RPIL cells (Agilent;Â Lexington,Â MA) transformed with the expression vector for Ki-67 (orÂ RepoMan)Â were grown at 37Â°C in LB broth containing selective antibiotics.

Your initial submission has been assessed by Tony Hunter in consultation with three members of the Board of Reviewing Editors. Although the work is of interest, we are not convinced that the findings presented have the potential significance that we require for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The main linkage between this paper and the original paper in <italic>eLife</italic>, which justifies this as a Research Advance, is the crystal structure of the Ki-67 motif bound to PPI. This new structure is very similar to that of the homologous RepoMan motif bound to PP1Î³, which would have been predicted based on the very strong similarity of the PP1-binding motifs of these proteins. In the rest of the manuscript the authors used the RepoMan:PP1 interaction as a proxy for the Ki-67:PP1 interaction, but without validating any of their conclusions on Ki-67 itself, which makes the link to the original <italic>eLife</italic> paper rather tenuous. The Ki-67 and RepoMan motif-PPI structures are quite interesting because the peptide forms a Î²-hairpin, with its N-terminal part being positioned on the usual RVXF binding site of PP1, but with its C-terminal part turning around 180 degrees, in contrast to other PP1 structures where the polypeptide chain continues more or less straight on the PP1 surface, often establishing a second main contact at the SILK binding site. However, whether Ki67 and RepoMan are the only ligands for this new binding site on PP1, as the authors claim, is not clear, as it may well be that motifs with divergent or even unrelated sequences bind at the same site. Regulation of RV(S/T)F sites by Aurora B kinase has already been established (most notably, for the N-terminal region of Knl1/CASC5), as has the control by Aurora B of RepoMan recruitment to chromatin. Moreover, no direct evidence of the functional importance of the reported RepoMan and Ki-67 interactions with PP1Î³ for progression through mitosis is provided, for instance as assessed by expressing appropriate mutants in knockdown cells. Taken together, the three editors who reviewed this paper are not convinced that these studies constitute a sufficiently substantial advance on Booth et al. to justify publication as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We return a high proportion of articles to authors without passing them on for in-depth peer review so that they can be promptly submitted elsewhere.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Tony Hunter as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This Research Advance by Kumar et al. defines the mechanism by which RepoMan (RM) and Ki-67 interact with the PP1Î³ catalytic subunit. The authors use crystallography, ITC and cell imaging to characterize these interactions. The two main findings are that: (i) RM and Ki-67 interact with PP1Î³ through a common structural mechanism involving an extended structure that includes the RVxF SLiM, the Î¦Î¦ SLiM and a novel motif they refer to as the KiR SLiM. (ii) The authors define a structural mechanism for the selectivity of RM and Ki-67 for the PP1gamma isoform relative to PP1Î± as being due to Arg 20 in PP1Î³ compared to Gln20 in PP1Î±. By substituting Arg for Gln, the authors convert PP1Î± to PP1Î³ -like and vice versa. These results are of interest and warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, subject to the following important corrections and clarifications.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>Second paragraph of Introduction section: A recent paper in Nature sheds light on an important function of Ki-67 and the authors might elect to cite it.</p><p>Sixth paragraph of Results section: &quot;[â¦]pull down PP1Î³[â¦]&quot;: are the data shown anywhere? They are not in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref></p><p>The discussion on binding specificity of RM and Ki-67 for isoforms of PP1 is limited to the Î± and Î³ subunits, but the authors do not mention the Î² subunit anywhere. This point should be discussed.</p><p>Fifth paragraph of Results section: &quot;GFP-Traps showed that GFP- PP1Î³ and GFP-PP1Î±Q20R bind [â¦] in prometaphase-arrested cells&quot;. This is an important point. If the authors' theory on phosphoregulation of the interaction is correct, there ought to be no binding in prometaphase. Please clarify.</p><p>Is Panel 3C cited anywhere in the text?</p><p>First paragraph of Conclusion section: There is additional prior art on the role of PP1 in the control of mitotic checkpoint function, in particular the paper from the Funabiki laboratory (Rosenberg et al. Current Biology 21:942). Please cite it.</p><p>Panel 2F: The upper left panel is probably not the WT Ki-67 sequence, but the positive control GFP-LacI. In panel G, the authors could clearly indicate that they are comparing GFP-LacI to GFP-LacI-Ki67.</p><p>Please add molecular weight markers to all gels.</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>1) The statement beginning in the first paragraph of the Results section. ' [â¦] this conserved region[â¦] constitutes the full PP1 interaction domain'. I could not find evidence for this statement.</p><p>2) Also in the same sentence, given the data presented at this point, the comment that 'Ki-67 and RM interact with PP1 using identical mechanisms' is unsubstantiated. Their structural data presented later does give credence to this view.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> should indicate the Kd and the name of the interaction proteins.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> should also indicate the Kd and the name of the interaction proteins and also indicate what ÎKiR-SLiM actually is.</p><p>5) Third paragraph of Results. The authors identify a new SLiM using HMMER. Did the authors test the role of consensus residues in this motif, for example F517/F404, P523/A416?</p><p>6) The authors suggest that Arg20 of PP1Î³ confers selectivity for RM and Ki-67. The equivalent residue in Gln in PP1Î±. Unfortunately neither the structure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> nor the text explains how Arg20 confers this selectivity. What residues on RM and Ki-67 does Arg20 interact with?

Although the work is of interest, we are not convinced that the findings presented have the potential significance that we require for publication in eLife.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for their assessment that the work is of interest.</p><p>We believe that the findings do have the potential significance required for the publication in eLife and address this concern, in addition to the specific concerns of the reviewing editors, below. We have made the appropriate changes to the manuscript itself, including 12 new experiments (4 new GFP cellular trapping experiment, 2 tethering experiments, 4 ITC measurements and 2 NMR experiments) and 8 revised figures.</p><p> <italic>The main linkage between this paper and the original paper in eLife, which justifies this as a Research Advance, is the crystal structure of the Ki-67 motif bound to PPI.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate that the reviewers agree that this work is justified as a Research Advance due to its original link with Booth, et al. (Booth et al., 2014).</p><p><italic>This new structure is very similar to that of the homologous RepoMan motif bound to PP1Î³, which would have been predicted based on the very strong similarity of the PP1-binding motifs of these proteins.</italic> </p><p>As stated above, this statement is incorrect. This is because the RepoMan:PP1 holoenzyme structure has never been published (3 different PDBids for all novel structures are provided in the manuscript). Rather, it is this manuscript reports both the Ki-67:PP1 and RepoMan:PP1 holoenzyme structuresâi.e., they are both new structures that were not known prior to this work.</p><p>Furthermore, although the ~30 aa sequence conservation between Ki-67 and RepoMan had been identified in the original paper, it was not known until our study that this sequence corresponds to the full PP1 interaction domain for both proteins. The only residues previously identified to interact with PP1 correspond to the well-established RVxF motif. Thus, it is this Research Advance manuscript that demonstrates that residues beyond the RVxF motif are essential for binding PP1 and that they bind PP1 in a manner never observed for any other PP1 regulator. This is a major advance for the field and is why we feel that the finding presented have the significance required for publication in eLife.</p><p><italic>In the rest of the manuscript the authors used the RepoMan:PP1 interaction as a proxy for the Ki-67:PP1 interaction, but without validating any of their conclusions on Ki-67 itself, which makes the link to the original eLife paper rather tenuous.</italic> </p><p>We discovered (and describe in this manuscript) that the Ki-67/RepoMan PP1 interaction motifs are exceptionally well-conserved, bind PP1 with identical affinities and bind PP1 via an identical mechanism, as demonstrated by our multiple PP1 holoenzyme crystal structures (Ki-67:PP1Î³, RepoMan:PP1Î³ and RepoMan:PP1Î±). These data already strongly suggest that the results obtained from RM will be valid for Ki-67. However, we understand the concern of the reviewers and thus have repeated all of the experiments using Ki-67 to experimentally demonstrate this is the case.</p><p>1) GFP-trapping experiments. We performed new GFP-trapping experiments with both wt PP1 isoforms (PP1Î³ and PP1Î±) and PP1 isoform variants (PP1Î³R20Q and PP1Î±Q20R). The results show that only PP1Î³ and PP1Î±Q20R effectively trap endogenous Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). These results mirror that obtained for RM (Figure Supplement 4c).</p><p>2) Tethering experiments. We performed new tethering experiments with GFP-Laci-Ki-67 and RFP-PP1 (PP1Î³ or PP1Î³R20Q) in Chicken DT40 cells. The results show that only PP1Î³ co-localizes with GFP-Laci-Ki-67 at the LacO array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2f and 2g</xref>). These results mirror what was observed for RM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2d and 2e</xref>).</p><p>3) ITC experiments. We performed new ITC experiments with Ki-67 and PP1Î±, PP1Î³R20Q and PP1Î±Q20R. We also performed ITC experiments with Ki-67S507D and PP1Î³. The results show that the affinity of Ki-67 for PP1Î± is weaker than that for PP1Î³, the affinities reverse with PP1 variants PP1Î±Q20R and PP1Î³R20Q, and that the phosphomimetic mutation of Ki- 67S507D profoundly weakens the affinity of Ki-67 for PP1Î³ (Table 1, Figure Supplement 1). These results mirror what was observed for RM (Table 1, Figure Supplement 1).</p><p>4) NMR/phosphorylation experiments. We performed new NMR and mass spectrometry experiments with Ki-67 and Aurora B kinase. The results demonstrate that only Ki-67 residue S507 is phosphorylated by Aurora B kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). This result mirrors that obtained for RM (Supplemental Figure 4).</p><p><italic>The Ki-67 and RepoMan motif-PPI structures are quite interesting because the peptide forms a Î²-hairpin, with its N-terminal part being positioned on the usual RVXF binding site of PP1, but with its C-terminal part turning around 180 degrees, in contrast to other PP1 structures where the polypeptide chain continues more or less straight on the PP1 surface, often establishing a second main contact at the SILK binding site.</italic> </p><p>We agree that these structures are âquite interestingâ. This is the first time such an interaction has ever been observed with PP1, the phosphatase that dephosphorylates more than 50% of all ser/thr residues in humans. Although PP1 has been studied for decades, a mechanistic understanding of how its regulators bind and direct PP1 activity is only just now beginning to be understood. Prior to our study, the only residues in RepoMan and Ki-67 identified to bind PP1 were the canonical RVxF motif. Here, we used NMR spectroscopy and ITC to identify the full PP1 binding domain, which revealed that the PP1 interaction domain extends beyond the RVxF interaction motif to bind PP1 via a novel mechanism and at a novel interaction site that not only enhances binding, but also mediates PP1 isoform selectivity. We then determined the crystal structures of three different holoenzyme complexes to demonstrate that this is the case: (1) Ki- 67:PP1Î³, (2) RepoMan:PP1Î³ and (3) RepoMan:PP1Î±.</p><p><italic>However, whether Ki67 and RepoMan are the only ligands for this new binding site on PP1, as the authors claim, is not clear, as it may well be that motifs with divergent or even unrelated sequences bind at the same site.</italic> </p><p>Over the last ~15-20 years it has been well established that the PP1 binding pockets (such as the RVxF, SILK and Arg binding pockets) bind to motifs with very limited variation in sequence (Choy et al., 2014). For example, the RVxF motif of known PP1 interactors contains a âVâ in 94% of the sequences (the remaining 6% contain an âIâ) at the âVâ position and an âFâ in 83% of the sequences (âWâ in the remaining 17%) at the âFâ position. Similarly, the SILK motif varies only in the first residue, being either G or S (i.e., [G/S]ILK). Thus, contrary to the hypothesis put forward above, the protein-protein interaction sites in PP1 have, in fact, strict requirements for the sequence motifs that bind at these sites.</p><p>Indeed, this is identical to what is observed for substrates and regulatory proteins that bind calcineurin (which bind PxIxIT and LxVP motifs) (Grigoriu et al., 2013), PP2A (LSPI motifs) (Qian et al., 2015) and also defines the sequence specificity of multiple enzymes, like kinases (e.g. PKA, RRxS/TÎ¦, CDK, S/TPxK/R, or the D-motif for substrate recognition of MAPKs, among 10âs and 100âs of other examples). This demonstrates that protein-protein interaction pockets bind to specific sequence motifs and, in this way, achieve specificity. Thus, there is no reason not to expect the same strict sequence requirements will be required for binding the KiR-SLIM binding pocket on PP1. Indeed, this is the reason why numerous efforts are ongoing to target these sequences in the pharmaceutical industry (including Vertex Pharmaceuticals &amp; Reflexion Pharmaceuticals) and academia.</p><p><italic>Regulation of RV(S/T)F sites by Aurora B kinase has already been established (most notably, for the N-terminal region of Knl1/CASC5), as has the control by Aurora B of RepoMan recruitment to chromatin.</italic> </p><p>The specificity of phosphorylation events in time and space are critical for the exceptional fidelity of phosphorylation signaling (arguably, it is this reason why the 100s of phosphoproteomics studies performed in the last decade have been so informative). Our observation that Aurora B kinase specifically phosphorylates Ki-67/RepoMan at their RVxF motifs is a key novel discovery as it explains how and when these holoenzymes assemble during the cell cycle.</p><p>Although some RVxF sites have previously been demonstrated to be regulated by phosphorylation (i.e., PNUTS and Gm by PKA; KNL1 by Aurora B kinase), this manuscript describes the first time that the interaction of RepoMan or Ki-67 with PP1 has ever been demonstrated to be regulated by Aurora B kinase. This is important because it reveals a new mechanism by which the assembly of the Ki-67/RepoMan holoenzymes are regulated during the cell cycle. Namely, the phosphorylation of Ki-67 and RepoMan by Aurora B kinase explains why Ki-67 is maintained in a phosphorylated state in early mitosis and why the RepoMan:PP1 holoenzyme is largely excluded from chromatin prior to anaphase onsetâneither can bind and form stable holoenzymes with PP1. As noted by the reviewers, Aurora B augments this effect by phosphorylating a second site on RepoMan (Ser817; ~400 amino acids away from the RVxF 5 motif) to further prevent it from binding chromatin. Thus, our discovery that Aurora B phosphorylates a second site, the RVxF site, is not only novel, it also demonstrates that Aurora B phosphorylation of RepoMan results in two distinct mechanisms for reducing the premature targeting of PP1 to chromosomes prior to anaphase onset. Both of these are important and our results provide a new understanding of how these holoenzymes are regulated during the cell cycle.</p><p><italic>Moreover, no direct evidence of the functional importance of the reported RepoMan and Ki-67 interactions with PP1Î³ for progression through mitosis is provided, for instance as assessed by expressing appropriate mutants in knockdown cells.</italic> </p><p>In fact, just the opposite is true. Namely, our structural, biochemical and cell biological studies now explain a number of pieces of data concerning Ki-67 and RepoMan the functional importance of Ki-67 and RepoMan during the cell cycle.</p><p>First, previous work has demonstrated that overexpressing a RAXA mutant of RepoMan (which inhibits PP1 binding; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> in the current manuscript) in HeLa cells results in the displacement of PP1Î³ from chromatin. This results in an adverse effect on cell viability, as almost no mitotic cells and very few interphase cells are detected expressing high levels of this mutant and a much larger level of cell death was observed (Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006). Similarly, a study by one of the authors of this manuscript demonstrated that phosphorylation of RepoMan at three distinct sites (Ser400, Ser412 and Ser419) also inhibits PP1 binding (Qian et al., 2015).</p><p>Conversely, mutating these residues to alanine (non-phosphorylatable; 3A variant) results in the binding of PP1 to RepoMan prior to anaphase onset (these mutants were expressed in knockdown cells) and causes the precocious dephosphorylation of mitotic-exit substrates. Our work reveals also how this functional result is achieved at a molecular level--namely, that all three of these residues are part of the PP1 interaction motif and thus, their phosphorylation directly inhibits PP1 binding. Taken together, these data demonstrate the essential role of RepoMan in cell viability is directly related to its PP1-targeting activity.</p><p>Second, when endogenous Ki-67 is replaced by a Ki-67 RASA mutant (which cannot bind PP1), the accumulation of PP1Î³ on chromosomes is reduced (Booth et al., 2014; Takagi et al., 2014). However, the formation of daughter nuclei are not notably affected. This mild phoenotype is consistent with that observed for cells in which Ki-67 is knocked-down completely. Thus, Ki-67 is less important for mitosis and viability than is RepoMan.</p><p>Third, both Ki-67 and RepoMan were previously demonstrated to be specific for the gamma isoform of PP1 (Booth et al., 2014; Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006). We show unequivocally that this specificity is due to the recognition of a single residue within the PP1 catalytic domain by these regulators, Arg20. This is a fundamental new discovery that now explains a plethora of other papers that observed but did not explain this isoform specificity e.g. for nucleolar targeting.</p><p>In conclusion, the importance of these regulators in cell viability and mitosis, in spite of their conserved PP1 interaction motif, differ. This is because the only residues that the two proteins have in common are the short ~30 amino acid PP1 interaction motif; the rest of the sequences are divergent. As stated above, knock-down studies with RepoMan demonstrate that it is critical for viability. The importance of PP1 binding for this function of RepoMan was demonstrated by transfecting a PP1-deficient mutant (RAxA) which led to a large level of cell death. In contrast, 6 similar studies with a Ki-67 RAxA mutant resulted in mild phenotypes, similar to those observed from cells with Ki-67 knocked down. We have edited the text accordingly to more explicitly address these points.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p> <italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Reviewer 1:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Second paragraph of Introduction section: A recent paper in Nature sheds light on an important function of Ki-67 and the authors might elect to cite it.</italic> </p><p>We have included a sentence about the newly discovered function of Ki-67 and have also cited this paper.</p><p>âRecently, it was shown that one role of Ki-67 is to function as a âDNA surfactantâ, preventing individual chromosomes from collapsing into a single chromatin mass upon nuclear envelope disassembly by binding directly to the surface of chromatin<sup>12</sup>.

This is not a surprise, as PP1Î² has the same primary sequence as PP1Î³ in the newly identified selectivity sequence â only PP1Î± is different.</p><p>This now explains data presented in the <italic>eLife</italic> article on which this research advance is associated with (Reference 1). Namely, Booth et al. (2014) used a tethering/recruitment assay (such as that illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) to show that LacI-Ki-67<sub>301-700</sub> recruits both PP1Î³ and PP1Î² to a LacO array in DT40 chicken cells. This work also showed that PP1Î³ is recruited more efficiently than PP1Î². Furthermore, pull-down experiments coupled with SILAC to identify RepoMan interactors whose binding was enriched in anaphase also identified both PP1Î³ and PP1Î², but not PP1Î± (see reference 21). Finally, we now also show in this current report that PP1Î² co-immunoprecipitates with RepoMan and this binding is reduced when the corresponding arginine is mutated to Q (R19Q); this data is now included in âSupplemental Figure 5â..</p><p>To clarify this in the text, we added/edited the following sentences:</p><p>âin vivo, Ki-67 and RepoMan bind specifically to the Î²- and Î³-isoforms, but not the Î±-isoform, of PP1 (as PP1Î³ is recruited more efficiently than PP1Î², we focused our study on the PP1Î± and PP1Î³ isoforms).</p><p>GFP-traps showed that GFP-PP1Î³ and GFP-PP1Î±<sup>Q20R</sup> bind endogenous Ki-67 in prometaphase-arrested cells, while GFP-PP1Î± and GFP-PP1Î³<sup>R20Q</sup> bind much more weakly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>.

This is an important point. If the authors' theory on phosphoregulation of the interaction is correct, there ought to be no binding in prometaphase. Please clarify.</italic></p><p>The binding of PP1 to RepoMan is indeed much less prominent in (pro)metaphase than in anaphase because the binding of PP1 is then opposed by phosphorylation of the PP1-binding domain of RepoMan by Cdk1 (see reference 29) and Aurora B (this work). However, the PP1-RepoMan interaction in (pro)metaphase, although less pronounced, can clearly be demonstrated and is essential to dephosphorylate histone H3T3 at the chromosome arms and thereby contributes to the centromeric targeting of Aurora B (see reference 29) and also âFigure Supplement 4â.</p><p> <italic>Is Panel 3C cited anywhere in the text?</italic> </p><p>Panel 3C was cited in the text (subsection: âDynamic regulation of PP1y recruitment by Aurora K Kinaseâ), but an adjacent supplemental citation was referenced incorrectly making it hard to read.

' [â¦] this conserved region[â¦] constitutes the full PP1 interaction domain'. I could not find evidence for this statement.</italic></p><p>The evidence for this statement is that extending this domain did not enhance binding, as determined by ITC (i.e., RM<sub>383-441</sub>, RM<sub>348-450</sub> and RM<sub>303-515</sub> had K<sub>D</sub>s of 117 nM, 124 nM and 77 nM, respectively).

The data show that, alone, this mutation is not sufficient to negatively impact RepoMan function. Thus, the binding strength provided by the additional portions of both the KiR-SLiM and the RVxF/Î¦Î¦ SLiMs are sufficient to overcome this mutation in vivo. However, as we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, removing the SLiM altogether does negatively impact binding, demonstrating its importance.</p><p> <italic>6) The authors suggest that Arg20 of PP1Î³ confers selectivity for RM and Ki-67. The equivalent residue in Gln in PP1Î±. Unfortunately neither the structure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> nor the text explains how Arg20 confers this selectivity. What residues on RM and Ki-67 does Arg20 interact with? Are these conserved between RM and Ki-67?</italic></p><p>The mechanism is as follows. The Arg20 sidechain forms: (1) a salt bridge with PP1 residue Glu77 and (2) makes a strong planar stacking interaction (cation/Ï interaction) with PP1 residue Phe81. Important â neither interaction is possible with the uncharged, shorter Gln20 residue in PP1Î±. Thus, Arg20 stabilizes the interaction between PP1 loop 1 (residues 19-26) and the remainder of the PP1 catalytic core. This is consistent with our previous data â in the multiple PP1Î± structures we have determined to date (4XPN, 4MOV, 4MOY, 4MP0, 3V4Y, 3EGG, 3EGH, 3HVQ, 3E7A, 3E7B), the density for PP1Î± loop 1 is generally the weakest in the entire structure (even in the 1.4 Ã maps, 4MOV). In contrast, in PP1Î³ structures, the electron density of this loop is consistently better. This is also consistent with the B-factors of this loop: the average increase of the main chain B-factors for this loop (normalized against the average B-factor) are consistently higher for PP1Î± than PP1Î³. Together, these data demonstrate that only in PP1Î³ is this defined pocket is readily available for binding, which, as a consequence, leads to the isoform specific interaction of RM and Ki-67 for PP1Î³.</p><p>This is now more clearly described in the text (Results section, subsection: âThe specific recruitment of PP1y by Ki-67 and RepoManâ).</p><p>âAlthough R20 does not interact with RepoMan directly, it confers selectively through it interactions with PP1 which order the L1 loop. Namely, Arg20 sidechain forms a salt bridge with PP1 residue Glu77 and makes a planar stacking interaction (cation/Ï interaction) with Phe81. Neither interactions are possible with Q20, as the side chain is both uncharged and too short. Thus, only in PP1Î³ is this pocket ordered and readily available for binding, which allows for the isoform specific interaction of RM and Ki-67.â</p><p> <italic>7) The labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> aren't clear.</italic></p><p>The tops of the labels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> were inadvertently cut-off and have been fixed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
