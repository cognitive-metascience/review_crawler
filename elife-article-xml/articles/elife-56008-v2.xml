homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) - two independent pathways for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) - has the potential to improve the efficiency of gene targeting by CRISPR/Cas9. Here, we have developed a rapid and easy-to-score screening approach for identifying small molecules that affect the choice between the two DSB repair pathways. Using this tool, we identified a small molecule, farrerol, that promotes HR but does not affect NHEJ. Further mechanistic studies indicate that farrerol functions through stimulating the recruitment of RAD51 to DSB sites. Importantly, we demonstrated that farrerol effectively promotes precise targeted integration in human cells, mouse cells and mouse embryos at multiple genomic loci. In addition, treating cells with farrerol did not have any obvious negative effect on genomic stability. Moreover, farrerol significantly improved the knock-in efficiency in blastocysts, and the subsequently generated knock-in mice retained the capacity for germline transmission.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>knock-in</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination (HR)</kwd><kwd>non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)</kwd><kwd>farrerol</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chinese National Program on Key Basic Research Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFC2000100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chinese National Program on Key Basic Research Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0103300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chinese National Program on Key Basic Research Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFA0100400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Shaorong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31871438</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81972457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31721003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Shaorong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31871446</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jiayu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund14"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Program of Shanghai Academic Research Leader</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19XD1403000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>&quot;Shuguang Program&quot;

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tebas et al., 2014</xref>). In recent years, a number of genome editing tools including zinc-finger nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Porteus and Baltimore, 2003</xref>), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wood et al., 2011</xref>) and the RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mali et al., 2013</xref>) have been developed. Among them, the adapted <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> CRISPR/Cas9 (SpCRISPR/Cas9) has received the greatest attention due to its simplicity, relative high precision and flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>). The SpCRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system consists of the Cas9 nuclease protein and a single guide RNA (sgRNA) containing a 20-nucleotide (nt) sequence with complementary pairing to a target genomic locus adjacent to a 5’NGG3’ protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). When combined with an sgRNA, the Cas9 nuclease generates a DNA double-strand break (DSB) around 3 bp upstream the target PAM sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mali et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Upon DSB induction, two different DSB repair mechanisms are available to repair the lesion – homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The choice of DSB repair pathway determines the outcome of the genome editing. In the presence of a homologous template, successful HR results in a precise knock-in event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, the error-prone NHEJ probably leads to a phenotype of gene knock-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Many factors, including cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), competition between DNA damage repair factors such as RIF1/53BP1 vs. BRCA1/CtIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hollick et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Srivastava et al., 2012</xref>) and cell type collectively influence the choice between HR and NHEJ. Great efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of SpCRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smirnikhina et al., 2019</xref>). Knocking down the DNA damage response factor, 53BP1, which favors the choice of NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callen et al., 2013</xref>); or important NHEJ factors such as KU70, KU80 and LIG4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2015</xref>) promotes the SpCRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ye et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, a number of small molecules inhibiting NHEJ or promoting HR have been shown to improve knock-in efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Riesenberg and Maricic, 2018</xref>). For instance, suppressing NHEJ by blocking LIG4 activity with SCR7, or inhibiting DNA-PKcs kinase activity with NU7441 or NU7026, has been shown to improve the precise targeting efficiency of SpCRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Robert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, stimulating the HR factor, RAD51, with RS-1 also improved SpCRISPR/Cas9 editing efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jayathilaka et al., 2008</xref>). However, both inhibiting NHEJ and stimulating the activity of the recombinase involved in HR are potentially harmful to the maintenance of genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vartak and Raghavan, 2015</xref>). NHEJ is the major pathway for mending the broken ends in mammalian cells in all cell cycle stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mao et al., 2008a</xref>). Loss of this pathway often leads to high cancer incidences and premature aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lombard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vogel et al., 1999</xref>). The risk of activating RAD51 is that it might increase the chance of the spontaneous recombination with prevalent repetitive sequences in mammalian cells, resulting in the loss of large amounts of genetic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Richardson et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, there is a need to expand the list of the compounds which can improve the efficiency of precise genome editing with minimal or no effect on global genome stability.</p><p>Here, based on our recently developed cell lines containing a dual-reporter for the simultaneous measurement of both HR and NHEJ efficiency at the same chromosomal site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), we generated a novel, rapid, quantitative and easy-to-score screening platform for identifying compounds that could be potentially applied in SpCRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Using the system, we screened 722 small molecules isolated from herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine. We found that farrerol, a natural compound isolated from <italic>Rhododendron dauricum</italic>, which exhibits antibechic, anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), promoted HR but had no effect on NHEJ. Further mechanistic studies indicated that farrerol stimulated the recruitment of RAD51 to DSB sites rather than changed the expression levels of HR related factors. We then demonstrated that farrerol facilitated SpCRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome targeting at different loci in human somatic cells, mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and mouse embryos. In contrast, SCR7 and RS-1, two most commonly used small molecules for gene targeting, exhibited a position dependent effect on targeting efficiency in different cell lines and also in mouse embryos. Moreover, we demonstrated that farrerol did not destabilize genomes using comet assay, karyotype analysis and immunofluorescence staining of genotoxic markers. Conversely, treating cells with SCR7, which blocks the NHEJ pathway, and RS-1, which activates RAD51, diminished genome integrity. Besides, we also found that farrerol could significantly suppress the efficiency of single strand annealing (SSA), which may cause deletions of large fragments between repetitive sequences in genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wyman and Kanaar, 2006</xref>), while RS-1 had no effect on SSA efficiency. Moreover, treating mouse ESCs and blastocysts with farrerol had no adverse effect on cell growth and embryo development, whereas we observed abnormal development in mouse blastocysts treated with SCR7, and we failed to observe a remarkable stimulatory effect on knock-in efficiency in RS-1 treated mouse blastocysts. Most intriguingly, farrerol significantly improved the efficiency of SpCRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in in blastocysts, and the generated knock-in founder mice retained the capability for germline transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a high-throughput compound screening platform for monitoring the choice of DSB repair pathway</title><p>To identify novel compounds that can potentially enhance precise genome editing efficiency, we created CLZ3, a cell line suitable for high-throughput drug screening. The cell line contains a reporter cassette for the simultaneous detection of both HR and NHEJ efficiency at the same locus upon DSB induction at the I-SceI recognition sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and a chromosomally integrated doxycycline-inducible vector encoding the endonuclease, I-SceI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The CLZ3 cell line was derived from the previously described D4a human fibroblast cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), which was developed to measure the efficiency of both HR and NHEJ simultaneously at the same chromosomal site. In the dual HR-NHEJ reporter cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the part downstream of the CMV promoter consists of two GFP exons, the engineered rat Pem1 intron separating the two GFP exons, an adenoviral exon (AD2) flanked by recognition sequences for I-SceI endonuclease in an inverted orientation and an ATG-less tdTomato gene. In the part upstream of the CMV promoter, the reporter cassette contains the Pem1 intron and the inserted full length tdTomato gene. The inducible vector for I-SceI expression is comprised of two parts in an inverted orientation to avoid potential interference from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The first part contains the coding sequence of reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) driven by a constitutively active CAG promoter (P<sub>CAG</sub>). The second part encodes the I-SceI-NLS (Nuclear localization sequence) -HA endonuclease driven by a TET response element (TRE) promoter.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Establishment of a compound screening platform for monitoring the efficiency of DSB repair by HR and NHEJ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the HR-NHEJ dual fluorescent reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).

In contrast, supplementing CLZ3 cells with doxycycline turns on the I-SceI expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), resulting in the induction of DSBs on the dual-reporter cassette. Successful repair by HR leads to functional tdTomato, therefore turning cells red, while NHEJ restores active GFP, turning cells green (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Indeed, using the CLZ3 cell line we found that adding doxycycline into the culture medium leads to the I-SceI expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and we observed both tdTomato<sup>+</sup> (4.3%) and GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (1.5%) either using confocal microscopy or FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). These data indicate that we successfully obtained the cells for screening compounds that potentially alter the balance between HR and NHEJ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The identification of farrerol as an enhancer of HR but not NHEJ using the CLZ3 cell line</title><p>We then employed the CLZ3 cell line to screen a library containing 722 small molecules isolated from herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine. CLZ3 cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well into a 12-well plate. On day 1 post seeding, cells were supplemented with the chemical compounds at a concentration of 5 μM. On day 2, doxycycline was then added into the culture medium at a concentration of 0.5 µg/mL. On day 4 post splitting, cells were harvested for FACS analysis of DSB repair efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Among the 722 screened compounds, we found that it was farrerol that could significantly improve HR repair but had no detectable effect on NHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We further validated its stimulatory effect on HR using our well-established HCA2-H15c and HCA2-I9a cell lines for analyzing HR and NHEJ efficiency separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mao et al., 2008a</xref>). Consistent with our observation in CLZ3 cells, farrerol was proved to significantly promote HR and had no obvious influence on NHEJ in these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, using the extrachromosomal assay we also demonstrated that farrerol significantly promoted HR repair efficiency in mouse ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of HR activation by farrerol, the protein levels of HR associated factors including RPA2, NBS1, RAD50, RAD51, MRE11, CtIP, BRCA1, EXO1 XRCC2, and 53BP1, a negative regulator of HR, were analyzed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We did not observe any significant alterations in the expression level of repair-related factors upon farrerol treatment, indicating that enhancement of HR efficiency is probably not due to changes in the expression levels of the analyzed HR factors. Similarly, cell cycle distribution was not significantly impacted by farrerol treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting that the promotion of HR by farrerol is not through arresting cells in the HR-dominant S/G2 stage. We then hypothesized that farrerol might improve HR by accelerating the recruitment of HR factors to DNA damage sites. Accordingly, we checked the recruitment of RPA2, a single-strand DNA binding protein, at indicated time points post 2 Gy ionizing irradiation (IR) using immunofluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>). However, the result indicated that farrerol has no influence on the recruitment of RPA2. Surprisingly, we found that the average foci number of RAD51 per nucleus was 6.5 and 6.1 in the presence of farrerol (1 and 5 μM) at 4 hr post IR at 2 Gy, in comparison to 4.4 in control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>). At 16 hr post IR, the average foci number of RAD51 per nucleus dropped to 3.2 and 4.3 in farrerol treating cells whereas there were still 6.4 RAD51 foci in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>). These data indicate that the rapid recruitment and timely clearance of RAD51 post IR may contribute to the promotion of HR by farrerol.</p><p>In mammalian cells HR can be further categorized into precise gene conversion, crossover, and the SSA pathway which results in deletions of DNA sequences between two direct repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson and Jasin, 2000</xref>). We tested whether farrerol potentially affects SSA, thereby causing a loss of genome integrity. We employed two previously reported reporters HRF, which measures the efficiency of gene conversion, crossover and SSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), and HRIF, which measures only gene conversion and crossover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Therefore, SSA efficiency can be quantified with HRF minus HRIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mao et al., 2012</xref>). The two reporters were integrated into HCA2-hTERT cells, and a pool of colonies containing chromosomally integrated reporters were mixed for further analysis. Consistent with a previous report that RAD51 is not involved in SSA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benitez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennardo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mendez-Dorantes et al., 2018</xref>), we found that activating RAD51 with RS-1 had no effect on SSA efficiency. Surprisingly, treating cells with farrerol significantly suppressed SSA efficiency by 3.3-fold and 1.9-fold at concentrations of 5 μM and 10 μM respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), suggesting that farrerol might help maintain genome integrity by avoiding the aberrant recombination between the abundant repetitive sequences across genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Farrerol promotes the efficiency of SpCRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting in HEK 293FT cells</title><p>Precisely inserting an exogenous gene into a specific locus requires efficient and faithful HR directed repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pinder et al., 2015</xref>).

HEK 293FT cells were pretreated with farrerol or two positive control compounds SCR7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2017a</xref>) and RS-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Riesenberg and Maricic, 2018</xref>) at the indicated concentrations for 24 hr, followed by co-transfection with vectors encoding Cas9 and sgRNA targeting the <italic>AAVS1</italic> site, and a donor plasmid containing a promoter-less puromycin and a GFP gene driven by the CAG promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We further analyzed the knock-in efficiency using PCR with primers as indicated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that farrerol significantly stimulated the knock-in efficiency by ~2.0 fold at the concentration of 1 and 5 µM, which was similar to those of RS-1 or SCR7 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). In addition, we did not observe any significant effect on cell proliferation in the presence of farrerol at the indicated concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), suggesting

Surprisingly, the promotion of gene targeting by RS-1 is dependent on the size of the homologous arm of the targeting vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pinder et al., 2015</xref>), and the type of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Song et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). It is hypothesized that the promotion of gene targeting by SCR7 is through suppressing the canonical NHEJ (c-NHEJ) pathway by blocking the enzymatic activity of DNA LIG4, forcing cells to choose the other DSB repair pathway – HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Srivastava et al., 2012</xref>). Although some of our results confirmed previous findings that supplementing SCR7 improves the efficiency of gene targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maruyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Song et al., 2016</xref>), the effects are rather mild and it does not always function at the given genomic locus or in different types of cells. This can be explained by the fact that in addition to c-NHEJ and HR, alternative NHEJ (alt-NHEJ) can also repair DSBs. Treating cells with SCR7 actually leaves DSBs repaired either by HR and alt-NHEJ. Whether an optimized treatment with farrerol – such as concentration, treatment time or combinations of these compounds can further improve gene targeting efficiency remains to be further determined. Moreover, a comprehensive and thorough study on the mechanism by which farrerol promotes HR would also help the future application of this compound in genome editing.</p><p>Since HR and NHEJ are two competitive pathways when repairing DSBs particularly in the S/G2 phase with sister chromatids available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mao et al., 2008b</xref>), why does not the activation of HR pathway by farrerol cause the decrease in NHEJ? Upon DSB induction, several consequences might occur: (1) DSBs are not repaired and cells undergo cellular senescence or apoptosis; (2) DSBs are repaired by canonical NHEJ or alternative NHEJ; (3) DSBs are repaired by three sub-pathways of HR, gene conversion, crossover and SSA. Since we also observed that farrerol suppresses the mutagenic SSA pathway, it is possible that without affecting the two sub-NHEJ pathways, farrerol promotes the two precise HR pathways – gene conversion and crossover – by suppressing SSA pathway. Another possibility is that farrerol might tip cells with DSBs away from entering senescence or apoptosis and towards DSB repair by HR.</p><p>Safety is one of the most noteworthy issues in the field of genome editing. Our data suggest that farrerol exhibits no detectable adverse effect on the normal development of mouse blastocysts <italic>in vitro</italic>. More importantly, healthy founder mice with the precise genomic edit of interest could be efficiently generated, and the edited allele could be successfully transmitted to their offspring. Although some literature has reported that high concentration of SCR7 treatment increased the HR efficiency by as much as 10-fold in mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singh et al., 2015</xref>) and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2017a</xref>), our data indicated that SCR7 at such a high concentration would lead to adverse effects on karyotype and blastocyst development. The reason might lie in that inhibiting c-NHEJ might lead to inefficient and late repair of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vartak and Raghavan, 2015</xref>), resulting in abnormal development. In addition, blocking c-NHEJ may destabilize genomes, increasing the incidence of tumorigenesis and the onset of premature aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sekiguchi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vogel et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, the further application of compounds activating HR directed repair should also be cognizant of the possibility that aberrantly activated HR might be beneficial to tumor cells, and may disrupt the genome integrity by aberrantly recombining the abundantly available repetitive sequences across the genomes in normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Putnam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sasaki et al., 2010</xref>). For instance, increased expression of RAD51 destabilizes genomes by stimulating aneuploidy and making chromosomal rearrangements more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Richardson et al., 2004</xref>). Future studies on whether and how a short-term treatment of RS-1 or farrerol affects genome integrity are still warranted.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Wolf-Dietrich Heyer as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript describes the development of a screening platform using a dual fluorescent reporter on homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) activity and the identification of farrerol, a natural compound isolated from Rhododendron, that appears to specifically enhance HR. The authors show that this compound enhances the HR signal by about 2.5-fold, whereas the NHEJ signal remains unchanged. They show a statistically significant increase in targeted integration using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated DSBs in HEK293 cells at the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus as well as in mouse embryonic stem cells at three different gene loci (<italic>Actb</italic>, <italic>Rosa26</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>). Moreover, they show increased targeting activity in mouse embryos, which is statistically significant, an increase in germline transmission, and control for absence of negative effect during embryonic development. The compound is readily commercially available and may substantially increase to efficiency of targeted integration in human and mouse cells, as well as aid in generating knock-in mice.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The screening platform and the dual reported system is not explained well in Figure 1 and needs substantial clarification. In A, what does SA and SD is not defined. How long is the homology for the HR assay part? What is the control of I-SceI? rtTA, P<sub>TRE</sub> and P<sub>CAG</sub> are not defined.</p><p>2) The authors must discuss the unexpected result that HR is increased without a concomitant decrease in NHEJ. This is unexpected from the competition between both pathways, and typically mutants in one or the other pathway affect this balance in both directions. This result could also provide a key to understand the underlying mechanism, although it is understood that this contribution cannot address the underlying mechanism, but is focused on the observation as a tool.</p><p>3) The limited immunoblot analysis in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 does not allow to conclude that protein level changes are not causative, as only a small selection of HR proteins is analyzed and no negative regulators are considered. Excluding a mechanism by trying to demonstrate a negative from a small selection of targets is not a productive strategy, although it is useful to know that the protein analyzed show no changes.</p><p>4) The key issue that would farrerol make a useful tool is that it does induce genotoxic side effects, as shown for the SCR7 or RS-1. The analysis in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 tries to address this but needs to be expanded to include more markers of genotoxic stress (γH2AX foci, 53BP1 foci), karyotyping, and genomic analysis to monitor gross chromosomal rearrangements.</p><p>5) The germline transmission data and conclusion in Figure 5 are based on small numbers (5 versus 0 events), and it is surprising to see no germline transmission in the controls. Any explanation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56008.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The screening platform and the dual reported system is not explained well in Figure 1 and needs substantial clarification.

SD stands for splice donor, and SA stands for splice acceptor. The length of the homologous sequence in our dual reporter is ~ 3.9 kb including the Pem1 intron and the inserted full length-tdTomato. The rtTA is the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator; P<sub>TRE</sub> is the promoter containing the Tet-responsive element, which can be activated upon rtTA binding to the sequence only in the presence of tetracycline or doxycycline; and the P<sub>CAG</sub> is the CAG promoter, which is a strong synthetic promoter frequently used to drive gene expression in mammalian systems. We have included more clarification in figure legends (Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 3). In our previous work (Chen et al., 2019), we characterized HCA2-D4a, the parental cell line of CLZ3 which we used for screening in this study, with a vector encoding the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene (pHPRT–CAG32) as the control of I-SceI. In HCA2-D4a cells transfected with the vector encoding HPRT gene, we did not observe GFP<sup>+</sup> or tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure 1B, Chen et al., 2019), which we used as the measure of NHEJ and HR efficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors must discuss the unexpected result that HR is increased without a concomitant decrease in NHEJ.

We agree with the reviewer that HR and NHEJ are two competitive pathways when repairing DSBs. Nevertheless, upon the induction of a DSB in cells, several consequences might occur: (1) cells might choose not to repair it and enter senescence or apoptosis; (2) cells choose to repair it via canonical-NHEJ or alternative NHEJ; (3) cells choose to repair it by HR, which can be further categorized into two precise pathways, gene conversion and crossing over, and single-strand annealing (SSA) pathway. As shown in our paper, we also observed that farrerol actually suppressed SSA repair (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Therefore, the reasons leading to the increase in HR with no concomitant decline in NHEJ might lie in that (1) the balance of three sub-HR pathways shifts from SSA to the two precise sub-HR pathways in the presence of farrerol; (2) fewer cells with the I-SceI induced DSBs enter senescence or apoptosis. As the reviewer suggested, we have included some discussion in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The limited immunoblot analysis in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 does not allow to conclude that protein level changes are not causative, as only a small selection of HR proteins is analyzed and no negative regulators are considered.

We agree with the reviewer on this issue. We have included more HR factors such as CtIP, EXO1, XRCC2 and the negative regulator such as 53BP1 in the immunoblot analysis. Our results showed that farrerol did not stimulate HR by influencing the expression of these proteins. This data is shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2A. In addition, we have rephrased our text to tone down the conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The key issue that would farrerol make a useful tool is that it does induce genotoxic side effects, as shown for the SCR7 or RS-1. The analysis in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 tries to address this but needs to be expanded to include more markers of genotoxic stress (γH2AX foci, 53BP1 foci), karyotyping, and genomic analysis to monitor gross chromosomal rearrangements.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the valuable suggestions. We have performed immunofluorescence experiments to investigate the level of more markers associated with genotoxicity, including γH2AX and 53BP1. The results showed that in consistent with the previous data obtained with the comet assay, in HCA2-hTERT fibroblasts farrerol treatment did not induce genotoxic side effects assayed by analysis of γH2AX and 53BP1 foci number (Figure 4; Figure 4—figure supplement 1). The γH2AX and 53BP1 immunofluorescence experiments were also carried out in mouse ESCs. By analyzing the fluorescence intensity of the γH2AX using the software ImageJ and the foci number of 53BP1, we observed that farrerol did not affect the genome integrity in mouse ESCs (Figure 4A-D). Moreover, we also performed karyotyping analysis to investigate the potential influence of these drugs on large-scaled chromosomal rearrangements. We found that both SCR7 and RS-1 treatment led to the increase in the percentage of cells with an abnormal karyotype while farrerol treatment had no obvious influence on the karyotype (Figure 4F). Taken together, these data strongly indicate that farrerol has no negative effect on genomic stability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The germline transmission data and conclusion in Figure 5 are based on small numbers (5 versus 0 events), and it is surprising to see no germline transmission in the controls. Any explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. In the previous version we attempted to emphasize that farrerol treatment can not only efficiently improve knock-in efficiency in embryos <italic>in vitro</italic> but also generate more founder mice <italic>in vivo</italic> compared with control, and the generated mice can further transmit the modified gene to the offspring. In the revised version, we performed more experiments by increasing the sample size in the experimental group with the farrerol treatment (Figure 6E; Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). And the data further supported the conclusion. However, the only one targeted founder mouse in the control group was unable to produce knock-in offspring, as shown in our previous version of manuscript. We agree with the reviewers that most founder mice have the ability to transmit their knock-in genotype to their offspring. Thus, we hypothesized that one possible reason for our observation is that the homologous recombination is inefficient in control group and there exists a mosaic genotype which is caused by the occurrence of gene editing even after the 2- or 4-cell stage in individual blastomere, leading to the generation of the chimeric mouse. And the cells with genomic locus not edited might contribute to PGCs (Primordial germ cells), leading to the disability of germline transmission we observed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
