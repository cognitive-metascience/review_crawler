Previously, we used unblocking to show that lOFC neurons respond to a predictive cue signaling a ‘valueless’ change in outcome features (McDannald, 2014). However, many lOFC neurons also fired to a cue that simply signaled more reward. Here, we recorded lOFC neurons in a variant of this task in which rats learned about cues that signaled either more (upshift), less (downshift) or the same (blocked) amount of reward. We found that neurons acquired responses specifically to one of the three cues and did not fire to the other two. These results show that, at least early in learning, lOFC neurons fire to valued cues in a way that is more consistent with signaling of the predicted outcome’s features than with signaling of a general, abstract or cached value that is independent of the outcome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11299.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11299.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>orbitofrontal</kwd><kwd>single unit</kwd><kwd>Pavlovian</kwd><kwd>blocking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IRP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schoenbaum</surname><given-names>Geoffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (McDannald et. al, 2014), it is shown that dissociable populations of neurons in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex acquire responses to cues that predict more, less, or no change in reward in rats during training in a Pavlovian unblocking task.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is often described as signaling either an outcome expectancy, implying a knowledge of the features of the impending outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schoenbaum et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Delamater, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luk and Wallis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Steiner and Redish, 2012</xref>), or a value that exists independent of those features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Levy and Glimcher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</xref>). Notably, while support for abstract value encoding comes largely from studies employing economic decision-making procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plassmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</xref>), it has been suggested that the 'economic' value revealed by these procedures is the same as that underlying well-controlled OFC-dependent behavioral effects such as reinforcer devaluation or sensory preconditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</xref>). Notably, in these settings, the role of the OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">West et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pickens et al., 2003</xref>) cannot be strictly explained by signaling of an abstract or outcome-independent value. Indeed, the behavior that requires OFC reflects a value that is inextricably linked to, or an attribute of, the predicted outcome - the reward in the case of reinforcer devaluation or the primary conditioned stimulus in the case of sensory preconditioning. This implies that OFC allows access to a representation of the outcome through which the value can be inferred or calculated on the fly, at the time the behavior is engaged. Thus, while the aforementioned correlates could reflect the final common calculation, it is equally reasonable that they might reflect the specific associative representations that are activated as part of this calculation. Note this is even true of coding changes with subjective preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>, supplemental), since the perception of attributes is influenced by valuation or preference (e.g., a nice warm cup of hot chocolate while skiing in the winter versus the same cup at the beach in the summer).</p><p>We recently tried to distinguish between these possibilities by using Pavlovian blocking to strip away or ‘block’ the value portion of the outcome during learning, while leaving unblocked the outcome’s unique sensory and other features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McDannald et al., 2014</xref>). We did this by pairing a ‘target’ cue with a rewarding outcome in the presence of a cue that had been previously trained to predict a differently-flavored, but similarly-valued outcome. When this is done, the previously conditioned cue predicts the value that is common to the two outcomes, but does not predict the unique features that distinguish the new outcome (note features are not limited to sensory properties, but might include the outcome timing, location, temperature, size, number, etc.). The target cue acquires associations with the unique features of the new outcome but not with its general value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Burke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rescorla, 1999</xref>). Notably such unblocking is dependent on the OFC, whereas value-based unblocking is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McDannald et al., 2011</xref>). In this prior study, we found that OFC neurons responded strongly to this valueless target cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McDannald et al., 2014</xref>). In fact, they responded as strongly to this cue as they did to a control cue that was paired with an additional reward.</p><p>While this result was perhaps not surprising, given prior evidence that OFC neurons signal both value as well as sensory features of predicted rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>), we were intrigued by the similarity in the strength of these representations. After all, if OFC is primarily concerned with representing value or at least with encoding things with biological significance, then why was the neural representation of a cue signaling a valueless change in reward features so similar to the representation of a cue that actually predicted a more valuable reward? Furthermore, we did not find any correlation in the firing of the value-predicting neurons across other cues present in the task that also predicted reward and value. This suggested to us that the neural activity to this cue was likely not only representing value but instead was representing the unique features that led to the value prediction in the case of that cue; e.g., the additional reward.</p><p>Here we have designed a follow-up experiment to test this question. In this experiment, we have copied the design of the prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McDannald et al., 2014</xref>), recording OFC neurons during unblocking with two changes. The first change was to replace our reward identity shift with a downward shift in value to directly test whether responses to additional reward in the prior study were related to value, which should be reversed in this condition, or some other aspect of the additional reward, which might be unrelated. The second change was to deliver a single drop of reward rather than multiple drops to minimize differences in features between our reward manipulations. We also shifted the size of the outcome rather than the number because number downshift unblocking results in excitatory behavior while a concentration shift does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Esber and Holland, 2014</xref>). The delay to omitted reward in a number downshift condition reduces the downshift association with the cue. In contrast, in concentration downshift conditions, rats immediately know when they have received a reduced concentration and do not exhibit behavioral excitation. We shifted the size because it is more similar to concentration in terms of when rats learn that they have received the downshifted outcome. This change will enable us to differentiate between the upshifted and downshifted cues behaviorally because the former will lead to excitation and the latter inhibition.</p><p>Recording in this setting, we replicated our prior results. We found again that many OFC neurons developed responses to the cue that predicted more reward. Interestingly, these neurons again exhibited relatively restricted responses, suggesting they were signaling something unique about this manipulation. Furthermore, they were joined by other neural populations that developed similar responses to the cue that predicted less reward and even, to some extent, to the cue that predicted no change in reward. This pattern of activity is not consistent with coding of value <italic>independent</italic> of outcome features and instead suggests that much of the neural activity in the OFC is tightly linked to the attributes of impending events: value being one such attribute and outcomes being one such event.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded single-unit activity in the OFC in 18 rats during an odor-based unblocking task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). After implantation of microelectrodes in the lateral OFC, rats were trained to sample an odor in a central port following house light illumination and then respond to a reward well below for a single medium-sized drop of flavored milk. This training was extensive, lasting for at least four days, and was meant to establish the initial odor as a reliable predictor of this specific outcome. Each rat then underwent 1–6 rounds of unblocking.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11299.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental outline, behavior summary, recording sites, and recorded cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Thirsty rats were initially trained to enter an odor port after a house light lit up, then to go to the reward well below to receive a drop of chocolate milk. There were 4 trial types in the unblocking session. The first was a reminder of initial training. On the other three trial types, the originally trained odor was briefly presented, followed by one of three novel odors. The reward following the novel odors was either unchanged (black; blocked trials), larger in size (blue; upshift trials), or smaller in size (green; downshift trials). In the probe test stage, we assessed learning by presenting the novel odors without a subsequent reward. (<bold>b</bold>) Time in the reward well on the probe test trials.

One type was a reminder: the initially trained odor was followed by the expected outcome. On the other three trial types (upshift, downshift, blocked), rats were presented with the initially trained odor, followed immediately by one of three novel odors. On blocked trials, the expected medium-sized drop of milk followed the novel odor. This outcome is fully predicted by the initial odor, thus the novel odor should be blocked from acquiring associative significance. On upshift trials, a noticeably larger drop of milk followed the novel odor. Here the value is increased by the additional amount, with minimal changes in features since the reward identity is the same, as is the location and timing of delivery. Thus the novel target odor should enter into associations with the higher value and possibly with the feature of ‘larger’. On downshift trials, a noticeably smaller drop of milk followed the novel odor. Here the value is decreased by the missing amount, thus the novel odor should enter into associations with the lower value and possibly with the feature of ‘smaller’. We reasoned that if neurons responding to the upshifted odor cue, apparent value coding neurons in the prior study, were in fact signaling value, then they should show less firing to the blocked cue (which predicts no change in value) and even less to the downshifted cue (which predicts diminished value) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, left). On the other hand, if upshift neurons were signaling the attribute of ‘larger’, then we might expect them to be tuned to this particular cue, with additional populations showing selectivity to the cues predicting ‘smaller’ and ‘no change' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, right).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rats learned to respond differently to the upshifted and downshifted cues</title><p>In the unblocking sessions, rats were sensitive to presentation of the novel odors, exhibiting longer latencies to respond at the reward well following odor sampling on these three trial types. Longer latencies to the novel odors were most apparent on the very first trial of each session, particularly on day 1. ANOVA revealed a main effect of trial (F<sub>29,14100 </sub>=4.44, p&lt;0.001) and a trial x day interaction (F<sub>29,14100 </sub>=1.57, p&lt;0.05). In addition to this effect, the rats also learned that two of these odors predicted meaningful changes in the outcome were meaningful. This was evident in the extinction probe test in which they initially spent more time in the fluid well following sampling of the upshift odor and less time following sampling of the downshift odor, versus the blocked odor, as if expecting more and less reward respectively on up- and downshift trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Upshift-responsive neurons in the OFC do not signal value</title><p>We recorded 334 single units during the first day of unblocking and 346 units on the second unblocking day in 60 rounds of training across all 18 rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Characteristically, cells in these populations fired to all of the events that characterized the trials in our task, including prominently during odor sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–g</xref>, steepest portion of slope). To address our hypothesis, units with a baseline firing rate below 10 Hz from both unblocking days were screened for phasic responses to one of the four odors using a t-test, which compared firing rates during the ITI and novel odor period (significance level = p&lt;0.01). Excluding non-associative neurons, which fired from the start of training to all of the odor cues (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for this and other response types not the focus of this paper and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for activity of all units with a baseline firing rate below 10 Hz regardless of odor response), this screen identified 120 units (Day 1=65, Day 2=55) that showed a significant increase in firing to at least one of the odor cues but not all four odors similarly.</p><p>Our primary goal in the current experiment was to test whether upshift-responsive neurons, identified in our prior study, exhibit a firing pattern consistent with value signaling, or whether they might be signaling features. Thus we focused our initial analysis on the neurons (60/120) that showed a significant phasic response to the upshifted odor. For this analysis, we compared firing to the three novel odor cues via pairwise t-tests between the baseline firing rate in the 2 s prior to the light cue and the firing rate in the 1 s following novel odor onset (p&lt;0.01). We isolated cells that responded significantly above baseline to the upshift odor but not all four odors similarly. Cells that responded to all four odors and were value-coding were included in the upshift-responsive population. This analysis revealed a diverse set of patterns within the upshift-responsive population. While these neurons exhibited a variety of patterns of activity to the other odor cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–d</xref>), as a group they fired most strongly to the upshifted cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) and this preference was acquired with learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f, g</xref>), demonstrating that it was not driven by physical properties of the odors but instead by something the odor cue predicted about reward.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11299.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Single unit and population firing of upshift-responsive neurons.</title><p>(<bold>a–d</bold>) Raster plots for firing of single units on initial (red), blocked (black), upshift (blue), and downshift (green) trials.

This was evident in the population response, which while highest for the upshifted cue, did not distinguish between the blocked and downshifted cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Of course, the heterogeneity of response types within such a broad population could obscure a simple value correlate, so next we asked whether a subpopulation of the 60 upshift-responsive neurons might show a linear value correlate. Value-coding was operationally defined as an excitatory response to at least one odor and significantly more activity to the upshift cue than the blocked cue as well as significantly less activity to the downshift cue than the blocked cue. Few neurons exhibited firing that clearly rank ordered the cues according to their value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref>; 5/60; 8%). Though firing in these neurons did provide a linear value correlate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2p</xref>), this proportion was the smallest of the theoretically meaningful patterns that we found and its size was not larger than chance given our analytical approach. We repeated this analysis on all cells regardless of baseline firing rate and without limiting our analysis to odor-responsive cells and found a total of 6 cells, suggesting that our screen had not prevented us from finding value-coding cells.</p><p>On the other hand, we found many neurons that showed isolated firing to the upshifted odor alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>; 19/60; 32%). Indeed this was our largest subgroup. In these cells, we were only able to accurately classify the upshift trial type above chance, and no other trial type, suggesting that these cells only contain information about the upshift cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2q</xref>). Additionally we saw an almost equally large population of neurons that fired similarly to the upshifted and downshifted cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>; 16/60; 27%). This population was reminiscent of the neurons in our prior study that fired similarly to the two cues predicting changes in the outcome. And finally we found a substantial number of upshift-responsive neurons that were equally responsive to the other two novel odor cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>; 10/60; 17%), replicating the finding of salience or novelty encoding in our prior study. Notably, none of these populations showed a relationship between firing to the upshift and downshift cues consistent with value coding across them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2m-o</xref>). Thus, if we disregard the very small number of neurons showing linear coding of value, our results here largely replicated what we observed when unblocking learning by shifting value versus identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l</xref>). Reducing the feature space by moving to a single bolus of reward and including an explicit bidirectional value shift did not reveal frank value coding in a large proportion of the neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>OFC neurons respond independently to the upshifted, downshifted, and blocked cues</title><p>The upshift-responsive population may respond in a non-linear fashion to value. It is not immediately clear why that would be, since rats have been exposed to the different valued rewards in the session, and thus firing in the OFC should scale to reflect the full range that is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Padoa-Schioppa, 2009</xref>). While this is difficult to rule out, one way to address this is to turn to our alternative account, which is that the firing of these neurons represents the attribute or feature that is predicted by the cue, which is the increase in the size of the reward. If this is what is signaled by these neurons, then one would expect there to be similar populations firing to the cue predicting a decrease in reward size and perhaps to the cue signaling no change. These neurons would not have passed our first screen, since we specifically searched for upshift-responsive neurons. So to capture these, we returned to our original data set and repeated the analysis above, but this time examining firing to the other cues. This approach found cells that exhibited isolated firing to the downshifted cue (n = 16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a, d, g</xref>) and to the blocked cue (n = 16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b, e, h</xref>). These populations were similar to the neurons that showed isolated firing to the upshift cue (n = 19, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c, f, i</xref>). The difference in the number of cells that responded to each cue was not significant, chi-squared = 0.353, p = 0.84. In each case, cue-evoked firing developed with training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j, k</xref>). This impression was confirmed by an ensemble analysis that tested how well these neurons could identify the trial type; this analysis found that classification accuracy by these cells during the odor-sampling period improved significantly from day 1 (n = 20, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3l</xref>) to day 2 (n = 29, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3m</xref>). Within day 1, classification accuracy was at chance during the odor-sampling period. There was significant correlation between trial number and classification (rho = 0.85, p&lt;0.001) but accuracy did not increase to above chance until day 2, beginning on the first ten-trial window shown and remaining above chance for the majority of trial windows. The chance decoding in the first day reflects the finding that the responses of these neurons were not stable across these trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3n</xref>). Further, high decoding accuracy on the second day suggests that a downstream structure could decode the trial type from these tuned cells. Though the magnitude of the change in firing rate between baseline and the preferred cue is ~2 spikes/second in tuned cells, the high decoding accuracy suggests that the variance in firing plays a significant role in downstream decoding. High decoding accuracy on day 2 suggests that there is low variance in this response, allowing a downstream structure to interpret a relatively small change in firing magnitude.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11299.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Tuned cells and population activity.</title><p>Raster plots as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–d</xref> for firing of single units that are selective for one cue on unblocking day 2 are shown for units responsive to only the (<bold>a</bold>) Downshift cue (<bold>b</bold>) Blocked cue (<bold>c</bold>) Upshift cue.

We used blocking and identity unblocking as a way to prevent information about general value from becoming associated with our cue of interest. We found that OFC neurons developed firing to a cue predicting a valueless change in reward identity. However, many OFC neurons also fired when we increased the amount of reward. Here we conducted a follow-up experiment designed to test whether these responses are signaling value or whether they might be signaling the feature of the larger reward. We found primarily the latter, with very few neurons showing linear value correlates.</p><p>However, one flaw in our design is that, of course, we intentionally used blocking to reduce or eliminate associations with general value. Our apparent failure to observe linear value correlates could be secondary to this manipulation. To address this, we ran a control experiment in which the trial structure was identical to the above experiment except that in compound training, rats did not receive training with novel cues in compound with the initial odor cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). This change essentially eliminated the blocking of value, without changing any of the other aspects of the task. Accordingly, we found that the rats again showed evidence of learning about the reward predicted by the three cues, spending more time in the fluid well following sampling of the large-predictive odor and less time following sampling of the small-predictive odor, versus the medium-predictive cue, as if expecting more and less reward respectively after sampling these cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11299.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Control experimental outline, behavior summary, recording sites, and neural results.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Procedure is nearly identical to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> except a control procedure was used rather than a blocking procedure.

We recorded 93 single units during the first day and 78 units on the second day in 16 rounds of training across all 7 rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). As in our first experiment, these neurons exhibited firing to all of the events that described a trial, including prominently to the odor-sampling period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4f–h</xref>). Twenty-six units (Day 1=16, Day 2=10) showed a significant increase in firing to at least one but not all four of the odor cues similarly. We found no evidence of linear value coding (0/26, 0%); instead neurons in this population again tended to develop firing that was tuned to the individual cues (14/26, 54% including 8 small, 2 medium, and 4 large). Although we had a much smaller sample, the activity of these neurons looked similar to the activity of the tuned populations identified in our first experiment inasmuch as these neurons exhibited high firing to one of the odors and equally low firing to the other two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4d, e</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Neural signals in the OFC are often described as representing either outcome expectancies or abstract value. Although many studies have argued for one or the other, few have used behavioral designs that clearly dissociate predictions of these two hypotheses. Previously we addressed this question by using an unblocking procedure to strip away or ‘block’ the abstract value of the outcome during learning, while leaving unblocked – free to enter into associations – the outcome’s sensory and other unique features. This approach revealed that many neurons in the OFC developed firing to target cues that predicted a valueless change in the identity of the predicted outcome. This sort of associative encoding is consistent with the involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex in a variety of behaviors that require direct access to specific information about the outcome's sensory features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McDannald et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Howard et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>However, we also found that many neurons developed firing to a cue that simply predicted the delivery of an additional drop of reward. Although this condition was included as a positive control condition (in the event we saw no change in activity to our other cue), we were intrigued because the firing to this cue was not substantially stronger or in any other way more robust than that to the cue that predicted an unambiguous change in reward identity. This seemed at odds with proposals that the primary or at least a major role of the OFC is to encode the abstract or general value that cues predicting reward acquire (i.e., independent of outcome features). We wondered whether firing to this cue was simply reflecting some unique feature of additional reward (the concept of more, its timing, the unique presence of a third drop) and not the abstract increase in value it represented.</p><p>Here we tested this hypothesis by repeating our prior study, to identify neurons that fired to the cue predicting more reward, while adding a condition in which a cue predicted less reward. We reasoned that if the neurons firing to more reward were signaling abstract value, independent of any features unique to that condition, then neurons that fire more to a cue predicting more reward should fire less to a cue predicting less reward (versus the cue predicting no change). On the other hand, if these neurons were signaling a unique feature of the larger reward - essentially something contributing to its identity - then these neurons would not become selective for the other cues.</p><p>Our results were clearly in line with the latter prediction. We saw only a small population of neurons that exhibited firing consistent with abstract value coding across the three cues (upshift, downshift, blocked) and much larger groups of neurons that became responsive to each cue with training. Notably this was true in both the first experiment, in which we used a pre-trained ‘blocking’ cue as we had in the first study, and it was also true in the second experiment, in which we eliminated this pre-training. Thus, we do not believe that our failure to observe abstract or general value coding across cues was due to blocking of value by the pre-trained cue.</p><p>The firing that develops to these cues may reflect associations with novel features of the outcome delivered on these trial types (larger, smaller, unchanged). Such associations are known to develop when additional rewards are delivered, even during unblocking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Holland, 1984</xref>). This information encoded across an ensemble of neurons would clearly be relevant to determining the value of the impending outcome. However, our findings are not consistent with the proposal that these neurons directly signal the abstract or linear value that is acquired across cues at the single unit level. Indeed we saw almost no neurons in the OFC that fit this profile in our experiments.</p><p>So what does our failure to find these correlates mean? Many prior studies have reported value coding in the OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plassmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Padoa-Schioppa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tremblay and Schultz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McNamee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hare et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Plassmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kahnt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strait et al., 2014</xref>). How do we reconcile our results with these prior reports? A number of possible ways exist to understand this apparent discrepancy. The first is that it represents a species difference. Most of the aforementioned studies have focused on ‘economic’ value and decision-making. These models are largely applied to humans and monkeys. It is possible that the increased size and complexity of the OFC in primate species has led to the development of this abstract value coding. This is possible, though we believe it is unlikely, since most of the anatomical and functional data across species is roughly similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rudebeck and Murray, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wallis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stalnaker, et al., 2015</xref>). This is especially true of the importance of the OFC to reinforcer devaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gottfried, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Izquierdo et al., 2004</xref>), a function first identified in rodents. To the extent economic value is sensitive to devaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Padoa-Schioppa and Schoenbaum, 2015</xref>), this suggests that the role of the OFC in contributing to its representation is not unique to primates.</p><p>A second possibility relating to species differences is the accompanying differences in task design. Studies claiming value effects on neural activity in OFC have typically tested in a situation requiring choices between outcomes. This may make value information particularly salient compared to our task where explicit comparisons are not required. We view this as unlikely, since a core requirement of value signaling is automaticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lebreton et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, this does not preclude differences in how this tracked value is represented in neural activity in the OFC. While the OFC may perform the same function between Pavlovian and choice tasks, there may be differences in how each is encoded.</p><p>A third possibility is that we are in the wrong part of the OFC to find these correlates. We are recording primarily in the lateral OFC. This is an area distinguished by a pattern of connectivity with amygdala, striatal and cortical areas that is qualitatively most similar to what is termed the lateral orbital network in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ongur, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Price, 2007</xref>). Most of the studies that have identified abstract value correlates in the OFC found them in more medial areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plassmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McNamee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hare et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strait et al., 2014</xref>). Further, studies in primates that have tried to distinguish medial versus lateral functions have assigned valuation based functions more to medial areas and functions such as credit assignment and representation of reward identity to more lateral areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2012</xref>). It may be that the sort of linear value correlates that we were looking for are to be found in medial OFC. Indeed recent work in humans has shown that OFC represents specific outcome features and that more lateral orbital areas represent those outcomes in a way that is dependent upon prior cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Klein-Flugge et al., 2013</xref>). In this regard, it is worth noting that the lateral part of the OFC is not normally necessary for behaviors in which value independent of outcome features is required. For example, the OFC is not required for simple Pavlovian or instrumental conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Izquierdo et al., 2004</xref>) discrimination learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Izquierdo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McDannald et al., 2005</xref>), extinction by reward omission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>), transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</xref>), and even perhaps reversal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rudebeck et al., 2013</xref>), all of which can be accomplished without reference to specific information about predicted outcomes. Similarly, both blocking and unblocking – when it can be accounted for by value – do not require the OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Burke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McDannald et al., 2011</xref>). However, the OFC is necessary for superficially similar behaviors (Pavlovian or instrumental responding, discriminations, even learning) when they require knowledge of the outcome features in order to recognize errors or to derive or infer a value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Izquierdo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McDannald et al., 2011</xref>). This is even true in unblocking, where we have shown that the OFC is required for the development of conditioned responding to a target cue paired with a shift in outcome identity but not to a target cue paired with additional outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McDannald et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A fourth possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy between our results and many of these studies lies in the difference in measures. The vast majority of these studies have reported that BOLD signal correlates with abstract value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plassmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McNamee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hare et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2010</xref>). BOLD signal differs from single unit spiking in at least three important ways that are relevant to this question. First, BOLD signal obviously reflects the summed activity of many neurons. Thus it identifies what the global summed processing across a large ensemble is tracking. This might be very different from what is encoded by groups of individual single units. Without knowing more about specific connectivity between neurons within an area, it is impossible to know if one or the other result is more relevant to the function of the area. But at a minimum, this might lead to very different results. The second way these two measures differ is that BOLD signal is more likely to reflect neural processing other than what is output from an area. This is because it reflects energy usage, which is a measure that does not distinguish between local and long distance communication. On the other hand, extracellular recording electrodes are heavily biased to record from large, regular spiking neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McCormick et al., 1985</xref>), which are likely to be the output neurons, at least of cortical regions. Again this might cause very different signals to be detected using the two methods. Finally the third and related difference between these two measures is that fMRI can be heavily influenced by input to an area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Logothetis and Pfeuffer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Logothetis and Wandell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Logothetis, 2008</xref>). Again this is because it measures energy usage and thus will be sensitive to the EPSP's (and IPSP's) due to afferent input. Note this is true even if these inputs do not lead to summation and action potential generation at the downstream hillock of a large output neuron (a very energy efficient event). For all these reasons, it is to be expected that fMRI studies and single unit studies may often report divergent findings.</p><p>Finally it is worth noting that neuroeconomic value may not be the same sort of value identified in our lexicon as pure, abstract, general or cached (i.e., independent of outcome features). This has been our reading of the original reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plassmann et al., 2007</xref>). However one of the authors of these studies has suggested more recently that neuroeconomic value is in fact tied closely to and derived from knowledge of the features of the predicted outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Padoa-Schioppa and Schoenbaum, 2015</xref>). He states unequivocally that the economic value that correlates with firing in the OFC in monkeys is the same value that changes with devaluation and that it is tied inextricably to the identity of the predicted outcome. Indeed devaluation-sensitivity is taken to be an iconic feature of decisions based on economic value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</xref>). Notably, this definition would align our concept of signaling of outcome features with signaling of economic value, since economic value would then be just another attribute of the outcome. Of course, we would not expect it to be shared across outcomes or even necessarily across cues, particularly in a very lightly trained animal such as that in our current study. In this context, we would predict relatively specific representations and relatively little representation of this value across outcomes. This is what we have observed here. It is possible with extended training, such as that in studies reporting large populations of single unit coding value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Padoa-Schioppa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2014</xref>), that the representations generalize as the rewards used become part of a ‘goods space’ as it is defined in these prior studies. As long as what is being signaled by such activity remains an attribute or feature of the predicted outcome - and sensitive to changes in that feature without further learning - then this would be consistent with our current data.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>18 and 7 Male Long-Evans rats were obtained at 200–250 g from Charles River Labs, (Wilmington, MA) for the blocking and control experiments, respectively. Rats were tested at the NIDA-IRP in accordance with NIH guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgery and histology</title><p>Using aseptic, stereotaxic surgical methods, a drivable bundle of sixteen 25 µm diameter FeNiCr wires (Stablohm 675, California Fine Wire, Grover Beach, CA) was chronically implanted in the left hemisphere at OFC at 3.0 mm anterior to bregma, 3.2 mm laterally, and 3.9 mm ventral to each rat’s brain surface. These wires were cut at an angle with surgical scissors immediately prior to implantation, to extend ~1.8-2.5 mm beyond the cannula, with a range of ~0.3 mm between wires. Current was passed through each electrode immediately prior to implantation to lower the impedance to ~300–400 kOhms. At the study’s conclusion, a 15 µA current was passed through each electrode to mark the final position. Following perfusion of the rats, their brains were extracted and processed for histology using standard techniques.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Blocking task</title><p>Recording was conducted in grounded aluminum chambers approximately 18’’ on each side with sloping walls narrowing to an area of 12’’ x 12’’ at the bottom. An odor port was located centrally above a fluid well on a panel in the right wall of each chamber. Above the panel were two lights. To allow rapid delivery of olfactory cues to the odor port, it was connected to an airflow dilution olfactometer. Odors were chosen from compounds obtained from International Flavors and Fragrances (New York, NY). The fluid well was connected to lines controlling the independent delivery of liquid rewards. A computer running a behavioral program written in C++ implemented control of the task. Following implantation with microelectrodes, rats were water deprived by restricting access to 10 min daily. Following two days of water deprivation, rats were shaped, in stages, to hold in the odor port for 1 s in order to receive a water reward at the well. Each trial started with house light illumination, following which rats had 3 s to enter the odor port. A failure to enter the odor port caused restart of the trial. Rats were required to hold for 1 s in the odor port, and upon exit had 3 s to enter the reward well. Again, failure to hold for 1 s or to make reward well entry within 3 s resulted in restart of the trial. Following shaping, rats were trained until they proficiently responded for the initial odor to receive a medium-sized bolus of a flavored milk solution; this comprised up to 15 sessions, with a maximum of 170 trials per session. Completion of ~150 trials per session was characterized as proficient responding.</p><p>Once rats were deemed proficient at initial training and single units were isolated, the unblocking procedure began. On each of the two learning days, rats received four trial types. The first trial type was a reminder of initial training. The remaining trial types comprised a 200 ms presentation of the initial odor followed by one of three 800 ms, novel, differentiable odors: one signaling the same medium-sized bolus of flavored milk used in prior training, a second signaling a bolus more than twice as large, and a third signaling a bolus less than half the size of the medium bolus. The behavioral requirements for each of trial type were exactly as in initial training. Rats completed 20–40 trials with each novel odor per session during unblocking. Then, on the probe test day, rats received 10 reminder trials of each type, followed by up to 10 trials of each novel odor alone without reward, interleaved with rewarded presentations of the initial odor to maintain responding. During the unrewarded, novel-odor extinction trials, both requirements to sample the odor for 1-s and respond to the reward well were lifted. This unblocking procedure was repeated one to six times per rat, using a new set of blocked, upshift and downshift odors each time; for rats who completed more than 4 sessions, a new initial odor was also trained for 4–5 sessions prior to repeating unblocking.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Control task</title><p>The Control task was identical to the Blocking task through shaping. Following shaping, rats were trained until they responded proficiently for an odor cue to receive a medium-sized bolus of water; this comprised up to 15 sessions, with a maximum of 170 trials per session. Completion criteria and instrumental components were identical to the Blocking task aside from one difference, which was that the rats were required to hold for 1 s in the odor port, but the first 200 ms for every trial type were clean air, followed by 800 ms of odor cue presentation. Once rats were deemed proficient at initial training and single units were isolated, rats were trained that a new odor predicted a medium-sized drop of a flavored milk solution. Following this, on each of the two learning days, rats received four trial types. The first trial type was a reminder of initial training. The remaining trial types comprised three novel and differentiable odors, presented as in the Blocking task, again with one signaling the same medium-sized bolus of flavored milk used in prior training, a second signaling a larger bolus, and a third signaling a smaller bolus. The behavioral requirements and probe test were identical to the Blocking task. This control procedure was repeated one to four times per rat, using a new set of small, medium and large odors each time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Single-unit recording</title><p>Neural activity was recorded using six identical Plexon Multichannel Acquisition Processor systems (Dallas, TX), interfaced with odor discrimination training chambers described above. Following recovery from surgery and proficiency in shaping, electrodes were advanced daily until activity was obtained. Rats received reminder training using the pre-trained initial odor, as described above, during this process. Once rats showed proficient responding and single units were isolated, the rat began unblocking. During this three-day procedure, the electrode was moved ~167 µm between the first and second learning days for approximately three quarters of the runs in the Blocking-trained rats and for all of the runs in the Control-trained rats. Following completion of each three-day unblocking procedure and prior to repetition of this process in new odor cues, the electrode was advanced ~167 µm in order to acquire neurons in a new location in OFC in all rats.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical data analysis</title><p>Units were sorted using Offline Sorter software from Plexon Inc (Dallas, TX) using a k-means algorithm. Sorted files were next processed in Neuroexplorer to extract relevant event markers and unit timestamps. These data were then analyzed in Matlab (Natick, MA). To analyze activity in response to the novel odors, we examined activity between 300–1300 ms subsequent to initial odor onset, which corresponded approximately with the novel odor delivery to the odor port. The inter-trial interval was defined as the 2 s preceding illumination of the house light. Normalized firing was calculated by subtracting firing rate during the ITI from the period of interest: Normalized firing = (Period spikes/s) – (ITI spikes/s). Odor-responsive neurons were identified as units that showed an increase in firing from baseline during odor sampling (t-tests, p&lt;0.01) on at least one of the 4 trial types in either the Blocked or the Control experiment. All odor period analyses and figures show data beginning with the 8<sup>th</sup> trial, excluding heat plots over trials and classification accuracy over trials.</p><p>Neurons were classified as putative sensory neurons and excluded from further consideration if they significantly increased firing to all odors and were not value-coding. Neurons that were not eliminated by this screen were classified as upshift-responsive in the Blocked experiment if they increased firing significantly to the upshift cue. Single-unit and population activity was plotted in 50-ms bins. Population activity was additionally analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA with bin (50 ms) and odor trial (initial, blocked, upshift and downshift) as factors.</p><p>Heat plots were constructed in 150-ms sliding windows moving away from the novel odor onset in 50 ms increments. Warmer colors (dark red) indicated positive difference scores while cooler colors (dark blue) indicated negative difference scores. Significance of differential firing to identified odors was determined by performing a one-tailed t-test comparing differential firing to zero in the exact same 150-ms sliding windows for each trial shown.</p><p>Latency correlation analyses were performed between individual trial latencies and the firing rate during the novel odor period on the same trial. Correlation analyses were performed on cells recorded on the second day of unblocking on trials 5 through 30.</p><p>Classification accuracy was calculated using a linear classifier on instantaneous firing rate measured in 100 ms bins. The goal of the classification was to predict the trial type. Classification accuracy by trial was performed using a sliding window. Accuracy was calculated during the 400 ms window following novel odor presentation for all cells and 500 ms window following novel odor presentation for tuned cells. Bins were counted as additional trials to offset low trial number according to the number of cells used. Statistical significance was calculated based on a binomial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Combrisson and Jerbi, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Single unit and population firing were smoothed by taking a four-bin average moving in 50 ms increments moving away from the novel odor period. Classification accuracy during the odor period was smoothed by taking a three-bin average moving in 100 ms increments moving away from the novel odor period. Classification accuracy over trials plots were smoothed by taking a three-trial average.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program at the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an exciting follow up on a highly creative earlier study that further advances our knowledge of what drives neurons in the orbital prefrontal cortex.</p><p>Essential revisions are outlined below in detail:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript is a follow-up on an earlier study investigating what drives activity in orbitofrontal cortex neurons. The task is similar to before, except that the situation where the reward identity is changed (&quot;identity unblocking&quot;) is replaced by a condition where the reward size is reduced (&quot;downwards unblocking&quot;). There was again a blocking condition (new cue/same reward) and an &quot;upwards unblocking&quot; condition (new cue/bigger reward) to allow the authors to determine whether cells coded for value or for some other aspect of the stimuli. A second experiment was performed that missed off the initial cue such that essentially the authors could look for learning of value coding.</p><p>This is a nice follow up to the first published study. There is new information here to reinforce the authors' conclusions that value coding is not the predominant for observable in this particular population of lateral OFC cells in rodents. The discussion about why this does not fit with some others' views on OFC coding is excellent.</p><p>I only have a small number of comments to help clarity.</p><p>1) The key issue of the study is the proportion of value coding neurons. I wonder whether it would be useful to plot this explicitly in a pie chart or similar so the reader can quickly see this. Equally, would not a slightly less biased route be to ask: is there evidence for linear encoding (positive/negative) across the three reward sizes in any recorded neuron? I doubt this will change the conclusion – it might even strengthen it.</p><p>2) It took a long time for me to figure out what was happening in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Something other than making the initial odor cloud grey should be put in to make it clear that it wasn't presented.</p><p>3) It would be better if <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> was presented in a way that represented the trial types rather than &quot;preferred&quot; and &quot;non-preferred&quot;.</p><p>4) This isn't really an issue for the study and the conclusions, but I was surprised the downwards unblocking condition is being sold as a value reduction when the surprising thing in Holland's work is that it seems to confer positive value to the new stimulus in spite of the reduction in reward size. Any comments? Could this be related to the fact that the initial stimulus in the compound is shared across all trial types meaning it loses any predictive strength?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting study of cue-outcome association and value coding in the rat anterior insula/lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC). It follows up closely on a paper with an ingenious behavioural manipulation published by the same group in <italic>eLife</italic> in 2014 (McDannald et al.,) that argued that rat lOFC neuron activity is not easily explained as simply encoding value of a reward outcome but aspects of the association between a stimulus and a reward outcome. Here a further ingenious twist is added by the use of a combination of both upshift and downshift procedures whereby some animals learn that some cues indicate an increase or a decrease in previously experienced reward levels. Some lOFC neurons are preferentially active in response to upshift cues, some to downshift cues, and some to both. Once again the message is that it is difficult to reduce the activity of neurons in this region simple to value encoding.</p><p>I have the following minor observations. With the exception of point 1 they mostly concern the Discussion.</p><p>1) Presumably the population of neurons that are not the main focus of the current study but which responded to all cues do not contain a mixture of neurons with either positive or negative encoding of value but that such effects even out when the activity of the entire population is plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>)?</p><p>2) In general the Discussion is thoughtful. Unusually for a rodent neurophysiology study there is a serious attempt to engage with human neuroimaging and macaque neurophysiology data in a sophisticated way. The argument at the end of the Discussion is, however, difficult to follow and it is very salient because it is the final paragraph of the manuscript and thus seems like the authors' conclusion. It is difficult, for example, to square some of the manuscript's empirical findings with this paragraph. For example, it is difficult to square the prominence of downshift responses reported here in a simple and direct manner with neurons with activity that covaries with value but this seems to be authors' argument.</p><p>I agree that it is possible to imagine a brain that has both types of neurons and that they might operate in relation to one another. However, the authors seem to go further and suggest that the neurons they study here and the value neurons reported previously may be one and the same in nature. Given that the value effects that are reported in some previous macaque studies and human neuroimaging studies are not ubiquitous across the ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortex doesn't this already mean that are other types of neurons in other parts of the primate ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortex some of which may be more similar to the neurons the authors study here? There may be many disadvantages to neuroimaging but one advantage is that it is possible to get a sense of activity across the brain and when an attempt is made to look for both value and cue-outcome association representations in the same study (e.g. Noonan et al., J. Neuroscience, 2011) the results implicate different subdivisions of lOFC and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.</p><p>The section is also little unusual in the way that it attributes views to another author but cites a review written jointly by that person and one of the authors of the current report. There is something a little unusual about the style in which this section is written.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11299.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) The key issue of the study is the proportion of value coding neurons.

Rather than a preferred response, we have indicated the tuned response.</p><p><italic>4) This isn't really an issue for the study and the conclusions, but I was surprised the downwards unblocking condition is being sold as a value reduction when the surprising thing in Holland's work is that it seems to confer positive value to the new stimulus in spite of the reduction in reward size. Any comments? Could this be related to the fact that the initial stimulus in the compound is shared across all trial types meaning it loses any predictive strength?</italic> </p><p>While the above comment is true, our understanding (from the literature and discussions with Dr. Peter Holland) is that it applies primarily to decreases in reward number. In fact this is one reason why we moved from a number downshift to a size downshift in this experiment. This dichotomy is evident in published work. For example, in Esber and Holland (EJN, 2014), the rats experience concentration and number downshifts. While rats show excitation to the number downshift cue, they do not show excitation to the concentration downshift cue. Dr. Holland’s explanation as we understand it is that excitation may develop in response to a number downshift because the first reward is excitatory; thus, rats go to the well because they will receive the first expected reward. There is a delay before the subsequent reward is omitted, so this has a weaker associative effect on the number downshift cue since several seconds pass between the cue and a reward downshift. However, concentration is not excitatory. When rats first receive a concentration downshifted outcome, they immediately know which outcome they received and that it is worse than the previous outcome. This has a stronger associative effect because there is less delay between the cue and the downshifted outcome. Dr. Holland says that he has found similar effects for changes in size (personal communication); thus the excitatory effect seems to be unique to changes in number of rewards and perhaps only when presented sequentially.</p><p>In any event, we specifically chose a size change to avoid this issue. Fluid is dispensed in a fraction of a second, and rats immediately know that they received a smaller outcome. For this reason, we think that size in our design is more like concentration than number based on the immediacy of the outcome following the cue. Consistent with this goal, our rats did not show excitation to the downshifted cue; rather they showed inhibition of behavior – slower latencies. So we think in our particular case, that this concern does not apply.</p><p>However, because Peter and others have indeed found excitation in response to cues predictive of downshift, we will clarify this point in our Introduction. We have copied where we will elaborate on this difference between concentration and number below.</p><p>“Here we have designed a follow-up experiment to test this question. In this experiment, we have copied the design of the prior study (McDannald et al., 2014), recording OFC neurons during unblocking with two changes. […] This change will enable us to differentiate between the upshifted and downshifted cues behaviorally because the former will lead to excitation and the latter inhibition.”</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) Presumably the population of neurons that are not the main focus of the current study but which responded to all cues do not contain a mixture of neurons with either positive or negative encoding of value but that such effects even out when the activity of the entire population is plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>)?</italic> </p><p>Thank you for raising this question. We screen for value in cells that respond to all cues and consider cells that respond to all four cues with value encoding to be value-signaling cells and not putative sensory cells as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>. However, we looked through the manuscript for the description of how we screened for these cells and found that this was buried in the methods: “Neurons were classified as putative sensory neurons and excluded from further consideration if they significantly increased firing to all odors and were not value-coding.”</p><p>Below is a revised caption. Thus, it will be clear in looking at this figure that value-coding cells are not included in this population:</p><p>“<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. Odor-responsive units not analyzed in the main text […] d)52/174 (30%) of the excitatory odor-responsive cells showed a significant phasic response to each of the four odor cues. <italic>Neurons were classified as putative sensory neurons only if they were not value-coding.</italic> These neurons fired to all of the odors, even the blocked odor, thus their firing cannot be easily explained as signaling information about the predicted outcomes. However they might be signaling information about the cues themselves, such as their shared sensory features or intrinsic salience. When we examined the firing of neurons in this population on the first 10 trials of unblocking,”</p><p>Further, we noticed that our descriptions of how we screened for value cells in the main text did not indicate this either and updated the text accordingly:</p><p>“Our primary goal in the current experiment was to test whether upshift-responsive neurons, identified in our prior study, exhibit a firing pattern consistent with value signaling, or whether they might be signaling features. […] We isolated cells that responded significantly above baseline to the upshift odor but were not value-coding.”</p><p><italic>2) In general the Discussion is thoughtful. Unusually for a rodent neurophysiology study there is a serious attempt to engage with human neuroimaging and macaque neurophysiology data in a sophisticated way. The argument at the end of the Discussion is, however, difficult to follow and it is very salient because it is the final paragraph of the manuscript and thus seems like the authors' conclusion.

The section is also little unusual in the way that it attributes views to another author but cites a review written jointly by that person and one of the authors of the current report. There is something a little unusual about the style in which this section is written.</italic></p><p>We apologize for the confusion. The intent of the final paragraph is indeed a bit muddled. We really only meant to point out that at least one of the proponents of the OFC=value hypothesis – Camillo Padoa-Schioppa – has described in writing a definition of value that seems synonymous (to us) with the type of value that would be a specific attribute of the “goods”. Thus while the data and a how they are described refer to value as independent of the specific features of the learned associations, the writings and the statements this person makes in public are in fact different. In the “dialogue” that we cite, Dr. Padoa-Schioppa in fact states explicitly that the value signaled by OFC neurons is an attribute of the good or outcome. And previously he has written that devaluation is the iconic economic decision… (we cite both pieces). So we simply wanted to close by pointing out that IF this is what is meant by “neuroeconomic value”, <italic>then</italic> it is not at odds with our definition or our findings. We have tried to recraft this final paragraph (see below) to better reflect this intention:</p><p>“Finally it is worth noting that neuroeconomic value may not be the same sort of value identified in our lexicon as pure, abstract, general or cached (i.e., independent of outcome features). […] As long as what is being signaled by such activity remains an attribute or feature of the predicted outcome – and sensitive to changes in that feature without further learning – then this would be consistent with our current data.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
