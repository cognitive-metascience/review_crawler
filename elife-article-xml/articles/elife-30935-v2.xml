in the developing nervous system. KIF2A mutations have recently been identified in patients with malformed cortical development. However, postnatal KIF2A is continuously expressed in the hippocampus, in which new neurons are generated throughout an individual's life in established neuronal circuits. In this study, we investigated KIF2A function in the postnatal hippocampus by using tamoxifen-inducible <italic>Kif2a</italic> conditional knockout (<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO) mice. Despite exhibiting no significant defects in neuronal proliferation or migration, <italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO mice showed signs of an epileptic hippocampus. In addition to mossy fiber sprouting, the <italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO dentate granule cells (DGCs) showed <italic>dendro-axonal conversion</italic>, leading to the growth of many aberrant overextended dendrites that eventually developed axonal properties. These results suggested that postnatal KIF2A is a key length regulator of DGC developing neurites and is involved in the establishment of precise postnatal hippocampal wiring.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30935.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain contains billions of neurons that connect together to form ‘circuits’ that control behavior and process information. By the time we are born, most of the neurons in our brain have already formed and connected into these circuits. But there are some brain areas that continue to make new neurons throughout our lives. One such area is the hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in learning and memory. There, neurons called dentate granule cells keep their ability to divide, migrate to new locations, and develop new connections.</p><p>Like most neurons, at the heart of each dentate granule cell is a cell body that contains the cell's nucleus and protein-making machinery. Attached to this are a set of small branch-like structures called dendrites that receive signals from surrounding neurons. Extending away from the cell body is another, longer branch called an axon, which transmits signals to other neurons.</p><p>A protein called KIF2A plays several roles in the developing brain of mammals, including helping neurons to migrate to the right place and controlling how their axons form. Before birth, neurons across the brain make KIF2A. After birth this gradually changes until only the dentate granule cells in the hippocampus produce KIF2A. In humans, mutations that prevent KIF2A from working are thought to cause brain malformations. They may also lead to disorders such as schizophrenia, epilepsy and eye defects.</p><p>To investigate the role of KIF2A in more detail, Homma et al. genetically engineered mice so that giving them a drug called tamoxifen would inactivate the gene that produces KIF2A. Mice that had this gene switched off three weeks after birth – when KIF2A levels in the hippocampus are normally at their highest – lost weight and became hyperactive. They also developed severe temporal lobe epilepsy.</p><p>To find out why these problems ocurred, Homma et al. used a microscope to study sections of the brains of the mice. The neurons had divided and migrated to the correct location of the brain with no significant problems. However, dentate granule cells that lacked KIF2A looked unusual. They had too many dendrites, the dendrites were longer than they should be and they showed markers usually only found on axons. This suggests that KIF2A helps to control the length of axons and dendrites and the wiring of the hippocampus.</p><p>At the moment, it's not known whether the same defects also occur in humans. If the results are reproducible in people, future work could help to diagnose and understand conditions linked to KIF2A, like schizophrenia and epilepsy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>KIF2A</kwd><kwd>dentate granule cell</kwd><kwd>postnatal hippocampal wiring</kwd><kwd>axon-dendrite determination</kwd><kwd>temporal lobe epilepsy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirokawa</surname><given-names>Nobutaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004054</institution-id><institution>King Abdulaziz University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSTIP Strategic Technologies Program Project (12-BIO3059-03)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirokawa</surname><given-names>Nobutaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004054</institution-id><institution>King Abdulaziz University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR: 1-6-1432/HiCi)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Naseer</surname><given-names>Muhammad Imran</given-names></name><name><surname>Chaudhary</surname><given-names>Adeel G</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Qahtani</surname><given-names>Mohammed H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Postnatal KIF2A is a key regulator for axon/dendrite determination of developing dentate granule cells, and its loss developed apical axons in dentate molecular layer, broke hippocampal wiring, and induced temporal lobe epilepsy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the mammalian nervous system, kinesin super family proteins (KIFs) play a crucial role in intracellular transport, microtubule (MT) dynamics, and signal transduction and, hence, are key players in brain function, development, and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirokawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirokawa, 1998</xref>).

Both mutants are expected to lose MT destabilizing activity, due to a disruption in ATP binding or hydrolysis, thus resulting in a classic form of lissencephaly.</p><p>After reaching its peak in the early postnatal weeks, however, the expression of postnatal KIF2A throughout the brain is gradually restricted to specific brain regions, including the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lein et al., 2007</xref>), in which new neurons are generated throughout an individual’s life in established neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eriksson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaplan and Hinds, 1977</xref>). This postnatal expression pattern suggests that KIF2A might be involved in adult neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and the establishment of refined neuronal circuits in these brain regions, but this role has not yet been confirmed because conventional knockout mice die within 1 day of birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Homma et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we generated tamoxifen-inducible <italic>Kif2a</italic> conditional knockout (<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO) mice to demonstrate the postnatal role of KIF2A in the postnatal brain. We began tamoxifen injections in postnatal week 3 (3w), when the cortical neurons or major cranial nuclei had nearly completed their migration. The 3w-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO mice showed successful neuronal migration, but all mice died by postnatal week 6 and showed signs of hyperactivity, weight loss, and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In the postnatal hippocampus, KIF2A expression was histologically restricted to the dentate mossy fibers (MFs), and the loss of KIF2A-induced MF sprouting (MFS) and aberrant recurrent excitatory circuits. In our 3w-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO mouse model, unlike the typical TLE mouse model, the dentate granule cells (DGCs) extended aberrant axons through both the inner and outer molecular layers (IML and OML, respectively). Intriguingly, primary cultured P3-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO DGCs did not regulate axonal or dendritic length, and consequently, the characteristics of the overextended dendrites changed, resulting in axonal conversion. These results suggested that postnatal KIF2A is a key length regulator of DGC developing neurites and is crucial for establishing postnatal hippocampal wiring.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Weight loss, hyperactivity, and severe epilepsy were exhibited by 3w-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO mice</title><p>To determine the role of KIF2A in the postnatal brain, we generated tamoxifen-induced <italic>Kif2a</italic> conditional knockout mice (<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In the IML in 3w-<italic>Kif2A</italic>-cKO mice, ectopic granule cells into the dentate morphologically integrated into the dentate ML, potentially affecting gyrus circuitry and resulting in epileptogenesis in the 3w-<italic>Kif2A</italic>-cKO hippocampus.</p><p>However, the influence of TLE on the <italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO hippocampal phenotypes is still arguable. In ordinary TLE (left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), epileptic excitation induced MFS, recurrent extension of sprouted MF into the dentate IML, and aberrant excitatory recurrent circuits in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McNamara, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Although we succeeded in decreasing the influence of TLE through anticonvulsant CBZ treatment in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and by reproducing the aberrant neurites in dissociated DGC cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figures 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>), this approach must still be carefully evaluated when examining the contribution of the loss of KIF2A to the epileptogenesis and phenotypes of 3w-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO mice. For example, regarding the expansion of the aberrant axons throughout the ML in 3w-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO mice, in TLE, many other types of axons in the hippocampus in addition to MFs exhibit sptouting, but those axons are not detected by Timm's stain. In 3w-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-KO mice, MFS may extend into the OML simply because other types of axons did not sprout in our model, thus leaving more ‘space’ for MF sprouting. However, we believe that the ‘space’ might not be greatly different between 3w-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) and the 3w-induced TLE animal models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) because both mice showed TLE beginning at postnatal week 4, and the sprouting of many types of axons, including MFs in the hippocampus, might be induced by TLE in the ML at the same level.</p><p>Regarding the regulation of KIF2A function, the phenotypes of tamoxifen-injected <italic>Kif2a</italic>-KO DGCs suggested that KIF2A may possibly contribute to MFS in ordinary TLE. After epileptic fits in the hippocampus, hyper-excitation locally up-regulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the target site of the MF projection, the stratum lucidum (SL). The local activity of BDNF in the hilus initiates MFS, thus eventually resulting in hippocampal hyper-excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tamura et al., 2009</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, KIF2A is highly expressed in the SL, and previous research has shown that BDNF-derived kinases p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) block the function of KIF2A by phosphorylation in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ogawa et al., 2012</xref>); thus, the hyper-excitation-induced local activation of BDNF might potentially block KIF2A function and therefore induce MFS only in the hilus. Detailed analysis of tamoxifen-injected <italic>Kif2a</italic>-KO DGCs would demonstrate the contribution of KIF2A to MFS in ordinary TLE.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The contribution of KIF2A loss to weight loss and hyperactivity</title><p>The 3w-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO mice exhibited weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), first becoming hyperactive, then gradually losing interest in food, becoming weak, and eventually dying. The link between these phenotypes and epilepsy remains unclear, but some reports have suggested that these phenotypes are associated with hippocampal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fallet-Bianco et al., 2008</xref>). Doublecortin (DCX)-KO mice, which exhibit both weight loss and hyperactivity, harbor a neuronal lamination defect in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Håvik et al., 2012</xref>). Tuba1a-KO mice, which are hyperactive, exhibit prominent hippocampal lamination defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fallet-Bianco et al., 2008</xref>). Although 3w-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO mice did not show an apparent hippocampal laminar defect at P35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), ectopic cells in the dentate gyrus or pyramidal cells displaced by sprouted MFs would result in weight loss and hyperactivity.</p><p>Moreover, both phenotypes have also often been reported in MCD patients and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stottmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stottmann et al., 2017</xref>).

In the future, the molecular mechanisms of KIF2A regulation in DGC development and hippocampal wiring should be explored in both KO mice and in human patients.

and genomic fragments were amplified from the 129/Sv-derived ES cell (ESC) line CMT1-1 (Chemicon/Millipore, Billerica, MA) by using an LA-PCR kit (Takara, Japan). The CMT1-1 ESCs were transfected with the targeting vector and screened for homologous recombinants using PCR. The 3loxP/+ESCs were electroporated using a pCre-Pac plasmid to remove the selection cassette flanked by loxP sequences. The 2loxP/+ESCs were injected into blastocysts, and chimeric male mice were obtained and bred with C57BL/6J female mice. Germline transmission was confirmed by PCR using tail DNA samples. <italic>Kif2a</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were produced by an intercross with <italic>Kif2a</italic><sup>fl/+</sup> mice. To conditionally delete exons flanked by loxP and driven by the chicken beta-actin promoter/enhancer coupled with the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer (CBA), tamoxifen-inducible Cre transgenic mice (CreERt; CAG-Cre/Esr1; Jax #004453, JAX MICE Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were used. The CBA-CreERt mice were characterized by using lacZ expression with ROSA26 reporter mice (R26R), which have a loxP-flanked STOP sequence followed by the lacZ gene inserted into the gene trap ROSA26 locus (By courtesy of Prof. Soriano [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Soriano, 1999</xref>]). Conventional knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Homma et al., 2003</xref>) were crossed with CBA-CreERt<sup>+/−</sup> mice to obtain <italic>Kif2a</italic><sup>+/−</sup>;CBA-CreERt<sup>+/−</sup> mice.

Tamoxifen (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, 10 mg/ml) was dissolved in sunflower oil and administered at a dose of 30 mg per kg body weight daily for 7 consecutive days. The <italic>Kif2a</italic> deletion occurred when the tamoxifen-induced Cre recombinase deleted the floxed DNA domain, which was followed by a frameshift during the <italic>Kif2a</italic> RNA translation. Deletion was confirmed by a western blot analysis of the crude extracts of whole brain tissues at P21 by using a monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal region of KIF2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Noda et al., 2012</xref>). For control mice, we generally used wild-type mice after ensuring that the <italic>Kif2a</italic><sup>fl/−</sup>; CBA-CreERt<sup>+/−</sup> mice and WT mice were not significantly different.

The monitor displayed 16 invisible infrared light beams per axis with synchronous filtering, double modulation and digital hysteresis. These beams provide information that describes the movement of an animal in its home cage, thus allowing an animal’s behavior to be monitored. Mice that were housed singly in their home cages were placed in the beam boxes for 5 min, and their activity was continually recorded. The measurements used to assess home cage activity included active time. The average amount of active time was analyzed using Student’s t-tests.

Dental cement (GC Dental, Tokyo, Japan) was used to fix the electrode set to the skull. The electrode positions in the left hemisphere and the CA1 of the left hippocampus were stereotaxically determined as 1.3/1.3 mm or 2.0/1.8 mm anterior to the bregma and 1.2/1.2 mm or 1.5/1.5 mm lateral to the midline at a depth of 1.3/1.2 mm or 1.5/1.3 mm for the WT or 3w-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO mice, respectively. These differences were due to the differences in the average brain sizes between the two genotypes. EEG recordings were obtained from mice after complete recovery.

The mean signal intensity (I) within these cursor points was measured at an 8-bit resolution using ImageJ software (NIH, USA). The Timm grain intensity was determined by dividing the values of these subregions by the value of the subiculum (background). The same method was used to measure the NFM intensity. As an internal control, we used the intensity of NFM staining in the hilus, because the intensity in the subicular or other areas in the dentate gyrus was not stable.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Dispersed dentate granule cell cultures</title><p>P3-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO and WT mice were euthanized at P5, and their hippocampal dentate gyri were dissected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hagihara et al., 2009</xref>). Each dentate gyrus was trypsinized and gently triturated to isolate cells (3.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>), which were placed in a four-well glass chamber (Nunc, 155411). Chambers were coated with poly-L-lysine overnight at room temperature (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), washed with DW for 2 hr twice, and then coated with laminin overnight at 4°C (inquiry) to clearly visualize any morphological differences in the rapid growth of neurites. Dispersed cells were cultured in MEM (Gibco Thermo Fisher, MA)/Neuro Brew-21 (MACS, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. To confirm the characteristics of the cultured neurons, the cells were stained with anti-NFM, anti-MAP2, anti-Prox1, and anti-AnkyrinG antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures</title><p>To confirm excitatory recurrent circuits in the tamoxifen-injected <italic>Kif2a-</italic>cKO hippocampus, organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koyama et al., 2004</xref>). Briefly, P4 mice were deeply anesthetized, and their brains were removed and cut into 300-μm-thick transverse slices using a VR-1200S (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) in a cold oxygenated Gey’s balanced salts solution supplemented with 25 mM glucose. Entorhino-hippocampi were dissected and cultured using a membrane interface technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stoppini et al., 1991</xref>). Briefly, the slices were placed on sterile 30-mm-diameter membranes (Millicell-CM; Millipore, Bedford, MA) and transferred to six-well tissue culture trays. The cultures were fed with 1 ml of 50% minimal essential medium (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD), 25% horse serum (Cell Culture Lab, Cleveland, OH), and 25% HBSS and the cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The medium was changed every 3.5 days.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Phil Soriano (Mt.

We think this is a very interesting phenotype, bit there were aspects of the work that we think require additional data and that the work was somewhat overinterpreted. Thus we cannot consider the manuscript further at this time. However if you are able to address these issues with additional data and rewriting, we would be will consider a resubmission in the future.

The authors accomplish this through the generation of a novel, floxed allele of KIF2A gene and crossing to a β-actin promoter tamoxifen-inducible Cre line. Doses of tamoxifen administered daily between P14 and P21 led to the loss of KIF2A expression in the brain and the onset of hyperactivity, weight loss and epilepsy. The dentate gyrus was particularly affected by KIF2A deletion where they observed misplaced granule cells and increased axon terminals in the outer molecular layer. In culture KIF2A-null cells exhibited minor neurites that were positive for both axon and dendrite markers and increased axon branching with the latter phenotype reversed by re-introduction of KIF2A. From these data, the authors conclude that KIF2A regulates hippocampal wiring, and loss of KIF2A results in aberrant sprouting of axon like neurites from granule cells that precipitates epileptiform activity in the hippocampus. The resulting phenotype is interesting in that there is a proliferation of terminals in ectopic locations within the dentate gyrus that is in some ways reminiscent of mossy fiber sprouting in TLE models and patients. Overall this is an excellent study, but key aspects are lacking or could use significant refinement to support the conclusions.</p><p>1) The authors claim in multiple places that there is a distinction between their model and animal TLE models since the sprouting occurs in their model without an initial inciting excitatory event. This is a distinction with uncertain accuracy. They show that their mice have spontaneous activity so it is hard to know how much is being driven by the ongoing abnormal excitation in these fibers. The treatment with VPA is perhaps a bit helpful for this, however, VPA likely acts via augmenting inhibitory synaptic activity and may not actually be affecting cell-intrinsic abnormal excitation in the DGC. Another even more important point is that the authors neglect the recent studies of Danzer and colleagues (and others) who have shown that mutants in PTEN develop spontaneous MF sprouting and seizures. I would say that the authors results are interesting and novel without making attempts to overstate the global novelty of a model that spontaneously develops sprouting.</p><p>2) The authors try to argue that &quot;migration&quot; is essentially complete by P15 and thus they are studying the formation of circuits instead. However, the dentate continues to generate new neurons and this is still ongoing at P15 at a very high level. These newborn cells are produced in the subgranular zone and migrate into the dentate. It seems quite possible that <italic>Kif2a</italic> is involved in their migration too. Thus, it is hard to conclude that the ectopic DGC are due to abnormal excitation or due to their abnormal axonal morphology. This could still be a primary migratory problem. The authors need to acknowledge this issue and/or provide data in support of their conclusions.</p><p>3) It is interesting that the authors note the phenotype of multiple axons, which is distinct from MF sprouting in epilepsy. In epilepsy the axons are usually sprouted from the main axon and there are still clear dendritic processes. This is distinct and interesting. However, this does perhaps make it less physiologically relevant to the human problem. This issue needs discussion to avoid overinterpretation.</p><p>4) Their section distinguishing between the terminals in pilo-TLE dentates isn't convincing. The example here is a fairly weakly sprouted TLE mouse compared to many animal TLE examples. Furthermore it is worth remembering that in TLE it isn't only the MF that are sprouted but many axons in the hippocampus. It is just easier to detect the MF sprouting because of Timm's stain. In their model it is possible that the MF sprouting occupies other areas simply because of other axon types are not sprouted in their model, leaving more &quot;space&quot; for MF sprouting. The authors need to be more cautious with these interpretations as the current formulation is not convincing.</p><p>5) The authors claim that their model has sprouting and epilepsy without an &quot;inciting&quot; epileptic event. This is a big chicken-egg problem. The authors aren't able to actually exclude that their mice are having small subclinical seizures from very early on. The use of VPA doesn't exclude this possibility. This is another example of overinterpretation.</p><p>6) The authors make an effort to confirm that cerebral cortex lamination is not affected by postnatal conditional deletion of KIF2A. Yet, no characterization is presented regarding the impact of KIF2A loss on granule cell neurogenesis and migration. This relates to KIF2A's established role in mitosis and migration.</p><p>7) The emergence of what the authors refer to as apical axons is a critical aspect of the report, yet it is not clear if the cells producing these processes are established or newly integrated granule cells. Another issue associated with the apical axons is the lack of a clear demonstration that these neurites are capable of forming presynaptic processes on other neurons (if only demonstrated in culture). The observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3N and 3O</xref>, while interesting, are not quantified thus making it difficult to conclude the significance of these finding either in magnitude or how often such events are observed.</p><p>8) Additionally, the manuscript needs significant compositional editing and proofing.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;KIF2A regulates the development of dentate granule cells and postnatal hippocampal wiring&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Samuel J Pleasure (Reviewer #1). The reviewers were very satisfied with this version of the manuscript. The study brings new insights both to the cell biology of KIF2A function in neurons during circuit assembly and to the cytoskeletal contributions to the establishment and maintenance of neural circuitry. As such, it will be a valuable contribution to multiple disciplines.</p><p>We ask only that you consider these minor suggestions before final acceptance:</p><p>1) Given that this is a novel mechanism for hyper-excitability, the manuscript would benefit from a discussion of this dendro-axonal conversion including whether this phenomenon may be a result of altered chemo-attraction/repulsion or could be cell autonomous.</p><p>2) The Abstract requires further refinement including where the olfactory bulb is referred to as a site of adult neurogenesis and the authors could better define 3w-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO at this section of the manuscript.</p><p>3) The inducible Cre model and various control strains/treatments could also be more clearly described in the Results section.</p><p>4) Methodological choices remain unclear including the reasoning for culturing the hippocampal slices for 10 days rather than using acute slices for electrophysiological recordings and the switch from tau1 staining to NFM for axon labeling. Clarification would benefit the reader in following the logic of the study.</p><p>5) Immuno-histochemical examination of the distribution of the axon hillock marker Ankyrin G could be a straightforward and important way to better define the nature of the additional neurites observed in the 3w-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO hippocampi as they are posited to contribute to the phenotype of the cKO.</p><p>6) The term &quot;ictal mouse&quot; could be replaced with &quot;mouse during the ictal phase of seizure&quot;.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> legends refers to statistical measures no longer found in those figures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30935.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors claim in multiple places that there is a distinction between their model and animal TLE models since the sprouting occurs in their model without an initial inciting excitatory event.

I would say that the authors results are interesting and novel without making attempts to overstate the global novelty of a model that spontaneously develops sprouting.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, we indeed overstated the differences between our model and animal TLE models. After learning about the research on PTEN, including the studies of Danzer and colleagues, we have changed a focus of our manuscript from the role of KIF2A in TLE to a focus on postnatal development of DGCs because spontaneous sprouting has not been determined to be a globally novel phenomenon.</p><p>We still describe the differences between our model and animal TLE models, but we have minimized the claims regarding these differences. As supporting evidence, we also used an anti-epileptic drug, but changed the drug from VPA to carbamazepine (CBZ), which is a blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-E</xref>). The results indicated that axonal terminals were spread in the OML in CBZ-treated 3w-<italic>Kif2A</italic>-cKO, which was the same result as that observed in VPA-treated mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors try to argue that &quot;migration&quot; is essentially complete by P15 and thus they are studying the formation of circuits instead. However, the dentate continues to generate new neurons and this is still ongoing at P15 at a very high level. These newborn cells are produced in the subgranular zone and migrate into the dentate.

This could still be a primary migratory problem. The authors need to acknowledge this issue and/or provide data in support of their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer stated, we should have tested DGC migration, because we have shown that KIF2A prenatally affects neuronal migration in the hippocampus, thus resulting in a laminary defect (Homma et al., 2003). Therefore, in this revised manuscript, we tested DGC migration by using birth dating analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We injected two thymidine analogues (CldU and IdU) into pups for 7 days before and during tamoxifen injection. In this experiment, CldU-positive cells were designed to lose KIF2A expression after cell proliferation, but IdU-positive cells were designed to lose KIF2A expression during cell proliferation. At P35, we fixed the brains, and brain slices were immunostained with specific antibodies for each dU. After measuring the number of dU-positive cells and the distance between the baseline of the GCL and the cell, we compared the values statistically. Significant differences were not detected in either cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) or cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G and 3H</xref>). Therefore, we believe that cell proliferation and migration might contribute less to the development of an epileptic hippocampus than hippocampal wiring due to aberrant DGC development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is interesting that the authors note the phenotype of multiple axons, which is distinct from MF sprouting in epilepsy. In epilepsy the axons are usually sprouted from the main axon and there are still clear dendritic processes. This is distinct and interesting. However, this does perhaps make it less physiologically relevant to the human problem. This issue needs discussion to avoid overinterpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised Discussion, we have added some explanation of this issue (subsection “Future perspectives”). In human patients with mutant KIF2A, there has been no histological evidence of hippocampal phenotypes, because all of the patients are still living.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Their section distinguishing between the terminals in pilo-TLE dentates isn't convincing. The example here is a fairly weakly sprouted TLE mouse compared to many animal TLE examples.</p></disp-quote><p>We had a similar thought, and we repeated experiments more than three times to generate a pilocarpine-induced TLE animal model, but the results were the same, in that the axon terminals in IML were substantially weaker than those in many mouse TLE models. We surmise that three weeks (from postnatal week 3 to 5) is not a sufficient amount of time to develop severe recurrent circuits from sprouted axons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore it is worth remembering that in TLE it isn't only the MF that are sprouted but many axons in the hippocampus. It is just easier to detect the MF sprouting because of Timm's stain. In their model it is possible that the MF sprouting occupies other areas simply because of other axon types are not sprouted in their model, leaving more &quot;space&quot; for MF sprouting. The authors need to be more cautious with these interpretations as the current formulation is not convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the constructive suggestion. We obtained additional data to compare the “space” in the molecular layer between the <italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO and TLE animal models, and we now mention this possibility in the revised Discussion (subsection “The contribution of postnatal KIF2A loss to hippocampal wiring and epilepsy”, third paragraph). We believe that the “space” might not be different between 3w-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and 3w-induced TLE animal models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) because both mice showed TLE from the postnatal week 4 onward, and the sprouting of many axons, including MF in the hippocampus, might be induced by TLE in the molecular layer at the same level.</p><p>In our study, however, when we used anti-epileptic drugs such as carbamazepine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the Timm’s staining in the molecular layer was darker than that observed in untreated <italic>Kif2A</italic>-cKO. Therefore, as the reviewer mentioned, there might be more “space” in the molecular layer in CBZ-treated 3w-<italic>Kif2A</italic>-cKO than in untreated 3w-<italic>Kif2A</italic>-cKO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors claim that their model has sprouting and epilepsy without an &quot;inciting&quot; epileptic event. This is a big chicken-egg problem. The authors aren't able to actually exclude that their mice are having small subclinical seizures from very early on. The use of VPA doesn't exclude this possibility. This is another example of overinterpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We also have considered the “chicken-egg” problem in the previous manuscript. In the revised paper, we mainly focus on KIF2A function in DGC development, not the pathogenesis of TLE, and we have made fewer claims regarding our findings. As a phenotype of less epileptic episodes, we explain the results of anti-epileptic drug treatment. In the revised paper, we used CBZ instead of VPA because CBZ blocks the voltage-gated sodium channels of the DGC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors make an effort to confirm that cerebral cortex lamination is not affected by postnatal conditional deletion of KIF2A. Yet, no characterization is presented regarding the impact of KIF2A loss on granule cell neurogenesis and migration.

We have added data from a birth-dating analysis to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Within a period of 3 weeks after tamoxifen injection, however, we did not detect a significant difference in DGC neurogenesis and migration. In the future, we want to determine the influence of KIF2A loss on adult neurogenesis and migration by using a late-onset Cko model, such as 8w-<italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO mice, because those mice can live for more than 6 months (unpublished data).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The emergence of what the authors refer to as apical axons is a critical aspect of the report, yet it is not clear if the cells producing these processes are established or newly integrated granule cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We are also eager to know whether the granule cells are “established or newly integrated”. We succeeded in labeling established cells born at E13.5 at the top of the GCL by using in utero electroporation, but we were not able to immunostain established neurites with either axonal markers or a dendritic marker. In addition, the signal was so weak at P35 that we could not observe spine morphology.</p><p>We succeeded in comparing DGC morphology at the top, middle, and bottom by using Thy1-GFP-expressing M-line transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B and 5C</xref>). The top DGCs lost KIF2A expression after being established, the middle ones lost it during migration, and the bottom ones lost it during proliferation or migration. The results showed that the bottom cells developed aberrant protrusions or thin neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), and the middle and the top ones developed recurrent axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The dendrites of the top DGCs showed morphological changes, and the trunks became thinner and the spines became more unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), even if the frequency of the spine was not significantly different.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue associated with the apical axons is the lack of a clear demonstration that these neurites are capable of forming presynaptic processes on other neurons (if only demonstrated in culture). The observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3N and 3O</xref>, while interesting, are not quantified thus making it difficult to conclude the significance of these finding either in magnitude or how often such events are observed.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised paper, the frozen slices were stained with synaptoporin, which is a marker of both presynapses and DGC axons. The average intensity in the molecular layer was higher in <italic>Kif2A</italic>-cKO mice than in control mice. We attempted for more than a year to detect triple-stained synapses with Thy1-GFP, presynaptic marker, and DGC marker; however, this approach was unsuccessful in the slice samples, owing to technical issues (especially Thy1-GFP-expressing cells, which could not be stained with any antibodies). Ultimately, we did not add the data to this revised paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Additionally, the manuscript needs significant compositional editing and proofing.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for having submitted our manuscript with insufficient editing and proofreading. We have obtained English proofreading through the “Nature Research Editing Service”, which is one of the most-trustworthy editing groups worldwide. We believe the English in the recent version of the manuscript has been improved.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We ask only that you consider these minor suggestions before final acceptance:</p><p>1) Given that this is a novel mechanism for hyper-excitability, the manuscript would benefit from a discussion of this dendro-axonal conversion including whether this phenomenon may be a result of altered chemo-attraction/repulsion or could be cell autonomous.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised Results section, we have added some comments on this issue (subsection “Cultured <italic>Kif2a</italic>-cKO DGCs showed dendro-axonal conversion from DIV3”, end of first paragraph), starting that the dendro-axonal conversion is likely a result of a cell autonomous process rather than altered chemo-attraction/repulsion because dispersed cultured DGCs showed this phenotype without chemical treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Abstract requires further refinement including where the olfactory bulb is referred to as a site of adult neurogenesis and the authors could better define 3w-Kif2a-cKO at this section of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these helpful suggestions. In the revised Abstract, we have considered your comment and finally decided to delete the reference to the “olfactory bulb”, as it is not the focus of this manuscript. We also deleted “3w” from “<italic>3w-Kif2a-cKO”</italic>, because we not only used <italic>3w-Kif2a-cKO</italic> mice, but also <italic>P3-Kif2a-cKO</italic> mice for cultured hippocampal slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I-K</xref>) and cultured dentate granular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The inducible Cre model and various control strains/treatments could also be more clearly described in the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for submitting our manuscript with insufficient information on the inducible Cre model and various control strains/treatments.
