Because motor proteins in chromatin assembly also function as chromatin remodeling factors, we investigated the relationship between ATP-driven chromatin assembly and chromatin remodeling in the generation of periodic nucleosome arrays. We found that chromatin remodeling-defective Chd1 motor proteins are able to catalyze ATP-dependent chromatin assembly. The resulting nucleosomes are not, however, spaced in periodic arrays. Wild-type Chd1, but not chromatin remodeling-defective Chd1, can catalyze the conversion of randomly-distributed nucleosomes into periodic arrays. These results reveal a functional distinction between ATP-dependent nucleosome assembly and chromatin remodeling, and suggest a model for chromatin assembly in which randomly-distributed nucleosomes are formed by the nucleosome assembly function of Chd1, and then regularly-spaced nucleosome arrays are generated by the chromatin remodeling activity of Chd1. These findings uncover an unforeseen level of specificity in the role of motor proteins in chromatin assembly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00863.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00863.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00863.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In many cells, genomic DNA is wrapped around proteins known as histones to produce particles called nucleosomes. These particles then join together—like beads on a string—to form a highly periodic structure called chromatin. In the nucleus, chromatin is further folded and condensed into chromosomes. However, many important processes, including the replication of DNA and the transcription of genes, require access to the DNA. The cell must therefore be able to disassemble chromatin and remove the histones, and then, once these processes are complete, to reassemble the chromatin. Enzymes known as chromatin assembly factors are responsible for the disassembly and reassembly of chromatin.</p><p>There are two main types of chromatin assembly factors in eukaryotic cells (i.e., cells with nuclei)—histone chaperones and motor proteins. The histone chaperones escort histones from the cytoplasm, where they are made, to the nucleus. The motor proteins—using energy supplied by ATP molecules—then catalyze the formation of nucleosomes. This involves two activities: the motor proteins assemble nucleosomes by helping the DNA to wrap around the histones, and they also remodel chromatin by altering the positions of nucleosomes along the DNA to ensure that they are periodic—that is, regularly spaced.</p><p>A conserved motor protein called Chd1 performs chromatin assembly and remodeling in eukaryotic cells. Chd1 works in conjunction with histone chaperones—both are needed for chromatin assembly, and so are DNA, histones and ATP. However, whether or not chromatin assembly and chromatin remodeling by Chd1 are identical or distinct processes is not well understood.</p><p>Torigoe et al. have now discovered a mutant Chd1 protein that has nucleosome assembly activity (i.e., it can make nucleosomes) but cannot remodel chromatin (i.e., it is unable to move nucleosomes), and thus have demonstrated that these two processes are functionally distinct. Torigoe et al. additionally have found that the mutant Chd1 proteins produce randomly distributed nucleosomes rather than the periodic arrays normally found in chromatin. Further analysis then revealed that the wild-type Chd1 protein, which can remodel chromatin, is able to convert randomly distributed nucleosomes into periodic arrays.</p><p>These findings have led to a new model for chromatin assembly in which Chd1 initially generates randomly distributed nucleosomes (via its assembly function), and then converts them into periodic arrays of nucleosomes (via its remodeling function). Together, these studies shed light on the mechanisms by which chromatin is created and manipulated in cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00863.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00863.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>chromatin assembly</kwd><kwd>chromatin remodeling</kwd><kwd>Chd1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM058272</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kadonaga</surname><given-names>James T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM084192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowman</surname><given-names>Gregory D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Chd1 motor protein performs two functionally distinct ATP-dependent activities, nucleosome assembly and chromatin remodeling, to generate periodic arrays of nucleosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The assembly of nucleosomes is necessary for the regeneration of chromatin following DNA replication, transcription, and DNA repair, and is an active ATP-driven process, as originally discovered by Worcel et al.

These motor proteins exhibit both chromatin assembly and remodeling activities, and are members of the SNF2 (sucrose non-fermenting 2) protein family, which comprises the ATPases that are known to be involved in chromatin remodeling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flaus and Owen-Hughes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hargreaves and Crabtree, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ryan and Owen-Hughes, 2011</xref>). With the Chd1, ACF, and ToRC motor proteins, it has been shown that efficient chromatin assembly requires both a histone chaperone (such as NAP1) and the motor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lusser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emelyanov et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, the Chd1, ACF, and ToRC motor proteins are not able to catalyze chromatin assembly in the absence of a histone chaperone. To determine whether nucleosome assembly requires the ability to reposition nucleosomes, we examined the properties of mutant Chd1 proteins that are defective for chromatin remodeling activity yet retain a substantial amount of their ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Patel et al., 2011</xref>).

To this end, we used the purified, defined ATP-dependent chromatin assembly system that consists of NAP1, core histones, Chd1, ATP, and relaxed DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lusser et al., 2005</xref>). Chromatin assembly requires both the Chd1 motor protein as well as the NAP1 histone chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lusser et al., 2005</xref>). The extent of nucleosome assembly was monitored by the DNA supercoiling assay, in which the change in the linking number of DNA that occurs upon formation of nucleosomes in the presence of topoisomerase I is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Germond et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Simpson et al., 1985</xref>). In these experiments, we observed that the mutant yChd1 proteins are able to assemble nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the presence of adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), a β-γ-non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP, chromatin assembly was not observed. The extent of nucleosome assembly by the mutant proteins was about 65% of that of wild-type yChd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>We further tested whether the mutant yChd1 proteins catalyze the formation of nucleosomes by micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion analysis. First, we extensively digested the reaction products with MNase, deproteinized the samples, and analyzed the resulting DNA fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). With the wild-type as well as the mutant yChd1 proteins, we observed the ATP-dependent formation of DNA fragments corresponding to the length of a core particle. However, in the absence of ATP, particularly with the mutant yChd1 proteins, there were DNA fragments that are longer than those obtained in the presence of ATP. We therefore examined whether or not the species formed in the absence of ATP contained canonical nucleosomes by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of the MNase digestion products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In this assay, we observed ATP-dependent stimulation of the formation of core particles by wild-type as well as mutant yChd1 proteins. Thus, the mutant yChd1 proteins catalyze the ATP-dependent formation of nucleosomes, as assessed by the generation of chromatin that yields core particles upon extensive MNase digestion.</p><p>To determine the relative rates of chromatin assembly by the wild-type and mutant yChd1 proteins, we performed kinetic analyses and found that the initial rates of nucleosome assembly by the Δ932–940 and W932A proteins were approximately 8.5% and 12% of the rate of wild-type yChd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Hence, the chromatin-remodeling defective yChd1 proteins exhibit substantial ATP-driven nucleosome assembly activity (∼10% of the rate of wild-type yChd1) that is at least 100-fold higher than their ATP-driven chromatin remodeling/sliding activity (&lt;0.1% of wild-type yChd1). The properties of wild-type and mutant yChd1 proteins indicate that the ATP-dependent catalysis of nucleosome assembly appears to be a functionally distinct process from the ATP-dependent remodeling of chromatin.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00863.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the initial rates of nucleosome assembly by the wild-type, W932A, and Δ932–940 yChd1 proteins.</title><p>The initial rates were measured as change in % supercoiling ([Δ supercoiled DNA/total DNA] × 100%)/(nM protein) vs time (min).

As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the mutant yChd1 proteins are defective in the ATP-dependent formation of periodic nucleosome arrays. To quantitate the ATP-dependent catalysis of nucleosome spacing, we devised a nucleosome spacing index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) that measures the formation of distinct di- and tri-nucleosome MNase digestion bands. The spacing index increases with the periodicity of the chromatin, and can be used for the comparison of series of samples that are under identical electrophoretic conditions. For example, quantitation of the nucleosome spacing data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> reveals that wild-type yChd1 has strong ATP-dependent spacing activity, whereas the mutant yChd1 proteins exhibit little or no spacing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The essentially complete absence of spacing activity in the mutant yChd1 proteins was further observed in experiments that were carried out with concentrations of yChd1 proteins ranging from 2–120 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). (Examination of the spacing index also reveals that the periodicity of the partial MNase digestion array slightly decreases upon addition of Chd1 proteins in the presence of AMP-PNP. This effect may be due to the blockage of MNase digestion by static nonproductive binding of the Chd1 to DNA.)

It remained formally possible, however, that chromatin remodeling is sufficient for chromatin assembly. To test this notion, we carried out parallel chromatin remodeling and assembly reactions with purified yChd1 (as a positive control/reference) and purified human Brg1 (hBrg1; also known as SMARCA4), which is a SNF2-like family ATPase found in human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flaus and Owen-Hughes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hargreaves and Crabtree, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ryan and Owen-Hughes, 2011</xref>). The purified hBrg1 protein is active for chromatin remodeling (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Phelan et al., 1999</xref>). By using the restriction enzyme accessibility assay for chromatin remodeling (e.g., as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Varga-Weisz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexiadis and Kadonaga, 2002</xref>), we found that remodeling activity of yChd1 was comparable to that of hBrg1 over a range of concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We then performed chromatin assembly reactions with the same concentrations of factors, and found that hBrg1 did not assemble chromatin under conditions in which efficient chromatin assembly was observed with the yChd1 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, the hBrg1 caused a decrease in the supercoiling of DNA, which may be related to the nucleosome disruption activity of the SWI/SNF complex (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwon et al., 1994</xref>). These results thus show that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling does not necessarily result in the formation of nucleosomes from histones, histone chaperone (NAP1), DNA, and ATP.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00863.009</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The Brg1 chromatin remodeling factor does not catalyze chromatin assembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Purified human Brg1 (hBrg1) has a specific activity for chromatin remodeling that is similar to that of wild-type yChd1.

Although we depict the two processes separately, they may occur concurrently with wild-type Chd1. The basis for the formation of periodic nucleosomes as the final product of chromatin assembly is not known, but it is possible that attractive forces between nucleosomes are maximized when the nucleosomes are arranged and/or compacted in a periodic array.

Specifically, the ATP-dependent assembly of nucleosomes by Chd1 occurs in the near complete absence of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. Hence, these findings revealed a level of specificity in the role of ATP-dependent motor proteins in chromatin assembly that had not been previously anticipated. In addition, the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein, human Brg1, does not assemble nucleosomes. We further examined the ability of the chromatin remodeling-defective Chd1 proteins to function in the assembly of periodic nucleosome arrays. The results suggest a process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) in which randomly-distributed canonical nucleosomes are generated by the nucleosome assembly function of Chd1 and are then converted into regularly-spaced nucleosome arrays by the chromatin remodeling/spacing/sliding activity of Chd1. This model for chromatin assembly should provide a useful framework for the analysis of the regeneration of nucleosomes during the many processes in the eukaryotic nucleus that involve the disassembly and reassembly of chromatin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Protein purification</title><p><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> NAP1 and topoisomerase I (ND432 N-terminally truncated form containing the catalytic domain) were purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fyodorov and Kadonaga, 2003</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached a decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We believe the work will advance the field and thus we invite you to resubmit a revised manuscript addressing the following issues:</p><p>Though the Chd1 Δ932-940 and W932A mutants are capable of hydrolyzing ATP, they essentially function as ‘histone chaperones’ of a sort since they are defective for chromatin remodeling.

With regard to this point, I should mention that we did publish the chromatin assembly activity of wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic> Chd1 by itself (no NAP1) in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lusser et al., (2005)</xref> [attached; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2 and 4</xref>]. We found that wild-type Chd1 does not exhibit chromatin assembly activity without NAP1, even in the presence of ATP. We can repeat the same experiments with the mutant Chd1 proteins in the absence vs. presence of NAP1 and ATP, if desired. Given, however, that the wild-type protein lacks any detectable chromatin assembly activity in the absence of NAP1, it does seem unlikely that the mutant proteins will somehow have gained this activity. Nevertheless, if the reviewers wish for us to perform this experiment, we will.</p><p><italic>The usage of ATP could really differentiate the chromatin assembly mechanisms of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and histone chaperones, and the question is therefore important</italic>.</p><p>Since we have previously shown that Chd1 alone (no NAP1) does not assemble chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lusser et al., 2005</xref>), doesn't that already demonstrate a difference between the ATP-dependent motor proteins and histone chaperones? Also, in the present manuscript, we demonstrated the ATP dependence of Chd1 function by the use of ATP vs. AMP-PMP.</p><p>The main point of this paper is that ATP-dependent chromatin assembly is functionally distinct from ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, as in the title. In addition, wild-type Chd1 by itself (no NAP1) does not assemble chromatin in the presence of ATP. Therefore, it is difficult to see how characterization of the ATP-dependence of the wild-type and mutant Chd1 proteins by themselves (no NAP1) would affect the conclusion of this work. Perhaps some clarification would be useful here.</p><p><italic>Additionally, nucleosome assembly is monitored solely by the change in negative supercoiling in 1D gels.

Given the limit of about four samples per gel, we would need to run samples in one series of experiments on multiple different gels. It would be difficult and essentially impossible to obtain reliable data for the comparison of different samples on different gels. Even within a single 2D gel there can be some variations due to the relatively long distances the DNA samples travel in two different dimensions. In other words, it just doesn't seem realistic or feasible to run all of the supercoiling samples on 2D gels. In our experience, we can generate the most consistent and reliable data for the comparison of a series of multiple samples with 1D gels. If our experiments had involved the quantitative analysis of two or three samples, we would have used 2D gels as we have in the past. In other words, while 2D gels can provide information on the relative amounts of differently supercoiled species of a plasmid, we do not recommend their use in the comparative analysis of a series of samples.</p><p>If we did the 2D gels, we might get different numbers, but I would not be confident that they would be more accurate or more informative. In addition, I do not really see how obtaining the data in units of number of nucleosomes/nM Chd1/min will change the conclusions of this paper.</p><p><italic>With the exception of the 1D supercoiling analysis, there is little evidence that the altered Chd1 is actually assembling nucleosomes.
