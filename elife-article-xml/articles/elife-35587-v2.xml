However, most studies of processing in the primary auditory cortex (AI) have viewed neurons as independent filters; little is known about how coordinated AI neuronal activity is expressed throughout cortical columns and how it might enhance the processing of auditory information. To address this, we recorded from populations of neurons in AI cortical columns of anesthetized rats and, using dimensionality reduction techniques, identified multiple coordinated neuronal ensembles (cNEs), which are groups of neurons with reliable synchronous activity. We show that cNEs reflect local network configurations with enhanced information encoding properties that cannot be accounted for by stimulus-driven synchronization alone. Furthermore, similar cNEs were identified in both spontaneous and evoked activity, indicating that columnar cNEs are stable functional constructs that may represent principal units of information processing in AI.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory cortex</kwd><kwd>neuronal ensembles</kwd><kwd>spectrotemporal processing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC02260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Atencio</surname><given-names>Craig A</given-names></name><name><surname>Schreiner</surname><given-names>Christoph E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Coleman Memorial Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Atencio</surname><given-names>Craig A</given-names></name><name><surname>Schreiner</surname><given-names>Christoph E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hearing Research Incorporate, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Atencio</surname><given-names>Craig A</given-names></name><name><surname>Schreiner</surname><given-names>Christoph E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Science Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>See</surname><given-names>Jermyn Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Auditory cortical columns contain small subsets of neurons with highly synchronous activity (cNEs) that create robust sequences of coordinated activity suitable for enhanced information processing and signal transmission beyond the capability of individual neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>How individual neurons work together to encode sensory information and influence behavior remains one of the fundamental questions in systems neuroscience. Single neurons have been traditionally considered to be the basic functional unit of the brain and much of our understanding of how the brain encodes sensory stimuli or motor output comes from decades of single-unit studies. Single-unit activity in isolation, however, is often insufficient to account for observed sensory or motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bizley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Britten et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Engineer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Georgopoulos et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Herzfeld et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Paninski et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Technological advances in large-scale recordings, including calcium imaging and high-density multi-channel electrodes, have allowed the monitoring of the simultaneous activity of large populations of neurons. This has led to the demonstration of coordinated activity within groups of recorded neurons, identified and verified by statistical approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Billeh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gourévitch and Eggermont, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Miller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Peyrache et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pipa et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>These concerted neuronal activities are postulated to be local network events that reflect improved associations with decision-making, predictions of perceptual events, memory formation, and behavioral performance over isolated single-unit activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bathellier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gulati et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ince et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kiani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Laubach et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Peyrache et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Reimann et al., 2017</xref>). Coordinated ensembles have also been postulated to be elementary units of information processing in the brain (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Buzsáki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yuste, 2015</xref>). However, basic statistical properties of these ensembles, such as cellular composition, extent, stability, and functional roles, including selectivity of information extraction and reliability of transmission, are not yet well understood.</p><p>This is especially true in the auditory cortex (AC). Most of what we understand about AC function is based on single-unit and general population analyses. Single-unit studies in the AC have focused on characterizing receptive fields, treating AC neurons as arrays of (nearly) linear filters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aertsen and Johannesma, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Atencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Calabrese et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Thorson et al., 2015</xref>). Population activity in the AC, often based on indiscriminate pooling of single- or multiple-unit activity, has been shown to correlate with an animal’s perception of simple sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bathellier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rodgers and DeWeese, 2014</xref>) and can be used to decode aspects of acoustic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Miller and Recanzone, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brasselet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ince et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">David and Shamma, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2017</xref>). However, these studies did not identify groups of cooperating neurons, treating all simultaneously recorded neurons as equivalent information-processing entities. Meanwhile, synchronous activity between local pairs of AC neurons can reflect shared and unique stimulus aspects, enabling enhanced information encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atencio and Schreiner, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atencio and Schreiner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Brosch and Schreiner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Eggermont, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gourévitch and Eggermont, 2010</xref>). While neuronal pairs represent the smallest possible ensemble, larger columnar or distributed networks of synchronously active neurons could reveal specific and particularly meaningful information-bearing network events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bathellier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bharmauria et al., 2016</xref>). One particular issue is whether coordinated ensemble events can be meaningfully distinguished from coincidental events that result from stimulus synchrony and overlaps in the receptive fields of neurons. Therefore, to better understand network encoding, the membership criteria, structure and function of synchronously firing neuronal groups must be examined to distinguish between coordinated and coincidental neuronal ensembles.</p><p>Here, we identified and characterized coordinated neuronal ensembles (cNEs) from the synchronous activity across populations of neurons within auditory cortical columns. We performed high-density extracellular electrophysiological recordings across several laminae within primary auditory cortical (AI) columns of rats using broadband dynamic noises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atencio and Schreiner, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2010b</xref>). The cortical column is a fundamental organizing substrate within the AC, and relates neurons with similar preferred frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wallace and Palmer, 2008</xref> (gerbil); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atencio and Schreiner, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2010b</xref> (cat); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Guo et al., 2012</xref> (mouse); but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Winkowski and Kanold, 2013</xref>). Recording from the column therefore increased the likelihood of encountering stimulus-driven, temporally aligned spiking activity. We chose the ketamine-anesthetized preparation to enhance the stability of the recordings over time and to reduce the influence of state changes on neural networks; the awake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fritz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Okun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Poulet and Petersen, 2008</xref>) or urethane-anesthetized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Clement et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Marguet and Harris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pagliardini et al., 2013</xref>) rat cortex would undergo state changes more frequently, potentially affecting the composition of cNEs. We applied dimensionality reduction techniques to recorded populations and identified cNEs, which consisted of neurons that exhibited sharply synchronous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2013</xref>). Our results show that cNEs can be accurately and reliably detected, have higher coincident firing than can be explained from receptive field similarity or second-order (pairwise) correlations, and have active events that occur more frequently than expected from population recordings. cNEs identified from spontaneous and evoked epochs were highly similar, implying that cNEs represent functional networks that are not dependent on stimulus presentation. Our results also show that cNEs encode auditory information more reliably than single neurons or random groups of neurons with similar receptive fields and support the notion that cNEs represent unique and functionally significant units of processing in AI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Heterogeneous functional connectivity between columnar AI neurons</title><p>We used high-density recording electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to simultaneously record the activity of populations of neurons across supragranular and granular laminae within AI columns.

STRFs of neurons from the same columnar penetration showed general similarities in characteristic frequency and frequency tuning, and displayed minor variations in spectral and temporal details (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), similar to cat cortical columnar recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atencio and Schreiner, 2010a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35587.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Electrode used, sample recording, STRFs, and PWCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electrode schematic.

We observed similar trends in columnar recordings, although the correlation between these synchrony aspects and pairwise distance only explained ~10–30% of the total variance (R<sup>2</sup> values, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–2G</xref>). Notwithstanding weak spike train correlations, neuronal coordination and synchronization have been widely postulated to play a vital role in information processing and the organization of the nervous system within the cortical column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atencio and Schreiner, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Panzeri et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore sought to identify larger columnar groups of neurons that reliably share synchronous firing events, resulting in higher correlated rates of firing than could be accounted for by inter-neuronal distances and shared receptive field properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of coordinated neuronal ensembles (cNEs)</title><p>To identify synchronously firing groups of neurons, or coordinated neuronal ensembles (cNEs), we combined two dimensionality reduction techniques - principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA), following the approach by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2013</xref>. This analysis identifies groups of neurons that repeatedly fire synchronous action potentials throughout the duration of the recording. This approach provides a parametric analysis that identifies both the number of cNEs and the neurons that are members of each cNE. Further, simulations show that this approach is applicable to both large- and small-scale recordings, and that it can be applied to spike trains with Poisson characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Peyrache et al., 2010</xref>). Application of PCA to the simultaneously recorded spike trains determines the number of cNEs above a significance criterion (see Materials and methods). ICA is then applied to the significant eigenvectors or principal components (PCs) to extract the linear combination of the individual neurons’ activity associated with each cNE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2013</xref>). To illustrate this approach, we simulated the spike trains of 8 neurons, where two groups of five neurons had highly synchronous firing, with two neurons being shared between these two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Each spike train was first binned and z-scored to ensure that cNE identification was not skewed towards neurons with higher firing rates. The correlation coefficients between the spike trains were calculated and represented as a correlation matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). PCA was applied to the correlation matrix, resulting in a distribution of eigenvalues and corresponding PCs. Each eigenvalue represents the relative importance of each PC. To determine which PCs represented groups of neurons that significantly fired together, we compared the distribution of eigenvalues from the data to the distribution that would be expected for groups of independently firing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Marčenko and Pastur, 1967</xref>). In the simulated example, there were two significant eigenvalues reflecting the fact that there were two cNEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, because neurons 4 and 5 were shared between both cNE #1 and #2, the PCs did not accurately represent the true membership of the two cNEs due to PCA’s variance maximization framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To resolve this ambiguity, we applied ICA to the two most significant PCs, which resulted in two independent components (ICs) that accurately identified the two cNEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Both the PCs and ICs can be used to recreate the activity of the cNEs over time by projecting them back onto the spike matrix. However, since PCA did not separate the cNEs properly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), only the ICA-derived activity correctly reflected the spiking activity of each cNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35587.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Simulated data illustrating the coordinated neuronal ensemble (cNE) detection algorithm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Raster of the simulated data. cNE #1 consists of neurons 1 to 5 while cNE #2 consists of neurons 5 to 8.

In the case of the example recording, 9 cNEs were extracted. Since cNEs were extracted via ICA, the activities of the different cNEs are necessarily independent of one another across the whole recording period. Yet, as can be seen in the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, cNEs can fire together with other cNEs (e.g., cNE #2 (red trace) and cNE #3 (green trace) at the 1.1 s and 1.75 s time marks). The cNEs identified in 15 additional columnar recordings are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We next tested if the identified cNEs were stable and reliable estimates of coordinated group activity that persisted throughout the entire recording. First, we wanted to determine if the cNEs identified from one half of a recording were similar to those identified independently from the other half. We split the recordings into 10 equal parts and applied the cNE algorithm to both sets of interleaved parts of the recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The halves were interleaved to compensate for potential recording instabilities. The correlation coefficients for each of the two sets of independent components were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To calculate the significance of all correlations within each penetration, spike trains were circularly shuffled, and processed with the cNE detection algorithm (similar to the method to determine the threshold criterion for neuronal membership in cNEs). The resulting ICs were correlated to give a null distribution, and the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile for each null distribution was set as the significance threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Approximately 96% of independent components had significant matches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>), indicating that the two interleaved parts of the recording contained the same independent components and that the cNEs were present throughout the entire recording.</p><p>Secondly, we wanted to test if cNEs detected in a subset of the recorded activity would be able to accurately estimate the cNE activity of the rest of the recording. In this case, we split the recording into two datasets for training (first half) and for testing (second half). Applying the PCA/ICA approach to each dataset, we obtained two corresponding sets of independent components, and projected both sets onto the test data to extract training and test cNE activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We then correlated the training and test cNE activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>) and took the maximum correlation value for each training cNE as ‘matched correlations’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>). The remaining correlation values for all penetrations were treated as ‘non-matched correlations’ and formed the null distribution, and the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of that null distribution was the significance threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Across all penetrations, approximately 83% of training cNE activity had significant matches to test cNE activity. Thus, cNEs obtained from the first half of the recordings were sufficient to predict the activity of cNEs in the latter half of the recording. Together, these tests show that derived cNEs are stable and reliable descriptors of coordinated neuronal activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>cNE identity is dependent on time bin size</title><p>In previous studies, the time interval for defining synchronous firing varied widely, from a few milliseconds to several hundred milliseconds (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref> for a selection of example studies). Reasons for the different choices of time ranges were related to the temporal resolution permitted by the applied methods and the physical distance between considered neuronal elements. We chose a temporal resolution consistent with the time needed for auditory information to traverse the interlaminar microcircuit in AI columns. Using the propagation speed found in the cat and rat, the time required to traverse a rat AI column of approximately 1500 µm in extent is ~10 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atencio and Schreiner, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kubota et al., 1997</xref>). The upper limit was defined by the need to avoid stimulus-based temporal properties; the dynamic moving ripple stimulus contained temporal envelope fluctuations up to 40 Hz, resulting in a minimum temporal resolution of 25 ms. We therefore selected 10 ms as a reasonable window of within-column synchrony. Inclusion of synchrony with extracolumnar sources and targets may require analysis with a different window size.</p><p>To determine the functional significance of the chosen time window, we binned spikes into varying time bin sizes, obtained cNE activity for each bin size, and then estimated the receptive field information of cNEs detected based on the bin sizes (see Materials and methods).

Spikes of each cNE member neuron were compared against the events of the cNE that each neuron belonged to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>). cNE events were extracted by setting a threshold for the activity profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, see Materials and methods). For each trial-based comparison between a cNE and one of its member neurons, the entity with the higher spike or event count was sub-sampled to maintain equal number of spikes or events and ensure unbiased MI comparisons. The cNE event rasters showed less trial-to-trial variability than individual neuron rasters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>), and the MI conveyed by cNE events was, accordingly, ~10% higher than the MI of each member neuron (p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).

First, we repeated a 10-min ripple noise stimulus 15 times and examined units that responded to each stimulus repetition with firing rates that varied by less than 30% across adjacent stimulus presentations. We isolated 24 units that satisfied these criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the simultaneously recorded (‘real’) spike trains, we randomly selected 15 of the 24 neurons from one repetition at a time and calculated cNEs (for a total of 100 unique combinations). For the non-simultaneous (‘surrogate’) spike train matrix, we selected the same 100 unique combinations of 15 neurons, but the spike train of each neuron was extracted from a different stimulus repetition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). If the cNEs had resulted purely from stimulus-driven synchronization, the simultaneous/‘real’ spike train matrices should have cNE statistics that were similar to that of the non-simultaneous/‘surrogate’ spike train matrices. We found, however, that the ‘surrogate’ spike train matrices had fewer cNEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>) and that the detected cNEs had fewer member neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>).

In a first model (‘shuffled’), we circularly shuffled each of the simultaneously recorded spike trains, breaking the temporal relationships between neurons as well as the match between stimulus and receptive field at each spike’s occurrence while preserving inter-spike intervals (ISIs) for each neuron (see Materials and methods).</p><p>In a second model (‘preserved receptive field’ or ‘PR’), we again shuffled the spike times of neurons, but in a way that preserved the match between stimulus and receptive fields at the new spike times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To achieve that, we calculated the similarity between stimulus segments and neuronal STRFs (projection value) and shuffled spikes between time bins with similar projection values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2A</xref>, see Materials and methods). This procedure created surrogate spike trains that had shuffled spike times but similar receptive fields to the original spike trains.</p><p>In the third model, we used a parametric analysis to investigate if second-order correlations were sufficient to describe the degree of synchrony we see in cNE members. We used a ‘dichotomized Gaussian’ (‘DG’) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Macke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2009</xref>, see Materials and methods), which creates spike trains that match both the firing rate of each neuron and the PWC between each pair of neurons. Thus, this model accounts for the overall activity of neurons up to second-order correlations but does not contain information about higher-order correlations.</p><p>To validate that the models behaved as expected, we calculated the STRFs for each neuron in each dataset via spike-triggered averaging. The ‘PR’ model preserved STRFs relative to STRFs derived from the real spike trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3A</xref>), indicating that the long-term receptive field information was accurately preserved. As expected, the ‘shuffled’ and ‘DG’ models did not provide well-defined STRFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3A</xref>). When STRF similarity between the three different models and the real spike train was calculated, the ‘PR’ model had a high median correlation value (~0.74) while the ‘shuffled’ and ‘DG’ models had values close to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We also calculated PWCs for pairs of neurons in the real spike train and the models and found that the ‘shuffled’ and ‘PR’ models captured very little of the correlation between pairs of neurons in the real spike train, while the ‘DG’ model only captured the correlation between pairs of neurons in the real spike train at zero delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This is expected because the ‘shuffled’ model breaks up all inter-neuronal correlations; the ‘PR’ model only preserves receptive fields, and PWCs between the temporal profiles of STRFs are broad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>); and the ‘DG’ model is based on correlations between pairs of neurons. Since the correlation value is a single value estimated across the entire spike train, it does not take into account intra-spike train synchrony and does not model delay-dependent temporal correlations. However, since PWCs between pairs of neurons in the same cNE are sharp, with mean sharpness values of 3.39 ± 1.21 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–6J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), and mean absolute peak delays of 0.76 ± 1.74 ms, modeling spike trains using the ‘DG’ model at 5-ms temporal resolution effectively encompasses the temporal correlations between neurons from the same cNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>Surrogate spike trains from the ‘shuffled’ and ‘PR’ models had significantly fewer cNEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>) than the real data. On the other hand, the ‘DG’ model overestimates the number of detected cNEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). Despite that, all three models, including the ‘DG’ model, resulted in cNEs that were smaller in size (i.e., fewer member neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>) than the real data (n = 16 penetrations; mean values for each penetration were calculated over 200 iterations for each model). These results imply that the observed synchrony represents unique network events that cannot be explained simply by second-order correlations or by synchrony reflective of the underlying similarity in the receptive fields of neurons.</p><p>Finally, to estimate the degree of coincident firing between cNE member neurons, we calculated coincidence ratios (CRs) between groups of neurons. The CR was defined as the ratio of the number of time bins in which all neurons in the pre-defined group spike together, to the number of time bins in which the neuron with the lowest firing rate is active. When the whole group is active each time the neuron with the lowest firing rate spikes, the CR value will be one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s4">Figure 11—figure supplement 4A</xref>). This measure allows us to compare the probability that several neurons in a cNE will fire together and can be thought of as a generalization of the dot product between two spike trains to multiple spike trains. Using this measure, we directly compared our responses across different presentations of the same stimulus and the simulated spike trains (1000 iterations each) to the real data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E and F</xref>), by estimating CRs for 400 unique groups of 2, 3, 4, and 5 neurons within the same cNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s4">Figure 11—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Since neuronal identity was preserved in all simulations and the repeated stimulus data, we normalized each group of neurons by the CR of the real data, to determine how well the synchrony from simulated data approximated the synchrony from the real data. The normalized CR for the repeated stimulus data (‘repeat’), ‘shuffled’, ‘PR’ and ‘DG’ models were significantly less than one for all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E and F</xref>). For groups containing more than three members, the CR values for most control models were always near or at 0 (not shown). These results suggest that member neurons of cNEs have more coincident activity than expected, further supporting the hypothesis that coordinated cNE events are driven by higher-than-second-order correlations and cannot be explained simply via stimulus-induced synchronization or shared receptive field properties, including those not reflected in STRFs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A key goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that auditory processing of an ongoing stimulus is better interpreted as sequences of coordinated activity among small subsets of neurons in the cortical column, rather than independent spikes distributed across the same subsets of neurons. We were able to identify, for each columnar recording in rat AI, several groups of neurons with coordinated activity (cNEs) in response to broadband stimuli with dynamic spectro-temporal envelopes. Each identified cNE comprised a subset of ~15–20% of the simultaneously recorded neurons. The spatial distribution of neurons within most cNEs was contained within &lt;250 μm of columnar depth, approximately corresponding to the width of granular and supragranular layers. However, several cNEs encompassed neurons distributed across multiple layers.</p><p>We isolated and identified groups of neurons in AI columns that showed coordinated spiking activity by using dimensionality-reduction techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2013</xref>). The group spiking events associated with each cNE were more reliable and conveyed more information about the stimulus than spikes of individual neurons or random groups of neurons (matched to cNE size). We verified that identified cNEs were not chance constructs as a result of stimulus-driven synchronization alone by showing that the frequency of occurrence of cNE events was higher than predicted from basic receptive field similarities within the column. Since a high percentage of cNEs had matching neuronal composition during evoked and spontaneous activations, these findings support the concept that cNEs are stable local units of information processing in the cortical column.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Challenges in detecting cNEs in AI</title><p>Detecting or identifying cNEs in sensory cortex is difficult due to the multidimensional nature of population recordings. The first difficulty is implementing a method that may estimate the number and members of ensembles from high-dimensional data. Another difficulty is that any method will rely on responses occurring over chosen time windows and may be confounded with the temporal information processing performed by the region of interest. Non-auditory responses are more easily examined for ensemble activity because stimuli that drive the neurons in these regions are not functions of time. While the visual scene may vary over time, it is not dominated by rapid temporal information. Since visual images are predominantly static, visual cortical studies have used two-photon calcium imaging, which measures a response signal over an integration window of 125–250 ms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Miller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2015</xref>). Such imaging approaches and time windows cannot be utilized in the auditory cortex, since auditory cortical neurons are responsive to envelope modulations occurring over tens of milliseconds. Only static stimuli, such as pure tones or spectral ripple stimuli, could be utilized for auditory imaging studies. Thus, it is uniquely challenging to identify ensembles in auditory cortical regions due to the confound between analysis windows and temporal stimulus preferences.</p><p>Once estimated, interpreting auditory cortical ensembles poses additional challenges. Visual cortical receptive fields are often estimated over long time delays, while auditory cortical receptive fields based on dynamic stimuli necessarily contain more precise timing information. Thus, ensemble synchrony might be due to either stimulus-driven receptive field similarity, or it may be due to specific network configurations that favor joint activity, such as high anatomical or functional connectivity. To determine if ensembles represent more than the consequences of receptive field similarity, we utilized a variety of controls and showed that while ensemble activity can be related to stimulus preferences, it cannot be wholly explained through similarities in basic receptive field processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">11</xref>). Furthermore, the observation that spontaneous activity engages local networks that are very similar to those engaged by externally driven activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) supports the idea of the utilization of basic network building blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hebb, 1949</xref>) in the transition from representation to interpretation to behavior. cNEs appear to be stable, functionally connected subsets of neurons that are embedded in broader columnar and horizontal networks whose activity reliably signifies specific auditory information.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Detection and identification of cNEs</title><p>Even though technologies for recording large populations of neurons have been growing exponentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Blanche et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Du et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rios et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Stevenson and Kording, 2011</xref>), the ability to make meaningful observations about network activity or ensembles of neurons has been hampered by the lack of analytic tools to detect and identify such constructs.

This approach extracts the number of significant cNEs, assigns weights according to each neuron’s contribution to each cNE, and gives an intuitive measure of cNE activity. The identification of significant cNEs was also calculated using established results from random matrix theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Marčenko and Pastur, 1967</xref>), and therefore reduces the reliance on surrogate randomization methods. The method is mostly linear; ICA uses nonlinear equations to quantify negentropy (a measure of distance between a distribution and the Gaussian distribution), but this is highly optimized by the fast ICA algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hyvärinen and Oja, 1997</xref>), making it significantly faster than most nonlinear algorithms. Since we were focusing on the cortical column, we limited our examination to synchronous spiking within 10-ms time windows. The short time window that we used de-emphasizes the need to assess neuronal ensembles as a function of the lag between time bins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Russo and Durstewitz, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, since our neuronal firing rates are approximately stationary, we did not correct for nonstationarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Russo and Durstewitz, 2017</xref>). </p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>cNEs are distinct from cell assemblies or simple populations of neurons</title><p>Because we defined cNEs via synchronous firing within temporal bins, we termed these constructs ‘coordinated neuronal ensembles’ instead of the more commonly used term ‘cell assemblies’. Cell assemblies, as first defined in Donald Hebb’s seminal work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hebb, 1949</xref>), were hypothesized to be fixed units of neurons that are highly and strongly interconnected, and that the activation of a few of its members would be sufficient to reliably cause the activation of the whole assembly. Hebb’s cell assemblies also relate to large scale behavioral phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hebb, 1949</xref>) and have been proposed to require a read-out mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Buzsáki, 2010</xref>). Since our groups of neurons have not been linked to global aspects of behavior, and do not include the activity of potential target neurons outside the column, we chose to use the term ‘coordinated neuronal ensembles’ to distinguish it from the more functionally related term ‘cell assemblies’.</p><p>Another distinction is that the identity of neurons contributing to each cNE is important and their roles should be distinguished from neurons accumulated for the purpose of deriving simple population codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bizley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chakraborty et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Furukawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rodgers and DeWeese, 2014</xref>).

This implies that cNEs are stable functional entities that reflect stimulus selectivity but do not require external stimuli to be activated. This also supports previous findings in sensory cortices that patterns of spontaneous activity can be similar to those of evoked activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Jermakowicz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Luczak et al., 2009</xref>), albeit at much finer timescales. These underlying functional network units have also been hypothesized to reflect constraints that cortical organization has imposed on the local propagation of neuronal activity (for in-depth reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Luczak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Luczak and Maclean, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The identity and stability of cNEs across spontaneous and evoked activity has only been established over relatively short periods of time (usually less than an hour under anesthesia).

This suggests that cNEs might similarly be mutable by dominant aspects of the auditory environment. By extension, we speculate that cNE composition and functional identity can be influenced by learning or any plasticity-inducing experiences. These potential effects need to be addressed in future work.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>cNEs cannot be accounted for by stimulus-driven synchronizations</title><p>A fundamental question regarding the identified cNEs is whether they were constructs that arose from the trivial fact that their member neurons all had similar receptive fields and, therefore, were simultaneously driven by the same stimulus. AI neurons in a column have been previously shown to have fairly closely related STRFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atencio and Schreiner, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wallace and Palmer, 2008</xref>), making stimulus-driven synchronization a likely contributor to the observed synchrony of cNEs.</p><p>We demonstrated, however, that cNE membership was not solely accounted for by receptive field overlap using several independent methods. Spike train PWCs between pairs of neurons in the same cNE are significantly narrower than that of STRF PWCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Assuming that pairs of neurons are simply synchronized by the stimulus, it follows that the spike PWCs would have similar widths to that of their receptive field PWCs. This is often true for pairs of neurons not within the same cNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–6F</xref>), putative examples of neurons that are only synchronized due to their receptive field overlap.</p><p>Moreover, we showed that cNEs detected during evoked activity were often also detected during spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Consequently, the evoked cNEs that had significant matches to spontaneous cNEs did not require input synchronization by a stimulus.</p><p>Another argument against stimulus-driven synchrony as the main reason for the observed synchrony is the lower degree of synchrony between independently firing neurons than that of the coordinated firing of cNE neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). The reduced synchrony, expressed in terms of lower cNE numbers and smaller cNE sizes for non-simultaneous spike matrices (‘surrogate’ spike matrices; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and B</xref>), indicates that basic receptive field similarity and overlap are insufficient to account for the observed coordinated firing patterns.</p><p>Finally, we modelled stimulus-driven synchrony with the ‘preserved receptive field’ (‘PR’) model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The idea behind this model was to shuffle the spike times of each neuron only among time bins associated with the same degree of similarity between the stimulus and receptive field (projection values). Given the probabilistic nature of neuronal spiking even for the highest projection values, the ‘PR’ model had, unsurprisingly, a lower number of cNEs per spike matrix and fewer neurons per cNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C and D</xref>). The CR for the ‘PR’ model was also significantly less than that of the real data for all sizes of sets of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E and F</xref>). These observations further support the notion that multi-neuronal coordinated activity requires conditions beyond receptive field overlap. The linear STRFs used here are, of course, not a complete representation of the stimulus preference of a neuron. Additional stimulus features may activate neurons, often in nonlinear fashion, as has been demonstrated using multi-filter approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atencio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Harper et al., 2016</xref>). Even though the main (linear) filters appear to carry the most information, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that shared but ‘hidden’ receptive field properties, not reflected in either basic or advanced multi-filter STRFs, contribute to the formation and activation of cNEs. However, these contributions cannot be very substantial, as indicated by our model-free analysis of cNE synchrony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further determinants of cNE events are likely governed by more globally defined network states, including top-down influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Okun et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>cNEs reflect higher-order correlations</title><p>To test if second-order correlations were sufficient to account for the synchrony observed between cNE neurons, we used the ‘DG’ model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C–11F</xref>). The ‘DG’ model is fully specified by neuronal firing rates and the covariance of actual spike trains. It produces a set of spike trains that reproduces these statistics, but does not contain information about higher-order correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Macke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2009</xref>, see Materials and methods). The ‘DG’ model was able to capture correlations between all possible pairs of neurons but was unable to directly replicate the correlations between three or more neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The lack of higher-order correlations resulted in smaller cNE sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>) and lower CRs for three or more neurons that were members of the same cNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F</xref>). The lower CR for pairs of neurons from the same cNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>) shows that the ‘DG’ model incompletely captures the columnar synchrony of AI neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>That second-order (pairwise) correlations were unable to recapitulate the synchrony seen between cNE neurons should not be surprising. The premise of the cNE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lopes-dos-Santos et al., 2013</xref>) is to detect groups of neurons with reliable synchronous activity and identify these synchronous events, which are likely driven by higher-order correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Montani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ohiorhenuan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). These higher-order correlations could be a result of common synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>), often shared by neighboring cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>), or a result of global fluctuations driven by top-down inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Goris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schölvinck et al., 2015</xref>). cNEs, and the statistics that we have used to describe them, are hence a useful tool to study higher-order correlations and the biological phenomena that drive them.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>cNEs are functional units that reliably represent and transmit information</title><p>Our data suggest that cNEs may be conveyors of specific environmental information that is either externally triggered or internally engaged. Acoustically driven cNEs conveyed more information in their response events than individual neurons or randomly selected groups of neurons. Since information necessarily includes timing information, this implies that cNEs are tightly locked to stimulus features that trigger ensemble responses. Additionally, since information increases as response precision increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), our results show that cNEs are more temporally reliable.</p><p>One way to examine a subset of stimulus features that trigger ensemble responses was to compare cNE STRFs against neuronal STRFs. To that end, we showed that cNE STRFs had enhanced excitatory and inhibitory subfields when compared to those of member neurons or randomly selected groups of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). This phenomenon could be explained by a reduction in the number of events during periods where the stimulus and the STRFs are relatively uncorrelated, or by an increase in the number of events that respond to stimulus segments with high projection values. We propose that both ideas are likely and contribute to the observed phenomena. cNE events only require a subset of member neurons to fire together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Furthermore, from one cNE event to another, the neurons that contribute to any event can vary among the cNE members. Given the probabilistic nature of neuronal spiking even for the highest projection values, it suggests that cNEs integrate complementary spiking information from member neurons during stimulus presentations to increase the number of events that respond to stimulus segments with high projection values and to better encode the stimulus. On the other hand, spikes that occur during stimulus segments with low projection values do not tend to be synchronous with spikes from other neurons and are less likely to be associated with cNE events (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9A and B</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, cNEs appear to more reliably encode features of auditory stimuli. If one purpose of synchronous firing by groups of neurons is to produce a more efficacious downstream effect than can be accomplished by a single neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Buzsáki, 2010</xref>), then cNEs may be the functional units that serve to maintain and/or enhance the fidelity of the encoding of relevant sound features. They are likely part of larger networks that can span more than a column and extend over several hierarchical levels. The relative constancy of cNEs can provide stable spatio-temporal firing patterns with transient multi-neuronal synchrony that may, among other functions, signal salient spectro-temporal events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hopfield and Brody, 2001</xref>) or contribute to the learning and extraction of stimulus categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Higgins et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In recent years, studies have identified neuronal ensembles or cell assemblies based on sophisticated statistical analyses and have ascribed functions to them based on observations of the behaviors of the identified constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bathellier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ikegaya et al., 2004</xref>). We extend these results to columnar AI responses by identifying cNEs and rigorously examining alternative hypotheses for their generation. Synchrony driven by the overlap of STRFs appears to be insufficient to account for the synchrony observed between neurons in the same cNE.

Both probability distributions were then normalized to the mean, µ, and standard deviation, σ, by x = (z - µ) / σ, to obtain P(x) and P(x|event).

To generate random groups of neurons for cNE/random-group comparisons, we selected one neuron from the cNE it was being compared to and randomly sampled from the rest of the neurons within a penetration, while excluding other member neurons of the cNE. Random groups of neurons that had more than one neuron from one of the other cNEs in the same recording were excluded as well. If 500 unique random groups of neurons could not be obtained (depending on the number of recorded neurons and the number of cNEs), this procedure was repeated to include two neurons from the cNE it was being compared to and the threshold for neurons from other cNEs in the same recording was similarly increased to two. This procedure was repeated until we obtained 500 unique random groups of neurons for each random group-cNE comparison that had as few neurons from within the same cNE as possible.</p><p>To generate rasters or spike trains, we summed the spikes of all member neurons of cNEs and neurons of random groups. For each cNE comparison to 500 iterations of random groups, we sub-sampled the number of spikes in the cNE and each of the 500 random groups to the number of spikes of the cNE or random group with the fewest spikes. Any set of cNE and random groups with fewer than 200 spikes after sub-sampling were excluded from the MI analysis to limit spurious comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Constructing repeat (‘surrogate’) spike matrices and ‘real’ spike matrices</title><p>To verify that the synchrony observed between neurons in the same cNE cannot be explained via overlapping receptive fields or stimulus synchronization, we compared synchrony between neuronal spike trains from the same presentation of the stimulus (‘real’) against neuronal spike trains across different presentations of the same stimulus (‘surrogate’). A brief overview of the process of constructing ‘real’ and ‘surrogate’ spike matrices is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>. From the 24 units that had reliable firing rates across all 15 repetitions of the 10-min RN stimulus, we randomly selected 100 unique 15-neuron combinations. For each combination, we constructed 15 ‘real’ and ‘surrogate’ spike matrices. Each ‘real’ spike matrix was constructed by taking the spike trains of the neurons in each combination from one presentation of the RN stimulus. Since there were 15 presentations of the stimulus, there were 15 ‘real’ spike matrices for each unique 15-neuron combination. Each ‘surrogate’ spike matrix was constructed by first randomly sorting each 15-neuron combination. The spike train for the first neuron in the combination was then taken from the first presentation of the stimulus, the second neuron from the second presentation, etc., to get one ‘surrogate’ spike matrix. This was repeated 14 additional times, each time by circularly shifting the randomly sorted 15-neuron combination vector by 1, to get 15 different ‘surrogate’ spike matrices for each 15-neuron combination. We then calculated the number of cNEs detected and mean cNE size for each of the ‘real’ and ‘surrogate’ spike matrices. Finally, by averaging across the 15 spike matrices for each measure (number of cNEs or mean cNE size), label (‘real’ or’ surrogate’) and unique combination, we obtained 100 data points for each measure and label. The results are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Simulated spike trains</title><p>We used three simulated spike trains in this study to validate our observations, the ‘shuffled’, the ‘preserved receptive field’ (‘PR’), and the ‘dichotomized Gaussian’ (‘DG’) models. The ‘shuffled’ model was computed by circularly shifting the rows of the spike matrix (where each row represents the binned spike train of one neuron) by a random number of bins, independently of other rows.</p><p>The ‘PR’ model was simulated based on each neuron’s STRF. First, each stimulus segment was correlated with the STRF to obtain P(z), the distribution of projection values without regard to a spike. Next, the full range of P(z) was divided into 15 equal-sized projection value bins. Projection values in each bin represent stimulus segments that were similarly correlated with the STRF. Projection value bins contained multiple projection values, with each of them corresponding to a different time within the stimulus. To obtain the distribution of projection values that corresponded to a spike for each projection value bin, the number of projection values corresponding to spikes was divided by the total number of projections values for that bin regardless of whether a spike occurred. This normalized distribution was P(spk|z). To shuffle spike times with respect to P(spk|z), spikes corresponding to a specific projection value were randomly assigned to different time bins that corresponded to projection values in the same projection value bin. This shuffling procedure preserves the distribution of projection values while creating a random spike train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The ‘DG’ model simulates spike trains that preserve the experimentally derived mean firing rate for each neuron as well as the PWC between each pair of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Macke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2009</xref>). Implementation of the ‘DG’ model with MATLAB can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Macke et al. (2009)</xref> and is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mackelab/CorBinian">https://github.com/mackelab/CorBinian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Macke, 2017</xref>)</ext-link>. The ‘DG’ model requires and produces binary spike trains and works best if the temporal resolution is high enough so that a maximum of one spike occurs in each time bin. However, since we also wanted to capture the temporal correlations between neurons, we simulated ‘DG’ spike matrices at 5-ms time resolution. We then binned the spike trains at a temporal resolution of 10 ms and completed the same analyses that were used to process the experimental data.</p><p>We iterated each of the 16 recordings 200 times per model and calculated the mean of cNE number and size for each model and recording. These statistics were compared with those of the real spike trains in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C and D</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Calculation of coincidence ratios (CRs)</title><p>The CR was defined as the ratio of the number of time bins in which all neurons in the pre-defined group spike together, to the number of time bins in which the neuron with the lowest firing rate is active. An illustration of this calculation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s4">Figure 11—figure supplement 4A</xref>. 400 unique combinations of 2, 3, 4 or 5 neurons within the same cNE were randomly selected. For each combination of neurons, we obtained one ‘real’ and one ‘repeat’ CR values. ‘Real’ CRs were calculated by computing the CR between neuronal spike trains from one presentation of the stimulus. ‘Repeat’ CRs were calculated by computing the CR between neuronal spike trains from different presentations of the stimulus. Each combination of neurons also had 1000 ‘shuffle’, ‘PR’ and ‘DG’ CR values. These were computed by iterating the shuffle and PR models 1000 times and calculating the CR for each iteration of each model. The median CR value for each model was calculated and compared to the single ‘real’ and ‘repeat’ CR values. An example of this comparison for a 2-neuron combination is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s4">Figure 11—figure supplement 4B</xref>. CR values for 2- and 3-neuron combinations are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E and F</xref>. Each set of CR values is normalized to the ‘real’ CR value to determine how much of the real coincidence can be approximated by each data manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E and F</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Michael Brainard and Massimo Scanziani for invaluable scientific discussions; Brian Malone, Tatyana Sharpee and Brett Mensh for feedback on the manuscript; Vitor Lopes-dos-Santos for providing his dimensionality-reduction MATLAB code; and Jakob Macke and Marcel Nonnenmacher for providing their dichotomized Gaussian MATLAB code and guidance on its application.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Coordinated Neuronal Ensembles in Primary Auditory Cortical Columns&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Shihab Shamma (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All reviewers agree that the paper focuses on an important question, which is how ensembles of synchronized neurons in cortex function and represent stimulus information. Nevertheless, and as set out in the appended reviews, they felt that key elements of this claim were insufficiently supported. For example, with respect to the methods, the reviewers felt it was not clear what assumptions were made, and how the results were affected by grouping criteria. There were also concerns about the criteria for establishing whether or not receptive fields overlapped. This is important for ruling out the possibility that neurons responded to a similar feature of stimulus nonlinearly. The reviewers also felt that the functional consequences of these data remain unclear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a well-written paper that provides solid analysis of an exceptional set of data from primary auditory cortex. On the positive side, the paper advances the concept of cNE in auditory cortex and offers a suite of algorithms and tests to define and identify them. Much of the paper is a solid analysis that deals convincingly with the many possible confounds. For the most part, what is discussed and demonstrated is well-presented, and thus I have little to complain about. All in all, I found the paper enjoyable and informative. What I find less satisfying is what is <italic>not</italic> in the manuscript, as I will explain:</p><p>I found the following sentence very interesting, but is unfortunately undeveloped, and is not addressed in the paper at all:</p><p>&quot;If one goal of synchronous firing by groups of neurons is to produce a more efficacious downstream effect than can be accomplished by a single neuron (Buzsáki, 2010), then cNEs may be the functional units that serve to maintain and/or enhance the fidelity of the encoding of relevant sound features&quot;.</p><p>So what are examples of these features? In other words, the functional significance of these cNE is not addressed at all in this paper except by the general statements in the end. The experiments exploited a broadband complex stimulus, and even showing the STA's measured from the firings of the cNE's would have provided (I believe) really interesting insights into what stimulus features these cNEs are trying to enhance. Such measurements would justify and use the analyses shown, and elevate the paper from a &quot;Methods&quot; paper to something much more, which it deserves to be with a little more analysis of the cNE data. Obviously, many future experiments might engage animals in behaviors or go after the features in speech and music and so on, or to find out if these cNE's remain stable or not, and whether they are somehow related to &quot;Brain States&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper &quot;Coordinated Neuronal Ensembles in Primary Auditory Cortical Columns&quot; uses multi electrode recordings to study the synchronized activity of groups of neurons and investigate enhanced information processing by their coordinated activity. The question at the center of this paper is very important, however the paper doesn't really deliver what is promised. The shortcomings of the study are discussed in detail below.</p><p>To begin with, how exactly the ensemble of synchronized neurons are identified is unclear. It is mentioned that they apply independent component analysis to the most significant PCA coefficients, but no more detail is provided. While the method is demonstrated using a simulated example, it is unclear what assumptions are being made, what are the limitations of this method, and how the results discussed are affected by this grouping criteria. In short, identifications of neural ensemble in this paper is treated as a trivial, solved problem, which is not the case because the choice of the method can hinder the interpretation of the results.</p><p>As an example, the authors show that PWC between CNE members vary from non-members. However, given that the CNEs were chosen based on correlation patterns (PCA/ICA of autocorrelation matrix), this observation is of course expected from the selection criteria.</p><p>Another major claim of the study is enhanced information transfer. However, the measure of information used in this study does not really reflect whether CNE carries more information about the stim, the state, or about any other factor as claimed. The measure used is basically an entropy of PSTH, measuring how far from uniform the average spike train is. In other word, it is calculated by averaging the neural responses over 50 repetitions of the same stimulus, and then the entropy of this average is computed. So, this measure only reflects how &quot;bumpy&quot; the average response is. Again, the finding of higher entropy for CNE neurons is expected from the selection criteria of these neurons. If the averaging is done over uncorrelated neurons, the average will be more flat. If they are from a CNE, they by selection have higher correlation and as a result their average will be less uniform (average is indeed what the first PC of the data approximates). Therefore, this finding is not really compelling and informative. I suggest methods such as decoding or &quot;Mutual&quot; information instead of plain entropy. In particular, answering &quot;what&quot; information is more reliably represented and &quot;how&quot; is crucial for the claims of the study.</p><p>Moreover, the method used identifies neurons that are co-activated. But obviously if they are fully correlated, then there will be no added information by the ensemble. This issue is ignored, and the authors have only focused on similarity of CNE responses, and not the complementary components encoded by ensemble members.</p><p>Finally, the evidence for the claim that the CNEs are not based on overlapping receptive fields is rather weak. The evidence shown is based on STRF, which is a lousy model of neuron's actual receptive field. Therefore, they cannot rule out the possibility that neurons responded to a similar feature of stimulus nonlinearly.</p><p>From Discussion &quot;Instead, cNE activity represents important stimulus information embedded in broader network-related contexts&quot;. This is indeed a very interesting claim, but I do not believe the author have shown compelling evidence for it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a thorough study identifying cell assemblies in auditory cortex. Spiking events from these cell assemblies carried more information than spikes from single neurons or randomly selected groups of neurons with the same spike/event rate. The authors use a number of controls to demonstrate that the identified cell assemblies could not be solely accounted for by the receptive field similarity.</p><p>The analysis in the subsection “Identification of coordinated neuronal ensembles (cNEs)” correlating results obtained full datasets and the first three quarters is somewhat confusing. Some of the overlap in the results will be due to overlap in the data. One possibility is to use bootstrap correction to report the expected correlation that has been compensated for the dataset overlap. A more standard alternative would be to compare cell assemblies identified from different 3/4 of the datasets, and then if they perfectly overlap that would be one answer. If the overlap is less than 100% this can again be corrected using bootstrap formula from the Efron and Tibshirani book &quot;An introduction to the bootstrap&quot;.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Coordinated Neuronal Ensembles in Primary Auditory Cortical Columns&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We suggest that you make the analyses of the noise correlations more explicit, and test whether the synchrony you observe goes beyond that expected for pairs. To do this, you could compare against surrogate data sampled from a model, e.g. Ising or dichotomized Gaussian, with the same pairwise correlations but no higher-order correlations.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your revised article entitled &quot;Coordinated Neuronal Ensembles in Primary Auditory Cortical Columns&quot; for peer review at eLife.

They point out that this produces simulated spike trains that differ from the real data in two ways: 1) higher-order correlations at all delays and 2) second-order correlations at non-zero delays. If the goal is to quantify the impact of higher-order correlations, this might not the best way to do it. The DG framework can be used to generate spike trains that match the second-order correlations at all delays. Wouldn't that be better for this purpose?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35587.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a well-written paper that provides solid analysis of an exceptional set of data from primary auditory cortex.

Activity from within a cortical column may contain instances of such sequential activation given that we explicitly included that possibility with our selection of the 10 ms synchrony window. Actually, the few cNEs that extended across several layers (Figure 7F) may be examples of such ‘projection assemblies’. However, to separate sources and targets within a column requires much more data than available. To resolve this issue, measurements are needed that include more spatially segregated sites of sources and targets, e.g., from thalamus, IC, or other cortical fields.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>So what are examples of these features?

It was not our intention to tout that as the main point of Figure 6, and have changed the heading of that section to reflect that (“Synchrony between cNE members cannot be fully explained by receptive field overlap”). Rather it illustrates that the correlation sharpness for cNE members is narrower than both the bin size constraining spiking synchrony and the receptive field (RF) correlation width.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another major claim of the study is enhanced information transfer.

For our analysis, we applied the approach of Brenner et al. (2000), and adopted their metric for mutual information. In their paper, they do indeed derive this mutual information metric from the difference between two entropies (see pages 1534-1539 of their paper for mathematical derivation). Thus, our approach does appropriately capture stimulus information, and is not equivalent to simply measuring the entropy of PSTHs.</p><p>The finding of higher entropy for cNE neurons is not necessarily expected. The detection of cNEs only requires neurons to be coincident in 10-ms time bins; this does not require for the neurons to be coincident in 10-ms time bins and be responsive to specific characteristics in the stimulus. In fact, we have cNEs that are not very stimulus-responsive and their correlated firings are not reliable with respect to the stimulus. These cNEs end up having flat PSTHs as well, and random groups of neurons that are all stimulus responsive (and hence can be synchronized by the stimulus) can end up having “peakier” PSTHs (and hence more information) than the cNEs that are not stimulus-responsive.</p><p>We have added another mutual information analysis that takes into account the receptive fields of neurons and cNEs (Figure 10). This is meant to answer “what” information is more reliably represented. “How” it is represented is discussed in the Discussion (subsection “cNEs are functional units that reliably represent and transmit information”, second paragraph) and further analyses will be done in another manuscript, given the substantial length of that analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the method used identifies neurons that are co-activated. But obviously if they are fully correlated, then there will be no added information by the ensemble. This issue is ignored, and the authors have only focused on similarity of CNE responses, and not the complementary components encoded by ensemble members.</p></disp-quote><p>The degree of co-activation is, obviously, quite low, given average correlation coefficients of &lt; 0.08. Nonetheless, the analysis of the complementary components encoded by ensemble members and the whole cNE is highly relevant and will be treated in detail elsewhere given its extensive nature. We have added a section in the Discussion that discusses this idea (subsection “cNEs are functional units that reliably represent and transmit information”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the evidence for the claim that the CNEs are not based on overlapping receptive fields is rather weak. The evidence shown is based on STRF, which is a lousy model of neuron's actual receptive field. Therefore, they cannot rule out the possibility that neurons responded to a similar feature of stimulus nonlinearly.</p></disp-quote><p>There are several independent lines of reasoning to address this point.</p><p>i) The linear STRF is, of course, not a complete representation of the stimulus-preference of a neuron. Additional stimulus features may activate neurons, often in nonlinear fashion, as has been demonstrated using multi-filter approaches (e.g., Atencio et al., 2008; Harper et al., 2016). Nonetheless, the main (linear) filters appear to carry the most information. The similarity of only the main features captured by these first filters (determined by STAs) are used here, and cannot exclude the possibility of ‘hidden’ feature-driven aspects of the cNE neurons. Preliminary analysis of second-order filters, however, show an even lower degree of similarity between cNE members and non-members. A more detailed analysis of these aspects will be forthcoming.</p><p>ii) Comparison of responses to repeated stimuli (Figures 11A and 11B) reflects a model-free (non-STRF based) analysis that basically ruled out that neurons consistently responded to linearly or nonlinearly encoded similar stimulus features.</p><p>iii) The new spontaneous-evoked cNE comparison (Figure 8) further supports the idea that the activation of these cNEs are not driven by receptive field similarities alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From Discussion &quot;Instead, cNE activity represents important stimulus information embedded in broader network-related contexts&quot;. This is indeed a very interesting claim, but I do not believe the author have shown compelling evidence for it.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included Figure 10 to illustrate that cNE STRFs have enhanced excitatory and inhibitory subfields when compared against single neurons STRFs that shows evidence for the above claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The analysis in the subsection “Identification of coordinated neuronal ensembles (cNEs)” correlating results obtained full datasets and the first three quarters is somewhat confusing. Some of the overlap in the results will be due to overlap in the data. One possibility is to use bootstrap correction to report the expected correlation that has been compensated for the dataset overlap. A more standard alternative would be to compare cell assemblies identified from different 3/4 of the datasets, and then if they perfectly overlap that would be one answer. If the overlap is less than 100% this can again be corrected using bootstrap formula from the Efron and Tibshirani book &quot;An introduction to the bootstrap&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this inaccuracy and now use the first half of the stimulus (training) to predict the cNE activity of the second half of the stimulus (test) avoiding overlap between the training and test datasets (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). The findings and their interpretation are not affected.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We suggest that you make the analyses of the noise correlations more explicit.</p></disp-quote><p>We implemented this suggestion and completed an explicit noise correlation assessment by analyzing the responses of pairs of neurons to 5-second repeated stimuli. We report these results in Figure 9—figure supplement 2. Our analysis showed that pairs of neurons from the same cNE had significantly higher noise correlations than pairs of neurons not within the same cNE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And test whether the synchrony you observe goes beyond that expected for pairs. To do this, you could compare against surrogate data sampled from a model, e.g. Ising or dichotomized Gaussian, with the same pairwise correlations but no higher-order correlations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed this suggestion and compared the experimental data to surrogate data derived from a ‘dichotomized Gaussian’ (‘DG’) model. We used the open-source library available at https://github.com/mackelab/CorBinian to implement the ‘DG’ model. The library allowed us to produce surrogate spike trains that had the same pairwise correlation coefficients as the experimental data but had no higher-order correlations. We have incorporated these results into Figures 11C–F, as well as Figure 11—figure supplements 3 and 4.</p><p>The ‘DG’ model is based on a multivariate Gaussian analysis, which generates spike trains that match the neuronal mean firing rates and the second-order correlations of the experimental spike train data. We created the model spike trains at the same native resolution as those in the experimental data, which allowed us to carry out the identical cNE analyses on the ‘DG’ surrogate data that we had completed on the experimental data.</p><p>We found that the ‘DG’ model allowed us to identify a similar number of cNEs from the surrogate spike trains as we had identified from the experimental spike trains (Figure 11C).</p><p>However, membership in a cNE is determined by local moments of multi-neuronal synchrony that occur across the entire recording period. Further, ICA is a required step beyond the pairwise correlation analysis and must be applied to assign shared neurons into appropriate cNEs. Thus, we found that ‘DG’ cNEs were smaller in size (Figure 11D) as a result of the lack of temporal correlations and higher-order, spike-time synchrony that are present in the experimental data.</p><p>The importance of synchrony was further confirmed when we found a lower coincidence ratio (CR) for pairs of 2 neurons for ‘DG’ spike trains (Figure 11E). This indicates that even for pairs of neurons, temporal correlations provide a substantial contribution to the cNE analysis. Further, this implies that merely matching the rate and pairwise-correlation statistics is not adequate to model simultaneous recorded auditory cortical columnar spike trains. Auditory cortical columnar spike trains contain strong inter-neuronal synchrony, which can only be captured with higher-order correlation analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Your article has been favorably reviewed, but there is one remaining reviewer comment that needs to be addressed before a final decision can be made.</p><p>Reviewer:</p><p>The use of the DG model is appropriate, but I wonder why the authors used a model that matches the pairwise correlations only at zero delay? They point out that this produces simulated spike trains that differ from the real data in two ways: 1) higher-order correlations at all delays and 2) second-order correlations at non-zero delays. If the goal is to quantify the impact of higher-order correlations, this might not the best way to do it. The DG framework can be used to generate spike trains that match the second-order correlations at all delays. Wouldn't that be better for this purpose?</p></disp-quote><p>Due to computational limitations, the most feasible remedy was to use the</p><p>basic dichotomized Gaussian (‘DG’) framework to model second-order correlations at zero delays using 5-ms time bins. Using 5-ms time bins fulfills the requirement that the spike trains be binary, and also allows us to include most of the important temporal correlations between neurons from the same cNE. Neurons within the same cNE have been shown to have very sharp pairwise-correlations with median sharpness values of approximately 2-4 ms (Figure 6G – 6J, Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and have peak delays that are 2 ms or less. Therefore, this time resolution appropriately accounts for second-order correlations at non-zero delays (Figure 11—figure supplement 3C).</p><p>We show that even though this ‘DG’ framework seems to overestimate a subset of Pearson’s correlation values between pairs of neurons, leading to a larger number of detected cNEs (Figure 11C), it does not replicate higher-order correlations that are present in the real data, since cNE sizes in the ‘DG’ spike trains are smaller than that of the real spike trains (Figure 11D).</p><p>The importance of higher-order correlations in the real spike train was further</p><p>confirmed when we found a lower coincidence ratio (CR) for pairs of 3 neurons for ‘DG’ spike trains (Figure 11F).

Auditory cortical columnar spike trains contain strong inter-neuronal synchrony, which can only be captured with higher-order correlation analyses.</p></body></sub-article></article>
