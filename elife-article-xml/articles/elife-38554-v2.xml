define ‘command-like neuron’ as a neuron whose activation elicits or ‘commands’ a specific behavior). In most animals, it remains unknown how neural circuits switch between antagonistic behaviors: via top-down activation/inhibition of antagonistic circuits or via reciprocal inhibition between antagonistic circuits. Here, we use genetic screens, intersectional genetics, circuit reconstruction by electron microscopy, and functional optogenetics to identify a bilateral pair of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval ‘mooncrawler descending neurons’ (MDNs) with command-like ability to coordinately induce backward locomotion and block forward locomotion; the former by stimulating a backward-active premotor neuron, and the latter by disynaptic inhibition of a forward-specific premotor neuron. In contrast, direct monosynaptic reciprocal inhibition between forward and backward circuits was not observed. Thus, MDNs coordinate a transition between antagonistic larval locomotor behaviors. Interestingly, larval MDNs persist into adulthood, where they can trigger backward walking. Thus, MDNs induce backward locomotion in both limbless and limbed animals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38554.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When we choose to make one kind of movement, it often prevents us making another. We cannot move forward and backward at the same time, for example, and a horse cannot simultaneously gallop and walk. These ‘antagonistic’ behaviors often use the same group of muscles, but the muscles contract in a different order. This requires exquisite control over muscle contractions.</p><p>Neurons located in the central nervous system form circuits to produce distinct patterns of muscle contractions and to switch between these patterns. Smooth, rapid switching between behaviors is important for animal escape and survival, as well as for performing fine movements. However, we know little about how the activity of the neuronal circuits enables this.</p><p>Carreira-Rosario, Zarin, Clark et al. set out to identify the underlying neuronal circuitry that allows larval fruit flies to transition between crawling forward and backward. Results from a combination of genetics and microscopy techniques revealed that a neuron called the Mooncrawler Descending Neuron (MDN) induces a switch from forward to backward travel. MDN activates a neuron that stops the larvae crawling forward, and at the same time activates a different neuron that is only active when the larvae crawl backward. Carreira-Rosario et al. also found that MDN triggers backward crawling in the six-limbed adult fly.</p><p>Understanding how a single neuron – in this case MDN – can trigger a smooth switch between opposing behaviors could be beneficial for the medical and robotics fields. In the medical field, understanding how movement is generated could help to improve therapies that fix damage to the relevant neuronal circuits. Understanding how behavioral transitions occur may also help to design autonomous robots that can navigate complex terrain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural circuit</kwd><kwd>locomotor</kwd><kwd>command neuron</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>backward crawl</kwd><kwd>descending neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32NS105350-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carreira-Rosario</surname><given-names>Arnaldo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHMI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carreira-Rosario</surname><given-names>Arnaldo</given-names></name><name><surname>Zarin</surname><given-names>Aref Arzan</given-names></name><name><surname>Manning</surname><given-names>Laurina</given-names></name><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HD007348-24</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Matthew Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD27056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Matthew Q</given-names></name><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>APS Porter Physiology Development Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HD007348-24</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Matthew Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>APS Porter Physiology Development Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007413-36</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Matthew Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A brain descending interneuron can coordinate a switch between two antagonistic behaviors (forward and backward locomotions).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals typically execute one behavior to the exclusion of all other possible behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briggman and Kristan, 2008</xref>).

Such mutually exclusive choice of behavior has also been observed in several other systems, including <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (forward vs backward crawling), <italic>Tritonia</italic> (crawling vs swimming), leech (feeding vs swimming), tadpole (struggling vs swimming), turtle (swimming vs scratching), and zebrafish (left vs right escape) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berkowitz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaudry and Kristan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Popescu and Frost, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soffe, 1993</xref>). The selection of a locomotor program to the exclusion of all others is necessary to prevent injury and escape predation.

However, much less is known about how antagonistic motor programs are suppressed during command neuron-induced behavior. On one hand, there could be a high degree of reciprocal inhibition between neurons in antagonistic circuits; on the other hand, the command neurons that activate one behavior may also suppress antagonistic behaviors (in which case there could be minimal reciprocal inhibition). Here, we use the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva to characterize the neural circuits coordinately regulating two antagonistic behaviors: forward versus backward locomotion.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> larva have many distinct behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vogelstein et al., 2014</xref>), but forward locomotion is the default locomotor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berni et al., 2012</xref>) and consists of coordinated posterior-to-anterior waves of somatic body wall muscle contractions driven by corresponding waves of motor neuron activity within the segmented ventral nerve cord (VNC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heckscher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hughes and Thomas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pulver et al., 2015</xref>). There are ~35 motor neurons per bilateral hemisegment, innervating 30 body wall muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Landgraf and Thor, 2006</xref>), about 250 interneurons per hemisegment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rickert et al., 2011</xref>), and an unknown number of ascending and descending neurons traversing each segment of the VNC. The circuits for motor wave propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fushiki et al., 2016</xref>), the coordination of muscle groups within each segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zwart et al., 2016</xref>), and the bilateral adjustment of muscle contraction amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heckscher et al., 2015</xref>) have been recently investigated; however, much less is known about the circuits promoting backward locomotion, or the switching from forward to backward locomotion.</p><p>Larvae initiate backward locomotion upon encountering a barrier or experiencing mild noxious stimulation to the anterior body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kernan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Robertson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Titlow et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tracey et al., 2003</xref>). Backward locomotion consists of anterior-to-posterior waves of motor neuron and muscle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heckscher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pulver et al., 2015</xref>). A segmentally reiterated VNC neuron that triggers backward locomotion has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>), but high-order command-like neurons for backward locomotion and the circuit for executing backward wave propagation while simultaneously suppressing forward waves remain unknown.</p><p>Here, we identify a bilateral pair of <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain descending neurons that coordinately activate backward locomotion and suppress forward locomotion, and identify the downstream pre-motor circuitry effecting the switch. Surprisingly, immortalization of CsChrimson (Chrimson) expression in these larval command-like neurons reveals that they survive metamorphosis, have the exact morphology of previously described adult ‘moonwalker’ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bidaye et al., 2014</xref>), and can induce backward walking in the adult. By analogy to the adult naming scheme, we refer to these larval brain neurons as ‘mooncrawler descending neurons’ (MDNs). We reconstruct the larval MDNs in an electron microscopy volume comprising the whole central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>), in which we also map its postsynaptic neuron partners. We identify the circuit motifs by which MDNs induce backward locomotion while simultaneously suppressing forward locomotion. The MDNs project their axons along the length of the nerve cord, where they directly activate an excitatory cholinergic pre-motor neuron (A18b) that is specifically active during backward waves. In parallel, the MDNs synapse onto a GABAergic inhibitory neuron (Pair1) that directly inhibits cholinergic pre-motor neurons (A27h) active specifically during forward locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fushiki et al., 2016</xref>); optogenetic experiments showed that MDNs activate Pair1 neurons, which then inhibit A27h and block forward locomotion. The circuit structure therefore suggests that two behaviors such as forward and backward peristaltic locomotion can maintain mutually exclusive activity due to top-down excitation/inhibition, rather than reciprocal inhibition. We conclude that the MDNs promote backward locomotion at all stages of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> life cycle: from the limbless crawling maggot to the limbed walking adult.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of brain neurons sufficient and necessary for larval backward locomotion</title><p>We previously showed that activating neurons labeled by the Janelia R53F07-Gal4 line could induce backward larval locomotion, but this line has broad expression in the brain, subesophageal zone (SEZ), and both motor neurons and interneurons of the VNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2016</xref>).

We screened populations of larvae for Chrimson-induced backward locomotion (obtaining 1–2 larvae per 100 screened), and stained the CNS to identify the Chrimson:Venus<sup>+</sup> neurons that were sufficient to induce backward locomotion.

We found that both the intact larvae and fictive CNS invariably performed a backward motor wave in response to a pulse of MDN activation, with the fictive CNS occasionally generating a second wave at variable times during the 25 s after Chrimson activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We next asked, if forced activation of MDNs can induce backward locomotion, perhaps the MDNs are normally active specifically during backward locomotion. To test this hypothesis, we used CaMPARI to monitor MDN activity during forward versus backward locomotion within the intact crawling larva. CaMPARI undergoes an irreversible green-to-red conversion upon coincident exposure to elevated Calcium (i.e. neuronal activity) and 405 nm illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fosque et al., 2015</xref>). We used Split2 to express CaMPARI in MDNs and exposed crawling larvae to 405 nm illumination for 30 s while larvae moved either backward or forward. We detected little or no activity-induced red fluorescence during forward locomotion, but significant red fluorescence during backward locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

To do this, we identified the MDNs in an existing serial section TEM reconstruction of the newly hatched larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>). Our first step was to determine the precise morphology of both MDN neurons. We generated individually labeled neurons within the Split2 pattern using MultiColor FlpOut (MCFO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nern et al., 2015</xref>). These single neurons serve as the ‘ground truth’ for matching morphological features of individual neurons by light and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heckscher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>). We identified single MDNs in Split2 MCFO preparations based on morphological similarity to the behavior flip-out neurons described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Diagnostic features shared by both MDNs in the pair include ventral, anterior, medial somata, distinctive ipsilateral and contralateral arbors, a contralateral projection in the posterior commissure, and descending projections terminating in segments A3-A5 of the VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–E</xref>). MDN descending projections run slightly lateral to the dorsal medial FasII<sup>+</sup> bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Landgraf et al., 2003</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Each neuron in the pair share all these features, but the two MDNs can be distinguished from each other by their ipsilateral arbor, which is either linear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, arrow) or bushy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, arrowhead). We next searched for the MDNs in the TEM volume using CATMAID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>). We found two pair of neurons that showed an excellent morphological match to the MDNs in every distinctive feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A'–D'</xref>); we annotate them as MDNa and MDNb in the TEM volume. Hereafter, we call these neurons simply MDNs due to their similarity in morphology and connectivity (see next section). Importantly, none of the 50 neurons with cell bodies nearest to the MDNs have a similar morphology (data not shown). Thus, we can be certain that the MDNs in the TEM reconstruction are identical to the MDNs visualized by our Split-gal4 lines. This is also confirmed by functional optogenetics (see below). We conclude that the MDNs can be uniquely identified by light microscopy and by TEM.

These are the top four MDN partners in both synapse number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and percentage of total MDN output synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). All four MDNs have similar connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Most of the top MDN output neurons are either premotor neurons or have preferential input into known premotor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–G</xref>). For example, ThDN has a large number of synapses with A27l/A27k premotor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,E,H</xref>), as well as with A18g (which is not a premotor neuron).

Lastly, A18b is a premotor neuron present in all abdominal segments, but it only receives MDN input in segment A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,I</xref>). Thus, the MDNs provide mono- and di-synaptic connectivity to premotor neurons. The activity and function of the MDN-A18b and MDN-Pair1 pathways in locomotion will be addressed below; we lack genetic tools to investigate the MDN-ThDN pathway (no known lines for ThDn or A27k, and the A27l line has many off-targets).</p><p>There are numerous MDN inputs (an average of 396 post-synapses per MDN neuron) and we have not attempted to reconstruct them; this is beyond the scope of a single paper.

To answer this question, we performed three experiments. First, we used dual color calcium indicators in a fictive CNS preparation to simultaneously monitor motor neuron activity (GCaMP6m) and A18b activity (jRCaMP1b). We observed robust forward and backward motor waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, top), with A18b only active during backward motor waves, not forward motor waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, bottom; quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Second, we performed dual color calcium imaging within intact larvae, and again observed that A18b was only active during backward motor waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>;quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Third, we used CaMPARI within intact larvae to determine if A18b was preferentially active during backward locomotion. We expressed CaMPARI in A18b and tested for activity-induced green-to-red photoconversion during either forward locomotion or backward locomotion. We found that illumination during forward locomotion generated minimal CaMPARI red fluorescence, whereas illumination during backward locomotion resulted in a significant increase in CaMPARI red fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We call the A18b neuron backward-active rather than backward-specific because we do not know its pattern of activity in rolling or other larval behaviors. We conclude that A18b neurons are preferentially active during backward not forward locomotion.</p><p>To determine if MDNs activate A18b, we used Split1 to express Chrimson in MDNs and A18b-lexA to express GCaMP6f in A18b in fictive preparations. MDN stimulation led to a significant increase in GCaMP6f fluorescence in A18b, and this was not observed in controls lacking all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal (ATR), an essential co-factor for Chrimson function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Interestingly, MDN activation triggered a backward wave of A18b activity from A2 to A6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We propose that MDN activates A18b in segment A1, which is the only segment we detect direct synaptic contacts, and this is transformed into an anterior-to-posterior wave of A18b activity.</p><p>We showed above that A18b has direct synaptic connectivity to motor neurons and is cholinergic, indicating that is likely to be an excitatory pre-motor neuron. Consistent with this expectation, we observed co-activity of A18b and motor neurons during backward motor waves in fictive preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), and A18b stimulation led to a significant increase in GCaMP6f fluorescence in motor neurons, which was not observed in controls lacking ATR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>).</p><p>We wanted to test whether activation of A18b in segment A1 could induce backward waves of motor neuron activity. Unfortunately, the A18b-Gal4 line is not expressed in A1 (only A2-A7), precluding this experiment; moreover, it has ‘off-target’ expression in the brain and in the VNC; these off-target neurons do not prevent monitoring A18b activity because they do not overlap with A18b arbors, but they make it impossible to selectively activate or silence A18b. In conclusion, our data support the following model: MDN activates A18b in segment A1, which initiates a coordinated anterior-to-posterior wave of A18b/motor neuron activity that drives backward locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MDNs activate Pair1, a backward-active descending interneuron</title><p>Connectomic data shows that MDNs have many synapses with the bilateral Pair1 neurons, which send a descending projection to the VNC where they form synapses with A27h in posterior abdominal segments.

These preparations show rhythmic forward and backward waves of motor neuron activity, and Pair1 neurons were only active during backward waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; left, center).

These results are consistent with detection of MDN-A18b synapses only in segment A1, and support our conclusion that MDNs trigger but do not persist throughout, a backward wave. Noxious stimuli that produce multiple waves of backward locomotion are likely to continuously activate MDNs.</p><p>We do not know how sensory stimulation of MDNs produce a bilateral backward motor wave. It may be that noxious sensory stimuli typically activate both left/right MDNs. Alternatively, there is a single contralateral synapse in both directions between A18b left/right neurons in A1, and the number could increase with the age of the larva. Perhaps, the single synapses between contralateral A18b neurons transform unilateral MDN activation into bilateral motor waves. Lastly, unilateral MDN activation may produce bilateral A18 activation via uncharacterized contralateral neurons.</p><p>MDNs are necessary for a normal backward locomotor response following mild noxious touch to the head. It is unclear how the tactile sensory cue is transduced to the MDNs: we find no monosynaptic sensory inputs to the MDNs in the current TEM connectome (data not shown). It is also unknown whether MDNs are used for backward crawling in response to other noxious sensory modalities, such as high salt, bright light, or bitter taste. MDNs may be dedicated to responding to noxious mechanosensation, or they may integrate multimodal inputs to initiate backward locomotion.</p><p>The discovery of MDN command-like neurons that switch locomotion from forward to backward raises the question: are there command-like neurons that induce the opposite transition: from backward to forward locomotion? Whereas the MDN descending projection extends to A3-A5, and thus well past the thoracic and upper abdominal segments that initiate backward locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berni, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heckscher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pulver et al., 2015</xref>), a descending command-like neuron that induces forward locomotion is likely to project into the posterior abdominal segments, where forward waves are initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berni, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heckscher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pulver et al., 2015</xref>). Exploring the function of the latter type of descending neuron would help answer this question, as would the characterization of inhibitory inputs into the Pair1 or A18b backward-active neurons.</p><p>Our model is that the activation of A18b in A1 induces backward locomotion. This model is based on several observations. (1) A18b is only active during backward locomotion. (2) MDN forms excitatory synapses on A18b in A1 but not more posterior segments. (3) Stimulation of MDN produces an A18b backward activity wave. (4) The A18b backward wave is always concurrent with a motor neuron backward wave. Unfortunately, we are unable to directly test the function of A18b in triggering backward locomotion due to the A18b Gal4 line having off-target expression in the brain and in the VNC, and lacking expression in A1 or thoracic segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Backward motor waves are initiated from the thorax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pulver et al., 2015</xref>), and it is likely that stimulation of A18b in A1 or thoracic segments would be required to induce a backward motor wave. We attempted to find A18b in the thoracic segments, but failed, either due to incomplete annotation, segmental differences in morphology, or lack of thoracic A18b neurons. Similarly, the A02o ‘wave’ neuron can only induce backward motor waves following stimulation in anterior abdominal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>). The relationship between A18b and A02o is unclear (they are not directly connected), nor is it known how activation of either produces a backward motor wave. This level of understanding would require a comprehensive anatomical and functional analysis of larval premotor and motor circuits.</p><p>We propose that MDNs directly excite Pair1 neurons to halt forward locomotion. But there are also additional mechanisms to induce Pair1 activity, as many Pair1 activity bouts occur without MDN activity. These alternate mechanisms are likely to be used for Pair1-induced pausing that is not followed by backward locomotion, for example during a pause-turn behavior. The MDN-independent inputs that activate Pair1 remain to be discovered.</p><p>The least understood MDN output to motor neurons is the MDN-ThDN-A27k/l pathway. A27l is inhibitory (AAZ and CQD, unpublished) so if ThDN is also inhibitory, it would provide a disinhibitory circuit motif for activating A18b. This would be synergistic with MDN direct excitation of A18b. There are currently no genetic tools providing access to ThDN or A27k neurons, and the existing driver line for A27l has off-target neurons, precluding a functional analysis of this pathway.</p><p>MDNs can induce backward crawling in the limbless <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva, and persist into adulthood where they can induce backward walking in the six-legged adult fly. This is remarkable because most mechanosensory neurons are completely different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kendroud et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kernan, 2007</xref>), although there are some gustatory and stomatogastric sensory neurons that survive from larva to adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kendroud et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, most or all the downstream motor neurons controlling crawling (larva) and walking (adult) are different: abdominal motor neurons in the larva and thoracic motor neurons in the adult. It will be interesting to see which, if any, interneurons in the larval MDN circuit remain connected in the adult, and whether they perform the same function in the adult. For example, does the larval Pair1-A27h circuit persist in the adult, but become restricted to thoracic segments? It is also interesting to consider the evolution of the MDN circuit; some of the neurons we describe here may originally have been used to regulate adult walking, prior to becoming co-opted for regulating larval crawling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transgenes</title><p><italic>pBDP-Gal4</italic> in attP2 (gift from B.D.

Five minutes after acclimation to the room, one animal at a time was transferred to of 3.0% agar apple juice square arenas, 2 cm thick with an area of 81.0 cm<sup>2</sup>, and crawling was then recorded at 5 Hz using an Axiocam 506 mono under low transmitted light from below for 15 s follow by 15 s under 0.275 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> 561 nm green light.

Number of forward waves and backward waves, and percent of time engaged in either forward, backward or paused were quantified using the recorded movies. Behavioral data was acquired, given an unique identifier, and scored blind; except <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, where it was a binary assay (forward wave/backward wave) that did not require blind scoring.

We then calculated the probability by dividing the number of times the animal began backward crawling immediately after a poke by the total number of times that each animal was poked, which was always five times. For each animal, this was done with no light first and then under 0.96 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> 561 nm green light. We performed one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test between light ON groups. For panel 1H, we induced a backward run and turned on the 0.96 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> green light immediately after the second backward wave. We define a backward run as two or more consecutive backward peristaltic waves after being poked in the most anterior part of the animal. We scored how many backward waves animals performed after the light was turned on.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Calcium imaging</title><p>For dual-color and single-color calcium imaging in fictive preps, freshly dissected brains were mounted on 12 mm round Poly-D-Lysine Coverslips (Corning BioCoat) in HL3.1 saline, which were then were placed on 25 mm ×75 mm glass slides to be imaged with a 40 × objective on an upright Zeiss LSM-800 confocal microscopy. To do calcium imaging in intact animals (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D’</xref>), a second or third instar larva was washed with distilled water, then moved into a drop of halocarbon oil 700 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) on the slide. A 22 mm × 40 mm cover glass was put on the larva and pressed gently to restrict larval locomotion. The larva was mounted ventral side up so that the ventral nerve cord could be imaged using 40 × objective on an upright Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope. To simultaneously image two different neurons expressing GCaMP, we imaged neuron-specific regions of interest (ROI). In addition, we imaged two neurons using neuron-specific GCaMP6m and jRCaMP1b. Image data were imported into FijI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/fiji">https://imagej.net/fiji</ext-link>) and GCaMP6m and jRCaMP1b channels were separated.

GCaMP6m or GCaMP6f signal in postsynaptic neurons were imaged using 2–4% power of the 488 nm laser with a 40 × objective on an upright Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope. Chrimson in presynaptic neurons was activated with three pulses of 561 nm laser at 100% power delivered via the same 40 × objective using the bleaching function in the ZEN Zeiss software. The total length of the pulses carried was depend on the ROI size which was kept consistent across ATR +and ATR– samples within an experiment. For A18b activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), the light pulse was 700 ms; for activation of MDN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) or Pair1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), the light pulse was 440 ms. To quantify ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> traces we used MATLAB. Before extracting any fluorescence, our script first performs rigid registration to correct for movement while recording. F<sub>0</sub> was set as the average fluorescence of the three frames acquired before each Chrimson stimulus analyzed. For predicted excitatory connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>), we first average ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> traces for two consecutive 561 nm Chrimson stimuli separated by 20 488 nm acquisition frames. This was enough time to let GCaMP6f levels return to ground state. For predicted inhibitory connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), we gave multiple 440 msec Chrimson stimuli separated by 5 s. After recording, we then selected all events where the start of the Chrimson stimulus coincided with an A27h forward activity wave, which was necessary to elevate the GCaMP6m levels sufficiently to see subsequent Chrimson-induced inhibition. We selected the A27h segmental neuron with the highest mean fluorescent intensity in the frame before the Chrimson stimulus from segments A4-A7 (where Pair1 synapses with A27h).

We let the animals start crawling forward for at least 5 s in the lanes. For forward data collection, the photoconverting 405 nm light was turned on at 0.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> while the larvae crawled forward for 30 s. For backward, same light was turned on and backward locomotion was immediately induced by gentle touch on the most anterior part of the larva with a semi-blunt pin.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A command-like descending neuron that coordinately activates backward and inhibits forward locomotion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ronald L Calabrese as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present a thorough analysis of descending neurons (2 bilateral pairs of MDNs) that can initiate backward crawling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae; their role in behavior and their downstream circuitry that can mediate a transition from forward to backward crawling. They show that activating the neurons is sufficient to suppress forward crawling and initiate backward crawling. They demonstrate also that these neurons are active during backward crawls using CaMPARI albeit not in every case. They then show that suppressing their activity suppresses backward crawling in response to mild mechanical stimuli to the anterior body, indicating necessity for this specific behavior. They use immortalization genetics to follow these neurons into the adult where they have been previously described as 'command' neurons for backward walking. The manuscript uses the full armamentarium of intersectional genetics and optogentic techniques available for circuit analyses and is guided by an EM reconstruction of downstream synaptic targets. The level of circuit analyses is impressive and clearly shows that there is parallel excitation of backward crawling circuitry and inhibition of forward crawling circuitry. The analysis is elegant and pushes the technology available. The elegance of both the analysis and the mechanisms uncovered for preventing conflicting behaviors ensures that the manuscript will be of wide interest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1a) The paper does not consider the dynamics of backward locomotion, and the role of the MDNs and downstream circuits in generating these dynamics. Reviewer #2 describes 2 experiments that could address this issue. The second experiment (varying the temporal properties of MDN optogenetic stimulation, and measuring the effects on behavior or downstream interneuron activity) seems doable and would definitely enhance the paper but it is not critical, and if it cannot be performed within the timeframe of revisions, this concern should be dealt with as a caveat in the Discussion.</p><p>1b) The statement that &quot;…MDNs coordinate a transition between antagonistic larval locomotor behaviors…&quot; seems an overreach unless some data is presented on the relationship between MDN activity and backward locomotion.</p><p>2a) Command is always a sticky issue because it is often loosely used. The authors provide a nice sufficiency test but perform a necessity test only for backward crawling in response to mild mechanical stimulation of the anterior body and suppression is not 100% complete. We suggest that the authors clearly define command, if they wish to maintain this terminology and that they carefully circumscribe its usage.</p><p>2b) Please clarify why the MDNS are not always active during backward crawls as assessed by CaMPARI.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>1) The paper does not consider the dynamics of backward locomotion, and the role of the MDNs and downstream circuits in generating these dynamics. For example, is MDN activity sustained throughout backward locomotion? Is transient activation of the MDNs sufficient to produce sustained backward movement? At the circuit level, the first question could be addressed by imaging from MDN neurons during fictive backward locomotion (if technically feasible). The second question could be addressed by varying the temporal properties of MDN optogenetic stimulation, and measuring the effects on behavior or downstream interneuron activity. Either or both experiments would provide the reader with context for interpreting the functional imaging and connectivity experiments, which use optogenetic stimuli on the timescale of hundreds of milliseconds to seconds. Not addressing these issues would be a missed opportunity to understand how and where the dynamics of peristaltic backward locomotion arise. This question is directly relevant for understanding to what degree the MDNs are &quot;command-like&quot;, and how descending &quot;commands&quot; are transformed into behaviors that evolve over longer temporal and spatial scales.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38554.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1a) The paper does not consider the dynamics of backward locomotion, and the role of the MDNs and downstream circuits in generating these dynamics.

So it seems justified to say that MDNs coordinate a transition between antagonistic larval behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2a) Command is always a sticky issue because it is often loosely used.

In addition, the MDN axons have lower signal to noise than experiments imaging large dendritic arbors, making low values more likely. Thus, we don’t want to overinterpret any single data point in this experiment, but rather view the population as a whole. Interpreting the data conservatively, as a population, allows us to make the conclusion that MDNs are preferentially active during backwards locomotion. A rigorous determination of MDN activity during a backward wave would require dual color calcium imaging in MDNs and motor neurons (see response to reviewer #2, comment 1, below) rather than a CaMPARI experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) The paper does not consider the dynamics of backward locomotion, and the role of the MDNs and downstream circuits in generating these dynamics.

We tried expressing GCaMP in both MDNs and motor neurons and imaging neuron-specific ROIs, but it was not possible due to the massive overlap in motor dendrites and MDN axon in thorax and abdominal segments; imaging MDN in the brain and motor neurons in the VNC was not possible due to their difference in z-axis position. We also tried imaging MDN and various pre-motor neurons (as a proxy for motor activity) but found the overlapping expression also precluded acquiring neuron-specific data. The ideal experiment would be to express RCaMP in motor neurons using the RN2-LexA driver and GCaMP in the MDNs using the Split3 Gal4 driver. To build this stock would take about two months, plus the time to do the experiment, which is beyond the time allotted for this revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second question could be addressed by varying the temporal properties of MDN optogenetic stimulation, and measuring the effects on behavior or downstream interneuron activity.

We found that this brief pulse of MDN activity invariably triggers one wave of backward larval locomotion, in both intact and fictive preparations, with fictive preps sometimes having a second wave at variable times during the 25 second imaging interval following the induced backward wave. Note that backward waves are common in fictive preps (Pulver et al., 2015), and it is likely that these second waves are simply background backward wave activity, as they are not time-locked to the first (induced) wave. Nevertheless, it is clear from our new experiments that transient (300 millisecond) activation of MDN always leads to a multi-second backward locomotor wave. These data are shown in new Figure 2F.</p></body></sub-article></article>
