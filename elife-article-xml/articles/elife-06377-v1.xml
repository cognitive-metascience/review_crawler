implement their biological functions. In this study, we describe an exception to this paradigm. TRIM33 is identified here as a lineage dependency in B cell neoplasms and is shown to perform this essential function by associating with a single <italic>cis</italic> element. ChIP-seq analysis of TRIM33 in murine B cell leukemia revealed a preferential association with two lineage-specific enhancers that harbor an exceptional density of motifs recognized by the PU.1 TF. TRIM33 is recruited to these elements by PU.1, yet acts to antagonize PU.1 function. One of the PU.1/TRIM33 co-occupied enhancers is upstream of the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>Bim</italic>, and deleting this enhancer renders TRIM33 dispensable for leukemia cell survival. These findings reveal an essential role for TRIM33 in preventing apoptosis in B lymphoblastic leukemia by interfering with enhancer-mediated <italic>Bim</italic> activation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06377.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06377.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06377.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA inside every cell in a human body is the same, and yet the activities that occur within different types of cells can vary greatly. White blood cells, for example, are different from skin cells or liver cells because different genes are active in each type of cell. Molecules called transcription factors and transcriptional cofactors associate with specific DNA sequences to control the activity of nearby genes. It is common for a single transcription factor or cofactor to bind to thousands of sites across the DNA of any cell.</p><p>In humans, our immune systems protect us against infectious diseases and from malfunctioning cells that could become cancerous. White blood cells called B cells provide part of this immune defense. These cells help to identify invading bacteria and viruses, and can also develop into memory cells that help the immune system to rapidly recognize, respond to and eliminate a disease if it is re-encountered.</p><p>Immature B cells—also known as B lymphoblasts—mature within bone marrow. If any problem occurs in a cell as it matures, that cell is usually programmed to self-destruct in a process called apoptosis. If these cells are not destroyed, they can accumulate in the bone marrow and prevent the production of other immune cells. This leads to a type of cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</p><p>Wang et al. now reveal that TRIM33—a protein that B-lymphoid leukemia cells need to survive—is a transcriptional cofactor that prevents apoptosis. Furthermore, unlike other known transcription factors and cofactors in mammals, TRIM33 binds to an exceedingly small number of sites across the DNA of B cells. In fact, the cancer cell's dependency on the protein is due to TRIM33 associating with just a single binding site.</p><p>The role of TRIM33 in B cell leukemia also has potential therapeutic implications. Although it is found in cells throughout the body, Wang et al. found that inhibiting TRIM33 in mice resulted in lower numbers of B cells being produced, but did not affect other tissues. Developing drugs that prevent TRIM33 from working could therefore provide new options for treating leukemia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

(TFs) typically recognize short 6–12 base-pair motifs, which exist at a high frequency in mammalian genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wunderlich and Mirny, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>). While chromatin restricts the accessibility of these sequences, TFs nonetheless occupy thousands of genomic sites in any given cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>). As examples, MyoD has been detected at ∼39,000 sites in primary myotubes and Pax5 at ∼20,000 sites in B cell progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Revilla et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, transcriptional cofactors (coactivators and corepressors) are also known to occupy the mammalian genome in a generalized manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ram et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, strong support exists for a model in mammalian cells in which transcriptional control is performed by regulators that exert broad, yet highly coordinated effects on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wunderlich and Mirny, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>). This is in stark contrast to prokaryotic species, in which TFs can occupy as few as one or two sites in an entire genome to implement precise transcriptional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martínez-Antonio and Collado-Vides, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wunderlich and Mirny, 2009</xref>). Whether such a degree of gene-specificity exists among mammalian transcriptional regulators is currently unknown.</p><p>TRIM33, also known as TIF1γ, belongs to the tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing protein family of E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Venturini et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hatakeyama, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herquel et al., 2011</xref>). TRIM33 and its homologs TRIM24 and TRIM28 belong to a subfamily of ubiquitously expressed TRIM proteins that contain a tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) and bromodomain module and function as transcriptional cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Venturini et al., 1999</xref>). One role of TRIM33 is in the TGFβ signaling pathway, which occurs through regulation of SMAD4 mono-ubiquitination and/or by functioning as a cofactor for the TFs SMAD2 and SMAD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dupont et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agricola et al., 2011</xref>). TRIM33 is also known to interact with the TF SCL/TAL1 to promote transcription elongation of erythroid-specific genes, which may occur through the recruitment of FACT and P-TEFb complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2013</xref>). However, another study suggests that TRIM33 can form repressive complexes with SCL to block transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kusy et al., 2011</xref>). The PHD-bromodomain module of TRIM33 interacts with covalently modified histone tails, which can further stabilize TRIM33 chromatin occupancy and stimulate its E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agricola et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xi et al., 2011</xref>). While several studies have linked TRIM33 to transcriptional control, a genomewide assessment of TRIM33 occupancy has yet to be performed to define the scope of its regulatory function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNAi screen identifies TRIM33 as a lineage dependency in cancers of B cell origin</title><p>In an ongoing effort to identify roles for chromatin regulators as cancer dependencies, we carried out a negative selection RNAi screen in a cell line derived from a mouse model of high risk B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), initiated by introducing the BCR-ABL oncogene into <italic>Arf</italic>-null bone marrow cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Williams et al., 2006</xref>). 1,126 shRNAs targeting 259 chromatin regulators were assessed individually for effects on the viability of B-ALL cells in culture, which led to the identification of 16 dependencies after applying stringent scoring criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The majority of these factors had been identified in a prior screen that evaluated the requirement of chromatin regulators in MLL-AF9/Nras<sup>G12D</sup> acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zuber et al., 2011b</xref>), however TRIM33 was identified here as a unique requirement in B-ALL. The six TRIM33 shRNAs used in the screen exhibited a close correlation between knockdown efficiency and loss of B-ALL viability, suggesting on-target effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Furthermore, a v-Abl transformed B cell progenitor line, 38B9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alt et al., 1984</xref>), and several human B cell cancer lines were also sensitive to TRIM33 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, TRIM33 knockdown led to negligible effects on the viability of MLL-AF9/Nras<sup>G12D</sup> AML and Notch-mutant T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Upon knockdown of TRIM33, B-ALL cells underwent apoptosis, as shown by Annexin V/DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that TRIM33 is essential for the survival of neoplastic B cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06377.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNAi screen identifies TRIM33 as a lineage dependency in cancers of B cell origin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Negative selection shRNA screen targeting chromatin regulators in murine B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). shRNAs are rank ordered by the fold-change in GFP positivity over 10 days in culture, which represents a competition-based assay in which loss of GFP positivity reflects shRNA-postive cells becoming outcompeted by shRNA-negative cells.

This result is significant, since <italic>Bim</italic> –117 is already heavily enriched for PU.1 in B-ALL cells, but PU.1 occupancy becomes even greater when TRIM33 is suppressed. Consistent with the functional importance of PU.1 antagonism by TRIM33, we found that knockdown of PU.1 resulted in a reduced sensitivity of B-ALL and 38B9 cells to the lethal effects of TRIM33 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

In contrast, <italic>Atp1b3</italic> knockdown did not alter the sensitivity of B-ALL to TRIM33 suppression (data not shown).

Importantly, the level of H3K27ac at this AML-specific enhancer cluster is much greater than that observed at the −117 region. This leads us to speculate that the AML-specific enhancers at the −66 kb region might be the dominant regulatory elements at the <italic>Bim</italic> locus in this cell type. The overall strength of these enhancers in AML may diminish the functional significance of the −117 element, thereby rendering TRIM33 dispensable for AML survival.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we provide evidence that TRIM33 prevents apoptosis in murine B-ALL cells by blocking enhancer-mediated <italic>Bim</italic> activation. The role of TRIM33 as a negative regulator of enhancer activity is reminiscent of LSD1, a histone demethylase that has been shown previously to suppress active enhancers during embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Whyte et al., 2012</xref>). However, a key distinction we make here is that LSD1 suppresses thousands of enhancers in ES cells, while TRIM33 preferentially accumulates at a small number of regulatory elements in the B-ALL genome. We trace this unusual enhancer selectivity of TRIM33 in B-ALL to the density of PU.1, a TF which has been shown previously to associate with TRIM33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kusy et al., 2011</xref>). This binding interaction is likely to be cooperative on motif-rich DNA elements, which would account for the biased accumulation of TRIM33 at enhancers harboring an exceptional PU.1 density. Our ChIP-seq analysis of TRIM33 in myeloid, B lymphoid, and T lymphoid leukemias suggests that other TFs are also likely to recruit TRIM33, such as TCF3/E2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). To our knowledge, TRIM33 is the first example of a mammalian transcriptional regulator that performs an essential function through a single genomic binding site.</p><p>The selective occupancy of TRIM33 within the active enhancer landscape may account for the minimal phenotypes observed in TRIM33-deficient mice. This is in contrast to the effects of suppressing BRD4, a more general cofactor that is essential for the maintenance of many cancer types and for the homeostasis of several normal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shi and Vakoc, 2014</xref>). Remarkably, it is the localization of TRIM33 to one lineage-specific enhancer upstream of <italic>Bim</italic> that renders B-ALL cells hypersensitive to loss of TRIM33. The similar sensitivity of normal and transformed B cells to TRIM33 inhibition implies that the regulatory mechanisms defined here in B cell leukemia are likely to have evolved to control normal B cell development. Interestingly, <italic>Bim</italic> is upregulated as a means to eliminate auto-reactive B cells and to prevent autoimmune disease, suggesting a rationale for precise modulation of enhancer activity at the <italic>Bim</italic> locus by TRIM33 to regulate adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouillet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Enders et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In humans, a reversible depletion of normal B cells is a well-tolerated side effect of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, which is an efficacious therapy in mature B cell neoplasms and in autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coiffier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edwards et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, our findings also implicate TRIM33 as a promising therapeutic target, since one of the major phenotypic abnormalities in mice experiencing systemic TRIM33 inhibition is a selective and reversible B lymphocyte deficiency. Targeting of TRIM33 is particularly attractive since other bromodomain modules (e.g., BRD4) have proven to be amenable to direct chemical inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Prinjha et al., 2012</xref>). However, we observe a modest expansion of myeloid cells upon short durations of TRIM33 suppression in vivo and <italic>Trim33</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have been shown to develop chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aucagne et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, long-term inhibition of TRIM33 might have pro-tumorigenic effects in certain tissues. Nonetheless, our findings justify consideration of TRIM33-inhibition as a therapeutic approach in B cell neoplasms, which would be expected to unleash an apoptosis-promoting enhancer element.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>For competition-based assays in murine cells, the LMN-GFP or LMN-mCherry shRNA retroviral vector were used (MSCV-miR30-shRNA-PGKp-NeoR-IRES-GFP/mCherry).

The GFP percentage in total bone marrow was approximately 75% on dox for shRen and shTRIM33 mice. The GFP percentage in the total spleen was approximately 15% for shTRIM33 and shRen mice on dox.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission:</p><p>The manuscript by Wang et al. describes a lineage-specific epigenetic dependency, namely on Trim33. Many B-lineage cancers and autoimmune diseases continue to be urgent clinical problems, increasing the impact of this manuscript. The authors define a novel mechanism, where highly clustered binding sites for the transcription factor PU.1 at enhancer sites are counteracted by Trim33. This disproportionally affects 2 genes including the apoptosis inducer <italic>Bim</italic>. The authors demonstrate functional importance of <italic>Bim</italic> and functional importance of a single enhancer element upstream of <italic>Bim</italic>. Thus, virtually all of the oncogenic effects of TRIM33 can be attributed to binding to a single site in the genome, a remarkable discovery.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the paper was very interesting and well crafted, but there was some discussion about limited impact due to the fact that most mechanistic work was done in a single cell line, and that the mechanism of action of TRIM33 is largely unexplored. The reviewers agreed that further insight into the mechanism of action was not needed for a Short Report, but there was consensus on requiring validation of key mechanistic experiments in a second cell line.</p><p>More specifically, the authors show a unique higher density of PU.1 at the <italic>Bim</italic>-117 enhancer and antagonism of PU.1 by TRIM33 recruitment to this enhancer in B-cell derived leukemic and progenitor cell lines. However, while they show the initial phenotype for several B cell lines, B-ALL, 38B9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, 1C</xref>) and other B cell cancer lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplements 1B, 1C, 1D</xref>), all mechanistic work (except for TRIM33 occupancy) is done in only one cell line (B-ALL). The authors should reproduce their mechanistic studies in a second cell line (e.g., 38B9). Otherwise the novelty of this work is somewhat limited: it is known that PU.1 binds enhancers, and that TRIM33 interacts with PU.1. The reviewers agreed on the need to delineate the PU.1/TRIM33/<italic>BIM</italic> pathway in 38B9 cells, with the exception of removal of the enhancer at the <italic>BIM</italic> locus, which was thought to be too involved and would delay publication.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) In the Discussion the authors claim TRIM33 as a therapeutic target “… since the major phenotypic abnormality in mice experiencing systemic Trim33 inhibition is a selective and reversible B lymphocyte deficiency.” The authors do not address the other hematopoietic lineage phenotypes previously described by Aucagne et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2011 and Bai et al., Dev. Biol., 2013, most importantly the CMML phenotype. That is surprising as the authors also see an expansion of the granulocytic compartment after 1 week (BM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), and more dramatically 4 weeks (spleen, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Please discuss this.</p><p>2) If PU.1 is a lineage-specific factor for many myeloid lineages, why would TRIM33 antagonize PU.1 specifically in B (progenitor) cells? What about PU.1 density at the <italic>Bim</italic> enhancers in AML or T-ALL cell lines (the authors only show TRIM33 occupancy in those)? One would expect that either PU.1 density is low or that <italic>Bim</italic> does not play a key role in these cell lines. This should be discussed.</p><p>3) How do the authors imagine the interplay of TRIM33 and PU.1 in normal B cell differentiation? Is this mechanism active in vivo? The authors show that in the mouse model depleted for Trim33 B-lymphoid cells are selectively lost. They do not address whether apoptosis in the model is due to PU.1-TRIM33 antagonism. In fact, they show that TRIM33 binds to the <italic>Bim</italic> enhancer in normal spleen. However, work by Oliver et al., J. Exp. Med., 2004 shows that <italic>Bim</italic> is expressed in B-cell precursors. Is this also true in the authors’ system? If so, how do they explain <italic>Bim</italic> expression despite TRIM33 occupancy at the enhancer? What are the absolute <italic>Bim</italic> levels compared to those in the B-ALL model?</p><p>4) The fact the GFP-gated cells in vivo show more efficient B-lineage depletion than non-GFP-gated cells (and that there are non-GFP cells present under induced conditions in the marrow) suggests to me that the mouse strain with inducible shRNA/GFP has variegated expression in the B-linage or even whole BM (position effect). I believe this does not affect the manuscript's message, but the authors should clarify.</p><p>5) The authors allude to other factors with documented peak number: MyoD ∼39,000 and Pax5 ∼20,000 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Revilla et al., 2012</xref>). In a side by side comparison, using the same peakfinder and same parameters including p-value cutoff, how many significant peaks are there for Trim33 in the p190-leukemia cells? It might be that not the number of peaks is different from characterized transcriptional regulators but the existence of the unusual outliers including <italic>Bim</italic>. Please clarify.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06377.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers agreed that the paper was very interesting and well crafted, but there was some discussion about limited impact due to the fact that most mechanistic work was done in a single cell line, and that the mechanism of action of TRIM33 is largely unexplored.

This epigenomic analysis highlights a similar binding pattern for TRIM33 at the <italic>Bim</italic> locus in this cell type. We find a larger number of peaks for TRIM33 in 38B9, however, <italic>Bim</italic>-117 and Atp1b3-35 are among the most profoundly enriched in 38B9, similar to the observations in B-ALL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>). We also show by ChIP-qPCR that PU.1 occupies the <italic>Bim</italic>-117 and Atp1b3-35 regions in 38B9, much like it does in B-ALL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>). We have also performed experiments in which we knock down <italic>Bim</italic> and PU.1 in 38B9, which we shows alleviates the TRIM33 requirement, in agreement with the observation in B-ALL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3–figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>).

In addition, we now have two independent cell lines in which we can show that TRIM33 performs an essential function through a single <italic>cis</italic> element.</p><p><italic>Minor points</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) In the Discussion the authors claim TRIM33 as a therapeutic target “… since the major phenotypic abnormality in mice experiencing systemic Trim33 inhibition is a selective and reversible B lymphocyte deficiency.” The authors do not address the other hematopoietic lineage phenotypes previously described by Aucagne et al., J.

Please discuss this</italic>.</p><p>In our revised manuscript, we now discuss the potential for tumorigenic effects incurred by TRIM33 inhibition in certain tissues, in light of the Aucagne et al. study showing CMML-like disease in TRIM33-ko mice. This appears in the last paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>2) If PU.1 is a lineage-specific factor for many myeloid lineages, why would TRIM33 antagonize PU.1 specifically in B (progenitor) cells? What about PU.1 density at the</italic> Bim <italic>enhancers in AML or T-ALL cell lines (the authors only show TRIM33 occupancy in those)? One would expect that either PU.1 density is low or that</italic> Bim <italic>does not play a key role in these cell lines. This should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>This is an important issue, which was not adequately addressed or discussed in the original manuscript. To carefully define the cell type-specific pattern of TRIM33 occupancy in these different leukemia contexts, we have now performed ChIP-seq analysis of TRIM33 in 38B9, AML, and T-ALL cell lines. This analysis shows that TRIM33 occupies the <italic>Bim</italic>-117 and <italic>Atp1b3</italic>-35 enhancers in B-ALL, 38B9, and AML, but not in T-ALL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, we show that occupancy of TRIM33 at <italic>Bim</italic> and <italic>Atp1b3</italic> occurs at extremely high levels in 38B9 and AML as compared to other genomic sites, which resembles the skewed pattern observed in B-ALL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>). We have also performed ChIP-qPCR analysis of PU.1 in 38B9, AML, and T-ALL cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>). This reveals PU.1 occupying <italic>Bim</italic>-117 and Atp1b3-35 in 38B9 and AML, but not T-ALL. Hence, these findings reveal that PU.1 and TRIM33 occupy similar elements at the <italic>Bim</italic> and Atp1b3 loci in B-lymphoid and myeloid leukemias, but not in T-lymphoid cells.</p><p>The ChIP-seq observation of TRIM33 occupancy at the <italic>Bim</italic>-117 enhancer in AML was unexpected, as our original manuscript included ChIP-qPCR data showing a lack of TRIM33 occupancy at this region in AML. This discrepancy prompted us to perform additional TRIM33 and PU.1 ChIP-qPCR experiments in 3 additional early passage AML cultures, which were all derived independently from the MLL-AF9/Nras<sup>G12D</sup> mouse model. The results are shown below and validate the ChIP-seq findings that TRIM33 occupies the <italic>Bim</italic>-117 region in AML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1</xref>). We do not fully understand why our original results were erroneous with regard to TRIM33 occupancy in AML, but this may due to the use of a late-passage of AML cell lines for this experiment in the original submission, whereas the ChIP-seq and new ChIP-qPCR experiments was performed in early passage AML cultures. Alternatively, it is possible there was cell culture mixup that led to this incorrect conclusion. We apologize for this error in the original submission, which we have corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><p>These findings now raise the issue as to why <italic>Bim</italic> expression and apoptosis are unaffected in AML cells upon TRIM33 knockdown, despite PU.1/TRIM33 occupancy at <italic>Bim</italic> -117 in this cell type. An analysis of H3K27ac in B-ALL and AML reveals a significant difference in the <italic>Bim</italic> enhancer landscape in these two cell types. In B-ALL, the -117 kb region is among the most hyperacetylated regions in the vicinity of <italic>Bim</italic>, suggesting this enhancer is among the most active at the <italic>Bim</italic> locus in this cell type. In AML we observe a unique enhancer cluster at ∼66 kb upstream of <italic>Bim</italic> which is not observed in B-ALL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, the levels of H3K27ac at this region are substantially higher than the level of H3K27ac at the -117 kb region. This raises the possibility that a different set of enhancers control <italic>Bim</italic> in AML, whose strength might be substantially greater than the activity of the -117 region. This leads us to speculate that, while TRIM33 and PU1 occupy the <italic>Bim</italic> locus in AML, this element is not a major contributor to <italic>Bim</italic> expression in this cell type, which is instead regulated by the -66 enhancer cluster. We provide a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> and a new paragraph discussing this point in the revised manuscript (last paragraph of the Results section).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06377.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>ChIP-qPCR of TRIM33 and PU.1 in 3 independent MLL-AF9/Nras<sup>G12D</sup> acute myeloid leukemia cell lines, which are all early passage cultures derived from leukemic mice.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06377.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06377.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06377-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) How do the authors imagine the interplay of TRIM33 and PU.1 in normal B cell differentiation?

What are the absolute</italic> Bim <italic>levels compared to those in the B-ALL model?</italic></p><p>Our manuscript does not completely address whether the TRIM33/PU.1 antagonism is operating during normal B cell development. However, there are several lines of suggestive evidence that point to the observations in B-ALL being relevant during normal B cell differentiation. First, we observe a similar sensitivity in normal and transformed B cells to TRIM33 knockdown. Second, we observe PU.1 binding to the <italic>Bim</italic>-117 and <italic>Atp1b3</italic>-35 regions in previously published ChIP-seq datasets obtained from normal B cell progenitors (Heinz and Glass, Molecular Cell 2010, PMID: 20513432). Third, we observe TRIM33 occupancy at the <italic>Bim</italic>-117 and <italic>Atp1b3</italic>-35 regions in whole spleen. All of these findings would be consistent with TRIM33/PU.1 antagonism being relevant to the phenotype observed in TRIM33-deficient mice, however definitive evidence will require additional genetic experiments in normal B lymphoid cells. We describe the potential relevance of TRIM33 for regulating normal B cell development in the Discussion section.</p><p>It should be noted that <italic>Bim</italic> is actually expressed at reasonably high levels in B-ALL cells even in the presence of TRIM33 (RPKM value of 12.6 from B-ALL RNA-seq). It can also be appreciated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> that the <italic>Bim</italic> promoter exhibits robust H3K4me3 in B-ALL despite TRIM33 occupancy at the -117 region. In addition, by Western blotting we can readily detect <italic>Bim</italic> protein in TRIM33-proficient B-ALL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The <italic>Bim</italic> locus in B-ALL cells also harbors multiple H3K27ac peaks, suggesting multiple active enhancers are contributing to <italic>Bim</italic> expression, with TRIM33 only antagonizing one of these elements. Hence, our findings are consistent with Oliver et al., 2004, in that <italic>Bim</italic> is expressed in these different normal and malignant B cells, but this expression is just below the critical threshold for committing cells to undergo apoptosis. Hence, targeting TRIM33 tips this balance by quantitatively increasing <italic>Bim</italic> expression through releasing the activity of one enhancer. It does not appear that TRIM33 regulates an on/off switch of <italic>Bim</italic> expression. For space considerations of a short report, we have not provided an extensive description of this issue in the text of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) The fact the GFP-gated cells in vivo show more efficient B-lineage depletion than non-GFP-gated cells (and that there are non-GFP cells present under induced conditions in the marrow) suggests to me that the mouse strain with inducible shRNA/GFP has variegated expression in the B-linage or even whole BM (position effect). I believe this does not affect the manuscript's message, but the authors should clarify</italic>.</p><p>In the subsection headed “Transgenic animal studies” of the Methods section, we describe in greater detail the GFP percentages in the bone marrow and spleen following dox administration and the variegated expression pattern of shRNA/GFP in these animals. The bone marrow is approximately 75% GFP+ and the spleen is approximately 15% GFP+, which highlights the need for GFP gating to accurately measure effects on normal hematopoietic cells.</p><p><italic>5) The authors allude to other factors with documented peak number: MyoD ∼39,000 and Pax5 ∼20,000 sites (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"><italic>Cao et al., 2010</italic></xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33"><italic>Revilla et al., 2012</italic></xref><italic>). In a side by side comparison, using the same peakfinder and same parameters including p-value cutoff, how many significant peaks are there for Trim33 in the p190-leukemia cells? It might be that not the number of peaks is different from characterized transcriptional regulators but the existence of the unusual outliers including</italic> Bim<italic>. Please clarify</italic>.</p><p>The Pax5 study used the same algorithm (MACS) as we have used to characterize TRIM33 occupancy. In fact, in the Pax5 ChIP-seq analysis the authors used an even greater stringency of cutoffs than we have used when we defined 31 TRIM33 peaks in B-ALL. Hence, applying the same cutoffs to the TRIM33 ChIP-seq data would have revealed even fewer peaks than the 31 we were able to identify. As described below, the absolute number of peaks identified using ChIP-seq must caveated by the arbitrary enrichment cutoffs used to define occupancy.</p><p>Our revised manuscript now includes TRIM33 ChIP-seq performed in 38B9, AML, and T-ALL. This analysis reveals a substantially greater number of peaks overall in each of these cell types that achieves statistical significance using standard MACS peak calling criteria. However, we note in each dataset that there are indeed, as the reviewers suggest, the presence of unusual outliers with exceptional occupancy, such as <italic>Bim</italic> and Atp1b3. Throughout the text of the revised manuscript, we have more clearly described this type of pattern. For instance, we have removed the description of TRIM33 occupancy as ‘sparse’ in the B-ALL genome (which was the wording in the original Abstract), since we should not over-interpret the absolute number of peaks identified in the ChIP-seq experiments. Instead, it is more appropriate to describe the disproportionate accumulation of TRIM33 at a small number of sites in each cell type, which appears to be a consistent pattern in B-ALL, 38B9, and AML, but to a lesser extent in T-ALL. Our revised manuscript also includes a MEME-based motif analysis of the TRIM33 peaks in each of these cell types, which confirms the relevance of PU.1 in myeloid and B lymphoid cell types, but reveals additional TFs as contributing the TRIM33 recruitment in T-ALL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
