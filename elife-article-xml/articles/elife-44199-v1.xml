They catalyze the ligation of RNA molecules via phosphodiester bonds during different RNA processing events, such as repair, editing and splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Popow et al., 2012</xref>). The fungal tRNA ligase Trl1 (previously named Rlg1) is encoded by an essential gene and is involved in tRNA splicing and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Trl1 is a tripartite enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), consisting of an N-terminal adenylyltransferase domain (ligase; LIG), which belongs to the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily alongside DNA ligases and RNA capping enzymes, a C-terminal cyclic phosphodiesterase domain (CPD) and a central polynucleotide kinase (KIN) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phizicky et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 1990</xref>). Trl1 substrates initially contain a 2’,3’ cyclic phosphate and a 5’-OH group at the RNA termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greer et al., 1983</xref>). The ligation reaction progresses via three enzymatic steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). First, the CPD activity opens the 2’,3’ cyclic phosphate by hydrolysis to form a 3’-OH/2’ phosphate terminus, and, second, the KIN activity phosphorylates the 5’-OH in an NTP-dependent reaction – preferring GTP over ATP. These first two steps ‘heal’ (i.e., modify) the RNA termini in preparation for the ligation reaction. Third, the LIG activity ‘seals’ the healed ends through ATP-dependent phosphodiester bond formation. This final reaction occurs in three nucleotidyl transfer steps: (1) Trl1-LIG reacts with ATP to form a covalent LIG-(lysyl-N)-AMP intermediate; (2) the bound AMP is transferred to the 5’ phosphate end to form a 5’-to-5’ RNA-adenylate; (3) Trl1-LIG catalyzes the attack by the 3’-OH on the RNA-adenylate to form a phosphodiester bond, releasing AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greer et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phizicky et al., 1986</xref>). The remaining 2’ phosphate at the splice junction is removed by an additional enzyme, Tpt1, which is a 2’ phosphotransferase that, like Trl1, is also essential for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Culver et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Culver et al., 1993</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44199.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fungal tRNA ligase Trl1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain organization of Trl1. The ligase/adenylyltransferase domain (LIG) is shown in blue, the polynucleotide kinase domain (KIN) in white, the cyclic phosphodiesterase domain (CPD) in green.

Exon ligation progresses via a covalent ligase-AMP intermediate (LIG-AMP) and a 5’−5’ RNA-adenylate. The residual 2’-phosphate at the splice site is then removed by a separate enzyme, the 2’-phosphotransferase Tpt1.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44199-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44199.003</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Sequence alignment between <italic>sc</italic>Trl1 and <italic>ct</italic>Trl1.</title><p>Sequence alignment of Trl1-LIG from <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic> (<italic>ct</italic>) and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>sc</italic>).

When we mapped these residues on the structure of <italic>ct</italic>Trl1-LIG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we found that they all cluster around the active site. In addition, these residues are all surface exposed, which points to their importance to binding and correct positioning of RNA substrates. Interestingly, His148 was also identified as an essential residue as its change to Ala, Asn, or Gln scored as lethal in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang and Shuman, 2005</xref>). By contrast, cells bearing the <italic>sc-trl1-H148Y</italic> allele were viable and shown previously to block UPR-induced nonconventional mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sidrauski et al., 1996</xref>).

Since the positioning of His182 suggests its participation in substrate binding, we performed in vitro ligation assays with recombinant, purified wild-type (WT) and <italic>sc</italic>Trl1-LIG-H148Y. As substrate we used Ire1-cleaved <italic>HAC1</italic><sup>U</sup>-508 RNA whose ends were enzymatically ‘healed’ (modified) to yield an appropriate substrate for Trl1-LIG (see Materials and methods for details). Equivalent concentrations of the WT enzyme yielded more spliced (i.e. ligated) product of the <italic>HAC1</italic><sup>U</sup>-508 RNA substrate compared to <italic>sc</italic>Trl1-LIG-H148Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>sc</italic>Trl1-H148Y is catalytically impaired towards a <italic>HAC1</italic>-derived RNA substrate but not inactive. To test if reduced substrate affinities cause the inhibiting effect of the H148Y mutation on RNA ligation, we determined the dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) of <italic>sc</italic>Trl1-LIG-WT and <italic>sc</italic>Trl1-LIG-H148Y towards <italic>HAC1</italic>-derived 5’ and 3’ exon RNA oligonucleotides using fluorescence titration experiments.

To obtain a quantitative comparison of the differences in ligation kinetics, we tested both enzymes in an RNA oligonucleotide ligation assay. To this end, we monitored ligation of a fluorescein (FAM)-labeled <italic>HAC1</italic>-derived 5’ exon RNA oligonucleotide (last 10 nucleotides before the splice site; enzymatically modified 2’ phosphate/3’ OH end) to an unlabeled 3’ exon RNA oligonucleotide (first 20 nucleotides after the splice site; harboring a 5’ phosphate). The isolated ligase domain (<italic>sc</italic>Trl1-LIG-WT or -H148Y) was pre-incubated with the 3’ exon fragment to improve the reaction efficiency. The pre-formed LIG/3’ exon complex was used in excess over the FAM-labeled 5’ exon fragment and the time-course of ligation was analyzed by denaturing urea-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The results were fitted to a first-order model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and revealed a 2.2-fold longer half-life for the H148Y mutant (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 9.2 min) compared to WT ligase (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 4.1 min). These kinetic data confirmed the impeding effect of the His-to-Tyr mutation on <italic>HAC1</italic> exon-exon ligation.

In the present study, we present the crystal structure of Trl1-LIG and provide new insights into the intricate kinetic competition between <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA splicing and mRNA decay.</p><p>The crystal structure of Trl1-LIG from <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> revealed a two-domain architecture comprised of a canonical adenylyltransferase domain and a C-terminal domain with a unique all-helical fold within the same enzyme superfamily. Previous structural and enzymatic data on T4Rnl1 showed that its C-terminal domain is not required to catalyze RNA ligation but confers specificity for tRNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El Omari et al., 2006</xref>). Based on these observations and the structural similarities between the adenylyltransferase domains of <italic>ct</italic>Trl1-LIG and T4Rnl1, we suspect a similar function, that is conferring substrate specificity, of the C-terminal domain of <italic>ct</italic>Trl1-LIG. It will be interesting to see if the requirement for a 2’ phosphate on the 5’ exon is mediated by this unique domain.</p><p>A major motivation for our efforts towards an atomic structure of Trl1-LIG was to understand the separation of function resulting from the UPR mutant allele <italic>trl1-H148Y</italic>. The reduced ligation kinetics of Trl1-H148Y tip the balance almost completely in favor of degrading cleaved <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA. Both major exonucleolytic decay pathways of the cytosol, Xrn1 and the RNA exosome with the Ski complex, are part of this kinetic competition of RNA processing enzymes, albeit with different roles.</p><p>Our data suggest that Xrn1 degrades the 3’ exon fragment of cleaved <italic>HAC1</italic> and plays an important role in allowing efficient translation from the spliced mRNA. The <italic>HAC1</italic> intron in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> blocks translation initiation by forming complementary base pairing with the 5’ UTR of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rüegsegger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sathe et al., 2015</xref>). Degradation of the intron after splicing was reported as required for lifting the translational block and the production of Hac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mori et al., 2010</xref>). Deletion of <italic>XRN1</italic>, even in the presence of WT Trl1, resulted in lower levels of Hac1 upon ER stress. Interestingly, Xrn1 also degrades tRNA introns during tRNA splicing, a process with equivalent biochemistry as <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA splicing and shared functionality of Trl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu and Hopper, 2014</xref>). It should be noted that in all cases phosphorylation of the 5’ end, as catalyzed by the central polynucleotide kinase part of Trl1, is required to render the RNA molecules substrates for Xrn1. In consequence, this kinase-mediated decay poses a permanent competition for Trl1-mediated ligation of any RNA substrate in the cell. Degradation of tRNA introns in yeast has been previously reported to be catalyzed by Trl1-KIN and Xrn1in an analogous two-step process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu and Hopper, 2014</xref>).</p><p>We showed that abrogation of the RNA exosome by deletion of <italic>SKI2</italic> rescued ER stress sensitivity of <italic>trl1-H148Y</italic>. However, splicing was not restored in <italic>ski2Δ;</italic> instead, stabilization of the isolated 5’ exon fragment of <italic>HAC1</italic> allowed UPR signaling. Previous studies have shown by adding a stop codon after the 5’ exon of <italic>HAC1</italic> that the 18 amino acids encoded in the 3’ exon are dispensable for the transactivation function of Hac1p. In <italic>trl1-H148Y ski2Δ</italic>, the truncated form of Hac1p would need to be translated and released from an mRNA that lacks a stop codon. Indeed, we could demonstrate, that Hac1<sub>trunc</sub> is produced from the isolated <italic>HAC1</italic> 5’ exon in sufficient amounts to initiate the transcriptional response. The nascent chain release in this context is dependent on ribosome splitting by the NGD pathway. This finding is in accordance with a previous study that identified <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA as the strongest Dom34 target by ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guydosh and Green, 2014</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that RIDD in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> also depends on NGD-mediated ribosome rescue to allow degradation of cleaved mRNAs by the Ski complex/exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guydosh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kimmig et al., 2012</xref>). Together, these findings establish a crucial role of NGD in both functional outputs of the Ire1 branch of the UPR. Interestingly, production of Hac1<sub>trunc</sub> coincides with a high-molecular weight laddering that we interpret as ubiquitination of the truncated form. We surmise that the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA is an endogenous substrate of the recently characterized ribosome quality control (RQC) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The UPR is of crucial importance for cellular homeostasis. In yeast, Hac1 initiates a major transcriptional response that re-shapes the entire ER and upregulates hundreds of target genes comprising ~5% of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Travers et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, tight regulation of the response is of great importance for cell physiology. Our data show, that deletion of <italic>SKI2</italic> leads to the accumulation of Hac1<sub>trunc</sub> – even in the context of WT Trl1. It is very likely that single cleavage by Ire1 occurs frequently and that RNA decay pathways assist in degrading these <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA fragments to prevent premature UPR signaling. We conclude that tight regulation of the UPR in yeast is achieved by the interplay of several control mechanisms to which this study adds RNA decay and surveillance by mRNA quality control factors.</p><p>Trl1 homologs are present in all human fungal pathogens. They are essential enzymes for them due to their role in tRNA splicing. They also represent promising targets for antifungal drug discovery because their structure and mechanism are distinct from the RTCB-type tRNA ligases in metazoans (as well as archaea and many bacteria). The absence of human homologs of Trl1-LIG could therefore be explored as a promising new drug target in antifungal therapy, whose development has largely stalled in recent years. Together with the recently published structure of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> Trl1 kinase domain Trl1-KIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Remus et al., 2017</xref>), our study presents new opportunities for inhibitor screens guided by atomic-resolution Trl1 structures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic>)</td><td><italic>TRL1</italic></td><td><italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic> genome resource</td><td>Ct:CTHT_0034810</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>TRL1</italic></td><td><italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database</td><td>SGD:S000003623</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>IRE1</italic></td><td><italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database</td><td>SGD:S000001121</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>HAC1</italic></td><td><italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database</td><td>SGD:S000001863</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-HA (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Sigma:H3663;

The model optimization and quality assessment was carried out with PDB-REDO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joosten et al., 2014</xref>) and MOLPROBITY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 2004</xref>). All structure figures were generated using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schrödinger, LLC) and electrostatic surface potential calculations were performed using PDB2PQR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dolinsky et al., 2004</xref>) and APBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2001</xref>). Ligand interactions were analyzed using the protein-ligand interaction profiler (PLIP) web service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salentin et al., 2015</xref>). A composite omit map was generated in Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) to exclude model bias and to verify ligand density.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p>All yeast strains in this study were based on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> W303 that was made <italic>TRP1</italic> and <italic>ADE2</italic> by repairing the endogenous auxotrophy.

The extracted RNA was resolubilized in water, the quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the concentration determined by absorbance spectroscopy. For RT-PCR, cDNA was generated using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with oligo-(dT)<sub>12-18</sub> or random hexamers primers (both Thermo Fisher Scientific) from 1 μg of total RNA. The cDNAs of interest were amplified from the reverse transcription reactions (1:100 dilution) with Phusion polymerase (Thermo Scientific) using the appropriate primer sets and optimal cycle numbers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> for primer sequences and cycle numbers). RT-PCR reactions were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Yeast protein extract preparation and immunoblotting</title><p>Extraction of yeast proteins was performed as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kushnirov, 2000</xref>). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (any kD Criterion TGX stain-free gels, Bio-Rad) and transferred onto Protran 0.2 μm pore nitrocellulose membrane (Perkin Elmar). Blots were probed with the following antibodies diluted in TBS-T buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk: mouse anti-HA (1:2,000; Sigma H3663), rabbit anti GAPDH (1:1,000; abcam ab9485), HRP conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000; Promega W4021), HRP conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000; Promega W4011).

To this end, the authors solved the crystal structure of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Trl1 homolog from Chaetomium thermophilum. They exploited in particular the His-to-Tyr mutation at Trl1 position 148 (within the ligase domain), which abolishes UPR signaling but not splicing, gaining important insight into the <italic>HAC1</italic> pre-mRNA splicing mechanism by demonstrating kinetic competition between non-conventional mRNA splicing and RNA degradation, which effects the outcome of Ire1-initiated mRNA processing. Thus, the mRNA decay and surveillance mechanisms interact to ensure fidelity of non-conventional mRNA splicing during the UPR.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers agree that the paper presents an interesting study, which would warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic> if amended in response to the reviewers' critiques.

We tested several different in vitro approaches to determine binding affinities for both exons. We measured affinities by monitoring fluorescence changes of labeled RNA oligonucleotides upon binding to <italic>sc</italic>Trl1-LIG. Unexpectedly, these experiments yielded very similar affinities for WT and mutant Trl1-LIG towards 5’ and 3’ exon fragment (differing by only ~1.4 and ~1.1-fold, respectively), respectively). We included these fluorescence binding measurements as new Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><p>We conclude from this work that, if binding affinities are not significantly impeded, the reduced activity of the mutant enzyme must result from a changed catalytic activity. To confirm the reduced ligation kinetics (efficiency) of the Trl1-H148Y enzyme (Figure 4B), we performed time-resolved in vitro ligation experiments with labeled RNA oligonucleotides. These results confirmed the effect of the His-to-Tyr mutation, causing a ~2-fold reduced apparent rate constants. Interestingly, the mutant ligase is not only a 2x slower enzyme but also plateaued at a &gt;5-fold lower amount of ligation product compared to the wild-type enzyme. These results are depicted as new Figures 4C (PAGE gel) and 4D (quantification and fitting). Taken together, these results strongly support our kinetic competition model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What is the band marked with an asterisk in Figure 1D, lane 3?</p></disp-quote><p>The * demarks a circularized tandem <italic>HAC1</italic> intron. We now added experimental evidence that this is indeed the case. To this end, we used antisense DNA oligos complementary to either the presumptive ligation (circularization) site or the middle of the intron. After annealing to the RNA products of the in vitro splicing reaction and treatment with RNase H, which specifically hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bonds of RNA in RNA/DNA hybrids, the band in question disappeared and a band at the exact position of the severed intron (252 nt) re-appeared. We conclude that * represents two cleaved introns that were circularized by two intermolecular ligation events at their 5’ and 3’ ends. The results are depicted in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. We added the RNase H assay to the <italic>Materials and methods</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The results in Figure 4 should be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We quantified the <italic>HAC1</italic> splicing results and added the results to Figure 5 (previously Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Discussion: Where is it shown that Xrn1 degrades the 3' exon?</p></disp-quote><p>We softened the statement by changing “Our data show…” to “Our data suggest…”. Based on our RT-PCR results (Figure 5D), we could show that levels of the 5’ exon are not affected by the presence or absence of Xrn1. Although we did not directly “show” the degradation of the 3’ exon by Xrn1, it is the only <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA component left in the non-conventional splicing reaction. Our RT-PCR data demonstrate that deletion of <italic>XRN1</italic> restores splicing, which requires a fully intact 3’ exon as substrate.</p></body></sub-article></article>
