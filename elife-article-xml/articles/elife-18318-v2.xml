Modes of gastrulation range from stochastic translocation of individual cells to coordinated infolding of an epithelial sheet. How such morphogenetic differences are genetically encoded and whether they have provided specific developmental advantages is unclear. Here we identify two genes, <italic>folded gastrulation</italic> and <italic>t48</italic>, which in the evolution of fly gastrulation acted as a likely switch from an ingression of individual cells to the invagination of the blastoderm epithelium. Both genes are expressed and required for mesoderm invagination in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> but do not appear during mesoderm ingression of the midge <italic>Chironomus riparius</italic>. We demonstrate that early expression of either or both of these genes in <italic>C.riparius</italic> is sufficient to invoke mesoderm invagination similar to <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>. The possible genetic simplicity and a measurable increase in developmental robustness might explain repeated evolution of similar transitions in animal gastrulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18318.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18318.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18318.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In animals, gastrulation is a period of time in early development during which a sphere of cells is reorganized into an embryo with cells arranged into three distinct layers (called germ layers). The process has changed substantially during the course of evolution and thus provides a great experimental system to investigate the genetic basis for differences in animal form and shape.</p><p>As an example, true flies use at least two different mechanisms to make the middle germ layer (the mesoderm). In both cases, the mesoderm is made up of cells that move inwards from the boundary of the outer germ layer. In midges and some other flies, these cells migrate individually, while in others including fruit flies, the cells move together as a sheet. Fruit flies and midges shared their last common ancestor 250 million years ago and although the genes that make the mesoderm in fruit flies are well understood, little is known about how the mesoderm forms in midges.</p><p>Urbansky, González Avalos et al. investigated which genes were responsible for the evolutionary transition between the different types of cell migration seen in flies. The experiments identified two genes – called <italic>folded gastrulation</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> – that seem to operate as a simple switch between the two ways that mesoderm cells migrate. Both of these genes are active in fruit fly embryos and are required for the group migration of mesoderm cells. However, the genes do not appear to play a major role in the movement of individual mesoderm cells in midges.</p><p>Further experiments demonstrate that switching on these genes in midge embryos is sufficient to invoke group mesoderm cell migrations similar to those seen in fruit flies. These findings show that it is possible to identify genetic changes that underlie substantial differences in animal form and shape over hundred million of years. The ease by which Urbansky, González Avalos et al. were able to switch between the two types of mesoderm migration might explain why similar transitions in gastrulation have evolved repeatedly in animals. The next step is to test this hypothesis in other animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18318.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18318.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>C. riparius</italic></kwd><kwd>gastrulation</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>cell ingression</kwd><kwd>tissue invagination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LE 2787/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lemke</surname><given-names>Steffen</given-names></name><name><surname>Urbansky</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name><name><surname>González Avalos</surname><given-names>Paula</given-names></name><name><surname>Wosch</surname><given-names>Maike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional recapitulation of a likely evolutionary gain in gene expression shows that two genes are sufficient to switch mesoderm cell internalization from stochastic cell ingression to coordinated epithelial invagination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolution of shape and form is generally associated with changes of cell and tissue behavior during the course of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carroll et al., 2013</xref>). Such changes in morphogenesis can originate from modifications of molecular patterning, by adjusting the interpretation and integration of molecular patterning within and between cells, or by altering the translation of cellular decisions into changes of cytoskeleton and cell behavior, either alone or in combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davies, 2013</xref>). Understanding principal transitions in the evolution of morphogenesis thus requires the precise description of differences in cell and tissue behavior, the identification of coincident changes in gene activity, and a functional validation to support the link between molecular and morphogenetic divergence.</p><p>The evolutionary gain or loss of gene activity has been shown to be a major source of morphological innovation, in particular between closely related species and in systems where patterns of gene expression correspond to a direct phenotypic output like insect wing and body pigmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arnoult et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gompel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prud'homme et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wittkopp et al., 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2002b</xref>). Well-studied examples of morphogenetic evolution have correlated differences in tissue and cell behavior to modifications in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cleves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Indjeian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shapiro et al., 2004</xref>), occasionally supported by experimental evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abzhanov et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2004</xref>), but rarely have analyzed morphogenesis in reference to a genetically well-understood developmental context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rafiqi et al., 2012</xref>). It is currently not known whether major, macro-evolutionary changes of morphogenesis between distantly related species are driven through accumulative genetic tinkering, the recruitment or modification of pre-existing developmental modules in a switch-like fashion, or by the acquisition of entirely new gene function; neither is it understood how many or what kinds of modifications are required to instruct transitions between different modes of morphogenesis.</p><p>To address these questions, we have studied gastrulation in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and the midge <italic>Chironomus riparius</italic>, two fly species that shared their last common ancestor about 250 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wiegmann et al., 2011</xref>). Their evolutionary history is characterized by an evolutionary transition between two distinct modes of cell internalization during gastrulation, i.e. mesoderm invagination in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and mesoderm ingression in <italic>C. riparius</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Similar transitions between distinct modes of cell internalization have been observed repeatedly and in either direction during the evolution of metazoan gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leptin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nielsen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Solnica-Krezel and Sepich, 2012</xref>). In insects, the extremely fast and coordinated invagination of mesoderm cells constitutes a derived morphogenetic process that evolved from stochastic migration of individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johannsen and Butt, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roth, 2004</xref>). Mesoderm invagination in flies has been studied extensively in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> and thus provides an excellent reference system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leptin, 2005</xref>); mesoderm ingression is less well understood but has been previously reported for <italic>C.riparius</italic> as well as other species representing the most basal branches of flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goltsev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ritter, 1890</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18318.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>To assess gastrulation differences between <italic>C.riparius</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, nuclear position and embryonic axis elongation provide faithful proxies for cell position and stage of mesoderm internalization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>,<bold>B</bold>) Mesoderm internalization shown for <italic>C.riparius</italic> (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> (<bold>B</bold>) in transversal embryonic sections stained for DNA (DAPI) and F-actin (phalloidin).

Gastrulating embryos of <italic>C.riparius</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> were classified according to the degree of GBE.

In these embryos, putative mesoderm nuclei were barely detectable (arrow heads), presumably because they were few and adhered closely to the ectoderm.

Their positional information is relayed to the cytoskeleton by G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling through Folded gastrulation (Fog) as ligand, Mist as receptor, and Concertina (Cta) as associated Gα-unit. Upon binding of Fog to Mist, Cta is released and activates RhoGEF2, which is enriched at the cell apex of mesoderm cells through the transmembrane anchor T48. In turn, RhoGEF2 dependent activation of Rho1 invokes changes in cell shape through constriction of the apical actomyosin network (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leptin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Manning and Rogers, 2014</xref>). We used this defined morphogenetic module as reference to identify the genetic innovations that distinguish mesoderm invagination in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> from ingression in <italic>C.riparius</italic>. We then asked whether the evolutionary transition between ingression and invagination could be experimentally reproduced, and finally tested whether the origin of mesoderm invagination in flies has been associated with putative developmental advantages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>An initial comparison of mesoderm internalization in <italic>C.riparius</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> indicated differences in the mode of cell internalization, which were consistent with an evolutionary transition from ingression to invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). To establish whether differences between ingression and invagination could be studied by a careful analysis of cell positions in fixed tissue, we used staining of F-actin and DNA as a proxy for the cytoskeletal cell outline and nuclei, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). In both species, we found that the position of mesoderm cells during progression of mesoderm formation could be approximated by their nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,E’</xref>). To establish equivalent time points of mesoderm internalization during the courses of gastrulation in <italic>C.riparius</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, we compared the timing of mesoderm internalization in both species relative to a conserved and independent process of fly gastrulation, i.e., germband extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson, 1966</xref>). We found that relative to the onset of germband extension, mesoderm internalization started and ended earlier in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> than in <italic>C.riparius</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In transversal sections of <italic>C.riparius</italic> embryos that were about halfway through internalization, mesodermal cells clustered on top of a shallow groove along the ventral midline, while at a comparable stage in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> they formed part of a deep ventral furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,F</xref>). Taken together, the net behavior of mesoderm cells in the two species appeared to be either ingressive (<italic>C.riparius</italic>) or invaginative (<italic>D.melanogaster</italic>).</p><p>Notably, when we used cell position in transversal sections to assess the coherence of mesoderm cell behavior in individual embryos (see Materials and methods), we found mesoderm cell behavior to vary substantially along the anterior-to-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B’’</xref>). These differences were more pronounced in <italic>C.riparius</italic> embryos than in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> and indicated that the classification of cell internalization in fixed embryos as either ingressive or invaginative could not be based on qualitative measures of transversal sections alone. Thus, to account for variation in the mode of cell internalization within and between individuals, we established measures to quantitatively distinguish mesoderm ingression and invagination in whole embryos. Specifically, we quantified cell behavior during mesoderm internalization by using parameters that have been used to characterize this process in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>. These included the total number of cells within the future mesoderm that underwent mitosis, the width and depth of the ventral furrow, the number of cells along the ventral midline that were internalized, a measurement of epithelial integrity, and the maximal depth at which an internalized cell could be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kam et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McMahon et al., 2008</xref>). Mitosis was detected by antibody staining against phosphorylated histone H3. All remaining features were quantified by approximating cell position based on the position of the nuclei relative to the computationally reconstructed egg and epithelial surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the assessment of maximal cell internalization and furrow depth, the analysis based on nuclear cell position proved particularly beneficial as it was independent of cell orientation and avoided discrimination against distinct modes of mesoderm internalization. All features were evaluated for nine transversal sections of a ventral window for each embryo (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). While mitosis was rarely detected in either species during mesoderm internalization, wild-type embryos of <italic>C.riparius</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> exhibited significant divergence in all other parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18318.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Quantitative analysis of mesoderm internalization in <italic>C.riparius</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> characterizes differences between mesoderm ingression and invagination.</title><p>(<bold>A–B’’</bold>) Ventral view (<bold>A</bold>,<bold>B</bold>) transversal sections (<bold>A’</bold>,<bold>B’</bold>) and stacks of transverse centerlines (<bold>A’’</bold>,<bold>B’’</bold>) at comparable positions and corresponding stages of mesoderm internalization in <italic>C.riparius</italic> (<bold>A–A’’</bold>, blue; 17% GBE) and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> (<bold>B–B’’</bold>, red; 17% GBE).

Critical features for the quantitative analysis are indicated in yellow: 'mitosis' was measured by overlap of nuclear position with a positive pHis H3 staining, 'furrow width' was measured as distance between edges of furrow abutting nuclei (<italic>furrow width</italic>, 'A') relative to embryo width (<italic>embryo width</italic>, 'B'), 'furrow depth' was measured as maximal distance between reconstructed egg surface and nuclei within ventral epithelium, 'internalization' was measured as number of nuclei inside the embryo with a minimal distance of one nuclear diameter to the reconstructed egg surface (threshold indicated by the black line), 'integrity' was measured by the number of nuclei within the ventral epithelium divided by the total number of internalized nuclei, and 'max cell depth' was measured as the maximal distance between the deepest internalized nucleus and the reconstructed egg surface (indicated as grey line beneath furrow). The calculation of integrity was adapted in case of <italic>Cri-sna</italic> knockdown to account for high tissue integrity without internalization (see Materials and methods).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18318.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18318.005</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-18318-fig2-figsupp1-v2"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>To address the extent to which each individual parameter contributed to the global differences in <italic>C.riparius</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> mesoderm formation and detect biases in the analysis, we performed a principal component analysis of all the sections and parameters. We found three principal parameters that, regardless of intra-species variation in space and time, permitted the best discrimination between ingression and invagination: cell internalization, the depth of the ventral furrow and epithelial integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–F’’’</xref>). Accordingly, invagination in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> was characterized by high tissue integrity, a deep ventral furrow, and a high number of internalized cells, while ingression in <italic>C.riparius</italic> was characterized by low tissue integrity, a shallow ventral furrow, and a lower number of internalized cells. The number of internalized cells as well as the depth of the ventral furrow may be in part depended on the size of the mesoderm anlage and thus contain a species-specific component, whereas integrity was independent of the size of the mesoderm anlage.

Specifically, we asked whether mesoderm invagination might be provoked in <italic>C.riparius</italic> by emulating Drosophila-like gene expression of <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic>. We tested this hypothesis by injecting <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed mRNA of the <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> genes <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> into <italic>C.riparius</italic> embryos at the early blastoderm stage. In response to this unspecific and early ubiquitous expression of <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48, C.riparius</italic> embryos exhibited an invagination of the mesoderm. This invagination was seen in several ways. First, we observed the formation of a distinct continuous ventral furrow, qualitatively comparable to that of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Then in particular, the induced invagination in <italic>C.riparius</italic> embryos was characterized by increased epithelial integrity and an increased furrow depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18318.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Ubiquitous expression of <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> promotes Drosophila-like mesoderm internalization in <italic>C.riparius</italic> embryos.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mesoderm internalzation was characterized by a shallow furrow and little overall epithelial integrity in individual transversal section in control injected embryos (raw data as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Following early ubiquitous expression of <italic>Cri-fog</italic> and <italic>Cri-t48, C.riparius</italic> embryos responded with an invagination of the mesoderm which resembled that seen with the <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> forms of <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that a gain of early ubiquitous expression of one or both of these molecules was sufficient for the induction of mesoderm invagination. To test whether both <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> had been necessary for the evolution of mesoderm invagination, we tested whether a single factor alone was sufficient to induce invagination in <italic>C.riparius</italic>. Upon early ubiquitous expression of either <italic>Cri-fog</italic> or <italic>Cri-t48</italic> alone, <italic>C.riparius</italic> embryos displayed induced furrows overall, with increased epithelial integrity and deeper internalization very similar to the features observed in <italic>Cri-fog</italic> and <italic>Cri-t48</italic> double-injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Our results indicate that <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> operate differently in transmitting instructions to the cytoskeleton, while at the same time demonstrating that gaining early expression of either gene alone was sufficient to invoke a change in the mode of mesoderm internalization. This interpretation was further supported by converse experiments in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>. While the loss of either <italic>fog</italic> or <italic>t48</italic> activity in the mesoderm alone affects ventral furrow formation, it does not block it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kölsch et al., 2007</xref>), but the combined knockdown of <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> functions in the ventral blastoderm abolished ventral furrow formation and resulted in ingression-like mesoderm cell behavior reminiscent of <italic>C.riparius</italic> wildtype development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, the expression of <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> both contribute to coordinated mesoderm invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Manning and Rogers, 2014</xref>). Our observations in <italic>C.riparius</italic> suggested that expression of either <italic>Cri-fog</italic> or <italic>Cri-t48</italic> was already sufficient for a morphogenetic response that appeared indistinguishable from the expression of both genes together. This seemingly redundant control of mesoderm invagination in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> prompted us to speculate that features beyond cell internalization were associated with a tissue-wide invagination. In comparison with individual cells, a coherent epithelium provides increased mechanical stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</xref>). In the context of mesoderm internalization, this stability of a coordinated invagination could provide robustness against physical perturbations that are widely present during fly gastrulation as the germband expands and the midgut invaginates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa et al., 1993</xref>). To test whether variation within <italic>C.riparius</italic> gastrulation could be reduced by early ectopic expression of <italic>Cri-fog</italic> and <italic>Cri-t48</italic>, we collected and compared all time-independent measures of mesoderm internalization between control-injected and <italic>fog</italic>/<italic>t48</italic> injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

We could demonstrate that mesoderm ingression in <italic>C.riparius</italic> correlates at the genetic level with the absence of significant <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> activity in the early embryo. In comparison with mesoderm invagination in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, these results suggested that an evolutionary gain of early <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> activity may constitute a genetic switch to change the mode of fly gastrulation. We functionally tested this hypothesis by early ubiquitous expression of <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> in <italic>C.riparius</italic> embryos, and we found that the activities of either gene alone or both genes together were sufficient to invoke a Drosophila-like invagination of the mesoderm in <italic>C.riparius</italic> embryos. Our data suggest that mesoderm invagination in <italic>C.riparius</italic> increases developmental robustness and efficiency. Additionally, invagination preserves the epithelial character of the mesoderm during internalization and thus decouples epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in the mesoderm from the positional cell exchange during germband extension. As a result, the anterior-to-posterior order of mesoderm cells may be more effectively preserved throughout gastrulation. During the course of evolution, this could have facilitated the use of positional information of pre-gastrulation blastoderm patterning for post-gastrulation differentiation of the internalized mesoderm.</p><p>In the following, we are building on our results in <italic>C.riparius</italic> to assess the evolution of highly coordinated mesoderm invagination as described for <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>. Unspecific injection of <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> mRNA, which at best corresponds to a strong maternal loading, had a specific effect on <italic>C.riparius</italic> mesoderm internalization instead of leading to pleiotropic morphogenetic defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This observation was unexpected and surprising. In order for <italic>C.riparius</italic> embryos to respond to the early ubiquitous expression of <italic>fog</italic> or <italic>t48</italic> in a spatially restricted manner along the ventral midline, the activity of either gene was apparently realized differently in different regions of the <italic>C.riparius</italic> blastoderm embryo. A strong and exclusively ventral response to <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> activity in <italic>C.riparius</italic> could explain such a local change in the mode of morphogenesis in spite of ubiquitous gene expression. Recent work has shown that ancestral modes of gastrulation can be built upon a gene repertoire that is in part distinct from the network known in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stappert et al., 2016</xref>), and the local response to ubiquitous <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> activity in <italic>C.riparius</italic> embryos may thus be elicited by an unknown <italic>fog/t48</italic> sensitive pathway under control of <italic>twist</italic> and/or <italic>snail</italic>. Alternatively, ectopic <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> in <italic>C.riparius</italic> act through a conserved genetic cascade present also in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>. In this case, the activity of at least one component of this pathway downstream of <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> would have to be locally restricted to the ventral blastoderm. A possible candidate for such a conserved component with spatially restricted activity downstream of <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> is the G-protein coupled receptor Mist. In embryos of both species, <italic>C.riparius</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster, mist</italic> is expressed in a narrow domain along the ventral midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,F’,N,N’</xref>).</p><p>Mist transduces signaling of the extracellular ligand Fog to the intracellular receptor-coupled G-protein Gα<sub>12/13</sub> Cta, which during <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> mesoderm invagination results in apical RhoGEF2 activation. RhoGEF2 is intracellularly enriched at the apical cell membrane by its transmembrane anchor T48, and apical RhoGEF2 activation subsequently results in constriction of the apical actomyosin network and thus coordinated cell shape changes that lead to ventral invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kerridge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manning et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parks and Wieschaus, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dawes-Hoang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morize et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barrett et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Häcker and Perrimon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fox and Peifer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kölsch et al., 2007</xref>).

Similarly, the activity of ectopic ubiquitous <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> expression in <italic>C.riparius</italic> appears to be limited to a ventral domain that overlaps with endogenous <italic>Cri-mist</italic> expression.</p><p>Based on the expression of <italic>Cri-cta</italic> and <italic>Cri-mist</italic> and the induction of mesoderm invagination through ectopic <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic>, we speculate that mesoderm ingression as an ancestral mode of cell internalization is based on comparatively low-level <italic>RhoGEF2</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This low level of RhoGEF2 activity may be invoked by scattered expression of the ligand Fog, or, as has been suggested before, by low-frequency self-activation of Mist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Manning and Rogers, 2014</xref>). Our results in wildtype <italic>C.riparius</italic> embryos suggest that under such conditions, cells undergo an early epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and leave the blastoderm stochastically due to individual rather than collective cell shape changes. This cell behavior changes under conditions that increase RhoGEF2 activity at the apex of mesoderm cells, which may be achieved in two ways: either non-cell-autonomously, by increasing GPCR signaling strength through elevated levels of the secreted ligand Fog, or cell-autonomously, by improving GPCR signaling efficiency through the apically enriched membrane anchor T48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kölsch et al., 2007</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that nature used similar changes during fly evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), which ultimately led to the highly efficient GPCR signaling in the ventral blastoderm of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18318.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Evolutionary scenario for cell-biological changes underlying the origin of coordinated mesoderm invagination in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon model of putative ancestral mesoderm GPCR signaling based on findings in <italic>C.riparius</italic>.

Without an overt genetic directionality, mesoderm formation in flies has thus evolved either from a Drosophila-like ancestor that essentially lost maternal as well as zygotic <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> expression in <italic>C.riparius</italic>, or from a Chironomus-like ancestor that gained early embryonic <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> expression in successive steps leading to the developmental network described for <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>. We cannot exclude that <italic>C.riparius</italic> evolved from a Drosophila-like ancestor by a secondary loss of early <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> expression, and recent lineage-specific gene duplications, resulting, e.g., in two <italic>fog</italic> copies or <italic>pangolin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klomp et al., 2015</xref>), suggest that <italic>C.riparius</italic> may have diverged significantly from the last common ancestor of flies. Overall however, we favor the hypothesis that <italic>C.riparius</italic> rather than <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> is more reminiscent of ancestral mesoderm internalization in flies. Supporting this view, mesoderm ingression has been reported for an independent family at the base of the insect order of flies (Diptera), <italic>A.gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goltsev et al., 2007</xref>), in the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Handel et al., 2005</xref>), and reflects the general view that mesoderm formation in insects evolved from an ancestor with an ingression-like mode of cell internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roth, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Experimental induction of mesoderm invagination by early <italic>fog</italic> or <italic>t48</italic> expression in <italic>C.riparius</italic> embryos suggests that the evolutionary origin of the <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> gene network is linked to the gain of a ubiquitous maternal and a ventral zygotic enhancer for <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic>. Our results in <italic>C.riparius</italic> suggest that high levels of maternal-like ubiquitous expression of <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> are sufficient to invoke mesoderm invagination. Consistent with a critical role of maternal <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> in the evolutionary origin of mesoderm invagination, both genes are also expressed ubiquitously in pre-blastoderm embryos of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strutt and White, 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, so far only a weak maternal contribution has been functionally demonstrated for <italic>fog</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zusman and Wieschaus, 1985</xref>), and the main function of both genes in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> mesoderm invagination is derived from their zygotic, twist-dependent ventral expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kölsch et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, mesoderm invagination in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> originated by the origin of highly specific Twist-dependent enhancers in <italic>fog</italic> or <italic>t48</italic> and later the gain of maternal expression in both genes, or vice versa.

However, in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, the functions of <italic>fog, mist,</italic> and RhoGEF2 do not appear to be limited to gastrulation; the genes have been additionally implicated in gastrulation-like folding of epithelia during wing, leg, and salivary gland morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manning et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nikolaidou and Barrett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ratnaparkhi and Zinn, 2007</xref>), and the presence of <italic>fog</italic> and <italic>t48</italic> orthologues in insect genomes overlaps with the phylogenetic occurrence of winged appendages and salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krenn and Aspöck, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Images and stacks were processed using Fiji (2.0.0-rc-34/1.50a), Matlab (R2014b), and Vaa3d (2.801) and assembled into figures in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image processing</title><p>Each embryo was imaged as confocal <italic>z</italic>-stack with three 8-bit channels containing immunofluorescence of pHis H3, DAPI, and/or phalloidin. The image stacks were aligned to have the embryo ventral midline run in parallel to the x axis. From the aligned stacks cell positions, a boundary of the ventral epithelium, and an outline of the egg shell were extracted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Reconstruction of cell position, ventral epithelial boundary, and egg shell</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Cell position</title><p>To obtain cell positions, cells or cell nuclei were segmented and extracted as objects using <italic>Pixel Classification+Object Classification</italic> of the <italic>Ilastik</italic> framework (<italic>Linux version 1.1.5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sommer et al., 2011</xref>). The spatial position of each cell within the imaged volume was defined by the center of mass (centroid) of the <italic>iLastik</italic>-segmented cell or its nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Ventral epithelium</title><p>To obtain a boundary for the ventral epithelium, the staining of individual nuclei in a confocal z stack was blurred into a layer of connected nuclei by applying a Gaussian blur (sigma = 3) and enhancing image contrast (0.35 saturation). This volume was segmented and extracted as a single connected component using manual thresholding. The resulting object was loaded as point cloud into Matlab and remaining holes were closed using <italic>fillholes3d</italic> (maximal gap 20px). For this now closed object, a surface mesh was generated using <italic>vol2surf.</italic> Both, <italic>fillholes3d</italic> and <italic>vol2surf</italic> functions are part of the matlab iso2mesh toolbox. The surface mesh was separated into an upper mesh (facing the yolk side of the embryo) and a lower mesh (facing the egg shell). The lower mesh, corresponding to the apical side of the nucleus layer, was used approximation of the ventral epithelium and to classify tissue integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Egg shell</title><p>To approximate the egg shell outline in the absence of the vitelline membrane after fixation and devitellinization, a 3D alpha hull mesh was cast over the centroids of the segmented nuclei. Using the Matlab function <italic>alphavol</italic> with the <italic>xyz</italic> coordinates of the centroids (probe radius R set to default), this approach yielded the convex hull, a surface that enclosed all ventral nuclei with the smallest possible area and thus resulted in a virtual envelope that leveled out indentations and ventral furrow invagination. To compensate for the offset between nucleus center and egg shell edge, the alpha hull mesh was uniformly expanded by half a nucleus diameter in the ventral direction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification of morphological parameters</title><p>The developmental progression of fly gastrulation was assessed by the degree of germ band extension in lateral mid-sections of bright-field images. The deepest indentation of the infolding posterior midgut was taken as reference to the posterior end of the germband, and germband extension was measured in percent egg length relative to the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo (% GBE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To quantify morphological features of mesoderm formation, a region of interest (ROI) was defined by projection of a rectangle that encompassed all nuclei in the ventral 30% of the embryonic circumference and from 25% to 75% egg length along the anterior-to-posterior axis.</p><p>Coherence of mesoderm cell behavior along the anterior-posterior axis was qualitatively assessed in individual embryos by nuclear centre-lines. Centre-lines were generated for each transversal section of the ROI by determining the shortest path from the left to the right side of the ventral epithelium and successively passing through the centre of mass of each nucleus. The stack of center-lines was used as a visual and qualitative measure to judge coherence along the anterior-to-posterior of individual embryos. To compare tissue coherence between species, corresponding stages of mesoderm internalization were identified according to germband extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Morphological parameters of mesoderm formation were quantified within the ROI by determining the distance of cells to the epithelial surface of the embryo and the egg circumference using Matlab scripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lemkelab/mesoderm">https://github.com/lemkelab/mesoderm</ext-link>). The ROI was sampled by nine equal-sized intervals, each containing approximately 30 cells. Based on empirical thresholding, a cell was classified as internalized if the distance between its nucleus center and the reconstructed epithelial surfaceegg shell exceeded the length of one cell nucleus; it was independently classified as ingressed if the distance between nucleus center and the reconstructed reconstructed epithelial surface exceeded the length of one cell nucleus. Morphological parameters were then defined as follows: <italic>internalization</italic> - percentage of internalized nuclei in ROI; <italic>maximal cell depth -</italic> maximal measured distance between any nucleus center and the reconstructed egg shell in a transversal section; <italic>integrity</italic>: percentage of internalized cells that are not ingressed; <italic>furrow depth</italic>: maximal measured distance between internalized nucleus center and reconstructed egg shell in a transversal section. The <italic>furrow width</italic> of the respective cross sections was measured manually as a percentage of the embryo width directly on the <italic>zy</italic> image stacks in <italic>Fiji.</italic> As our definition of <italic>integrity</italic> as quantitative measure was measured only for internalized cells, this method cannot directly account for cases where cells stay within an epithelium in close contact with the egg outline (e.g. <italic>Cri-sna</italic> RNAi) In this case, the quantification of integrity was extended to all cells in ROI, regardless of internalization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Principal component analysis</title><p>The principal component analysis included all transversal sections for <italic>C.riparius</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> each described by its values for the five parameters: <italic>internalization, maximal cell depth, integrity, furrow depth</italic> and <italic>furrow width.</italic> All parameters were normalized by z-score normalization. Based only on parameter values and covariance, the analysis identified the two main axes along which variation in our data set was maximal. For all wild type sections, the resulting two principal components (PC1 and PC2) accounted for 57% and 21% of variance, respectively. A biplot for the PCA was generated to visualize the contribution of each of the parameters to the two principal components. To test whether parameter separation was dependent on variation in space (i.e. the position of a given transversal section along the anterior-to-posterior axis of an embryo) and developmental age (as measured by % of GBE), we color-coded cross sections according to their position and developmental age.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantification of variation and efficiency</title><p>Analysis of within and between-embryo variation was performed on all transversal sections and in the z-score normalized time-independent morphospace for <italic>C.riparius</italic> defined by <italic>internalization</italic>, <italic>epithelial integrity</italic>, <italic>furrow depth</italic> and <italic>maximal cell depth</italic>. Variation in cell behavior between transversal sections was calculated as Euclidean distance between transversal sections in morphospace. Variation between groups (H<sub>2</sub>O; +<italic>fog</italic> / +<italic>t48</italic>) was measured as the average distance between all cross sections of all embryos within this group. Variation between embryos was measured as the average distance of the cross sections of one embryo to the cross sections of all other embryos in one group. Variation within an embryo was measured as the standard deviation from the average distance of all cross sections within a given embryo. Efficiency of mesoderm internalization was measured by the number of internalized cells in embryos with 15 to 25% GBE.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical comparisons of distributions were performed as comparison of their medians via the <italic>Matlab</italic> implementation of the Wilcoxon rank sum test, as most variables analyzed were not normally distributed. p-values of this test are indicated in the figure legend.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Phylogenetic occurrence of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> mesoderm genes in insects</title><p>Genes were considered as present in the last common ancestor of insects if they were included in the insect as well as the metazoan or arthropod OrthoDB orthology group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Waterhouse et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, <italic>t48</italic> and <italic>fog</italic> sequences were identified by recursive searches of insect genomes with a position-specific scoring matrix (pssm). The pssm was generated in a psi-blast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) against non-redundant translated genome databases of representative insect genomes using two iterations and standard parameters. To identify orthologue candidates, this pssm was used in a psi-blast of individual insect genomes with an e-value cut-off at 0.001. For each searched genome, the top three contigs were selected and submitted to a reciprocal blast to identify the closest homologous gene match as well as putative species-specific gene duplications. In the first iteration, the pssm was generated using the <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> proteins T48 (GenBank, CAA55003.1) and Fog (GenBank, NP_523438), and the reciprocal blast was performed in the translated <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> transcriptome (BDGP5).

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A genetic switch controls the mode of gastrulation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Siegfried Roth, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jörg Großhans (Reviewer #2); Claire Lye (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper deals with the molecular mechanisms contributing to the evolution of mesoderm internalization in insects. The authors compare two dipteran species: <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and Chironomus riparius. The system provides a rare opportunity to address a macro-evolutionary question with an experimental approach. All reviewers agreed that this is an interesting study, which is important for the field of developmental biology as it exemplifies how the rich knowledge of pathways and genes controlling morphogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can be employed to explain the variations in visible morphology between closely and more distantly related species in terms of defined genetic variations.</p><p>However, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed prior to publication. Most of these issues concern the presentation of the study. There is only one point (9) in which an additional experiment was suggested.</p><p>1) The title should be more specific. The topic is mesoderm internalization and not gastrulation. The term genetic switch is misleading and in the context of the paper not appropriate.</p><p>2) Several terms are used for the process and types of mesoderm internalization, e.g. stochastic translocation, stochastic cell migration, stochastic cell internalization, stochastic migration of individual cells, cell ingression, single cell migration, stochastic internalization. We suggest authors use internalization as a general term, ingression for Chironomous, and invagination for <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>3) Mesoderm invagination is based on cell shape changes and cell movement. The authors analyzed fixed embryos stained for F-actin and DNA. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, the authors present data that are supposed to show that nuclear position is a good proxy for cell position. This is convincing in the example they present, but we would like to see examples for both C.riparius and D.<italic>melanogaster</italic>, and at a time when mesoderm internalization is more progressed. It is important to demonstrate that this way of measuring cell position holds for the full range of samples analyzed.</p><p>4) The Principal Component Analysis does not seem to be mentioned in the methods and generally needs more explanation. Do any statistical methods underlie the assertions that the 2 species separate most sensitively along epithelial integrity, or is this based on interpretation of the graph? Some details of this in the main text would be helpful.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> it would be nice to see statistics showing where differences are significant.</p><p>6) In all RNAi experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) it would be nice to see statistics showing where differences are significant.</p><p>7) Results section – twi RNAi: &quot;[…]internalization of cells outside the ventral midline[…]&quot;. This is not like <italic>Drosophila</italic> (as the authors claim) and suggests some non-autonomous effects, which spread from the mesodermal region to neuroectoderm and are suppressed in the presence of Cr-twi.</p><p>8) Results section – maternal loading: While for Dm-fog a weak maternal contribution has been functionally demonstrated (Zusman and Wieschaus, 1985), we are not aware of a maternal contribution for t48. However, even if this were the case for t48, the main function for both fog and t48 is derived from the zygotic ventrally localized expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The genetics are very clear!</p><p>9) Results section – Expression of Cr-fog2 and Cr-mist: It is rather astonishing that a fog paralog and the receptor mist are expressed ventrally prior to gastrulation. Indeed KD of fog2 seems to have a weak effect on mesoderm internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Are the authors sure the RNAi knockdown of these genes is working? Ideally, the authors should perform RT-PCR demonstrating a significant knockdown, which is important for the assertion the fog signalling pathway does not play a role in gastrulation in wildtype C.riparius</p><p>10) In the last part of the study, the authors would like to address the question whether epithelial infolding would make mesoderm invagination more robust than by cell ingression. For this they apply wounds by microinjection and assay developmental variation. This is done in normal and &quot;rescued&quot; Chironomus embryos. We do not find the assay robust and the data convincing as the read-out of the assay is not clearly defined. In our view this experiment could be removed entirely without affecting the strength of the study.</p><p>11) Discussion and conclusion section – Gain of a maternal enhancer for fog and t48: Since it is very clear that the contribution of fog and t48 to gastrulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> depends on their ventral zygotic expression we do not believe that the gain of maternal enhancers was the crucial evolutionary change. It is rather surprising that the Chironomus injections of t48 and fog mRNA showed such specific effects and did not result in pleiotropic morphogenetic defects. Regarding the injection experiments we think you should use a term like 'ubiquitous ecotopic expression' rather than mimicking maternal loading.</p><p>12) In reference to the Discussion, I am not convinced there is sufficient evidence to claim that RhoGEF2 activation normally occurs at low levels in C.riparius, though expression patterns of cta and mist might be suggestive if this. For such a claim to be tested further knockdown experiments would be required. The alternative that in wildtype C.riparius mesoderm internalisation could be controlled by a separate pathway, but that it is competent to response to ectopic fog and T48 should also be discussed.</p><p>13) The authors propose that the ingression mode of Chironomus is the evolutionary older mode and that the epithelial infolding mode has emerged later in evolution by gain of T48 and Fog expression in the mesoderm anlage. This model is not fully consistent with the situation on the genetic level. T48 and Fog genes are present in both species. No arguments are presented that would address the directionality, whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> has gained the expression or whether Chironomus has lost the expression of T48/Fog in the mesoderm anlage. The argumentation that Chironomus has lost the expression of T48 and Fog in the mesoderm anlage is equally valid. The authors should at least discuss the alternative model that the ingression mode in Chironomus is derived from an epithelial infolding by loss of Fog and T48 expression.</p><p>14) The manuscript contains nine supplemental figures. The authors should incorporate most if not all of the supplemental data into the main body of the manuscript. For example, the manuscript should start with a comparative description of mesoderm invagination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Chironomus that also defines the staging that is used furtheron in the study. The current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is not sufficient for such a presentation, as the staging is not clear and no cells are shown. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>/Chironomus, it is not clear whether only nuclei shifted their position or whether cell ingression has started. Multiple stages together with a time scale should be presented to describe the dynamics of the process. Much of this is shown in Figure Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>15) This paper contains analysis of a large quantity of quantitative data. Supply of underlying data would be useful for verification of their findings and may be of use to other researchers undertaking related studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18318.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The paper deals with the molecular mechanisms contributing to the evolution of mesoderm internalization in insects.

There is only one point (9) in which an additional experiment was suggested.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the helpful and supportive comments provided by the reviewers, and we feel they have improved the manuscript substantially. Specific changes in the manuscript have been indicated wherever possible, with the Discussion being an exception: based on the comments, we felt that a restructured Discussion would better be able to address the issues raised and, overall, improve readability. Likewise, the first two figures have been substantially reorganized and now include most of the data that has been previously placed in the supplements.</p><p><italic>1) The title should be more specific. The topic is mesoderm internalization and not gastrulation. The term genetic switch is misleading and in the context of the paper not appropriate.</italic> </p><p>We have changed the title to be more specific. It now reads: “Fog and t48 drive the evolution of coordinated mesoderm internalization in flies”.</p><p><italic>2) Several terms are used for the process and types of mesoderm internalization, e. g. stochastic translocation, stochastic cell migration, stochastic cell internalization, stochastic migration of individual cells, cell ingression, single cell migration, stochastic internalization. We suggest authors use internalization as a general term, ingression for Chironomous, and invagination for Drosophila.</italic> </p><p>We welcome the suggestion and adopted a more coherent terminology. The terms internalization, ingression, and invagination are now introduced in the context of fly mesoderm formation: “… we have studied the evolutionary transition between two distinct modes of cell internalization during fly gastrulation, i.e. mesoderm invagination in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and mesoderm ingression in the midge <italic>Chironomus riparius</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>)”. Either term is defined by example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and then used to describe the morphogenetic processes in <italic>C.riparius</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> throughout the remaining text.</p><p><italic>3) Mesoderm invagination is based on cell shape changes and cell movement. The authors analyzed fixed embryos stained for F-actin and DNA. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, the authors present data that are supposed to show that nuclear position is a good proxy for cell position. This is convincing in the example they present, but we would like to see examples for both C.riparius and D.melanogaster, and at a time when mesoderm internalization is more progressed. It is important to demonstrate that this way of measuring cell position holds for the full range of samples analyzed.</italic> </p><p>Following this suggestion, we have added additional data and changed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> as follows: panel A and B now contain a representative transversal section each of C.riparius and D.<italic>melanogaster</italic> embryos during the progression of mesoderm internalization; panel C depicts nuclei and cell outlines of the internalizing mesoderm cells based on DNA and F-actin stain. For both stainings, we have determined the cell center (centroids) and calculated the deviation between the two methods. Panel D shows that, for the analysis of whole embryos, the deviation of the two methods is less than 10% of cell height for almost all internalizing cells (97% in C.riparius; 90% in D.<italic>melanogaster</italic>).</p><p><italic>4) The Principal Component Analysis does not seem to be mentioned in the methods and generally needs more explanation. Do any statistical methods underlie the assertions that the 2 species separate most sensitively along epithelial integrity, or is this based on interpretation of the graph? Some details of this in the main text would be helpful.</italic> </p><p>A more detailed description of the principal component analysis has been added to the methods. Following main point #14, the analysis is now fully integrated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and the interpretation of the graphs has been integrated in the main text. The relevant section now reads (p3, final paragaph): “To address the extent to which each individual parameter contributed to the global differences in <italic>C.riparius</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> mesoderm formation and detect biases in the analysis, we performed a principal component analysis of all the sections and parameters. We found three principal parameters that, regardless of intra-species variation in space and time, permitted the best discrimination between ingression and invagination: cell internalization, the depth of the ventral furrow and epithelial integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F-F’’’</xref>). Accordingly, invagination in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> was characterized by high tissue integrity, a deep ventral furrow, and a high number of internalized cells, while ingression in <italic>C.riparius</italic> was characterized by low tissue integrity, a shallow ventral furrow, and a lower number of internalized cells. The number of internalized cells as well as the depth of the ventral furrow may be in part depended on the size of the mesoderm anlage and thus contain a species-specific component, whereas integrity was independent of the size of the mesoderm anlage.”</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> it would be nice to see statistics showing where differences are significant.</italic> </p><p>Statistics were added throughout all analyses to indicate where differences are significant.</p><p><italic>6) In all RNAi experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) it would be nice to see statistics showing where differences are significant.</italic> </p><p>See also response to comment 5: statistics were added throughout all analyses to indicate where differences are significant.</p><p><italic>7) Results section – twi RNAi: &quot;[…]internalization of cells outside the ventral midline[…]&quot;. This is not like Drosophila (as the authors claim) and suggests some non-autonomous effects, which spread from the mesodermal region to neuroectoderm and are suppressed in the presence of Cr-twi.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this passage in which we were using “ventral midline” in a poorly defined manner. We have revised the sentence, which now reads (p.4): “The knockdown of <italic>Cri-twi</italic> by RNAi resulted in embryos that lacked a visible ventral groove. Despite the <italic>Cri-twi knockdown</italic>, nuclei of internalized cells could still be observed within the ventral-most 10-15% of the embryonic circumference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), which corresponded to a slightly narrower domain than that of wildtype <italic>Cri-twist</italic> expression.”</p><p><italic>8) Results section – maternal loading: While for Dm-fog a weak maternal contribution has been functionally demonstrated (Zusman and Wieschaus, 1985), we are not aware of a maternal contribution for t48. However, even if this were the case for t48, the main function for both fog and t48 is derived from the zygotic ventrally localized expression in Drosophila. The genetics are very clear!</italic> </p><p>The suggested citation for the functional maternal contribution of fog (Zusman and Wieschaus, 1985) has been added in the Results section and the Discussion section. In the Discussion, we emphasize the weak functional contribution of the maternal fog transcript as follows:”… so far only a weak maternal contribution has been functionally demonstrated for <italic>fog</italic> (Zusman and Wieschaus, 1985), and the main function of both genes [fog and t48] in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> mesoderm invagination is derived from their zygotic, twist-dependent ventral expression (Costa et al., 1994; Kölsch et al., 2007).”</p><p>Early ubiquitous expression of t48 prior to blastoderm stages has been first reported by Strutt, D. I. and White, R. A. (1994). Mech Dev 46, 27–39. The citation is included at the same place as the citation of Zusman and Wieschaus (1985). In addition, we have provided modENCODE RNAseq data from flybase and stainings of early ubiquitous expression of <italic>t48</italic> and <italic>fog</italic> by whole mount in situ hybridization in the figure supplement of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). All data support a maternal contribution of <italic>t48</italic> in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>.</p><p><italic>9) Results section – Expression of Cr-fog2 and Cr-mist: It is rather astonishing that a fog paralog and the receptor mist are expressed ventrally prior to gastrulation. Indeed KD of fog2 seems to have a weak effect on mesoderm internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Are the authors sure the RNAi knockdown of these genes is working? Ideally, the authors should perform RT-PCR demonstrating a significant knockdown, which is important for the assertion the fog signalling pathway does not play a role in gastrulation in wildtype C.riparius</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for emphasizing the need to coherently outline our line of thoughts. It was not our intention to make a strong statement that knockdown of <italic>Cri-fog2</italic> or <italic>Cri-mist</italic> does not play any role in wildtype C.riparius gastrulation. We have and still do speculate in the Discussion that they may play a role: “… that mesoderm ingression as a mode of cell internalization is based on comparatively low-level RhoGEF2 activity. This low level of RhoGEF2 activity may be invoked by scattered expression of the ligand Fog, or, as has been suggested before, by low-frequency self-activation of Mist.”</p><p>However, the role of <italic>Cri-mist</italic> and <italic>Cri-fog2</italic> appears to be less prominent than in D.<italic>melanogaster</italic>. This interpretation is supported by the very weak effects we are seeing, e.g. after fog2 knockdown experiments, for which we added controls by qPCR (see methods and legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The corresponding section now reads: “[…] visual inspection of embryos after RNAi knockdown of either gene, […] provided evidence for just a weak phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Following the quantitative analysis, we found that the median cell internalization and furrow depth differed in <italic>Cri-mist</italic> RNAi embryos from water injected embryos. In <italic>Cri-fog2</italic> RNAi embryos, the difference was smaller and significant only for an increase in furrow and maximal cell depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).”</p><p><italic>10) In the last part of the study, the authors would like to address the question whether epithelial infolding would make mesoderm invagination more robust than by cell ingression. For this they apply wounds by microinjection and assay developmental variation. This is done in normal and &quot;rescued&quot; Chironomus embryos. We do not find the assay robust and the data convincing as the read-out of the assay is not clearly defined. In our view this experiment could be removed entirely without affecting the strength of the study.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the text could be improved by additional information that defines the read-out of the assay and thus allows to evaluate its robustness. We have provided this information by extending <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, which in its panel A now describes for two selected embryos how variation in mesoderm formation has been quantified. The technical details are outlined in the corresponding section in the Material and methods section. In our view, the assay is robust and provides informative results for the study because it points to potential advantages which the innovation of mesoderm invagination could have had during the course of fly evolution.</p><p><italic>11) Discussion and conclusion section – Gain of a maternal enhancer for fog and t48: Since it is very clear that the contribution of fog and t48 to gastrulation in Drosophila depends on their ventral zygotic expression we do not believe that the gain of maternal enhancers was the crucial evolutionary change. It is rather surprising that the Chironomus injections of t48 and fog mRNA showed such specific effects and did not result in pleiotropic morphogenetic defects. Regarding the injection experiments we think you should use a term like 'ubiquitous ecotopic expression' rather than mimicking maternal loading.</italic> </p><p>We followed the suggestion of the reviewers and used ‘ubiquitous expression’ instead of ‘mimicking maternal loading’. The result that Chironomus injections of t48 and fog mRNA showed specific effects and did not result in pleiotropic morphogenetic defects is now discussed in detail in the second and third paragraph of the Discussion. The genetic changes that would be required for the putative transition from an ancestral, Chironomus-like mode of mesoderm ingression to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mode of mesoderm invagination are also discussed in detail in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>12) In reference to the Discussion, I am not convinced there is sufficient evidence to claim that RhoGEF2 activation normally occurs at low levels in C.riparius, though expression patterns of cta and mist might be suggestive if this. For such a claim to be tested further knockdown experiments would be required. The alternative that in wildtype C.riparius mesoderm internalisation could be controlled by a separate pathway, but that it is competent to response to ectopic fog and T48 should also be discussed.</italic> </p><p>Following the suggestion of the reviewers, we have specified our thoughts on low-level RhoGEF2 activity in C.riparius as speculation: “Based on the expression of Cri-cta and Cri-mist and the induction of mesoderm invagination through ectopic fog and t48, we speculate that […]”. The alternative that in wildtype C.riparius mesoderm internalisation could be controlled by a separate pathway is now discussed: “[…] Recent work has shown that ancestral modes of gastrulation can be built upon a gene repertoire that is in part distinct from the network known in D.<italic>melanogaster</italic>, and the local response to ubiquitous fog and t48 activity in C.riparius embryos may thus be elicited by an unknown fog/t48 sensitive pathway under control of twist and/or snail. […]”</p><p><italic>13) The authors propose that the ingression mode of Chironomus is the evolutionary older mode and that the epithelial infolding mode has emerged later in evolution by gain of T48 and Fog expression in the mesoderm anlage. This model is not fully consistent with the situation on the genetic level. T48 and Fog genes are present in both species. No arguments are presented that would address the directionality, whether Drosophila has gained the expression or whether Chironomus has lost the expression of T48/Fog in the mesoderm anlage. The argumentation that Chironomus has lost the expression of T48 and Fog in the mesoderm anlage is equally valid. The authors should at least discuss the alternative model that the ingression mode in Chironomus is derived from an epithelial infolding by loss of Fog and T48 expression.</italic></p><p>We welcome the suggestion of the reviewers and discuss alternative directions of genetic changes in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>14) The manuscript contains nine supplemental figures. The authors should incorporate most if not all of the supplemental data into the main body of the manuscript. For example, the manuscript should start with a comparative description of mesoderm invagination in Drosophila and Chironomus that also defines the staging that is used furtheron in the study. The current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is not sufficient for such a presentation, as the staging is not clear and no cells are shown. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>/Chironomus, it is not clear whether only nuclei shifted their position or whether cell ingression has started. Multiple stages together with a time scale should be presented to describe the dynamics of the process. Much of this is shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</italic> </p><p>We followed the suggestion by the reviewers and have incorporated most supplemental figures in the main text. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> has been specifically modified to contain a comparative description of mesoderm internalization in Drosophila and Chironomus, the introduction of nuclei as reliable measure for cell position, as well as the staging scheme to orient the reader with respect to the relative timing of events.</p><p><italic>15) This paper contains analysis of a large quantity of quantitative data. Supply of underlying data would be useful for verification of their findings and may be of use to other researchers undertaking related studies.</italic> </p><p>We have provided the quantitative data underlying our analysis for each treatment and embryo in the appendix. For each category (Cri wt, Dme wt, Cri+H20, etc) we provide one text file containing the x,y,z coordinates, distance to cellular surface (d_cell) and distance to ventral surface (d_ventral) for all nuclei within the analyzed region of interest.</p></body></sub-article></article>
