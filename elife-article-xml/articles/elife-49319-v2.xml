Current techniques are limited to post hoc analyses of fixed tissues. Here we developed a fluorescent probe, naltrexamine-acylimidazole (NAI), to label opioid receptors based on a chemical approach termed ‘traceless affinity labeling’. In this approach, a high affinity antagonist naltrexamine is used as the guide molecule for a transferring reaction of acylimidazole at the receptor. This reaction generates a fluorescent dye covalently linked to the receptor while naltrexamine is liberated and leaves the binding site. The labeling induced by this reagent allowed visualization of opioid-sensitive neurons in rat and mouse brains without loss of function of the fluorescently labeled receptors. The ability to locate endogenous receptors in living tissues will aid considerably in establishing the distribution and physiological role of opioid receptors in the CNS of wild type animals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>wildtype</kwd><kwd>endogenous</kwd><kwd>opioid receptors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA008163</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>John T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA048136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arttamangkul</surname><given-names>Seksiri</given-names></name><name><surname>Farrens</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>John T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA042779</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Birdsong</surname><given-names>William T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Opioid sensitive neurons were identified using a traceless affinity labeling strategy to covalently label endogenous mu-opioid receptors with fluorescent compounds in living brain slices from wild type animals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the discovery of receptors for opiate drugs in early 1970 s, studies have focused on opioid actions in normal physiological and pathological conditions. Through pharmacological and cloning experiments, three opioid receptor subtypes: μ (MOR), δ (DOR) and κ (KOR) have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kieffer and Evans, 2009</xref>). These receptors are found throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems with unique distributions for each subtype. To date, the methods used for identifying these receptors in brain slices have relied on immunohistochemistry or genetically modified receptors. Fluorescent ligands based on opioid peptides and opiate alkaloids have been developed and used to visualize the receptors of cultured cells. Unfortunately, the use of these small-molecule ligands is often limited by the decrease in affinity and selectivity that results from the addition of a fluorescent molecule that is equivalent to or larger in size than the opioid ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Archer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaudriault et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Madsen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arttamangkul et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lam et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, these fluorescent ligands possess pharmacological actions and bind reversibly to the receptors, thus making them less useful for labeling receptors that later on will be studied for biological activity. Accordingly, a new strategy for long-lasting labeling of receptors without altering naïve receptor functions is desirable.</p><p>Affinity labeling has been a very useful technique to chemically link target-molecules to specific proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takemori and Portoghese, 1985</xref>). During the past decade, Hamachi and colleagues have developed a chemical method termed, ‘traceless affinity labeling’ to covalently tag a fluorescent dye to the protein of interest with the use of ligand guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayashi and Hamachi, 2012</xref>). The key advantage of this approach is that once the labeling reaction occurs, the guide ligand is free to dissociate while leaving the fluorescent probe covalently attached to the protein. In practice, a high affinity ligand is used to direct probe binding and ensure the labeling occurs near the ligand binding site. The close proximity between the ligand binding pocket and the reactive sites effectively increases the concentration of the reactive groups, enabling a probe of mild reactivity to be used. Because of the high affinity ligand guide, specific labeling can be obtained with low concentrations thus minimizing non-specific background reactions. Several of these ligand-directed molecules have been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tamura and Hamachi, 2019</xref>). Among them, the reactive probe of electrophilic acylimidazole (AI) has been shown to label a number of membrane-bound proteins, including folate, AMPA and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujishima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamaura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wakayama et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49319.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The chemistry of fluorescent naltrexamine-acylimidazole (NAI).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic showing the steps in fluorescent dye attachment to the opioid receptor via ligand-directed acylimidazole chemistry.

Fluorescent dyes were then linked to the naltrexamine-acylimidazole (NAI) parent compound via click chemistry. This small molecule was able to penetrate and label receptors deep within living brain slices. The labeling was stable following wash or application of naloxone. Fluorescently labeled endogenous receptors were observed in the locus coeruleus and several other areas in living brain slices from both rats and mice. Importantly, following the labeling process, the labeled neurons remained responsive to agonists.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synthesis of fluorescent naltrexamine-acylimidazole</title><p>The fluorescent naltrexamine-acylimidazole was designed based upon the crystal structure of β-funaltrexamine (β-FNA) bound MOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manglik et al., 2012</xref>). The key covalent attachment of β-FNA at K233 side-chain was purposely avoided. The linker for NAI was designed to be longer than that for β-FNA and was predicted to chemically modify nucleophilic side chains of amino acids on the extracellular loops 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The compound was made in two steps. First, naltrexamine-acylimidazole alkyne (NAI-AK) was synthesized. The β-epimer of naltrexamine was stereospecifically derived from a non-selective opioid antagonist naltrexone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sayre and Portoghese, 1980</xref>). Acylimidazole was incorporated into the naltrexamine to produce a proper linker and a terminal alkyne (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The second part of the synthesis was designed for coupling an azide probe to NAI-AK via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition known as click chemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tornøe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rostovtsev et al., 2002</xref>). The click reaction was optimized to be in slightly acidic conditions (pH≈4) to prevent hydrolysis of the acylimidazole linker. Incorporation of Alexa 594 azide to NAI-AK gave NAI-A594 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) with a good yield and high purity following high performance liquid chromatography.

Persistent labeling of FKOR was negligible.</p><p>Next, flow cytometry was used to confirm in FMOR cells that NAI-A594 efficiently labels the receptors. The average fluorescence intensity of cells labeled with NAI-A594 (100 nM, 1 hr at 37°C) was similar to antibody labeling using M1-A594 despite the fact that antibodies had an average four dye molecules per protein. Application of naloxone (10 µM) decreased the average fluorescence intensity by 30%, suggesting that there was a reversible component of NAI-594 labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). When naloxone was co-incubated during the labeling of NAI-A594 (100 nM), the average fluorescence intensity was reduced to only 2% of the NAI-A594 treatment alone, indicating that non-specific staining was negligible.</p><p>Under the same conditions the fluorescence intensity of cells labeled with the non-covalently labeling probe NTX-A594 (100 nM) was examined. The fluorescence intensity was only 40% of that with NAI-A594 and was further reduced with the application of naloxone. As the concentration of NAI-A594 increased, the fluorescence labeling also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Biochemical experiments were also carried out to verify that the dye moiety was in fact irreversibly bound to the receptors. In one set of experiments, NAI-A488 was synthesized, and used to label cells for subsequent immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In brief, FMOR cells were incubated with NAI-A488 (100 nM) in the absence (lane 4) and presence of naloxone (lane 3). Unlabeled FMOR cells (lane 2) and HEK293 cells not expressing FMOR (lane 1) were also included in the assays. Next, cell extracts were prepared and FMOR was immunoprecipitated using a rabbit anti-MOR antibody (UMB3) followed by western blotting with either rabbit anti-A488 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left gel) or anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal (M1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right gel). Immunoblotting with anti-A488 detected a ~ 75 kDa band of FMOR only in cells labeled with NAI-A488 in the absence of naloxone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left gel, lane 4), indicating that A488 was irreversibly bound to FMOR. In contrast, the anti-FLAG antibody detected FMOR in all treatment conditions except the control HEK293 cells, verifying that FMOR was present in unlabeled as well as labeled cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right gel, lanes 2–4). Nonspecific bands near 35 and 100 kDa were observed in every sample including the control HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 1–4 of left and right panels). The fluorescence spectra of the cell extracts used in this experiment confirmed the results from the immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis and displayed maximal emission at 517 nm, characteristic of A488 dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Fluorometry also confirmed that labeling of cells with NAI-A594 was FMOR-specific, and the emission maximum of 615 nm was consistent with the A594 fluorophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>The NAI compound was also used to directly label purified receptors. In this experiment, the purified FMOR (0.75 μM) was incubated with NAI-A488 (4.7 μM) at room temperature in the presence or absence of naloxone (100 μM). Aliquots were removed at 0, 4, 24, 48, and 96 hr and denatured by addition of SDS-sample buffer. Analysis of in-gel fluorescence showed that the attachment of A488 to receptors increased with time and reached maximal intensity after 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). No significant fluorescence was found in preparations co-incubated with naloxone, indicating that this labeling was specific to FMOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Agonist-induced internalization of receptor could also be followed in cells that were treated with NAI-A594. FMORs labeled with NAI-A594 were found co-localized with M1-A488 in the cytoplasm after [Met<sup>5</sup>]enkephalin (ME) application, indicating that the A594 labeled receptors could bind agonist, internalize, and be visualized in the endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,a–d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Labeling endogenous receptors in brain slices</title><p>Several brain areas were selected to evaluate NAI-A594 labeling of receptors on living neurons from rats and mice, as discussed below.</p><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Locus Coeruleus</title><p>Locus coeruleus (LC) neurons were first selected to test the labeling efficiency and functionality of the receptors after labeling.

Incubation times from 0.5 to 2 hr showed an increase in staining.

To examine the function of the neurons following a typical labeling procedure, whole cell recordings were done with LC slices from wild type rats that had been incubated with NAI-A594 (30 nM, 1 hr). In these experiments, the EC<sub>50</sub> concentration of ME (300 nM), caused an outward current that was approximately 50% of the current induced by ME at a saturating concentration, 30 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–a</xref>). Labeled LC neurons were also responsive to the α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist, UK14304 (3 μM). There was no difference in the amplitude of currents induced by ME between labeled neurons and untreated cells in wild type rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Osborne and Williams, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Levitt and Williams, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arttamangkul et al., 2018</xref>). Following these experiments, a post hoc analysis of living neurons was evaluated. In each case recorded cell were filled with Alexa 488 during the whole-cell experiment and later imaged using 2-photon microscopy. The A594-labeled MORs were present on the Alexa488-filled neurons. Other nearby LC neurons and dendrites were also labeled with NAI-A594 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–c,d</xref>). Thus incubation with a low concentration of NAI-A594 did not affect the concentration response to opioid agonists. When NAI-A594 was used to identify MOR containing neurons in the paraventricular of thalamus areas, all positive staining neurons showed GIRK activation after ME application (n = 4 of 2 slices, data not shown). The results support the advantage of using NAI-A594 to find neurons of interest in mixed populations.</p><p>The potential use of NAI-A594 to follow endogenous MOR internalization in brain slices was also studied. NAI-A594 (30 or 100 nM) was incubated in slices of rat LC for 1 hr. Following ME application, the fluorescence of NAI-A594 labeled receptors decreased along the plasma membrane and there were no clear fluorescent puncta in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–a,a’</xref>). To increase the labeling efficiency, LC slices were incubated with high concentrations of NAI-A594 (300 nM or 1 μM) for 2 hr. In this condition, agonist-induced receptor internalization was also not observed. To examine whether the labeling of NAI-A594 might interfere with MOR internalization, LC neurons containing FMOR from transgenic mice were used in the next experiments. Co-labeling with M1-A488 and NAI-A594, revealed fluorescence of both dyes on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–b,c</xref>). After ME application, fluorescent puncta of M1-A488 were found in the cytoplasm and clearly observed in the dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–c,c’</xref>). Similar to the results obtained from the rat LC neurons, the fluorescence of NAI-A594 along the plasma membrane decreased without the appearance of fluorescent puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–b,b’</xref>). The results indicated that while A594-linked receptors were not observed in the endosomes of LC neurons, NAI-A594 labeling did not disrupt the internalization of FMORs labeled with M1-A488.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current study describes a new fluorescent labeling strategy to identify endogenous opioid receptors in living brain tissue. The fluorescent naltrexamine-acylimidazole (NAI) offers a valuable tool for the simultaneous investigation of opioid receptor localization and function. NAI-A594 selectively labeled MORs in brain slices that were visualized with multiple imaging methods. The ability to identify neurons expressing endogenous MORs in living brain slices from wild type rats and mice highlights the benefit of this reagent for a wide array of investigations that will advance the understanding of the opioid system.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Chemical labeling of MORs</title><p>This study shows that NAI-A594 can be used in low nanomolar concentrations to label endogenous MORs, thus providing the advantage of negligible non-specific background fluorescence and the absence of residual antagonism of NAI-A594 and its product. Incubation times of live brain slices can be varied from minutes to hours at near physiological temperatures. It should be noted that an application of NAI-A594 at a high concentration of 500 nM took only 5 min to stain MORs of LC and PB neurons in the brain slice thus indicating that NAI-A594 can efficiently label endogenous MOR. The weak biological antagonism of NAI-A594 suggests that the compound itself has a low affinity as shown in the binding assays and can be competitively displaced by opioid agonists. Labeling brain slices using low concentrations of NAI-A594 or NAI-A488 can be achieved within an hour. Interestingly, the labeling of purified receptors with NAI-A488 was slower when compared to the labeling of receptors on the living cells. One possible factor is the incubation temperature, which is done at room temperature to stabilize the purified receptors. In addition, the purified receptors may not as frequently form proper conformations for β-naltrexamine to bind and efficiently guide the reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>NAI-A594 labels MOR in brain slices</title><p>Here we demonstrate that NAI-A594 primarily and covalently labels MOR on neurons in brain slices. This is unexpected given that naltrexamine binds to all three opioid subtypes at low nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2009</xref>). The design of NAI to have a long linker between the acylimidazole and the amine of naltrexamine (10 atoms apart) was expected to transfer the fluorophore to distant amino acids away from the binding sites. The side chains of Ser, Thr, Tyr or Lys on the second (EL2) or third (EL3) extracellular loops of the receptor are hypothetical sites for modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The ability of fluorescent NAI to predominantly modify MOR likely relies on several factors, including the availability of reactive amino acid side chains and affinity of fluorescent NAI for the different opioid receptors. For example, MOR has 12 amino acids that are potentially capable of reacting with fluorescent NAI, while KOR has 8 and DOR only 3. The paucity of available reactive amino acids in DOR may be one factor contributing to lack of A594 modification in brain slices, despite similar affinities of NAI-A594 for MOR and DOR. Conversely, KOR may have more potential modification sites compared to DOR, but has the lowest affinity for NAI-A594 compared to MOR and DOR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The selectivity of NAI-A594 for MOR over DOR in brain slice experiments contrasts with the experiments in HEK293 cells where the labeling of FMOR and FDOR were comparable. It is possible that the density of DOR on the plasma membrane in vivo is lower compared to MOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2008</xref> and references therein). Importantly, the Flag epitope-tagged receptors used in the HEK cells contains a signal peptide to enhance endoplasmic reticulum membrane insertion and plasma membrane expression. The development of compound that is capable of labeling intracellular receptors will be advantage. Changing the fluorescent dye from a hydrophilic and charged Alexa series to one that is smaller and not charged may increase membrane permeability of NAI compounds.</p><p>The labeling of MORs with NAI is different from the genetically expressed DOR-GFP and MOR-RFP in knockin mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scherrer et al., 2006</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erbs et al., 2015</xref>). Of course the genetically expressed receptors are found both on the plasma membrane and within the cytoplasm in various states of development. Labeling of receptors with NAI-A594 is only plasma membrane associated. The primary advantage of the NAI-A594 is that it is also working with other species particularly rats. The ability to study endogenous receptors in wild type animals of any species offers studies that were otherwise limited to post hoc analysis with antibody labeling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The labeled neurons are functional</title><p>One key characteristic for a traceless chemical label is that the receptor function is not altered. We confirmed that NAI-A594 was an antagonist at MOR. Pre-application of NAI-A594 (500 nM) decreased receptor activation by nearly half while there was less than 10% inhibition by NAI-A594 at lower concentrations (30–100 nM, data not shown). Like other fluorescent small-molecule ligands, the weak antagonism of NAI-A594 is probably due to the bulkiness of Alexa594 moiety because NAI-AK, the reactive probe without the dye could significantly block MOR activation when used at 300 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The low antagonism of NAI-A594 is advantageous particularly when only 30–100 nM of NAI-A594 is sufficient for labeling the receptors. In this case, the antagonistic property of NAI-A594 will be minimal and the residual of NAI-A594 or the liberated-naltrexamine product will be removed in a short time. Consistent with this idea, LC neurons labeled with NAI-A594 are able to activate GIRK in response to ME.</p><p>In addition to GIRK activation, further evidence that the labeled MOR receptors are functional comes from the agonist-induced internalization studies. Intracellular A594-puncta were observed upon exposure to ME in HEK293 cells expressing FMORs double labeled with M1-488 and NAI-A594 thus indicating that A594-labeled MORs can internalize in response to agonists. Interestingly, when similar internalization experiments are performed on M1-A488/A594 labeled MORs in LC slices, internalized signals appear only from M1-A488. In contrast, there is a noticeable decrease in A594 fluorescence signal on the plasma membrane. A quenching phenomenon of A594 in the acidic environment of endosomes can be ruled out because the fluorescence of A594 is pH insensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Panchuk-Voloshina et al., 1999</xref>). Surprisingly, similar decline in fluorescence intensities of 30–40% was observed when either ME, morphine or naloxone were applied onto the labeled LC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Because morphine is a non-internalizing agonist and naloxone is an antagonist, the results suggest that the decrease of A594 fluorescence probably occurs on the plasma membrane. This portion of labeling is competitive as also shown in HEK293 cells. Flow cytometry results also showed that a portion of labeling was displaced by naloxone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The competitive labeling occurs when NAI-A594 occupies the binding site even on receptors that have been previously covalently linked with the fluorescent ligand.</p><p>Another potential explanation for the fluorescence decrease may be due to a quenching event caused by nearby amino acids such as tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine and methionine as a result from receptor-conformation change after drug application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mansoor et al., 2010</xref>). However this phenomenon is expected to be reversible after washing out of the drugs but the decrease in fluorescence observed experimentally was not. The decrease in fluorescence intensity after application of drugs might limit visualization of A-594 labeled receptors in the endosomes. In addition, many neurons often show autofluorescence at the excitation wavelengths suitable for A488 and A594, thus further obscuring the detection of low fluorescence of A594 labeled receptors in the endosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The selectivity of NAI-A594 for the MOR makes this reagent a valuable tool to study the functionality and circuitry of MORs in many brain areas. The ‘traceless affinity labeling’ introduced by Hamachi and his colleague is applicable for many membrane proteins including G protein-coupled receptors as shown in this study. The advantage of this ligand-guided labeling is the ability to detect endogenous receptors in living slices. The labeling process is very simple and can be done in any buffer, at room or physiological temperatures and over reasonable time course.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain (mouse, C57BL/6J)</td><td>wildtype</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>Stock # 000664 <break/>RRID: <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">000664</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (rat, Sprague Dawley)</td><td>wildtype</td><td>Charles River Laboratories</td><td>Stock # 001 <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD_734476">RGD_734476</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (mouse)</td><td>C57BL/6J (THGFP)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sawamoto et al., 2001</xref></td><td>N/A</td><td>Dr. Kazuto Kobayashi, Fukushima Medical University</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (mouse)</td><td>C57BL/6J (FLAGMOR)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arttamangkul et al., 2008</xref></td><td>N/A</td><td>Dr. John T.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Visualizing endogenous opioid receptors in living neurons using ligand-directed chemistry&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Peggy Mason as Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher Evans (Reviewer #2); Meritxell Canals (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All agree that this is an exciting step forward. To be able to visualize mu opioid receptors in situ and still functioning is a tool that is likely to be of great use to many. There was some hesitation however because of two major issues.</p><p>First, your ideas on why delta and kappa receptors aren't labeled are plausible but not tested. Value would be added by testing your compound on cell lines transfected with delta and kappa receptors.</p><p>Second reviewer #2 raises important points about the efficacy and mechanism of labeling, particularly given the lack of endosome labeling (as also pointed out by reviewer #3) and the CTOP blockade.</p><p>With these concerns, we discussed whether to send this article back to you (soft reject) for more experiments with the hope of seeing a re-submission at a later time or to ask for revisions, with the expectation that you would possibly alter analyses, include experiments that are on hand, and discuss the caveats identified by the reviewers. We agreed on the latter course because of the novelty and promise of the method. Of course, if you want to add any of the experiments, please do and we will entertain a re-submission when available.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study describes a covalent labeling strategy for opioid receptors using ligand-guided proximity chemistry. Although the guide ligand used is not specific for mu opioid receptors, the authors demonstrate empirically that MOR is primarily labeled and that labeled MORs are functional. The authors also demonstrate that the method is suitable for labeling endogenous MOR in brain slices, and they provide a survey of labeling patterns in selected brain regions. The images are striking and, as the authors note, strong labeling of TH-negative processes in midbrain and VTA regions is particularly intriguing.</p><p>I think that the reagent described is very interesting and the data reported establish utility of the method and appropriately validate specificity. Considering the importance of understanding MOR connectivity in the brain and the relative paucity of methods suitable for detecting endogenous opioid receptors in tissue, I think this is a major advance and worthy of report in its present form. This is a really nice study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper describes the development of a fluorescent ligand-directed probe, naltrexamine-acylimidazole (NAI), that is able to fluorescently tag opioid receptors (appears only Mu receptors with NAI-A594) with subsequent dissociation of the ligand. This results in convincingly fluorescently labeled Mu receptors that can be visualized. This is a technique that could have broad applicability to GPCRs and complement studies with genetically fluorescently-tagged receptors.</p><p>1) NAI should bind to all opioid receptors – and the lack of tagging of delta and kappa has some explanation in the Discussion. However, the reasons given are theoretical and the site of modification on the Mu is currently unknown. Negative tagging data for transfected cell lines with delta and kappa would support the conclusions that delta and kappa cannot be tagged with this reagent. There are potentially other explanations that could modify NAI-A594 opioid receptor labeling in slices.</p><p>2) The fact that the hydrophilic Mu antagonist CTOP blocked the tagging is suggestive that only surface receptors are labeled by this strategy – do the authors have data pertinent regarding membrane permeability of the reagent?</p><p>3) To play devil's advocate one could envisage that Mu function is in fact impaired by the tagging of the receptor and it is homo-dimer driven endocytosis that is suggesting internalization activity. Certainly mu-receptor dragging to internal compartments has been shown to be triggered by activation of other GPCRs. Since 500nM NAI-A594 only blocks a percentage of agonist activity and 30-100nM is used for labeling, the number of tagged receptors may be well below 50%. This leads to the question of efficacy of the tagging and what proportion of the receptors are being tagged in the slices. Can the authors address the extent of receptor modification and possibility of homo-dimer driven endocytosis of NAI-A594-modified receptors if they were dysfunctional?</p><p>4) The NAI is an antagonist that is insensitive to states of the receptor and should label opioid receptors in inactive states (such as surface desensitized) – not clear to me at this point if receptors would be labeled that were targeted for exocytosis or signaling intracellularly. In the Discussion it would have been helpful to have a comparison of benefits and pitfalls of this approach vs. genetically labeling receptors with GFP. Clearly the method has advantages over post-fixing methodologies and maybe more sensitive in comparison to genetic tagging but the pros and cons of the technique should be explicit.</p><p>5) The lack of endosome labeling in the slices after agonist internalization and ligand-induced reduction of fluorescence is bothersome given the robust labeling of internalized receptors in the transfected cell lines. Some of the explanations were not convincing. That morphine and naloxone causes the same loss of surface fluorescence is suggestive of competitive binding and questions the mechanism of labeling in the slices as the same as the cell lines. Optimally this could be resolved before publication.</p><p>6) In Figure 3B the addition of a THGFP alone would help the identification of TH and NAI labeling and whether or not the punctate staining over the cell body is NIA-generated and not blocked by CTAP.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the current manuscript Arttamangkul et al., report the generation of a fluorescent probe that allows for the labelling of endogenous opioid receptors. This is a major advancement in our ability to visualise these receptors in their endogenous settings as it does not rely of fluorescent tags on the receptors (which requires genetic manipulation) or fluorescent ligands, which limit the use of the &quot;labelled&quot; receptor. In addition, the chemistry between the opioid antagonist and the fluorophore is based on click chemistry, making the reaction versatile for different fluorophores that may be useful for different imaging approaches. The authors show how this probe labels endogenous receptors in the LC and other areas of the brain and that it allows visualization deeper into the slice, which is a major advantage over the use of antibodies. Importantly, after labelling, the receptors remain functional, a key feature for future studies.</p><p>Results:</p><p>• First paragraph discusses the synthesis of naltrexamine-acylimidazole – it would be beneficial for the field to describe what a &quot;proper linker&quot; means. How was linker length and structure decided upon?</p><p>• Competitive radioligand binding shows that the probe (NAI-A594) has affinity for MOR, DOR and KOR. However, experiments done in slices show a pretty selective labelling of MOR, that is either absent in MOR KO or displaced by CTAP. The authors suggest that this subtype selectivity may be due to the residues exposed for the nucleofilic attack of the fluorophore being only present at MOR. It would be useful to provide a model of the three receptors' structure to illustrate this point.</p><p>• The internalization data in neurons is intriguing. While a decrease in A594 fluorescence at the plasma membrane is indicative of a reduction of receptor levels at the cell surface, there seems to be no detectable A594 fluorescence in the cytoplasm (where FlagMOR is detected). Moreover, the decrease in fluorescence is also observed after incubation of ligands that do not internalize the receptor. One would think this could be due to a quenching of the fluorophore due to acidic endosomal pH, however, the authors rule this out as A594 is pH insensitive (though a reference needs to be added here). Thus, a few major questions remain to be addressed to explore the full potential of these probes. What does the decrease in fluorescence at the plasma membrane mean? Why does not A594 label receptors in endosomes. Would labelling with A488 or any other fluorophore help address any of these questions? Can an &quot;internalizing&quot; conformation of the receptor be quenching A594?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49319.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) NAI should bind to all opioid receptors – and the lack of tagging of delta and kappa has some explanation in the Discussion.

Experiments using HEK293 expressed FlagMOR, FlagDOR and FlagKOR showed that the labeling of NAI-A594 to FlagDOR was comparable to FlagMOR but was minimal to FlagKOR. We included the results in the manuscript and as the supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). The selectivity toward mu opioid receptors was more apparent with endogenous receptors in brain slices. The results were confirmed with the use of CTAP and were included in the supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The fact that the hydrophilic Mu antagonist CTOP blocked the tagging is suggestive that only surface receptors are labeled by this strategy – do the authors have data pertinent regarding membrane permeability of the reagent?</p></disp-quote><p>NAI-A594 only labels surface receptors. It is reported that opiate alkaloids including naltrexamine are able to penetrate plasma membrane and interact with cytoplasmic receptors (Stoeber et al., 2018). Alexa 594 is hydrophilic and negatively charged due to sulfonation thus once tagged to naltrexamine will decrease plasma membrane permeability. Moreover, acylimidazole reactive group is shown to label only plasma membrane proteins (Tamura and Hamachi, 2019). Generally, low concentrations of NAI-A594 (30 to 100 nM) were used to sufficiently label the receptors. If NAI-A594 can penetrate the plasma membrane, it would take a much longer incubation time to label the receptors. A much higher concentration (10 μM used in Stoeber et al., 2018) would be necessary. The drawback for using fluorescent probes at this high concentration will be the significant non-specific background. Some fluorescent puncta in the cytoplasm of HEK293 may occur due to the high expression of receptors resulting in constitutive internalization. Additionally, we did not observe any cytoplasmic labeling of neurons in brain slices even after more than 2 hours of incubation (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The fluorescent puncta found in LC neurons from THGFP mice was autofluorescence that also appeared in CTAP treated cells. We included the separated GFP and NAI-A594 channels of Figure 3B(d) in the supplement (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) to show these autofluorescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To play devil's advocate one could envisage that Mu function is in fact impaired by the tagging of the receptor and it is homo-dimer driven endocytosis that is suggesting internalization activity.

Longer incubation times increase binding (fluorescence). The increased fluorescence could be interpreted in two ways. One is more receptors have been labeled. It is also possible that more sites on the receptor are tagged. During the incubation the binding pocket becomes available for a new molecule of NAI-A594. The length and flexibility of the linker may result in the labeling of new sites. Fluorescence intensity does not increase after incubating brain slices longer than 2 hours. (left slice in the vial for 3-4 hours give similar staining to 2 hours).</p><p>LC slices have been incubated with NAI-A594 (300 nM and 1 µM) for 2 hours and still did not observe any receptor internalization.</p><p>Increasing the concentration of NAI-A594 to 500 nM (5 min) blocked only a small percent of opioid activity but there was strong labeling following this treatment (see Figure 7). The minimal blockage of NAI-A594 suggested that the compound itself has a low affinity (also suggested in the binding assays) and was competitively displaced by ME.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The NAI is an antagonist that is insensitive to states of the receptor and should label opioid receptors in inactive states (such as surface desensitized) – not clear to me at this point if receptors would be labeled that were targeted for exocytosis or signaling intracellularly.

This has an advantage in identifying the mature receptors with correct folding that are capable of binding to opioid ligands. The GFP tagged receptors report a mixture of functional and non-functional unfolded receptors. We have included this comparison in the Discussion.</p><p>Cons: NAI-A594 cannot be used to label cytoplasmic receptors but other fluorophores that are more lipophilic such as BODIPY dyes which are smaller and non-charged molecules compared to Alexa dyes may be used to help permeabilize into cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The lack of endosome labeling in the slices after agonist internalization and ligand-induced reduction of fluorescence is bothersome given the robust labeling of internalized receptors in the transfected cell lines.

That morphine and naloxone causes the same loss of surface fluorescence is suggestive of competitive binding and questions the mechanism of labeling in the slices as the same as the cell lines. Optimally this could be resolved before publication.</p></disp-quote><p>A portion of labeling is competitive. This was shown in HEK293 cells as well. Flow cytometry results showed that a portion of labeling was displaced by naloxone (Figure 2B). The competitive labeling occurs when NAI-A594 occupies the binding site even on receptors that have been previously covalently linked with the fluorescent ligand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 3B the addition of a THGFP alone would help the identification of TH and NAI labeling and whether or not the punctate staining over the cell body is NIA-generated and not blocked by CTAP.</p></disp-quote><p>Images are now shown separately in a new supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). An explanation of issues associated with autofluorescence is also included in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Results:</p><p>• First paragraph discusses the synthesis of naltrexamine-acylimidazole – it would be beneficial for the field to describe what a &quot;proper linker&quot; means. How was linker length and structure decided upon?</p></disp-quote><p>The design strategy and possible lengths of the linker are now discussed. The design was based upon the crystal structure of β-funaltrexamine (β-FNA) bound MOR. The key covalent attachment of β-FNA at K233 side-chain was purposely avoided. The linker was designed to be longer for NAI compared to β-FNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Competitive radioligand binding shows that the probe (NAI-A594) has affinity for MOR, DOR and KOR. However, experiments done in slices show a pretty selective labelling of MOR, that is either absent in MOR KO or displaced by CTAP. The authors suggest that this subtype selectivity may be due to the residues exposed for the nucleofilic attack of the fluorophore being only present at MOR. It would be useful to provide a model of the three receptors' structure to illustrate this point.</p></disp-quote><p>The speculation is that the longer linker will find nucleophilic side chains of amino acids on extracellular loops, both loops 2 and 3. There are several sites that can be modified, including Ser, Tyr, Thr and Lys. The different of these sites on MOR, DOR and KOR were summarized and presented in the supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The internalization data in neurons is intriguing. While a decrease in A594 fluorescence at the plasma membrane is indicative of a reduction of receptor levels at the cell surface, there seems to be no detectable A594 fluorescence in the cytoplasm (where FlagMOR is detected). Moreover, the decrease in fluorescence is also observed after incubation of ligands that do not internalize the receptor. One would think this could be due to a quenching of the fluorophore due to acidic endosomal pH, however, the authors rule this out as A594 is pH insensitive (though a reference needs to be added here).</p></disp-quote><p>The reference has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thus, a few major questions remain to be addressed to explore the full potential of these probes. What does the decrease in fluorescence at the plasma membrane mean?</p></disp-quote><p>1) The decrease is caused by competitive binding component.</p><p>2) Quenching as a result of conformation change that allow energy transfer between Alexa dye and Trp nearby. We don’t think this is the case because the decrease fluorescence was not reversible after washing the ligand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why does not A594 label receptors in endosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>A594 tagged receptors were clearly found in endosomes after agonist activation in HEK293 cells and primary culture of habenula neurons (Damien Julie, UCSF, personal communication). In brain slices, problems of autofluorescence and the thickness of slices reduce sensitivity of the fluorescence signal such that identification of labeled endosomes has not been possible. It is also possible that MORs in brain slices may recycle faster and rapidly redistribute laterally. Observing endosomes using labeled antibodies is possible, perhaps because each antibody has multiple fluorescent dyes. It could also be possible that the recycling of the antibody labeled receptor is slowed allowing the observation of endosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would labelling with A488 or any other fluorophore help address any of these questions? Can an &quot;internalizing&quot; conformation of the receptor be quenching A594?</p></disp-quote><p>Energy transfer quenching is possible after internalization. Changing to a fluorophore that is not sensitive to this phenomenon would test this hypothesis.</p><p>References:</p><p>Stoeber et al.
