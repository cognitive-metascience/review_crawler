We demonstrate that conditional deletion of the DYT1 dystonia protein torsinA in embryonic progenitors of forebrain cholinergic and GABAergic neurons causes dystonic-like twisting movements that emerge during juvenile CNS maturation. The onset of these movements coincides with selective degeneration of dorsal striatal large cholinergic interneurons (LCI), and surviving LCI exhibit morphological, electrophysiological, and connectivity abnormalities. Consistent with the importance of this LCI pathology, murine dystonic-like movements are reduced significantly with an antimuscarinic agent used clinically, and we identify cholinergic abnormalities in postmortem striatal tissue from DYT1 dystonia patients. These findings demonstrate that dorsal LCI have a unique requirement for torsinA function during striatal maturation, and link abnormalities of these cells to dystonic-like movements in an overtly symptomatic animal model.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08352.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08352.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08352.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Dystonia is disorder of the nervous system that causes people to suffer from abnormal and involuntary twisting movements. These movements are triggered, in part, by irregularities in a part of the brain called the striatum. The most common view among researchers is that dystonia is caused by abnormal activity in an otherwise structurally normal nervous system. But, recent findings indicate that the degeneration of small populations of nerve cells in the brain may be important. The striatum is made up of several different types of nerve cells, but it is poorly understood which of these are affected in dystonia.</p><p>One type of dystonia, which most often occurs in children, is caused by a defect in a protein called torsinA. Pappas et al. have now discovered that deleting the gene for torsinA from particular populations of nerve cells in the brains of mice (including a population in the striatum) causes abnormal twisting movements. Like people with dystonia, these mice developed the abnormal movements as juveniles, and the movements were suppressed with ‘anti-cholinergic’ medications. Pappas et al. then analyzed brain tissue from these mice and revealed that the twisting movements began at the same time that a single type of cell in the striatum—called ‘cholinergic interneurons’—degenerated. Postmortem studies of brain tissue from dystonia patients also revealed abnormalities of these neurons.</p><p>Together these findings challenge the notion that dystonia occurs in a structurally normal nervous system and reveal that cholinergic interneurons in the striatum specifically require torsinA to survive. Following on from this work, the next challenges are to identify what causes the selective loss of cholinergic interneurons, and to investigate how this cell loss affects the activity within the striatum.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08352.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08352.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>dystonia</kwd><kwd>torsinA</kwd><kwd>cholinergic interneuron</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>neurogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1NS077730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dauer</surname><given-names>William T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37EB003320</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Robert T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR000433</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mabrouk</surname><given-names>Omar S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32NS007222</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pappas</surname><given-names>Samuel S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conditional forebrain deletion of <italic>Tor1a</italic> generates a dystonia model with face, construct, and predictive validity, and demonstrates that striatal cholinergic interneurons are selectively vulnerable to loss of the dystonia protein torsinA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary dystonia encompasses a group of sporadic and inherited disorders characterized by disabling involuntary twisting movements. This sole clinical feature of primary dystonia implies selective abnormalities of motor pathways. The absence of an overt neuropathological signature complicates identification of pathogenic brain structures and cell types, and underlies the widely accepted notion that primary dystonia results from abnormal functioning of a structurally intact central nervous system (CNS).</p><p>Several lines of evidence implicate the striatum as the major node of dysfunction in primary dystonia. <italic>Secondary</italic> dystonia–where symptoms result from CNS damage or exogenous pharmacological insult–is linked strongly to striatal (especially putaminal) damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marsden et al., 1985</xref>). Therapeutic benefit from antimuscarinic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burke et al., 1986</xref>) also implicates striatal dysfunction, as striatal cholinergic interneurons play a poorly understood but important role in motor control. Striatal-associated behavioral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carbon et al., 2011</xref>) and functional imaging abnormalities are present in primary dystonia (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pappas et al. (2014)</xref>), and altering basal ganglia output with deep brain stimulation therapy is an effective dystonia treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vidailhet et al., 2013</xref>). Despite this evidence, the key striatal cell type(s) that drive dystonic movements are unknown.</p><p>Studies aimed at defining mechanistic features in primary dystonia primarily use rodent models of DYT1 dystonia, a neurodevelopmental disorder manifesting during childhood, and the most common inherited primary dystonia. DYT1 dystonia is caused by a dominantly inherited mutation of the <italic>TOR1A</italic> gene that impairs function of the encoded protein torsinA. TorsinA is an endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope-localized AAA+ ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ozelius et al., 1997</xref>) implicated in protein quality control and nuclear membrane-localized functions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dauer (2014)</xref>). Heterozygous <italic>Tor1a</italic><sup><italic>ΔE/+</italic></sup> mice (mimicking the human DYT1 genotype) do not exhibit any overt abnormalities, while constitutive <italic>Tor1a</italic> knockout and homozygous ΔE knock-in mice both exhibit perinatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodchild et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tanabe et al., 2012</xref>). Transgenic mice overexpressing wild type or mutant torsinA do not exhibit overt motor abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2005</xref>), but are used to explore striatal electrophysiological abnormalities linked to overexpression of mutant torsinA. These studies demonstrate that in DYT1 mutant transgenics, striatal large cholinergic interneurons (LCI) exhibit a paradoxical response to dopamine D2 receptor agonists that may be involved in abnormalities of corticostriatal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pisani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martella et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sciamanna et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grundmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sciamanna et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2012b</xref>). The relationship of these abnormalities to dystonic movements is unclear, as they occur in rodent models both with and without abnormal movements.</p><p>Conditional deletion of torsinA in single brain regions (e.g., cortex, striatum) or cell types (e.g., cerebellar Purkinje cells, cholinergic neurons) implicated in the disease causes subtle changes in motor function, but no overt abnormal movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yokoi et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sciamanna et al., 2012a</xref>). Overt twisting movements are only observed in DYT1 model mice where torsinA function is impaired in precursor cells giving rise to multiple neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2014</xref>). These results implicate the importance of developmental timing of torsinA loss of function and the potential involvement of multiple dysfunctional cell types in disease pathophysiology. These models exhibit focal neurodegeneration in a discrete set of sensorimotor structures, and together with human subject neuroimaging studies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramdhani and Simonyan (2013)</xref>), raise questions regarding the ‘normal structure, abnormal function’ hypothesis of primary dystonias.</p><p>To further explore this structure-function question as well as the potentially important role for torsinA during the early development of corticostriatal circuitry, we developed a novel mouse model by deleting torsinA with <italic>Dlx5/6-Cre</italic>, which acts in progenitors of forebrain GABAergic and cholinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Monory et al., 2006</xref>). This model exhibits face, construct and predictive validity. These mice are initially normal, but exhibit overt motor deficits as juveniles, coincident with selective loss of striatal LCIs and related electrophysiological abnormalities. Similar to DYT1 patients, the abnormal twisting and clasping movements of these mice are reduced significantly with chronic antimuscarinic administration. Moreover, we identify cholinergic abnormalities in postmortem putamen from DYT1 subjects. These observations are the first to demonstrate the unique vulnerability of a specific striatal cell type to torsinA loss of function, and have important implications for the understanding of disease pathogenesis and the development of targeted therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conditional deletion of TorsinA from forebrain cholinergic and GABAergic neurons causes motor abnormalities during juvenile CNS maturation</title><p>We conditionally deleted <italic>Tor1a</italic> from precursors of forebrain GABAergic and cholinergic neurons by crossing <italic>Dlx5/6-Cre</italic> and <italic>Tor1a</italic> ‘floxed’ mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Monory et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2014</xref>).

We assessed motor function during gait and during tail suspension, when mice vigorously kick their limbs and attempt to attain an upright body posture. Gait analysis was largely unremarkable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Dlx-CKO mice exhibited normal behavior during tail suspension up to 14 days of age, but nearly 100% of the animals developed severe forelimb and hindlimb clasping behaviors beginning at 15–17 days of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This abnormal behavior remained fixed for the duration of the animal's life, to at least 1 year of age (17 out of 18 Dlx-CKO mice clasped during tail suspension at 1 year). A subset of these mutants simultaneously developed severe abnormal twisting of the trunk (∼70% of mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Dlx-CKO mice also developed a defect in the ability to hang from a wire grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, upper panel) that in some cases appeared related to abnormal hindpaw twisting. In contrast, motor learning and gross coordination appeared normal, as assessed by the ability to remain on an accelerating rotarod at 8 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, lower panel). Dlx-CKO mice are also significantly hyperactive in the open field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These observations demonstrate that torsinA loss of function in forebrain GABAergic and cholinergic neurons is sufficient to cause action-induced abnormal twisting movements.

In support of this possibility, current density measurements of evoked responses (evoked response amplitude divided by cell capacitance) were not significantly different at all stimulation intensities (data not shown).

As DYT1 tissue is in very limited supply and in general not of sufficient quality to perform valid quantification of cell numbers, we analyzed whole cell lysates of this tissue for cholinergic (TrkA, VAChT and AChE), GABAergic (GAD67), and dopaminergic (TH) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

This model incorporates several features believed essential for disease pathogenesis, including torsinA loss of function and targeting of forebrain motor circuitry including GABAergic and cholinergic neurons. Similar to the natural history and therapeutic response of the human disease, Dlx-CKO mice develop overt, dystonic-like twisting movements during juvenile CNS maturation that are reduced significantly with antimuscarinic drugs. The onset of abnormal movements coincides with a selective degeneration of striatal LCIs. Dlx-CKO mice are one of a small number of DYT1 mutant mouse models that exhibit overtly abnormal twisting movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2014</xref>), all of which exhibit loss of discrete populations of neurons critical for motor function. Clasping and twisting during tail suspension is observed in models of many neurological diseases, so are unlikely to be equivalent to dystonia. Nevertheless, this abnormal behavior is an overt manifestation of abnormal motor function linked to cell loss in Dlx-CKO and other symptomatic dystonia models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2014</xref>). This is the first demonstration of selective vulnerability of a striatal cell type to torsinA loss of function, findings supported by studies in postmortem putamen from DYT1 dystonia subjects. Our observations add to an emerging literature implicating CNS maturation-related vulnerability of discrete cell types in the pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia, a disease mechanism with potentially important implications for future approaches to therapy.</p><p>The onset and progression of Dlx-CKO motor abnormalities as juveniles, followed by a fixed defect that persists for life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), broadly resembles the progression of DYT1 and other childhood-onset primary dystonias. Abnormal behavior onset and striatal LCI loss in Dlx-CKO mice coincides with the period of striatal circuit maturation when connections are established and projection- and interneurons become physiologically active and mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hattori and McGeer, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tepper et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Sawatari, 2011</xref>). Subjects that carry the DYT1 mutation but do not manifest dystonia by their mid-20's almost invariably remain asymptomatic for life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bressman et al., 2000</xref>). These clinical and experimental observations support a critical role for torsinA during CNS maturation, and suggest that torsinA deficiency during a defined developmental window is a key component of DYT1 pathogenesis.</p><p>Previous torsinA loss-of-function models also demonstrate cell loss restricted to a neurodevelopmental window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2014</xref>). These observations suggest that CNS maturation, synaptogenesis, and associated processes may exert a unique stress on neuronal circuits. TorsinA is a AAA+ protein chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ozelius et al., 1997</xref>) with putative functions in protein quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nery et al., 2011</xref>) regulation of nucleocytoskeletal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerace, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Worman and Gundersen, 2006</xref>), trafficking of membrane-bound proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Torres et al., 2004</xref>), protein secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hewett et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2008</xref>), and nuclear export of large ribonucleoprotein granules during synapse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jokhi et al., 2013</xref>). Periods of synaptogenesis and circuit maturation are therefore periods in which torsinA function may be particularly important. Cell loss and behavior onset during a neurodevelopmental window is consistent with a critical period for torsinA function in CNS development.</p><p>LCIs play an early role in striatal development, which may in part account for the differences observed between Dlx-CKO mice and previous models. LCIs are the first striatal neurons to become post-mitotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phelps et al., 1989</xref>), and cholinergic signaling is believed to have important but poorly understood influences on the development of later-born striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chesselet et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast to our findings using the <italic>Dlx5/6-Cre</italic> transgene, which is active prior to these events (in progenitor cells), <italic>postnatal</italic> conditional deletion of <italic>Tor1a</italic> in cholinergic neurons does not cause overt abnormal movements or changes in striatal LCI number, morphology, and neurochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sciamanna et al., 2012a</xref>). Consistent with an important role for timing of deletion, <italic>germline</italic> heterozygous ΔE <italic>Tor1a</italic> knock-in mice exhibit increased LCI cell body area, though these mutants show no difference in the number of LCIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Song et al., 2013</xref>). Mice may require more marked torsinA loss of function to fully model cholinergic vulnerability, as the heterozygous ΔE <italic>Tor1a</italic> knock-in mice retain considerable torsinA function, and do not exhibit overt abnormal movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tanabe et al., 2012</xref>). It is possible that non-cholinergic neuron populations in Dlx-CKO mice appear morphologically normal but exhibit functional abnormalities. However, conditional deletion of torsinA in MSNs, which constitute 95% of all striatal neurons, does not cause overt abnormal movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yokoi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Current dogma holds that neurodegeneration does not occur in primary dystonia, but postmortem samples from DYT1 subjects are limited and have not been assessed quantitatively for abnormalities in the number of striatal neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paudel et al., 2012</xref>). Neuroimaging studies increasingly point to changes potentially consistent with cell loss (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramdhani and Simonyan (2013)</xref>). Our studies in postmortem striatum from DYT1 subjects, the first to examine cell type-specific markers in this context, are consistent with our experimental findings pointing to selective cholinergic defect in this structure. Previous work in overtly symptomatic DYT1 models demonstrates loss of discrete cell types in other motor-related structures (e.g., loss of neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei, with preservation of all other cerebellar cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2014</xref>). Our analysis of postmortem tissue was restricted to the striatum; future work is required to determine whether there is cell loss in extra-striatal areas corresponding to those identified in murine models. Postmortem analyses of DYT1 subjects suggests the presence of inclusion bodies in pedunculopontine cholinergic neurons, but did not report cell loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McNaught et al., 2004</xref>). These observations, and additional work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2014</xref>) and reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dauer (2014)</xref>, suggest that abnormal protein quality control may represent a pathogenic event in DYT1 dystonia.</p><p>Several lines of evidence are consistent with a potentially causal connection between LCI loss or dysfunction and abnormal twisting movements. Unilateral immunotoxin-mediated striatal cholinergic ablation causes ‘asymmetric concaving postures’ in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaneko et al., 2000</xref>) and LCI ablation also reduces the threshold for the development of motor tics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). LCIs are lost in a perinatal hypoxia-ischemia model of cerebral palsy-associated dystonia, mimicking the striatal pathology seen in that disease (‘status marmoratus’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke and Karanas, 1990</xref>), which is also treated with anticholinergic drugs. Furthermore, imaging studies of idiopathic cervical dystonia subjects suggest deficits in the density of striatal cholinergic axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1a">Albin et al., 2003</xref>). LCIs innervate fast-spiking interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koos and Tepper, 2002</xref>), a cell type concentrated in the lateral striatal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berke, 2011</xref>) where LCI loss is greatest in Dlx-CKO mice. Fast-spiking interneurons contribute to action execution and suppression of unwanted movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gage et al., 2010</xref>), and have been implicated in dystonic-like postures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gittis et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Previous reports of DYT1 rodent models support a role between torsinA loss of function and aberrant physiological properties of LCIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eskow Jaunarajs et al., 2015</xref>), but these models do not exhibit abnormal twisting movements or cell loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pisani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martella et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quartarone and Pisani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sciamanna et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2012b</xref>). Abnormal clasping is present in a transgenic rat model of dystonia, but it is not known if striatal LCI number is reduced in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grundmann et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of cholinergic neurons may be required for the remaining cells to become interconnected into an abnormal circuit. Recordings in striatal slices performed after maximal cell loss in Dlx-CKO mice demonstrate that surviving LCIs develop a complex set of intrinsic membrane and synaptic alterations. Dlx-CKO LCIs are less excitable when depolarized by intracellular current injections, yet display significantly larger evoked EPSCs, potentially reflecting increased excitatory synapses on the surviving (larger) neurons. Dlx-CKO LCIs also receive significantly enhanced inhibitory synaptic that could lead to aberrant firing when cells are challenged, as we have demonstrated in a related movement disorder, Huntington's chorea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holley et al., 2015</xref>). These multiple disturbances of surviving LCIs function raise the possibility that the beneficial effect of anticholinergic agents may in part arise from suppressing aberrant LCI signaling.</p><p>Our findings add to the emerging literature demonstrating a unique requirement for torsinA function for cell viability during CNS maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2014</xref>), a concept that may alter approaches to the therapeutic targeting of DYT1 dystonia.

Bands were visualized using Supersignal West Pico, Dura, or Femto enhanced chemiluminescence substrates, underwent several exposures to Amersham hyperfilm ECL, and were developed and fixed with an x-ray film developer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data are reported as mean ± SEM. Student's t-tests and Chi square tests were performed using Graphpad Prism software (version 6). One-way or two-way ANOVAs were performed using SPSS software (version 22), and post hoc Sidak's or Bonferroni's multiple comparisons tests were performed when significant main effects were observed (p &lt; 0.05). All experiments were repeated at least once before effects were considered significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Roger L Albin, Vikram G Shakkottai, and members of the Dauer lab for helpful discussion and critical reviews of the manuscript.

They describe selective dysfunction and pathology in large cholinergic interneurons (LCI) caused by the loss of the dystonia protein torsinA.</p><p>Substantial evidence suggests that DYT1 dystonia is caused by loss of torsinA function. However, the specific cell type (if this is cell-specific) responsible for the appearance of the phenotype remains unknown. Here, the authors developed a new mouse model with conditional deletion of torsinA in embryonic progenitors of cholinergic and GABAergic forebrain neurons. In this model, they encountered dysfunction and loss selectively in LCI following a specific topographic gradient. This pathology was paralleled by the appearance of a specific motor phenotype in mice. Subsequently, they found evidence in human necropsy tissue consistent with this finding (but not conclusive). Overall, the questions asked in this work are significant and relevant to human disease, the article is very well written and the experiments were carried out in a logical order and generated convincing results, with appropriate controls and analysis. The findings represent a significant advance in the understanding of neuronal network in the striatum that control motor activities. This article will be of great interest to the large community of scientists interested on the study of the basal ganglia, and specifically to those focused on dystonia research. In my opinion, this article should be published with minor changes as suggested below.</p><p>I believe no additional experimental data is required. The more robust and important contribution of this work is the demonstration of selective dysfunction in LCI upon loss of torsinA within the striatum leading to abnormal motor behavior. The link of this finding to human dystonia is very interesting, but a bit less convincing due to the limitations of the model. Based on that limitation, some of the conclusions might need to be modified for clarity:</p><p>The authors claim that, based on their data, selective loss of LCI likely plays a key role in the development of motor dysfunction in DYT1. However, torsinA is a widely expressed protein and they only deleted it here in a subset of neurons. In fact, the same group previously reported (JCI, 2014) the presence of degeneration is other brain areas together with motor dysfunction when conditional deletion was not restricted to the forebrain. That prior data argues that other cell types outside the striatum are equally vulnerable to loss of torsinA function. The way this paper is written, some readers less knowledgeable about the DYT1 field might believe that loss of torsinA leads to selective loss of LCI, and this is not entirely correct as the authors previously showed.</p><p>Progressive abnormal clasping behavior has been previously described by Grundman et al. in a rat model of DYT1. The authors mention that this model did not have selective loss of LCI. However, that was not carefully addressed in the DYT1 rats, so that statement is incorrect (we just don't know). It is still possible the rats have a similar LCI phenotype, which would strongly support their findings as expression of the mutated transgene (rather that loss of endogenous torsinA) in the rat model seems to be pan-neuronal.</p><p>Abnormal twisting of the trunk during tail hanging is reported in a large proportion of animals, and it is mentioned this “twisting” is specific to their model (though not specifically mentioned, it is implied the way the paper is written that the authors equate this behavior to human dystonia). This is very interesting. This twisting behavior is not included in many rating scales commonly used for clasping and might be simply underreported. This reviewer has observed “twisting” during tail hanging in other models of neurological disease (and in some controls) that exhibit abnormal clasping. I would be cautious about the significance of this “twisting” during tail hanging beyond abnormal motor function linked to LCI pathology.</p><p>As the authors properly acknowledge, the significance of the human data is compromised by the scarcity of available tissue and experimental limitations. They obtained 3 DYT1 brains from the UK and three controls from their own brain bank (meaning, different processing, storage, etc of cases and controls). It would have been better to also obtain the controls from the UK to at least diminish this potential confounding factor. There is no available information on the pathology of those brains, and this should be provided if available. Did they also have vascular or Alzheimer pathology, which could affect cholinergic neuron phenotype? (I know of at least one available DYT1 brain with significant AD and vascular pathology). It is implied in the Discussion that the human brains had selective LCI abnormalities. To claim selectivity, the authors would have to look at other brain regions and cell types, as their previous work suggests. I would simply emphasize the limitations of the human data a bit more, including toning down the sentence about LCI selectivity in human tissue in the Abstract.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Using a model of the Dlx-CKO mouse, the authors have analyzed cholinergic function and its relationship to behavioral abnormalities with resemblance to human dystonia. In a detailed series of experiments, they show that there is a developmental abnormality of LCI that correlates directly with the abnormal behavior. They show that the abnormality is specific for the cholinergic system, that some cells are lost and surviving cells are malfunctioning. They also show that anticholinergic medication improves the behavior, similar to human patients, and that human putamina also have a cholinergic abnormality.</p><p>The work is remarkable for its thoroughness and clarity of exposition. The final story relates the animal model and human disease on many levels, and is a major advance in understanding dystonia.</p><p>The authors should probably quote the McNaught paper of DYT1 pathology that found inclusions in the cholinergic neurons (even though they did not find any pathology in the striatum nor any cell loss).</p><p>I see no need for revision, but do have a few questions that they might want to try to answer or address.</p><p>1) The genetic abnormality is in GABA neurons as well as cholinergic neurons.

In our revised manuscript we clarify this point. In the Discussion, we now state that “our studies in postmortem striatum from DYT1 subjects, the first to examine cell type-specific markers in this context, are consistent with our experimental findings pointing to selective cholinergic defect in this structure. Previously work in overtly symptomatic DYT1 models demonstrates loss of discrete cell types in other motor-related structures (e.g., loss of neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei, with preservation of all other cerebellar cell types; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2014</xref>).” We have made several other changes to highlight that the selectivity observed here is within the striatum (all marked with “track changes” in the revised manuscript).</p><p><italic>Progressive abnormal clasping behavior has been previously described by Grundman et al. in a rat model of DYT1.

We have corrected and clarified this point in the Discussion point by stating that “abnormal clasping is present in a transgenic rat model of dystonia, but it is not known if striatal LCI number is reduced in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grundmann et al., 2012</xref>).”</p><p><italic>Abnormal twisting of the trunk during tail hanging is reported in a large proportion of animals, and it is mentioned this</italic> “<italic>twisting</italic>” <italic>is specific to their model (though not specifically mentioned, it is implied the way the paper is written that the authors equate this behavior to human dystonia).

As noted in the Methods section, our behavioral assessments were performed by several independent observers, all of whom were blinded to genotype. This analysis showed brief twisting episodes in only a very small number of control animals. In our pharmacological studies, only severe twisting episodes were considered abnormal and were scored accordingly. We agree that the relationship between twisting during tail suspension and human dystonia is unclear, and we have clarified this point in several instances in our revised manuscript, including by modifying the Title.</p><p><italic>As the authors properly acknowledge, the significance of the human data is compromised by the scarcity of available tissue and experimental limitations.

We have added additional information available to us regarding the postmortem tissue in the “Human Subject Data” table (Figure 8–figure supplement 1). This information shows that the subjects did not exhibit known vascular or AD pathology.</p><p>To more accurately report the results of our human postmortem studies, we removed the term ‘selective’ from the Abstract and several portions of the Discussion, and have clarified other statements regarding cholinergic selectivity.

Why aren't they involved?</italic></p><p>Considering how early torsinA is deleted, it is remarkable that forebrain GABA neuron number morphological appearance are normal. As we point out in the revised manuscript, they may be functionally abnormal, yet conditional deletion of torsinA from these cells does not cause overt abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yokoi et al., 2011</xref>). We are pursuing electrophysiological studies to address this question. We agree with the reviewer that the selectivity of cell loss is quite remarkable. While we do not yet have an answer to this question, the mechanisms of selective vulnerability is one we are actively exploring in a range of molecular and related studies of vulnerable and invulnerable neural cell types.</p><p><italic>2) The histological analysis shows the cholinergic abnormality mostly in the motor part of the striatum. Are there any observations about a distribution relating to the patch-matrix histology of the striatum? This histology was first defined on cholinergic markers.</italic></p><p>We have explored this question but do not observe any topographic loss according to patch/matrix organization. We note this point in our revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) Based on the cell biology of torsinA, how does the abnormality lead to the damage of the cholinergic neuron? The cell biology must be cell specific in some way</italic>.</p><p>We agree completely that the selectivity of LCI loss must reflect a key aspect of the cellular function of torsinA to which these cells are uniquely sensitive (within striatum). Indeed, the identification of torsinA-sensitive neural classes throughout the CNS is motivated by the expectation that understanding the mechanistic basis of this vulnerability will reveal key aspects of torsinA biology critical to disease pathogenesis. As noted above, we are currently pursuing studies in defined vulnerable and invulnerable cell types to address this question. Our understanding of the cellular role of torsinA is still quite limited, but abnormal protein quality control of a molecule particularly important to LCI is one possibility. TorsinA appears to play a role in protein quality control in the ER. To hint at this possibility, our revised manuscript now states, in the Discussion, that “postmortem analyses of DYT1 subjects suggests the presence of inclusion bodies in pedunculopontine cholinergic neurons, but did not report cell loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McNaught et al., 2004</xref>; #3647). These observations, and additional work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2014</xref> and reviewed by ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dauer, 2014</xref>), suggest that abnormal protein quality control may represent a pathogenic event in DYT1 dystonia.”</p><p><italic>4) Is there any explanation for the timing of the effect? Why is there the delay before the pathological process begins? And, why does it stop and plateau?</italic></p><p>We agree that the mechanism underlying the neurodevelopmental timing is LCI loss is another intriguing question. This timing coincides with the period of striatal circuit maturation when afferent connections are established and projection neurons and interneurons become physiologically active and mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hattori and McGeer, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tepper et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Sawatari, 2011</xref>). Our working hypothesis is that this period of circuit maturation represents an important critical period for torsinA function. This is also suggested by previous models. We inserted the following statement into the Discussion to address this important point: “Previous torsinA loss-of-function models also demonstrate cell loss restricted to a neurodevelopmental window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2014</xref>). […] cell loss and behavior onset during a neurodevelopmental window periods is consistent with a critical period for torsinA function in CNS development.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
