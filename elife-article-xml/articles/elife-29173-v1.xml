The last decades have witnessed huge efforts focused on identifying molecules necessary for organ formation in a wide range of organisms. This approach resulted in a deeper understanding of the molecular networks that control organogenesis in both vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilbert, 2014</xref>). Even though a broad range of molecular details have been uncovered, those did not contribute to revealing how cells from different embryonic origins end up together in the same functional unit.</p><p>There are two alternative scenarios on how cells from different lineages successfully come together during embryogenesis to assemble composite organs. One option is that they originate from cells that form in remote areas and migrate to a common pre-defined location. This typically happens during the formation of gonads in vertebrates, where germ cells follow a directional migration towards the somatic cells that will form their stem cell niche and eventually the gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doitsidou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Santos and Lehmann, 2004</xref>). The other option is that one cell type is generated in a stereotypic position to then recruit a second cell type to fulfil a new role <italic>in situ</italic>. This occurs during eye formation, where retinal progenitors trigger the induction of surface ectodermal cells into lens cells that are later integrated into the forming eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cvekl and Ashery-Padan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gunhaga, 2011</xref>).</p><p>While gonads, eyes and most animal organs have a defined number and location within species, the neuromasts - sensory organs of the lateral line system in fish - constitute a more plastic model in which organ numbers cannot exactly be deduced from the developmental stage or overall size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghysen and Dambly-Chaudière, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seleit et al., 2017</xref>). The first neuromasts of the posterior lateral line (pLL) system are generated during embryogenesis by one primordium (in medaka) and two primordia (in zebrafish, tuna and <italic>Astyanax</italic>) that migrate anterior-to-posterior along the horizontal myoseptum while depositing groups of cells from their trailing ends at regular intervals. Soon after deposition these cellular clusters mature into neuromasts, composed of three main cell types as assessed by morphology and molecular markers. Hair cells (HCs), the sensory component and differentiated cell type, project cilia into the external environment and are responsible for detecting water flow and relaying this information back to the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghysen and Dambly-Chaudière, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams and Holder, 2000</xref>). Surrounding the HCs is a population of progenitor support cells (SCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghysen and Dambly-Chaudière, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hernández et al., 2007</xref>), while mantle cells (MCs) form an outer ring around both cell types and encapsulate the projecting HCs in a cupula-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones and Corwin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steiner et al., 2014</xref>). Since HCs are continuously lost and replaced under homeostatic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cruz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams and Holder, 2000</xref>) and in response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hernández et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">López-Schier and Hudspeth, 2006</xref>) throughout the life of fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pinto-Teixeira et al., 2015</xref>), the existence of stem cells capable of constantly replenishing HCs has been proposed.</p><p>The presence of neuromast stem cells has also been inferred from the fact that new neuromasts are continuously added to the lateral line system during the lifetime of fish, presumably to cope with an increasing body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dufourcq et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghysen and Dambly-Chaudière, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wada et al., 2013</xref>). It has been reported that the peripheral ring of mantle cells plays a major role in new organ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dufourcq et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones and Corwin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stone, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wada et al., 2013</xref>). This has led to the proposition of a linear model in which mantle cells give rise to support cells that in turn replenish lost hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghysen and Dambly-Chaudière, 2007</xref>). The transition from support to hair cells has been heavily investigated in the past decade and is strongly supported by a large body of experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hernández et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">López-Schier and Hudspeth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Romero-Carvajal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wibowo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams and Holder, 2000</xref>). However, the proposed transition of mantle into support cells has not yet been shown and it is still unknown where the stem cells of the neuromasts reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pinto-Teixeira et al., 2015</xref>). An interesting observation is that upon repeated injury of the hair cell population coupled with a depletion of support cells, mantle cells re-enter the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Romero-Carvajal et al., 2015</xref>), but their precise role during homeostasis and regeneration remains unclear. The current view posits support cells as multipotent progenitors capable of self-renewing and differentiation and suggests a niche role for mantle cells influencing SC proliferative behaviour and fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Romero-Carvajal et al., 2015</xref>). In the absence of long-term lineage tracing data, however, it is very difficult to reveal the identity and location of neuromast stem cells and to assess if homeostatic replacement, response to injuries, and generation of new organs during post-embryonic stages are all performed by the same or different cell types.</p><p>Here we use newly developed transgenic lines to follow lineages during development and into adulthood in neuromasts of medaka fish. We prove that mantle cells constitute <italic>bona fide</italic> neuromast neural stem cells during homeostasis, growth and organ regeneration. Additionally, we identify a new population of neuromast cells that we name neuromast border cells (nBCs), which are conserved in other teleost fish. We demonstrate that in medaka, nBCs constitute a different lineage that never crosses boundaries with the neural lineage maintained by mantle cells. We track border cells back to earlier developmental stages both in medaka and zebrafish, and reveal that they do not originate from the pLL primordium but rather from the suprabasal skin epithelium, defining neuromasts as composite organs. Finally, we show that neural stem cells are necessary and sufficient to induce the conversion of epithelial cells into nBCs, and that the ablation of nBCs disrupts the architecture of the organ. Altogether, we uncover that neural stem cells recruit and intimately associate with neighbouring cells that will be maintained as a life-long separate lineage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>nBCs are the outer cells of the organ</title><p>To address the existence and identity of neuromast stem cells we decided to follow a lineage analysis approach using the <italic>Gaudí</italic> toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Centanin et al., 2014</xref>), in combination with transgenic lines that label the different cell types within mature neuromasts. The transgenic line (Tg) Tg(<italic>Eya1</italic>:EGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seleit et al., 2017</xref>) is expressed in all cells of the migrating primordium and during organogenesis, but is restricted to hair cells and internal support cells located underneath HCs in mature organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,A’</xref>). The newly generated enhancer trap <italic>neurom<sup>K8</sup></italic>:H2B-EGFP stably labels all support cells and mantle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,B’</xref>)(See Materials and methods).

A 3D reconstruction of triple transgenic Tg(<italic>K15</italic>:mEYFP), Tg(<italic>K15</italic>:H2B-RFP), Tg(<italic>Eya1</italic>:EGFP) neuromasts indicates that EYFP positive cells are wrapping the hair cells of the organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), a distinctive morphology and position that characterises mantle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones and Corwin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steiner et al., 2014</xref>). Both <italic>neurom<sup>K8</sup></italic>:H2B-EGFP and Tg(<italic>K15</italic>:H2B-RFP) also label skin epithelia on the entire body of juvenile and adult medaka fish.

This is the case for all neuromasts in medaka, including ventral, midline and dorsal neuromasts on the posterior lateral line, and neuromasts of the anterior lateral lines in both juveniles and adults (N &gt; 100 neuromasts). Since these elongated nuclei locate to the outer border of neuromasts, we named the corresponding cells neuromast Border Cells (nBCs). Electron microscopy revealed that the membranes of border cells are intimately associated with those of mantle cells, often producing cytoplasmic protrusions into one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–B’’’</xref>) In addition we also observed desmosomes between MCs and nBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–C’’</xref>).

One lineage involves mantle cells that expand and generate support and hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D’’</xref>) - the neural lineage - while the other lineage was restricted to neuromast border cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–E’’</xref>). We observed that 72 neuromasts contained clones that were restricted to the neural lineage throughout the timeline of the experiment. Intriguingly, they never generated a labelled nBC, suggesting that border cells do not originate from this lineage. These 72 neuromasts included cases of the entire proposed neural lineage progression from mantle to support to hair cells (N = 7 clones in 7 neuromasts in four fish)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–D’’</xref>).

The analysis of long-term clones in the CNC revealed that both neural and nBC lineages are maintained by dedicated, fate-restricted stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). We focused our analysis on CNCs in which 75% or less neuromasts contained labelled cells (47 CNCs containing 284 neuromasts, from which 112 contained GFP positive cells, in 30 recombined Gaudi<italic><sup>RSG</sup></italic> fish). We observed that 92% of neuromasts contain fate restricted clones, comprising either the neural lineage (34.8%, N = 39/112 neuromasts)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>) or the nBC lineage (57.1%, N = 64/112 neuromasts)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). The remaining 8% of neuromasts show co-occurrence of labelled cells in both lineages (N = 9/112 neuromasts)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These co-labelled cases could be the result of simultaneous recombination of cells in both lineages or alternatively, be produced by a rare bi-potent stem cell. By restricting the analysis to CNCs with sparse labelling (≤50% of neuromasts labelled per cluster), the ratio of co-labelled clones drops further (5.1%, 4/79 labelled neuromasts in 39 CNCs), and disappears when we select for an even lower recombination efficiency (≤25% of neuromasts labelled per cluster, 0/17 labelled neuromasts in 15 CNCs). Although we cannot exclude the existence of a bi-potent stem cell, the presence of fate-restricted stem cells is further supported by CNCs in which all neuromasts are labelled in either the nBC (N = 53 neuromasts in 10 CNCs) or the neural lineage (N = 3 neuromasts in 1 CNC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We observe that upon injury the initial reaction of the surviving mantle cells is to coalesce which is followed by an increase in cell numbers.

This highly ordered transition suggests that before differentiation developing neuromasts must attain a critical number of cells, as we observed during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seleit et al., 2017</xref>).

This event seems to be restricted to the initial phases of organ formation and involves a small number of cells. Our 4D analysis of the epithelial-to-border cell transition has revealed that border cells can divide after conversion to generate two border cells, which was confirmed by live imaging and short term lineage experiments in medaka. Labelled cells can generate large clones that involve all border cells in every neuromast of the CNC, indicating long-term stability of labelled clones. Altogether, we have shown that neural stem cell precursors trigger the induction of nBCs from suprabasal skin epithelial cells, which will in turn associate with them to form mature neuromast organs. The analysis of cell membranes during the conversion phase has revealed that skin epithelial cells change their morphology mirroring what has been observed for the induced nuclei. Notably during the induction phase, the neural stem cell precursors extend numerous cytoplasmic protrusions that dissappear once the stem cell — niche interaction has been established in mature organs. Cytoplasmic extensions have been reported in other systems as a way in which the niche signals to stem cells such as nanotubes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Inaba et al., 2015</xref>), opening the possibility that these processes are indeed a communication system between the two lineages during neuromast formation. Further experiments disrupting these cytoplasmic protrusions will contribute to defining their role in organogenesis.

There, the developing optic vesicle (composed of neural progenitors) contacts the surface ectoderm to induce a lens placode from previous ectoderm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cvekl and Ashery-Padan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gunhaga, 2011</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 2006</xref>). The case that we report here shares the same rationale and interestingly, the cells involved express the same molecular markers. Neuromast neural lineage cells are <italic>Eya1<sup>+</sup></italic> as retinal progenitors, and they induce a cell fate change in <italic>K15</italic><sup>+</sup> ectodermal cells. The similar molecular identity of the cell types involved, in which <italic>Eya1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells operate as the inducer and <italic>K15</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Eya1<sup>-</sup></italic> cells as responders, invites to question whether similar molecular mechanisms are involved in the event. The identity and nature of the inducer cells — in both cases neural progenitors responsible for generating neurons that define the organ’s function — indicate a shared hierarchical organisation during organogenesis of sensory systems. It would be interesting to address whether other sensory systems with a similar surface location and common molecular markers (e.g. the ampular system) follow the same rationale during organogenesis and ultimately, whether proximate interaction, or induction, constitutes an ancient signature for the establishment of sensory systems.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>nBCs as a niche for neural stem cells</title><p>The stem cell niche is key for stem cell maintenance in plants, invertebrates and vertebrates.. The concept of the stem cell niche was introduced by Schofield during the late 70’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schofield, 1978</xref>), and since then is defined as the stem cell microenvironment and architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nystul and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scadden, 2014</xref>). The niche influences the behaviour of stem cells by a variety of mechanisms including direct signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tulina and Matunis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xie and Spradling, 1998</xref>), in a way that stem cells that keep a close connection to the niche are destined to maintain their stemness while their displaced progeny start to differentiate. The complexity of the stem cell niche varies depending on stem cell type, spanning from the relatively simple case of <italic>Drosophila</italic> gonads to the extraordinarily vast hematopoietic niche. In the fly testis, germ stem cells are in contact with Hub cells (niche cells), and this interaction defines stemness through a series of well defined signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tulina and Matunis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xie and Spradling, 1998</xref>). In contrast, many cell types in the bone marrow have been reported as hematopoetic stem cell (HSC) regulators and contributors to the hematopoietic niche, including endothelial cells, LepR+, adipocytes, Schwann cells, nerve fibers and even macrophages and megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bruns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Christopher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scadden, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamazaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Many examples have been reported on how stem cells can act upon changes in their microenvironment. Mouse embryonic stem cells will self-renew upon culture conditions, generate any differentiated cell type if transplanted into a blastula but produce teratomas if implanted in an adult (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2004</xref>). Luminal stem cells in the mammary gland are bipotent in an embryonic niche, unipotent in the adult niche, and bipotent again upon loss of their basal counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Keymeulen et al., 2011</xref>). Neoblasts in planarians generate the cell types of their surroundings, but upon excision of a major part of the body they can produce distal cell types and even generate an entire new organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gurley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sánchez Alvarado, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). The surrounding microenvironment of a stem cell therefore defines crucial aspects of its identity.</p><p>The physical proximity and intimate contacts of neuromast border cells and mantle cells position nBCs as a strong candidate to constitute the neural stem cell niche of the organ. Indeed, we observe in medaka that MCs maintaining contact with nBCs continue expression of the neural stem cell marker (<italic>K15<sup>+</sup></italic>) and display stem cell behaviour, that is generation of long-term clones. Additionally, the removal of individual niche cells has local effects on the stem cells that were attached to them, while major ablations affect the overall architecture of the organ. In short, nBCs are part of the life-long direct microenvironmet of mantle stem cells and their relative location fulfills the requirements expected for niche cells – cells in contact remain stem cells, daughters that are located tangentially also become stem cells, and daughter cells moving radially inwards start differentiation programmes to eventually generate neurons. We believe that the simplicity of neuromast organisation, the abundance of organs per experimental animal and the possibility of combining physical manipulations and live-imaging position the neuromast as a highly complementary model to explore stem cell--niche interactions.</p><p>Further molecular characterisation of nBCs is needed to identify cell type-specific drivers, which in turn will facilitate analysing their impact on neural stem cells on the long-term scale. Additional ablations, for instance removing all mantle cells, are required to address whether nBCs could confer <italic>K15</italic> expression and long-term stem cell behavior to other cells types in the organ, as it was demonstrated for other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tetteh et al., 2016</xref>). The conservation of the same organ architecture and cell types in zebrafish will allow following dynamic aspects of niche—stem cell interaction in a model better suited for continuous 4D approaches.</p><p>Most niche cells have a different lineage than their respective stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2004</xref>), which raises fundamental developmental questions such as how do these cell types come together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>), whether they are formed simultaneously or sequentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ouspenskaia et al., 2016</xref>) and if there is a hierarchy organising their interaction. Our results suggest that during development, the neural lineage induces the formation of its own niche by fate conversion of neighbouring epithelial cells. The induction of a transient, short-lived niche by HSCs in zebrafish was recently reported to occur by major morphological remodelling of perivascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>). We report a similar morphological transition during sensory organ formation that notably results in a life-long, permanent niche. This model in which niche formation is triggered by arriving neural precursors seems appropriate for a system in which the number and location of organs is plastic and not genetically defined. Whether the same rationale applies to niche formation upon the arrival of migrating malignant cells in pathological cases is a clinically relevant question that remains to be elucidated.</p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="5">Key resources table</th></tr><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>strain (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>)</td><td>Cab</td><td>other</td><td/><td>medaka Southern wild typepopulation</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>O. latipes</italic>)</td><td>Tg(<italic>Eya1</italic>:H2B-EGFP)</td><td>PMID: 28087632</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>O. latipes</italic>)</td><td>Tg(<italic>Eya1</italic>:EGFP)</td><td>PMID: 28087632</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>O. latipes</italic>)</td><td>GaudíUbiq.iCre</td><td>PMID:25142461</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>O. latipes</italic>)</td><td>GaudíHsp70.A</td><td>PMID:25142461</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>O. latipes</italic>)</td><td>GaudíRSG</td><td>PMID:25142461</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>O. latipes</italic>)</td><td>Tg(<italic>K15</italic>:mYFP)</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td><italic>K15</italic> sequence by PCR using fosmidGOLWFno691_n05 (NBRP Medaka) as template</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>O. latipes</italic>)</td><td>Tg(<italic>K15</italic>:H2B-EGFP)</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td><italic>K15</italic>sequence by PCR using fosmid GOLWFno691_n05 (NBRP Medaka) as template</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>O. latipes</italic>)</td><td>Tg(<italic>K15</italic>:H2B-RFP)</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td><italic>K15</italic> sequence by PCR using fosmid GOLWFno691_n05 (NBRP Medaka) as template</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>O. latipes</italic>)</td><td>Tg(<italic>K15</italic>:ERT2Cre)</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td><italic>K15</italic> sequence by PCR using fosmid GOLWFno691_n05 (NBRP Medaka) as template</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>O. latipes</italic>)</td><td>Tg(<italic>neuromK8</italic>:H2B-EGFP)</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>0.5 Kb <italic>Keratin8</italic> sequence PMID: 18544450</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>AB</td><td>other</td><td/><td>Wildtype zebrafish strain</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tg(<italic>o.l.K15</italic>:H2B-EGFP)</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td><italic>K15</italic>:H2B-EGFP plasmid from medaka (this paper)</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tg(<italic>cxcr4b</italic>:Cxcr4b-GFP)</td><td>PMID: 24067609</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">antibody</td><td valign="bottom">a-EGFP (rabbit IgG polyclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">Invitrogen (now Thermo Fischer)</td><td valign="bottom">CAB4211;

Two gRNAs were selected (ngn1-1: UUCUCAGUGCUCGAGUCCGGCGG, and ngn1-2: UUCUCAGUGCUCGAGUCCGGCGG) using the freely available CCTop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stemmer et al., 2015</xref>). gRNA synthesis was done as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stemmer et al., 2015</xref>) using the following oligos:</p><p>gRNAngn1-1F: TAGGTTCTCAGTGCTCGAGTCCGG</p><p>gRNAngn1-1R: AAACCCGGACTCGAGCACTGAGAA</p><p>sgRNAngn1-2F: TAGGTCTGCGATGCGGATGGTCT</p><p>sgRNAngn1-2R: AAACAGACCATCCGCATCGCAGA</p><p>Tg(<italic>Eya1</italic>:EGFP) or Tg(<italic>Eya1</italic>:H2B-EGFP) embryos were injected at the 1 cell stage with a solution containing 15 ng/μl of each gRNA and 150 ng/μl of CAS9 mRNA. The resulting embryos were selected for the presence of ectopic neuromasts at late embryonic stages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantifying morphological changes</title><p>Circularity was used to measure the transition of shape observed between epithelial cells and nBCs. Circularity = 4π(area/perimeter^2), a circularity value of 1.0 denotes a perfect circle. As the shape deforms away from a circle its circularity value decreases. Standard Fiji software was used to calculate the circularity of 20 nuclei and cellular membranes of epithelial cells and 20 nuclei and cellular membranes of nBCs obtained from mosaic clones of fish co-injected with the <italic>K15</italic>:H2BRFP and <italic>K15</italic>:mYFP plasmids. The generation of boxplots was done using standard R software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank T Piotrowski, S Lemke, J Wittbrodt and M Allende for scientific inputs on earlier versions of this manuscript, and K Lust, A Gutierrez-Triana, T Oskarsson and Centanin lab members for active discussions on the project.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Tanya Whitfield) and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Seleit et al., have used short and long term lineage tracing to address the very interesting question of the origin of the stem cells that are necessary to replace: (i) hair cells during homeostasis and (ii) almost entire neuromasts during ablation and regeneration in the lateral line system of the Medaka. In addition, they have identified a new type of cells in the neuromasts, which they named neuromast Border cells (nBC) and which they show have a strictly different origin than the other neuromast cells. They propose that nBCs could serve as a niche for the neuromast stem cells.</p><p>All three reviewers commented on the merits of the study, including the long-term imaging, confirmation that mantle cells are the stem cells for the neuromast, and interesting observations concerning the border cells and their intimate contacts with the mantle cells. However, it was felt that some further work was necessary to strengthen the conclusions, and especially to support the interpretation that the border cells form a niche for the mantle (stem) cells of the neuromast. The essential suggested revisions are:</p><p>1) Reviewer 2 requests an additional video that includes a membrane label.</p><p>2) There was some discussion amongst the reviewers about experimental work that could be done to demonstrate a functional (niche) role for the border cells. As you will see, reviewer 1 comments on the current lack of experimental support for this interpretation, and ablation studies have been suggested by reviewer 2. It was acknowledged that these might be challenging to do, but it was felt that some attempt should be made to address this. It was also felt that unless further experimental support could be provided here, the authors should tone down their interpretations about the niche and alter the wording in the title.</p><p>3) In the Discussion, there could be more emphasis on what our understanding from other model systems has revealed about what constitutes a stem cell niche, why it is important and how the neuromast might serve as a useful model for the exploration of their formation and maintenance. It might also help discuss what has been learnt so far in this system and what additional observations might need to be made to firmly establish the neuromast as a model for self-organization of a stem cell niche.</p><p>4) Please give all details of quantification and statistical analysis, as requested by reviewer 2.</p><p>5) Please provide a brief explanation for the Gaudi methodology, as requested by two of the reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a very nice study, the lineage tracing data are very clear and the light and electron microscopy data very informative. In addition, the paper is very clearly written and pleasant to read. Yet, I have two major concerns about the manuscript.</p><p>1) Evidence showing that nBCare an integral part of the neuromasts is missing.</p><p>The authors describe the newly identified &quot;nBC&quot; as an integral part of the neuromasts. Since those cells have a different origin (the overlying epidermis, the authors show that very clearly), this is not clear to me at which point the nBC become part of the neuromasts. That the nBCare changing shape in the plane of the epidermis as neuromasts get deposited and mature is clear, but to my point of view, this is not sufficient to claim that they are an integral part of the neuromasts. If this is not the case, the nBCs should be considered as cells from the epidermis that change their shape upon contact with the neuromasts.</p><p>2) Evidence showing that nBCare acting as a niche for the mantle cells to maintain their stemness is missing.</p><p>In the discussion part, the authors write &quot;Our results suggest that during development, the neural lineage induces the formation of its own niche by fate conversion of neighboring epithelial cells.&quot; (subsection “Do nBCs constitute 1 a niche for neural stem cells?”). This statement is a bit surprising since no experiment in the result part are presented in this direction to prove that nBCs function as a &quot;stem cell niche&quot; for mantle cells. From my point of view, evidence is here totally lacking. Certainly the electron microscopy data &quot;revealed that the membranes of border cells are intimately associated with those of mantle cells, often producing cytoplasmic protrusions into one another&quot;, yet this does not prove that these two cell types signal to each other and even less that the nBCs are necessary for the maintenance of the mantle cells as stem cells. The authors should address this point or remove the &quot;stem cell niche&quot; aspect from the manuscript, and also then change the title.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript contains many neat long-term experiments that lead to new insights into the generation and maintenance of neuromasts. The strong point in this paper is that organogenesis and cell turnover is followed over long time scales. However, some additional statistics, experiments and text changes are necessary to convincingly define these stem cell lineages.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– All Figures need meaningful statistics. In the current version of the manuscript the statistics sometimes refer to clones, sometimes neuromasts and it is not always clear how many fish were used and what age these fish were. This needs to be clarified over all Figures. It should be added to the Figures themselves and also be explained in more detail in the text. Furthermore, it should be explained what happens to clones that are not explicitly mentioned in the analysis. For example, for the lineage in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> it is stated that 45.1% of clones end up in the neural lineage while 12.5% end up in the neuromast border cell lineage.</p><p>However, it is not clear what happens to the rest. This should be explained here and in all other quantifications.</p><p>Especially <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> need additional quantification to assess all clones analyzed for these experiments.</p><p>– It would tremendously help in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> to additionally show a DAPI staining to clarify where the exact boundaries of the respective organs are. This would help to appreciate the exact location of the labeled cells. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> DAPI panels would additionally help to differentiate between real cell ablation and mere photobleaching of the marker.</p><p>– As it is noted for<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> that mantle cells first coalesce and then re-enter the cell cycle, some BrdU or EdU staining should be performed to support this claim.</p><p>– To underline the authors' findings in the live imaging approaches, an additional 4D reconstruction of the video should be shown. Z information would help to understand the source of the epithelial cells and when and how they interact with the neuromast cells.</p><p>– Along the same lines, the authors should add 4D imaging of the double K15 transgenic line that also labels the cell membrane. This would clarify how the presumptive neuromast border cells contact the neural cells and how and when the associated cellular changes occur. This would also then link this data to the EM data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in which the authors suggest that cells are in contact with each other and share desmosomes. Otherwise, this data is never mentioned again in the manuscript or the discussion and falls a bit out of focus of the study. If neuromast and epidermal cells interact and this interaction leads to cell shape changes, this would be a substantial addition to the findings the authors present. As such experiments in the adult fish would probably take a long time, this set of experiments could also be performed in the developing larvae. As the authors have access to confocal as well as light sheet microscopes these experiments should be feasible with the current molecular markers used in the manuscript and would massively help to clarify a potential role of protrusions and cell-cell contacts.</p><p>– It would be very interesting to know how the tissue reacts in case border cells are depleted (for example by laser ablation as done in other experiments). Will new border cells be recruited? Will other cells transform? This data will reveal the biological function of the newly defined neuromast border cells. These experiments could also be done in developing larvae for time reasons.</p><p>– Even though the authors did not explicitly find lineages that give rise to both, neural and border cells, this possibility cannot be completely ruled out. The text should be adjusted accordingly.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Comprehensive analysis of lineage and fate with a variety of transgenic lines allows Seleit et al., to identify a <italic>K15+</italic> population as the previously elusive population of stem cells that serves as a source of source of both neural and epidermal lineages in the growing and regenerating Medaka posterior lateral line neuromasts. Their analysis suggests that while some <italic>K15+</italic> cells exclusively generate all the neural cells of the neuromast, others exclusively generate neuromast Border cells (nBC), a new epidermal sub-population defined by the authors that surrounds mantle cells and additional progeny that contribute exclusively to surrounding epidermal tissue. The authors also use EM to reveal intimate interactions between the mantle cells and the surrounding nBCs. The authors also emphasize how juxtaposition of a neural population, deposited by a migrating primordium, with its surrounding epidermal neighbors establishes interactions between cells of different embryonic origins to establish this stem cell niche. The results are clear and well laid out. The observations define a system that will serve well as a model for development of a stem cell niche in the future.</p><p>I found the EM results, which show potential interactions between mantle cells and surrounding nBC cells to be quite intriguing. To me they were reminiscent of observations made in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis where germline stem cells insert microtubule based nanotubes (cytoplasmic processes) into associated niche cells to receive Dpp signals, which are required for Germline stem cell survival. http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v523/n7560/abs/nature14602.html In light of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> observations, I believe these observations in the neuromast are quite interesting, worth sharing, and should be explored further.</p><p>I did, however, have a difficult time initially understanding some genetic manipulations as I was not familiar with the Gaudi system. Some brief introduction to the Gaudi system would help. This is primarily a descriptive paper and will serve as an important baseline for future studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29173.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Reviewer 2 requests an additional video that includes a membrane label.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the advice of the reviewer and performed additional imaging of skin epithelial cells during their conversion to nBCs. This data can be found in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2 &amp; 3</xref>, in the new <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>, and in an additional video that we include in this response (Video-Reviewer, independent videos for membranes, nuclei and merge).</p><p>Our initial attempts involved the combination of transgenic lines and the imaging device suggested by reviewer 2 – Tg(<italic>K15</italic>:mYFP)(<italic>K15</italic>:H2B-RFP) imaged with the MuVi-Spim. This device is equipped with two 15x objectives, which provide a nice spatial resolution when combined with nuclear-tagged fluorescent proteins – data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3 &amp; 4</xref> – but is not ideal when combined to membrane-tagged FPs. In the video movie attached to this response, we can observe that the morphological remodelling of K15 nuclei is accompanied by similar changes to membranes of induced cells, which we had already learnt from data presented in the previous version of the manuscript – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>. However, the low spatial resolution of the device combined with the excess of membrane label both in the skin epithelium and in neuromast mantle cells of Tg(<italic>K15</italic>:mYFP) precluded us from addressing the possible existence and timing of protrusions from skin epithelial cells during their conversion to nBCs. We believe that this new dataset does not add to the revised version of the manuscript and we therefore do not include it.</p><p>Instead, we proceeded with a complementary strategy to tackle membrane dynamics during neuromast formation. To visualise membranes more adequately we followed a mosaic approach by injecting the <italic>K15</italic>:mYFP plasmid in 2-4 cell stage medaka embryos. This allowed sparse labeling of skin epithelial cells along the trunk (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>) that we imaged at three time points (day 8, day 9.5, day 13 post fertilisation) with a SPE Leica Confocal microscope equipped with a 40x immersion objective. This set-up provides a better spatial resolution, but is not suitable for long-term live-imaging as required to follow the induction event continuously. Since the K15 promoter drives expression both in skin epithelium and also in neuromast mantle cells, the approach allowed us to follow clones in both lineages. The data we present in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref> shows that the skin epithelial cells do not extend obvious protrusions before, during or after their conversion to nBCs. We do however detect small protrusions similar to the ones observed in the EM once the organ is mature – new <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>. However, when analysing<italic>K15+</italic> neural stem cell clones we consistently observed cytoplasmic extensions from the neural lineage. Iterative imaging of the same clones revealed that these processes are indeed dynamic and transient, since they disappear at early postembryonic stages – see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3B-D</xref>’’. These new and unexpected data relates to the observation made by Reviewer 3, who suggested that the cytoplasmic protrusions between nBCs and <italic>K15+</italic> mantle cells observed by EM are reminiscent of the so-called nanotubes in the male germline of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We do not explore functional aspects of these protrusions in this study, but do speculate about these processes in the Discussion.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion, which has helped improve our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There was some discussion amongst the reviewers about experimental work that could be done to demonstrate a functional (niche) role for the border cells. As you will see, reviewer 1 comments on the current lack of experimental support for this interpretation, and ablation studies have been suggested by reviewer 2. It was acknowledged that these might be challenging to do, but it was felt that some attempt should be made to address this. It was also felt that unless further experimental support could be provided here, the authors should tone down their interpretations about the niche and alter the wording in the title.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the view from the reviewers, and have followed their suggestions to experimentally tackle a structural (niche) function for nBCs. Due to the lack of a permanent label for nBCs we have performed our experiments on Tg(<italic>K15</italic>:H2B-EGFP) and/or <italic>neuromast<sup>K8</sup></italic>:H2B-EGFP during late embryogenesis, a stage in which most nBCs still retain the label expressed by their skin epithelial precursors. We have performed two sets of experiments to address the function of nBCs: a) 2-photon laser ablation of 1 or 2 nBCs per neuromast, b) 2-photon laser ablation of most nBCs of a neuromast. Both of them suggest that nBCs constitute a physical niche for <italic>K15</italic>+ neural stem cells in the neuromast, and we show these experiments in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>.</p><p>Briefly, when one or few nBCs are ablated in neuromasts we observe an immediate reaction from the neural lineage, where <italic>K15</italic>+ neural stem cells move internally as if they were detached from their physical anchor. This effect is certainly more drastic when most nBCs of a neuromast are ablated, and we show that this has massive structural consequences for the neural lineage. To explore whether the <italic>K15</italic>+ stem cells lose their stem cell marker or die, we iteratively imaged neuromasts after injury. We observed that the neural lineage is maintained and the integrity of the organ is re-established when new border cells re-appear, a process that happens within a week after injury. Our data suggest that these new nBCs originate from a re-recruitment event from the skin epithelium since some are positive for k15 promoter driven FPs, but we cannot exclude that they also originate from a highly proliferative nBC that was unlabeled and therefore not targeted during the 2-photon laser ablation. These new results from the requested experiments indicate that nBCs act as a physical niche for the K15 neural stem cells and that they are important for maintaining neuromast integrity and architecture. We have also expanded the Discussion in this regard.</p><p>An additional experiment suggested by reviewer 2 – that addresses a concern raised by reviewer 1 as well – is also relevant for this point. We explored other teleost fish and found that in all cases analysed (&gt;10 neuromasts in <italic>Poecilia formosa</italic>, &gt;10 neuromasts in <italic>Danio rerio</italic>) neuromasts contained nBCs that are adjacent to mantle cells – new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. We also generated a zebrafish Tg(ol<italic>K15</italic>:H2B-EGFP) and used it to demonstrate not only the existence of this cell type but also the conservation of the induction process. The new <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref> shows that nBCs in zebrafish are induced from the skin epithelium upon the deposition of the neural lineage. Although not conclusive, the conservation of nBCs in distantly related teleost favours the view that nBCs are an integral part of the neuromast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the Discussion, there could be more emphasis on what our understanding from other model systems has revealed about what constitutes a stem cell niche, why it is important and how the neuromast might serve as a useful model for the exploration of their formation and maintenance.

In the revised version of the Discussion, we have included a more detailed description of what a niche is, and have provided examples of different niche complexity among the most studied models for post-embryonic stem cells. We have also highlighted what we believe is the main contribution of the neuromast to the field of niche-stem cell interaction and have stated our thoughts on future directions to explore this system further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please give all details of quantification and statistical analysis, as requested by reviewer 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the request of the reviewers and modified the way in which we present the quantifications of clones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please provide a brief explanation for the Gaudi methodology, as requested by two of the reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided a better description of the Gaudi methodology as requested by the reviewers – first sentences on the “<italic>nBCs constitute an independent life-long lineage</italic>” section.

Overall, we show:</p><p>a) Direct contact between nBCs and mantle stem cells – desmosomes in EM images, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>b) A morphological and molecular change – the loss of K15 expression – upon recruitment.</p><p>c) Clonal expansion of nBCs surrounding the neural tissue that is stable life-long – both with ubiquitous and cell-specific drivers.</p><p>d) The presence of nBCs in every neuromast of medaka, regardless of their location in the body, their developmental origin and the time of their formation.</p><p>e) The presence of nBCs in neuromasts of other teleost fish, <italic>Poecilia formosa</italic> and <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, favouring the view that nBCs are present in every neuromast – new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p>f) Local structural responses of the neural lineage when 1 – 2 nBCs are ablated, and massive structural consequences when most of them are hit – new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and new <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>. Please also refer to the essential revisions, point 2.</p><p>g) The recovery of organ shape and distribution of cell types upon arrival of new nBCs – new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">figure 10B</xref>.</p><p>While this does not definitively prove nBCs are part of the organ we believe our data provide compelling evidence that they should be considered as such. More generally, we share with the reviewer the interest in what constitutes an organ. And indeed cases do exist where cells are considered part of an organ even when their morphology and expression profile is continuous with the surrounding tissues outside of it, and in the absence of physical contact – e.g. epithelial cells of the cornea are considered part of the eye. Besides the fact that nBCs are cells that display intimate contacts to neural lineage cells, they also have a major role in maintaining neuromast architecture – as shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. Since the neuromast is a mechanosensory organ, we believe that a cell type that directly impacts organ architecture is of critical importance for normal neuromast homeostasis and function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Evidence showing that nBCare acting as a niche for the mantle cells to maintain their stemness is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point experimentally and provide new data indicating that nBCs indeed constitute a physical niche for neural stem cells – new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. In the revised Discussion we have also included a list of the pre-requisites for a cell type to be considered a niche, and show that nBCsfulfil these criteria comparably with other well established niches. The reviewer can find a more detailed response in the points 2 &amp; 3 of the essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion part, the authors write &quot;Our results suggest that during development, the neural lineage induces the formation of its own niche by fate conversion of neighboring epithelial cells.&quot; (subsection “Do nBCs constitute 1 a niche for neural stem cells?”). This statement is a bit surprising since no experiment in the result part are presented in this direction to prove that nBCs function as a &quot;stem cell niche&quot; for mantle cells. From my point of view, evidence is here totally lacking. Certainly the electron microscopy data &quot;revealed that the membranes of border cells are intimately associated with those of mantle cells, often producing cytoplasmic protrusions into one another&quot;, yet this does not prove that these two cell types signal to each other and even less that the nBCs are necessary for the maintenance of the mantle cells as stem cells. The authors should address this point or remove the &quot;stem cell niche&quot; aspect from the manuscript, and also then change the title.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript contains many neat long-term experiments that lead to new insights into the generation and maintenance of neuromasts. The strong point in this paper is that organogenesis and cell turnover is followed over long time scales. However, some additional statistics, experiments and text changes are necessary to convincingly define these stem cell lineages.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– All Figures need meaningful statistics. In the current version of the manuscript the statistics sometimes refer to clones, sometimes neuromasts and it is not always clear how many fish were used and what age these fish were. This needs to be clarified over all Figures. It should be added to the Figures themselves and also be explained in more detail in the text. Furthermore, it should be explained what happens to clones that are not explicitly mentioned in the analysis. For example, for the lineage in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> it is stated that 45.1% of clones end up in the neural lineage while 12.5% end up in the neuromast border cell lineage. However, it is not clear what happens to the rest. This should be explained here and in all other quantifications.</p><p>Especially <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> need additional quantification to assess all clones analyzed for these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right in that the numbers were presented in a confusing manner, which we have improved in the revised version of our manuscript. Please refer to the response to the reviewer 1 to see an extended explanation of the clones involved in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>We have followed the advice of the reviewer and modified the way in which we present the quantifications. The revised version shows a more consistent description of clones, and we have added the relevant numbers (numbers of clones/ neuromasts/ cluster/ fish) to the text and figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would tremendously help in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> to additionally show a DAPI staining to clarify where the exact boundaries of the respective organs are. This would help to appreciate the exact location of the labeled cells. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> DAPI panels would additionally help to differentiate between real cell ablation and mere photobleaching of the marker.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe there is a confusion here. On fixed samples DAPI labels the nuclei of all cells, but in live embryos it only labels hair cells (the reviewer can check Seleit <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017). The experiments mentioned by the reviewer are all in vivo, and we do need the embryos to survive the imaging in order to analyse the short-term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) and long-term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) effects of the treatment – be it cell labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or cell ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Therefore, we cannot use DAPI to label all cells in the organ or organ boundaries.</p><p>In order to clarify the point that the reviewer raises, we have complemented the previous version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> with a scheme depicting our way to identify cell types. The boundary of the neural lineage and nBCs is evident when using a bright-field view (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We show cases combining bright-field views with a transgenic line labelling just mantle cells and with another transgenic line labelling all nuclei. Nuclei with an elongated shape at the external boundary were annotated as border cells, nuclei internal of the boundary were annotated as mantle cells – data confirmed by 3D reconstructions and data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1 &amp; 2</xref> – and nuclei in the inner part of the organ were annotated as support cells or hair cells depending on their location and size.</p><p>As for whether the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4 &amp; 6</xref> is a true ablation or mere photobleaching, we believe that the presence of both scar-tissue and puncta of the disassociated burst nuclei point towards a real cellular ablation. In addition, iterative imaging revealed that those cases resulted in a proper ablation, since the fluorescent signal was not recovered soon after the treatment – as it would be expected from mere photo-bleaching.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– As it is noted for<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> that mantle cells first coalesce and then re-enter the cell cycle, some BrdU or EdU staining should be performed to support this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Our observation of coalescence followed by mitotic activity was based on iterative imaging of the same organ during the regeneration period. We understand that our previous statement is strictly speaking incorrect – if a cell re-enters the cell cycle it is assumed that it had exited it, which is something we are not showing (in fact we have shown that mantle cells in medaka are cycling even under homeostatic conditions). We have therefore modified the sentence to more accurately reflect what we have learnt from the experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To underline the authors' findings in the live imaging approaches, an additional 4D reconstruction of the video should be shown. Z information would help to understand the source of the epithelial cells and when and how they interact with the neuromast cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer can find a detailed answer to this point in the essential revisions point 1, where we explain our different attempts to address membrane dynamics during the recruitment phase.</p><p>Regarding the changes in Z during the conversion from epithelial cells to nBCs, we have performed additional experiments to enhance the resolution in that axis, and present the data in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>. We observed that recruited nBCs are continuous with suprabasal epithelial cells and stay in that same Z plane. We also present a 3D reconstruction of one clone – <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref> – to show this continuity in a clearer way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Along the same lines, the authors should add 4D imaging of the double K15 transgenic line that also labels the cell membrane. This would clarify how the presumptive neuromast border cells contact the neural cells and how and when the associated cellular changes occur. This would also then link this data to the EM data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in which the authors suggest that cells are in contact with each other and share desmosomes. Otherwise, this data is never mentioned again in the manuscript or the discussion and falls a bit out of focus of the study. If neuromast and epidermal cells interact and this interaction leads to cell shape changes, this would be a substantial addition to the findings the authors present. As such experiments in the adult fish would probably take a long time, this set of experiments could also be performed in the developing larvae. As the authors have access to confocal as well as light sheet microscopes these experiments should be feasible with the current molecular markers used in the manuscript and would massively help to clarify a potential role of protrusions and cell-cell contacts.</p></disp-quote><p>Please find a detail answer above, essential revisions, point 1.</p><p>The EM data shows that cells of mature organs are in contact with each other. We do not know – and we do not claim – that the interactions observed in the EM images are the ones triggering the conversion of skin epithelial cells into nBCs. In the revised Discussion we now speculate that this interaction is a strong argument for a stem cell–niche interaction.</p><p>During the course of some experiments suggested by this and other reviewers, however, we closely followed the activity of membranes of neural stem cell precursors. We did observe (as the reviewer predicted) a dynamic and transient activity of membrane protrusions, but these were much longer than the ones observed by EM, and were not found in mature organs. We share the excitement of the reviewer regarding these newly identified membrane protrusions and this is indeed a line of research we will follow. We include a brief comment about them in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be very interesting to know how the tissue reacts in case border cells are depleted (for example by laser ablation as done in other experiments). Will new border cells be recruited? Will other cells transform? This data will reveal the biological function of the newly defined neuromast border cells. These experiments could also be done in developing larvae for time reasons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done the experiments suggested by the reviewer and present the new data in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. The reviewer can find a more detailed answer in the answer to the essential revisions, point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Even though the authors did not explicitly find lineages that give rise to both, neural and border cells, this possibility cannot be completely ruled out. The text should be adjusted accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the text accordingly stating that the existence of bi-potent cells cannot be excluded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Comprehensive analysis of lineage and fate with a variety of transgenic lines allows Seleit et al., to identify a K15+ population as the previously elusive population of stem cells that serves as a source of source of both neural and epidermal lineages in the growing and regenerating Medaka posterior lateral line neuromasts. Their analysis suggests that while some K15+ cells exclusively generate all the neural cells of the neuromast, others exclusively generate neuromast Border cells (nBC), a new epidermal sub-population defined by the authors that surrounds mantle cells and additional progeny that contribute exclusively to surrounding epidermal tissue. The authors also use EM to reveal intimate interactions between the mantle cells and the surrounding nBCs. The authors also emphasize how juxtaposition of a neural population, deposited by a migrating primordium, with its surrounding epidermal neighbors establishes interactions between cells of different embryonic origins to establish this stem cell niche. The results are clear and well laid out. The observations define a system that will serve well as a model for development of a stem cell niche in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive comments of the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I found the EM results, which show potential interactions between mantle cells and surrounding nBC cells to be quite intriguing. To me they were reminiscent of observations made in the Drosophila testis where germline stem cells insert microtubule based nanotubes (cytoplasmic processes) into associated niche cells to receive Dpp signals, which are required for Germline stem cell survival. http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v523/n7560/abs/nature14602.html In light of the Drosophila observations, I believe these observations in the neuromast are quite interesting, worth sharing, and should be explored further.</p></disp-quote><p>This is quite an interesting point and in the revised version of the discussion we do include a reference to the nanotubes. We also performed additional experiments to address the presence of protrusions detectable under confocal microscopy. Although we did not find major cytoplasmic extensions in mature organs, we were surprised to detect numerous dynamic protrusions during organogenesis. These were clearly different in morphology from the reported nanotubes, and we briefly speculate in the revised Discussion about their putative role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I did, however, have a difficult time initially understanding some genetic manipulations as I was not familiar with the Gaudi system. Some brief introduction to the Gaudi system would help. This is primarily a descriptive paper and will serve as an important baseline for future studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided a better description of the Gaudi methodology as requested by the reviewers – first sentences on the “<italic>nBCs constitute an independent life-long lineage</italic>” section. We have also complemented the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> with a scheme of the genetic tools used to generate permanently labelled clones and how they are used in the neuromast model – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
