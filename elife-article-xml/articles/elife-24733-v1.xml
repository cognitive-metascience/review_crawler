influx. Their plasma membrane abundance is an important factor in determining BK current and thus regulation of calcium-dependent events. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we show that ERG-28, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, promotes the trafficking of SLO-1 BK channels from the ER to the plasma membrane by shielding them from premature degradation. In the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 channels undergo aspartic protease DDI-1-dependent degradation, resulting in markedly reduced expression at presynaptic terminals. Loss of <italic>erg-28</italic> suppressed phenotypic defects of <italic>slo-1</italic> gain-of-function mutants in locomotion, neurotransmitter release, and calcium-mediated asymmetric differentiation of the AWC olfactory neuron pair, and conferred significant ethanol-resistant locomotory behavior, resembling <italic>slo-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants, albeit to a lesser extent. Our study thus indicates that the control of BK channel trafficking is a critical regulatory mechanism for synaptic transmission and neural function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24733.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24733.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>alcohol</kwd><kwd>BK channel</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chuang</surname><given-names>Chiou-Fen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Hongkyun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

These roles of BK channels result from the unique feature that full activation of the BK channel requires coincidental membrane depolarization and elevation in free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fakler and Adelman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999</xref>). BK channel activity is regulated by many factors including post-translational modifications, associating auxiliary subunits, its localization at the plasma membrane, and the number of channels expressed at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim and Oh, 2016</xref>). Despite its importance, how BK channel density at the plasma membrane is determined is not well understood. Several proteins have been reported to affect the surface membrane expression of BK channels. For instance, cytoskeletal proteins and cytoskeleton-interacting proteins, including actin, microtubule-associated protein 1A, and filamin A, are reported to alter the level of BK channels at the plasma membrane in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tian et al., 2006</xref>). A recent study showed that cereblon mediates the interaction of BK channels with CRL4A E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which causes ubiquitination of BK channels and their retention in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Blocking BK channel ubiquitination or disrupting the interaction between BK channels and CRL4A E3 ubiquitin ligase was shown to increase the surface expression of BK channels in vitro in transfected primary cultured neurons. However, most of the studies on BK channel trafficking have been performed in heterologous cells that are designed to overexpress BK channels. For this reason, whether proteins that are reported to influence BK channel trafficking in vitro alter BK channel levels in vivo has not been clearly addressed.</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> BKIP-1, a plasma membrane localized protein, was shown to increase the levels of SLO-1 BK channels at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to the expression level at the plasma membrane, SLO-1 localization at specific membrane microdomains also plays an important role in determining SLO-1 function. <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetic studies identified genes that control the localization of SLO-1 channels in both muscles and neurons: The dystrophin complex localizes SLO-1 channels near calcium channels in the sarcolemma of body wall muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). It was also shown that alpha-catulin and dystrobrevin hierarchically organize BK channels near calcium channels at presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oh et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Biogenesis of plasma membrane proteins begins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Once completely folded and assembled, most plasma membrane proteins are packaged in cargo vesicles that exit from the ER through the COPII-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zanetti et al., 2012</xref>). It appears that proteins with multiple transmembrane domains require ER membrane chaperons and cargo adaptor proteins for their efficient exit from the ER. For example, yeast Erv14 is a cargo receptor that links many client membrane proteins to the COPII coat adaptor and is required for the efficient trafficking of many polytopic membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herzig et al., 2012</xref>). It is not known if the BK channel requires an ER chaperone, or a cargo receptor for its efficient trafficking. In our present study, we identified an ER membrane protein that promotes BK channel expression at the plasma membrane.</p><p>In a <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetic screen designed to identify genes that regulate SLO-1 function, we identified the <italic>erg-28</italic> gene that is homologous to yeast and mammalian ERG28. We found that ERG-28 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is required for the trafficking of SLO-1 to the plasma membrane. In the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 is not efficiently trafficked to the plasma membrane and undergoes degradation. Accordingly, <italic>erg-28</italic> mutants exhibit phenotypes of <italic>slo-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants including ethanol-resistant locomotory behavior. Thus, ERG-28 offers a new regulatory point that controls the synaptic abundance of SLO-1 and thus neurotransmitter release.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A mutation in <italic>erg-28,</italic> a gene distantly related to yeast ergosterol biosynthesis 28, suppresses phenotypic defects of <italic>slo-1</italic> gain-of-function mutant</title><p>In a genetic screen designed to identify mutants that suppress the sluggish movement of a <italic>slo-1</italic> gain-of-function mutant, <italic>slo-1(ky399gf)</italic>, we identified <italic>cim16</italic> mutant.

The ERG28 protein sequence has diverged in higher organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Veitia and Hurst, 2001</xref>). These homologues possess four predicted transmembrane domains instead of the two transmembrane domains found in yeast and have acquired the ER retention/retrieval motif in the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although <italic>C. elegans</italic> ERG-28 retains four transmembrane domains and the ER retention/retrieval motif, it is further diverged from mammalian ERG28 proteins; it shows 22.2% identity (56.4% similarity) with the human homolog C14orf1 based on a non-overlapping local alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A nonsense mutation in <italic>cim16</italic> leaves the coding sequence intact, except for seven amino acids at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To ascertain that the genetic defect in <italic>erg-28</italic> is responsible for the suppression of the <italic>slo-1(ky399gf)</italic> phenotype rather than a background mutation, we tested two other independently isolated alleles, <italic>erg-28(gk697770)</italic> and <italic>erg-28(tm6168)</italic>, which were generated by the Million Mutation Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>) and the National BioResource Project, respectively. The <italic>erg-28(gk697770)</italic> allele has a nonsense mutation in the 33rd amino acid residue and the <italic>erg-28(tm6168)</italic> allele is a deletion/insertion allele that introduces a nonsense codon at 145th amino acid residue in addition to the deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We examined if <italic>erg-28</italic> mutation suppresses these phenotypes as well. <italic>erg-28</italic> mutation was partially able to suppress the egg laying defect, as <italic>erg-28(gk697770) slo-1(ky399gf)</italic> double mutants retained less eggs than the <italic>slo-1(ky399gf)</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A pair of AWC olfactory neurons differentiates into two distinctive subtypes; one that expresses the <italic>str-2</italic> gene (AWC<sup>ON</sup>) and the other that does not (AWC<sup>OFF</sup>). Contrary to wild-type animals, over 90% of the <italic>slo-1(ky399gf)</italic> mutant animals express the <italic>str-2</italic> gene in both of the AWC neurons (2 AWC<sup>ON</sup>). <italic>erg-28</italic> mutation was able to suppress this <italic>slo-1(ky399gf)</italic> phenotype, as less than 30% of the <italic>erg-28(gk697770) slo-1(ky399gf)</italic> double mutant animals express <italic>str-2</italic> genes in both AWC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Taken together we conclude that <italic>erg-28</italic> mutation suppresses the phenotypic defects of the <italic>slo-1(ky399gf)</italic> mutant in general and mutation in <italic>erg-28</italic> is most likely to result in a reduction of SLO-1 function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ERG-28 is required for SLO-1 function in synaptic transmission</title><p>Previous studies showed that SLO-1 channels provide a negative feedback response for calcium influx and thus negatively regulate synaptic transmission. Our previous study showed that <italic>slo-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants exhibit a prolonged evoked synaptic response, whereas <italic>slo-1(ky399gf)</italic> mutants exhibit a reduced evoked synaptic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sancar et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, we reasoned that if the underlying mechanism for the suppression of <italic>slo-1 (ky399gf)</italic> by <italic>erg-28</italic> mutation is reduction of SLO-1 function, it is expected that <italic>erg-28</italic> mutant would exhibit increased synaptic transmission. First, we sought to determine the pharmacological sensitivity to aldicarb, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. While mutant animals with decreased levels of cholinergic synaptic transmission are resistant to aldicarb-mediated paralysis, mutants with increased levels of synaptic transmission are hypersensitive to aldicarb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mahoney et al., 2006</xref>). We found that <italic>erg-28(gk697770)</italic> animals are hypersensitive to aldicarb.

The shared promoter region, 2.5 kb upstream of <italic>C14C10.5</italic>, was fused to GFP coding sequence, and the resulting construct was used to determine the tissue expression pattern of <italic>erg-28</italic>. The expression of <italic>erg-28</italic> was found in many different tissues, including muscles, intestine, and neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Promoters of operons are often promiscuous and expression of individual genes in the operons is controlled at a post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blumenthal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blumenthal et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, to evaluate <italic>erg-28</italic> gene expression, we generated an integrated transgenic line that expresses mCherry-tagged ERG-28 driven by the shared 2.5 kb promoter. In this transgenic line, ERG-28 expression is observed mainly in neurons and muscles, where SLO-1 is predominantly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). After establishing its expression pattern, we analyzed the subcellular localization of ERG-28 in neurons by expressing GFP-tagged ERG-28 in a subset of motor neurons (9 DA and DB cholinergic motor neurons) using 2.4 kb <italic>unc-129</italic> promoter along with the ER and Golgi markers. Localization of GFP-tagged ERG-28 most likely reflects endogenous ERG-28 localization, since GFP-tagged ERG-28 was able to rescue the loss of ERG-28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cell bodies and dendrites of the DA and DB neurons are located in the ventral cord, and their axons are located in the dorsal cord, thus allowing us to distinguish axons from dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colavita et al., 1998</xref>). We found that ERG-28 is abundantly expressed proximal to neuronal nuclei and localized as distinct puncta throughout the synaptic terminals and dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). ERG-28 puncta co-localize well with the ER marker (mCherry::PISY-1) and exhibit minimal co-localization with the Golgi marker (AMAN-2::mCherry) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results are consistent with previous studies that the ER extends to axonal and dendritic neural processes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brockie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rolls et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, the distribution of ERG-28 is not restricted to axon or dendrites, indicating that ERG-28 does not have axon-dendrite polarity. Like mammalian ERG28, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ERG-28 C-terminus has a well-established consensus ER retrieval/retention motif (KKXX-COOH), which interacts with coat protein complex I (COPI) that mediates retrograde transport of target proteins from the <italic>cis</italic>-end of the Golgi complex to the ER, thereby ensuring the ER localization of the target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson, 2014</xref>). When GFP-tagged <italic>erg-28Δ7</italic> lacking 7 amino acids at the C terminus as in <italic>cim16</italic> allele was expressed in the DA and DB motor neurons, the overall expression was significantly decreased and normal punctate structures were no longer visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We cannot determine if the functional defect of the <italic>cim16</italic> allele is due to a structural instability independently of defective ER localization or localization defect caused by the absence of the ER retrieval sequence. Since the <italic>cim16</italic> allele suppresses <italic>slo-1(ky399gf)</italic> allele as effectively as <italic>gk697770</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), it is very likely that the C-terminal 7 amino acids are important for the stable expression and localization of ERG-28. The presence of the COPI binding motif in ERG-28 strongly suggests that ERG-28 shuttles between ER and Golgi. Indeed, we find that some of the ERG-28 puncta are mobile (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). These observations suggest that ERG-28 is localized to the ER membrane through COPI interaction.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24733.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ERG-28 is an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein expressed in muscles and neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>erg-28</italic> is a part of an operon with <italic>C14C10.5</italic>. 2.5 kb upstream of <italic>C14C10.5</italic> gene including 30 bp of coding region of <italic>C14C10.5</italic> was fused with GFP (<italic>cimEx54[erg-28p::gfp, ttx-3p::mRFP]</italic>).

To examine if SLO-1::GFP puncta in <italic>erg-28</italic> mutant are correctly localized at the presynaptic terminals as in the wild type animals, we generated a line that expresses fRFP fused ELKS-1, an active zone marker, by genome editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). First, the genome edited line, <italic>cim107[elks-1::fRFP],</italic> was crossed with <italic>cim105</italic> and we examined whether SLO-1::GFP co-localizes with ELKS-1::fRFP. We find that SLO-1::GFP and ELKS-1::fRFP are well co-localized although we occasionally observed that some SLO-1::GFP puncta that did not co-localize with ELKS-1::fRFP, and <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). While we and others previously observed broad SLO-1 expression in cell bodies of neurons with integrated transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oh et al., 2015</xref>), we did not observe such expression in the cell bodies with <italic>cim105[slo-1::GFP]</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In the <italic>erg-28</italic> mutant, the SLO-1 puncta were co-localized with ELKS-1::fRFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These results indicate that ERG-28 is required for the normal level of SLO-1 expression in muscles and neurons, but not for the localization at either presynaptic terminals or dense bodies in muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ERG-28 promotes SLO-1 trafficking to the plasma membrane</title><p>At the steady state level, ERG-28 is localized in the ER and SLO-1 is at the plasma membrane. How is an ER resident protein required for the normal expression of a plasma membrane localized protein? As a plasma membrane-localized protein, SLO-1 must be trafficked through the ER and Golgi complex to its final location at the plasma membrane. Thus, ERG-28 is likely to play a role during the biogenesis of SLO-1 in the ER or transport from the ER to the Golgi complex. Given their steady state localization and the mobile nature of ERG-28, the interaction between ERG-28 and SLO-1 is expected to be transient, if it occurs at all. Indeed, we find that SLO-1::GFP puncta rarely co-localize with mCherry::ERG-28 puncta although potential co-localization can be occasionally observed in neuronal cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, ERG-28 is most likely to function in ER for the efficient trafficking of SLO-1 to the plasma membrane.</p><p>If ERG-28 is required for SLO-1 transport from the ER to the Golgi complex, we would expect to see an accumulation of SLO-1 in the ER in <italic>erg-28</italic> mutants. However, SLO-1 accumulation in the ER was not observed in <italic>erg-28</italic> mutants. Thus, we hypothesized that in the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 is degraded by the proteasome. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether treatment with a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib) would increase SLO-1 expression in the ER or at the plasma membrane. When <italic>erg-28</italic> mutant animals were grown in the presence of bortezomib, SLO-1 expression at presynaptic terminals, but not in cell bodies, was increased by 50%, while the wild type animals showed no statistically significant change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This suggests that ERG-28 protects SLO-1 from degradation in the ER and is not an obligatory factor for SLO-1 exit from the ER. Thus, the lower expression level of SLO-1 at the plasma membrane in <italic>erg-28</italic> mutant is at least in part due to proteasomal degradation.</p><p>To identify genes responsible for the SLO-1 degradation in <italic>erg-28</italic> mutants, we tested some of the genes implicated in the ERAD (ER associated degradation) and proteasomal degradation pathway to determine whether their reduction of function would increase SLO-1 expression in <italic>erg-28(gk697770)</italic> mutant. From this approach, we identified <italic>ddi-1</italic> as a gene that participates in the degradation of SLO-1 in <italic>erg-28</italic> mutants. <italic>ddi-1</italic> is an orthologue of yeast and human DDI1, which is thought to be a shuttling factor that delivers ubiquitinated substrates to proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabriely et al., 2008</xref>). In yeast, DDI-1 appears to act as a negative regulator for general exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">White et al., 2011</xref>). Compared to wild type, the <italic>ddi-1(ok1468)</italic> single mutant did not show any significant difference in SLO-1 expression level in neurons and muscles. However, <italic>ddi-1(ok1468);erg-28(gk697770)</italic> double mutants showed a significantly higher expression of SLO-1 at the plasma membrane than the <italic>erg-28(gk697770)</italic> single mutant, albeit to a lesser extent than wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>).

Calcium influx is precisely controlled by several layers of regulatory mechanisms. The BK channel is one of the important negative regulators of calcium influx. The efflux of K<sup>+</sup> repolarizes the synaptic terminal, thereby limiting the duration of voltage-gated calcium channel activity. The BK channel current is impacted by many factors, including channel-associated auxiliary factors, post-translational channel modifications, and the number of the channels expressed at the plasma membrane. Our study demonstrates that the density of BK channels at presynaptic terminals influences synaptic transmission and neuronal function, and that ERG-28, an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, promotes the transport of SLO-1 BK channels from the ER to the plasma membrane. In <italic>erg-28</italic> mutants, the number of SLO-1 channels at presynaptic terminals is drastically reduced, leading to an alcohol resistance, and the suppression of phenotypic defects of <italic>slo-1(gf)</italic> mutants such as locomotory behavior, synaptic transmission, and altered chemosensory receptor gene expression.</p><p>ERG28 was originally identified in yeast as a scaffold in the ER to tether a group of ergosterol synthesizing enzymes, which form a sterol C4 demethylase complex. In higher organisms, however, ERG28 appears to have diverged from yeast ERG28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vinci et al., 2008</xref>). The number of ERG28 transmembrane domains changed from two to four, and its C-terminus acquired a COPI binding consensus sequence, which allows for recycling between the ER and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). While the involvement of ERG28 in cholesterol synthesis has not been studied in mammals, a recent study in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> showed that ERG28 tethers C4 demethylase components, but does not interrupt the sterol pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mialoundama et al., 2013</xref>). Instead, mutation in <italic>ERG28</italic> results in accumulation of cryptic sterol biosynthetic intermediates and consequent inhibition of polar auxin transport. <italic>C. elegans</italic> is not able to synthesize cholesterol de novo, and thus obtains the final sterol products from plants or mammals, such as ergosterol, sitosterol, and cholesterol. In the laboratory, cholesterol is added into the culture medium to maintain <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Substitution of cholesterol with lanosterol, which is a precursor of cholesterol that has a C4 methyl group, does not allow <italic>C. elegans</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>C. elegans</italic> does not possess biologically active known cholesterol C4 methyl derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mahanti et al., 2014</xref>). Our analysis shows that the genes we examined that encode candidate C4 demethylase enzymes do not affect SLO-1 function. While we cannot completely rule out the possibility that distantly related C4 demethylase components redundantly influence SLO-1 function, it is possible that ERG-28 may function independently of sterol synthesis. For instance, it is reported that hERG28 interacts with CLN8, an ER-resident membrane protein involved in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Passantino et al., 2013</xref>). CLN8 mutation in humans causes altered levels of sphingolipid and phospholipid. Whether ERG-28 directly mediates SLO-1 channel folding and trafficking or indirectly fosters the lipid environment conducive to SLO-1 channel folding and trafficking needs to be further investigated.</p><p>In the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 expression is drastically reduced at presynaptic terminals and muscle excitation sites and inhibition of proteasome function can partially restore the SLO-1 expression and function. This suggests that in the absence of ERG-28 in the ER, functional SLO-1 channels can still be transported to the plasma membrane. Also, in the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 does not appear to accumulate in cell bodies. Thus, ERG-28 is not an obligatory factor necessary for the ER exit of SLO-1. Plasma membrane-localized channels and receptors are folded and assembled in the ER and this process is closely monitored by the ER resident protein quality control system to ensure that only correctly folded and assembled channels are trafficked forward to the plasma membrane and to avoid aggregation of misfolded hydrophobic transmembrane domains. It is not clearly understood how cells discriminate folding/assembly intermediates from misfolded proteins in ER. In yeast, amino acid permeases require an ER chaperone to ensure that folding intermediates are not targeted for degradation prematurely, thereby facilitating trafficking to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kota et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuehn et al., 1996</xref>). The SLO-1 channel consists of four pore-forming α subunits and auxiliary subunits, and may require a molecular chaperone that aids channel folding and assembly. Our data support the model in which ERG-28 acts as a chaperone for SLO-1 channel folding/assembly intermediates so that they are not prematurely recognized as misfolded proteins and targeted for degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is also possible that ERG-28 may participate in SLO-1 channel trafficking. Designated ER proteins for specific ion channel folding/assembly and trafficking are common, and include RIC-3 that promotes nicotinic acetylcholine receptor surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Halevi et al., 2002</xref>), CALF-1 that facilitates synaptic localization of UNC-2 voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saheki and Bargmann, 2009</xref>), and NLF-1 that regulates axonal localization of NALC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). Currently, we cannot demonstrate if there is a direct physical interaction between SLO-1 and ERG-28 in vivo. We predict that the physical interaction would be transient and restricted to the folding/assembly intermediates of SLO-1 channels. It is also likely that ERG-28 has other functions independent of SLO-1 channels. For example, ERG-28 is equally distributed to the dendrites and axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), whereas SLO-1 is relatively specific to axons, suggesting its involvement in the trafficking of dendritic membrane proteins. Further studies are needed to identify additional targets of ERG-28 function.</p><p>We attempted to evaluate if ERG-28 function is conserved in mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Three out of four transgenic lines were able to partially rescue <italic>erg-28(cim16)</italic> mutation. This partial rescue could be due to the low primary sequence conservation or sub-optimal expression. Further studies are needed to definitively assess the functional conservation between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammalian ERG28 proteins.</p><p>We identified <italic>ddi-1</italic> as one of the factors that participate in the degradation of SLO-1 in the absence of ERG-28. <italic>ddi-1</italic> is an orthologue of yeast and mammalian DDI1. Molecular functions of DDI are presently poorly understood. However, it appears to have functions in proteasome-dependent protein degradation and general secretion in yeast. The aspartyl proteinase domain of the yeast DDI1 is important for its function as a negative regulator of general secretion. Recently, the aspartyl proteinase activity of DDI-1 was shown to be required for the activation of the ER-associated SKN-1 isoform during proteasomal dysfunction in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lehrbach and Ruvkun, 2016</xref>). However, its function under normal conditions is not yet known. Further study is needed to determine if DDI-1 participates in the degradation of SLO-1 directly or indirectly in the absence of ERG-28.</p><p>The SLO-1 BK channel is a well-known alcohol target mediating physiological and behavioral alcohol responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dopico et al., 1996</xref>). Our imaging data showed that <italic>erg-28</italic> mutation reduces the synaptic SLO-1 levels and confers ethanol-resistant locomotory behavior. The SLO-1 levels and behavioral ethanol response were reversed when <italic>ddi-1</italic> mutation was introduced to <italic>erg-28</italic> mutants. Previous studies indicated that functional alcohol tolerance has a correlation with BK channel levels at the plasma membrane, although the mechanisms by which its levels are controlled appear to involve several distinct steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palacio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pietrzykowski et al., 2008</xref>). Given that our current study shows that SLO-1 levels are controlled by ERG-28/DDI-1 in the ER, it is tempting to speculate that ERG-28/DDI-1 adjusts overall SLO-1 levels depending on cellular stress or physiological necessity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains and maintenance</title><p>All <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were cultured on NGM (nematode growth medium) plates seeded with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 at 20°C.

A DNA mixture adjusted to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml with pBluescript DNA was injected into the gonads of hermaphrodites.

When transgenes were used to determine co-localization, transgene DNA concentrations (<italic>myo-3</italic> promoter-based constructs: 2 ng/ml and <italic>unc-129</italic> promoter: 2 ng/ml) were kept low to achieve low level expression.

This method is based on the observation that if one gene undergoes a double strand break (DBS) and subsequent homologous repair, the second gene that is targeted together with the first in the same injection is more likely to undergo ‘co-conversion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arribere et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, we injected into the gonads of wild-type hermaphrodites a DNA mixture that includes a <italic>slo-1</italic> sgRNA construct and a repair GFP plasmid construct, a <italic>dpy-10</italic> sgRNA construct and a <italic>dpy-10</italic> homologous repair oligonucleotide (99 bp). The <italic>dpy-10</italic> sgRNA will lead to a DSB, and its aberrant non-homologous end-joining repair will lead to the Dpy (dumpy) phenotype in F2 homozygous animals. However, if this DSB is repaired by a homologous repair oligonucleotide, which contains a dominant mutation, the resulting F1 animals will exhibit the dominant Rol (roller) phenotype. We picked Rol animals in the F1 and genotyped them for GFP insertion. For a reason we cannot explain, the efficiency of <italic>slo-1</italic> CRISPR and homologous repair was extremely low, even though we tried 10 different <italic>slo-1</italic> sgRNAs and several different repair constructs. We injected over 350 animals, screened over 1200 F1 Rol lines for ‘co-conversion’ by PCR, and recovered only one line in which GFP is correctly inserted in-frame into the 9 bp upstream from the end of the <italic>slo-1</italic> gene. The same ‘co-conversion’ method was used for the insertion of FusionRed to the last exon of the <italic>elks-1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;ERG-28 controls BK channel trafficking in the ER to regulate synaptic function and alcohol response in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work can not presently be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers and editors appreciate the potential importance of the findings but felt that a critical mechanistic aspect of ERG-28 function was not properly addressed. Experiments to address this concern are straight-forward, but require more than the standard 2 month revision time that we allow for revisions.

We have now examined ERG-28 subcellular localization in muscle cells. Given that GFP-tagged ERG-28 is functional, we expressed GFP::ERG-28 together with either the ER marker PISY-1::mCherry or the Golgi maker AMAN-2::mCherry in muscle cells. To ensure a low level of expression, we used a low concentration of the expression construct <italic>myo- 3p::gfp::erg-28</italic> and <italic>myo-3p::PISY-1::mCherry</italic> (or <italic>AMAN-2::mCherry</italic>). As the reviewer pointed out, ER and Golgi exhibit completely different patterns in muscle cells. GFP::ERG-28 does not co-localize with the Golgi marker. By contrast, GFP::ERG-28 well co-localizes with PISY-1::mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref>).</p><p>We imaged body wall muscle cells by acquiring Z-stack images from the muscle interior (the muscle belly) to the muscle plasma membrane. If native localization of GFP::ERG-28 is the plasma membrane rather than ER, one would expect that GFP::ERG-28 signals would be strong in the stacks that represent the plasma membrane. However, our cross comparison with the ER marker shows that GFP::ERG-28 signals were not high in the stacks representing the plasma membrane, indicating that ERG-28 localizes in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition to these new results, ERG-28 has a well-defined classical ER retention/retrieval sequence motif, -KKXX-COOH, which is also called the dilysine motif. In fact, other studies have shown that this dilysine motif in the C-terminus is critical for determining ER localization. For example, a Golgi protein can be redistributed to the ER by attaching this dilysine motif to its C- terminus (Gorleku et al.). Another example is that a gap junction protein can be trapped in the ER by attaching this motif (Maza et al.). The mutant, <italic>cim16</italic>, that we isolated in our unbiased genetic screen has a mutation that deletes 7 C- terminal amino acid residues.

This is particularly a concern for Million Mutation project alleles which have been heavily mutagenized.</italic></p><p>The points raised in these paragraphs are addressed above.</p><p><italic>3) Materials and methods: there is little to no information about molecular biology and exact genotypes of strains. Given the absence of length restrictions in this journal, this lack of detail is incomprehensible.</italic></p><p>We have added a list of strains with detailed genotypes and a list of plasmid constructs used in this study to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) erg-28 is part of an operon with a gene involved in proteasome function (proteasome activator subunit 4). Given the model involving SLO-1 degradation proposed by the authors, this should be discussed. For example, could we expect that the missense mutation in erg-28(gk697770) would affect the mRNA stability of the first gene of the operon, causing ERG-28-independent effects on proteasome function?</italic></p><p>Transcription from an operon generates a polycistronic pre-mRNA that is co- transcriptionally processed by cleavage and polyadenylation at the 3’ end of each gene, thus generating separate mature mRNAs. It is very unlikely that a point mutation in the downstream gene would have effects on the pre-mRNA processing and stability of the processed mature mRNAs of upstream genes. We added a reference that addresses this. Importantly, if the <italic>erg-28</italic> mutation caused reduction of function in the proteasome activator subunit 4 gene and consequent reduction of proteasome dependent degradation, it may increase, but not decrease, SLO-1 channel levels.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] 1) Does ERG-28 do anything else? For instance, does it modulate abundance of other proteins with consequences on behavior? This may explain why the erg-28;slo-1(gf) mutant is hypersensitive to aldicarb, and the erg-28 single mutant is hypersensitive relative to the slo-1(lf) mutant. This could be tested by assaying behavioral, aldicarb, and electrophysiological phenotypes for the erg-28;slo-1(lf) double mutant vs. slo-1 and erg-28 single mutants.</italic></p><p><italic>2) Likewise, it would be good to test whether another membrane protein(s) changes abundance via COTI-dependent interaction via ERG-28.</italic></p><p>As stated above, we presently do not know of any other membrane proteins whose trafficking is influenced by ERG-28. While this is an interesting possibility, it is beyond the scope of the present study which focuses on the regulation of SLO-1.</p><p><italic>3) Does erg-28 overexpression yield excess SLO-1 in the membrane? Overexpression of slo-1 has consequences for all developmental, behavioral and physiological phenotypes in the manuscript. A positive result would be interesting because it may suggest that basal degradation of SLO-1 is poised to influence these phenotypes.</italic></p><p>This is an interesting point. We examined a transgenic animal line overexpressing <italic>erg-28,</italic> but we did not observe any measurable increase in SLO-1 channels or uncoordinated locomotory phenotype as seen in the <italic>slo- 1(gf)</italic> mutant. However, due to the limited quantitative resolution of SLO- 1::GFP, it may not be possible to detect a small increase that does not manifest as severely as in <italic>slo-1(gf)</italic> mutant.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been much improved through additional experiments and is almost ready for acceptance now. There are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic></p><p><italic>1) It is still confusing whether the GFP-tagged ERG-28 transgene shown to restore speed to slo-1(gf);cim16 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> was the same exact transgene used to investigate neuron expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> as is suggested in the first paragraph of the subsection “ERG-28 is an ER resident membrane protein expressed in neurons and muscles”. This is a subtle but important issue because if the GFP::ERG-28 transgene was not used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, there may be no evidence that it functions in vivo with SLO-1. The two rescued strains appear to use different promoters: H20 panneuronal for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and Punc-129 for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. Please clarify because one transgene might express at different levels or be regulated differently that may affect whether it accumulates in ER.</italic></p><p>The pan-neuronal H20 promoter in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (rescue of <italic>erg-28;slo-1(gf)</italic> locomotory phenotype) and the <italic>unc-129</italic> promoter in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> (localization of ERG-28 in neurons) were used to express GFP-tagged ERG-28. We used the <italic>unc-129</italic> promoter in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> instead of the H20 promoter because we felt that the pan-neuronal H20 promoter was not suitable for investigating subcellular localization of GFP::ERG-28. Pan-neuronal expression of GFP::ERG-28 from the H20 promoter makes it difficult to discern axons, dendrites, and individual cell bodies because of the high density of neurons in the ventral cord. By contrast, because the <italic>unc-129</italic> promoter drives expression only in the DA/DB cholinergic motor neurons, the exact localization of GFP::ERG-28 in axons, dendrites, and cell bodies is easily discernible. The DA/DB neurons innervate the dorsal body wall muscle that is essential for forward and backward movements (As described in our previous response, <italic>erg-28</italic> is likely to be expressed in these neurons). For this reason, the <italic>unc-129</italic> promoter has been widely used to investigate the localization or dynamics of GFP-tagged synaptic proteins by ourselves and others. For example, we previously used the <italic>unc-129</italic> promoter to study presynaptic localization of SLO-1 and the UNC-2 voltage gated calcium channel (Oh et al. BMC Neuroscience (2015) 16:26). Over-expression of the plasma membrane proteins may lead to a minor ectopic ER localization in addition to their normal localization. In the case of ERG-28, we did not find any other localization besides ER with our imaging setup. While we used the H20 and <italic>unc-129</italic> promoters to express GFP-tagged ERG-28 for specific purposes, it is unlikely that these different promoters would make a profound difference to the subcellular localization of ERG-28.</p><p>We made a change in the subsection “ERG-28 is an ER resident membrane protein expressed in neurons and muscles”: “Localization of GFP-tagged ERG-28 most likely reflects endogenous ERG-28 localization, since GFP-tagged ERG-28 was able to rescue the loss of ERG-28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).”</p><p><italic>2) Because it is important that the reader understand that fluorophore-tagged proteins could rescue behavior and expression level of the BK channel, I recommend that all figures, not just legends, note this more obviously rather than solely note the transgene code.</italic></p><p>We made changes in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, so that fluorescent protein-tagged proteins are easily noted.</p><p><italic>3) Wouldn't it be clearer to state &quot;Loss of erg-28 suppressed..&quot; rather than &quot;erg-28 mutation suppresses…&quot; in the Abstract?</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer and changed to “Loss of erg-28 suppressed…” in the Abstract.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows that the erg-28 mutant displays moderate resistance to intoxication, but nowhere near the strong resistance shown by slo-1(lf). So the statement in the Abstract &quot;erg-28 mutation…confers ethanol resistant locomotory behavior that resembles slo-1 loss-of-function mutants.&quot; should be corrected.</italic></p><p>We have changed the Abstract. Now it reads “conferred significant ethanol-resistant locomotory behavior, resembling <italic>slo-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants, albeit to a lesser extent.”</p><p>Because of this change, we had to make some minor adjustment in the Abstract to meet the 150-word limit.</p><p><italic>5) Please do not italicize &quot;and&quot; in the subsection “Worm strains and maintenance”.</italic> </p><p>It is corrected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
