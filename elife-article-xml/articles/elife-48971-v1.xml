Elucidating the neural implementation underpinning the dynamic construction of mental imagery is critical to understanding high-order cognitive function in the human brain. Here, we applied a frequency-tagging method to isolate the top-down process of speech mental imagery from bottom-up sensory-driven activities and concurrently tracked the neural processing time scales corresponding to the two processes in human subjects. Notably, by estimating the source of the magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals, we identified isolated brain networks activated at the imagery-rate frequency. In contrast, more extensive brain regions in the auditory temporal cortex were activated at the stimulus-rate frequency. Furthermore, intracranial stereotactic electroencephalogram (sEEG) evidence confirmed the participation of the inferior frontal gyrus in generating speech mental imagery. Our results indicate that a disassociated neural network underlies the dynamic construction of speech mental imagery independent of auditory perception.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>speech mental imagery</kwd><kwd>MEG</kwd><kwd>sEEG</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81790650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Jia-Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81790651</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Jia-Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81727808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Jia-Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>41830037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Jia-Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFC0108901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Jia-Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009592</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z171100000117012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Jia-Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shenzhen Peacock Plan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KQTD2015033016104926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Jia-Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018M641046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Lingxi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31421003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Jia-Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A disassociated neural network underlies the dynamic construction of speech mental imagery independent of auditory perception.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>People can generate internal representations in the absence of external stimulation, for example, by speaking or singing in their minds. This experience is referred to as mental imagery, which reflects a higher cognitive function of the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kosslyn et al., 2001</xref>). Speech mental imagery is among the most pervasive human experiences, and it has been estimated that people spend more than one-quarter of their lifetime engaged in such inner experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heavey and Hurlburt, 2008</xref>). Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported distributed neural networks involving the left pars opercularis in the inferior frontal cortex (Brocaâs area) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aleman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kleber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papoutsi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koelsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Price, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2016</xref>), the premotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Price, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kleber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koelsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aleman et al., 2005</xref>), the inferior parietal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kleber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2016</xref>), the middle frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2016</xref>), the anterior part of the insula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koelsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aleman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackermann and Riecker, 2004</xref>), and the superior temporal gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aleman et al., 2005</xref>) that can be activated by speech mental imagery. However, limited by the temporal resolution of the fMRI technique, the neural dynamics of speech mental imagery have been mostly overlooked.</p><p>Neuronal information processing is shaped by multiscale oscillatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">BuzsÃ¡ki and Draguhn, 2004</xref>), in which subjective experience in consciousness involves ongoing neural dynamics on the time scale of hundreds of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dehaene and Changeux, 2011</xref>). Therefore, establishing a neurophysiological model of speech mental imagery is highly important for elucidating the spectral-temporal features of imagery-induced neural activity. However, in the experimental environment, tracking subjectsâ internal subjective representations in milliseconds remains highly challenging due to the lack of external signals identifying imagery-related neural activity. Considering the limitations of the current methodologies, several neurophysiological studies have used the imagery-perception repetition paradigm to measure the sensory attenuation effect caused by speech mental imagery on subsequent auditory perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tian and Poeppel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tian and Poeppel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ylinen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Whitford et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tian et al., 2018</xref>). Preliminary magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies have shown that the modulatory effect of imagined speech on the amplitude of event-related responses to a subsequent auditory stimulus with matched pitch and/or content occurs as early as 100 to 200 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tian and Poeppel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tian and Poeppel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ylinen et al., 2015</xref>), and in an electroencephalogram (EEG) study, N1 suppression was observed when a matched phoneme was generated covertly before an audible phoneme was presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Whitford et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tian et al. (2018)</xref> examined the influence of imagined speech on the perceived loudness of a subsequent syllable and demonstrated the involvement of the sensory-driven cortex (i.e. the auditory cortex) in the early-stage interaction of speech imagery and perception. These neurophysiological findings implicate the early involvement of sensory-related neural substrates in the process of speech mental imagery, while in the adaptation paradigm, the neural pathway of top-down mental imagery cannot be disentangled from the bottom-up perception. To date, the neural dynamics of mental imagery independent of auditory perception remain puzzling.</p><p>Frequency-tagging is a promising approach for disentangling exogenous and endogenous processes when the corresponding neural activity changes periodically at different frequencies. Recently, frequency-tagging has been used to characterize higher-lever processes such as music rhythmic perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nozaradan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lenc et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nozaradan et al., 2018</xref>) and speech linguistic construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sheng et al., 2019</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nozaradan et al. (2011)</xref> asked eight musicians to imagine a binary/ternary meter when listening to a constant beat and found spectral responses not only to the beat stimulation but also to the imagined meters of this beat. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al. (2016)</xref> reported cortical responses to internally constructed linguistic structures such as words, phrases and sentences at different frequencies during the comprehension of connected speech. Therefore, frequency-tagging is an excellent candidate as an approach for capturing the dynamic features during the internal construction of speech mental imagery by tagging the corresponding neural activity in the frequency domain.</p><p>Here, we apply the frequency-tagging method in a behavioral task involving speech mental imagery to experimentally isolate the neural manifestations of internally constructed speech from the stimulus-driven processes. In this way, we are able to directly track the neural processing time scales of speech mental imagery in the frequency domain (in our experiment, we manipulated the imagery-rate frequency to 0.8 Hz). Furthermore, we used the MEG source estimation method to localize the neural underpinnings of the isolated processes of speech imagery independent of the bottom-up auditory perception and confirmed the localization of the neural sources by intracranial stereotactic electroencephalogram (sEEG) recordings. We hypothesized that in addition to the sensory-driven auditory cortex, distinctive neural networks are responsible for generating speech mental imagery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cortical tracking of speech mental imagery</title><p>In the MEG study, we aimed to identify the cortical representations of speech mental imagery independent of stimulus-driven responses. We constructed a 4 Hz sequence of auditory stimuli that were mentally organized into 0.8 Hz groups by a speech mental imagery task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Specifically, participants were asked to count in their minds following a sequence of 50 ms pure tones presented at 250 ms onset-to-onset intervals, and they were instructed to count from 1 to 10 in groups of 5 numbers (<bold>1</bold>, 2, 3, 4, 5, <bold>2</bold>, 2, 3, 4, 5, <bold>3</bold>, 2, 3, 4, 5â¦<bold>10</bold>, 2, 3, 4, 5) until the 50 pure tones terminated. As a result, when the subjects were performing the task, the spectral peaks were significant at the frequency of 0.8 Hz, corresponding to the grouping-rate rhythm of the mental imagery (<italic>t</italic><sub>19</sub>Â =Â 5.33, p=4.2Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â4</sup>, Cohenâs dÂ =Â 1.19, one-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> test, false discovery rate [FDR] corrected), and at the frequency of 4 Hz, corresponding to the rate of the auditory stimuli (<italic>t</italic><sub>19</sub>Â =Â 18.45, corrected p=3.0Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â12</sup>, Cohenâs dÂ =Â 4.13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).

More specifically, the left central-frontal lobe, the left inferior occipital lobe and the right inferior parietal lobe contribute to the spectral responses generated by speech mental imagery. Furthermore, the detection of imagery-induced neural signals in the left central-frontal lobe, particularly the region of the operIFG, in rare intracranial cases confirms the reliability of the minimum L1-norm estimation methods in solving the inverse problem for MEG data in our study.</p><p>Mental imagery has been proposed to be essentially an attention-guided memory retrieval process, for example, in the visual domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ishai et al., 2002</xref>). Mental imagery of speech not only recruits the pathway by which phonological, lexical, or semantic details are retrieved from the memory system but also requires planned articulation that is simulated internally to enable the individuals to have the subjective experiences of their mental imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tian and Poeppel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2016</xref>). In our study, the task of rhythmic inner counting produced cyclical neural signals that were captured in the frequency domain, reflecting the top-down regulation of the internally constructed mental imagery. The operational definition of speech mental imagery condition, namely, the rhythmic inner counting task, is not only related to the internal representations of speech but also requires high levels of working memory. To count following a rapid sequence of sounds presented at a 250 ms onset-to-onset interval, the brain must maintain the mental representations of the last group of 5 numbers (or at least of the beginning number) and construct the ongoing imagery of the subsequent group of 5 numbers concurrently with the sound stimuli. Additionally, the participants needed to verbally name the numbers and count âloudlyâ in their minds. It is worth mentioning that the rhythmic inner counting task in our study eliminated the influence of bottom-up sensory-driven processes by using the same pure tones as the stimuli and investigated the pure top-down processes of speech mental imagery independent of bottom-up perception. This is different from the typical silent counting task used in evoking P300 responses, which largely depends on the sensory perception and anticipation of the bottom-up physical features of the stimulus. The 0.8 Hz rhythmic mental operation activated the region of the left IOG, which is reported to be associated with verbal representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saito et al., 2012</xref>) and memory maintenance in numeral processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daitch et al., 2016</xref>), and the region of the right IPL, which is associated with auditory working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paulesu et al., 1993</xref>) and has also been proposed to be activated in imagined singing and imagined movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kleber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lebon et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, our study shows that the ventral PrG and PoG are also activated during the construction of speech imagery, which is consistent with previous findings that stronger activation of the sensorimotor cortex induced by articulatory imagery than hearing imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2016</xref>) and the direct neural signal from the sensorimotor cortex contributed to the decoding of imagined speech and silent reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, a firm conclusion on the contribution of the sensorimotor cortex to the construction of speech mental imagery will only be possible after controlling for any articulator movement in future studies. Furthermore, consistent with previous findings in fMRI studies suggesting that Brocaâs area (operIFG) is activated during the silent articulation of speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aleman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kleber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papoutsi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koelsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Price, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2016</xref>), the imagery-enhanced spectral responses in the region of the operIFG are not only identified in the MEG neural sources but also detected in the intracranial focal recordings, confirming the involvement of the higherÂ order frontal cortex in the dynamic construction of speech mental imagery. Taken together, these results show for the first time that the disassociated neural networks underlying the internal organization of speech mental imagery are independent of auditory perception. Because we identified only the operIFG as a neural source in the speech mental imagery due to the limited intracranial cases in the present sEEG experiment, more work is still needed to investigate the role of the left IOG and right IPL in the neural pathways underlying speech mental imagery.</p><p>Mixed evidence exists regarding the relationship between imagery and perception. One line of evidence suggests that mental imagery and sensory perception share common processes; for instance, the visual cortex can also be activated by visual imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kosslyn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stokes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dijkstra et al., 2017</xref>), and the auditory cortex is recruited during the imagination of music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zatorre and Halpern, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kraemer et al., 2005</xref>). However, other studies have suggested that differentiated neural substrates underlie these two processes; for example, brain-damaged patients with impaired object recognition have normal visual imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrmann et al., 1992</xref>), and the primary auditory cortex is activated by overt singing but not imagined singing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kleber et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tian et al. (2018)</xref> shed light on this issue by investigating the imagery-perception adaptation effect in speech mental imagery and found that imagined speech modulates the perceived loudness of a subsequent speech stimulus, demonstrating the overlapping neural underpinnings of the auditory cortex underlying the two processes of imagery and perception. Limited by the imagery-perception repetition paradigm, Tian et al. did not illustrate the role of non-overlapping brain regions that might be involved in the modulatory effect of imagery on perceived loudness. In our study, we address this gap by disassociating the two processes of imagery and perception, which were precisely frequency-tagged, and identifying the specific neural sources of speech mental imagery independent of auditory perception. We show that the auditory cortex was not engaged in neural activation at an imagery-rate frequency of 0.8 Hz. Instead, some isolated neural clusters, including the higherÂ order frontal cortex, were recruited at the imagery-rate frequency, reflecting the non-overlapping neural populations underlying the two distinctive processes of speech imagery and auditory perception. Notably, during the imagery task, the spectral power at the stimulus-rate frequency was weakened at the local contacts of the middle STG according to the sEEG recordings, indicating a potential imagery-driven suppression of auditory perception that fits well with the results of previous adaptation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tian and Poeppel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tian and Poeppel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ylinen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Whitford et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tian et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, we uncovered a reverse correlation between the grand averaged power at the imagery-rate frequency and the stimulus-rate frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), which might have resulted from the reallocation of limited cognitive resources between the low-level auditory representation and high-level imagery construction. The crucial role of the (left-lateralized) frontal cortex in the top-down control mechanism has been well demonstrated in the speech perception literature with the account of predictive coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cope et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sohoglu et al. (2012)</xref> also found opposite effects of top-down expectations and bottom-up sensory details on the evoked response in the STG. Based on these findings, we propose that the higherÂ order cortex (i.e. the inferior frontal cortex) is engaged in the dynamic organization of speech mental imagery, which might modulate neural activity in the lower-order auditory cortex. Determining the functional connectivity between the higher-order cortex and auditory cortex during the construction of speech mental imagery may be an important direction in future studies.</p><p>In our study, the same auditory stimuli (a 4 Hz sequence of pure tones) were played under both the mental imagery condition and baseline condition. As a result, strong spectral peaks with similar power amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and right-lateralized topographic distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) at the sensor level were observed at a frequency of 4 Hz, reflecting robust stimulus-driven auditory responses. Therefore, we mainly refer to 4 Hz as the âstimulus-rateâ frequency, but we should be aware that the mental imagery of each number during the counting task was first produced at 4 Hz and then internally organized into groups at 0.8 Hz. When comparing the 4 Hz responses between conditions at the source level, we found greater activation of the right MFG in the mental imagery condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which might reflect the additive effect of generating the speech mental imagery of each number during the counting task. Previous fMRI findings have suggested that the MFG is activated by the auditory imagery of music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zvyagintsev et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lima et al., 2015</xref>) and can be activated by hearing imagery (HI) of speech compared to articulatory imagery (AI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2016</xref>), but the results of our MEG experiment showed that the MFG also contributes to the processing of articulation imagery. From the perspective of inner speech theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alderson-Day and Fernyhough, 2015</xref>), HI, which refers to the inner representation of anotherâs voice, is distinct from articulatory imagery, which refers to covert speech production, including motor preparation and verbal working memory maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acheson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tian and Poeppel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2016</xref>). To ensure that the imagery task appeared to be natural and reflected subjectsâ daily experience, we set the imagery task in our study as the mental operation of counting silently, which can be treated as a type of articulatory imagery, without asking the participants to strictly distinguish between HI and articulatory imagery. Therefore, care should be taken when comparing our results with other neuroimaging findings in the research area of HI of speech or auditory imagery of music. In the future, whether the neural mechanism of speech mental imagery uncovered in our paradigm can be extended to a richer account of inner speech must be considered.</p><p>Note that the auditory cortex was not significantly activated at the imagery-rate frequency. This result is different from the previous finding that similar neural responses were observed for overt and covert hearing tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tian and Poeppel, 2010</xref>), which can be explained from two aspects. Firstly, the neural pathways underlying speech mental imagery are strongly modulated by the specific imagery requirement (i.e. articulatory imagery or HI) and task demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tian and Poeppel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tian and Poeppel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tian and Poeppel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tian et al., 2018</xref>). Unlike the detailed requirements for imagery used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tian and Poeppel (2010)</xref>, in our study, we instructed the participants to count in their minds without asking them to strictly distinguish between articulatory imagery and HI. Secondly, and most importantly, we for the first time applied frequency-tagging paradigm and disassociated the neural activity induced by rhythmic inner counting from that elicited by bottom-up auditory perception. The activation of auditory cortex was tagged and detected at the stimulus-rate frequency instead of imagery-rate frequency. These differences in the task requirements and experimental paradigm might have led to the different findings concerning the involvement of the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tian and Poeppel, 2010</xref>) in forming speech mental imagery.</p><p>Due to the absence of overt behavioral outcomes in mental imagery tasks, it is difficult or impossible to directly correlate the neural signals to the corresponding behavioral performance during the imagery task. To overcome this obstacle, some behavioral measurements have been developed in previous imagery studies, such as participant self-report assessments and judgement tasks regarding the content and nature of inner speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hurlburt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hurlburt and Heavey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lima et al., 2015</xref>), but these approaches still largely rely on subjective experience without objective verification. Our study did not obtain behavioral data from the participants during the task but controlled for their behavioral performance via a preceding training session in which the participants were asked to report their performance of inner number generation and ensured that after training, they were able to perform the imagery task correctly. In addition, in the sEEG experiment, we recorded the participantsâ subjective reports to exclude the incorrect trials from the analysis. A key issue that should be further addressed is advancing the paradigm to study speech imagery using behavioral measurements. Recently, an enlightening study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martin et al. (2018)</xref> proposed a novel task that recorded both the output of a keyboard (without producing real sounds) and the neural activity when a musician imagined the music he or she was playing. Thus, the objective data from the recorded sound of the keyboard were simultaneously obtained and could be analyzed with the neural representations of the music imagery. In addition, intracranial neural signals from the auditory cortex and sensorimotor cortex can be used to reconstruct perceived and imagined speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akbari et al., 2019</xref>), providing a new account for decoding the neural signals induced by speech imagery. Inspired by these studies, more work needs to be performed to examine the correlations between possible behavioral manifestations and the neural substrates underlying mental imagery to deepen the understanding of speech mental imagery and advance its application in brain-machine interfaces.</p><p>In summary, our study applied a frequency-tagging paradigm to track the neural processing time scales in line with the generation of speech mental imagery and the stimulus-driven activity using both the neuronal measures (MEG) and direct recordings from the cortex (sEEG). We uncovered a distinctive neural network underlying the dynamic construction of speech mental imagery that was disentangled from sensory-driven auditory perception.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty Mandarin-speaking young students (8 females and 12 males, 24.6Â Â±Â 3.6 years old, all right-handed) participated in the MEG experiment.

Two blocks (a mental imagery block and a baseline block) were performed, and each block included 15 trials. The presentation order of the blocks was counterbalanced across subjects.

Here, non-independent ROI selection criteria were chosen to quantitatively compare the source-level neural activation between conditions; thus, we interpreted the results with caution to avoid overestimation of the ROI data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>SEEG experiment</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>SEEG Participants</title><p>Five subjects (three females; 27.6Â Â±Â 12.0 years old, range 14â46 years old) who were undergoing clinical intracerebral evaluation for epilepsy participated in the sEEG experiment. All the participants were right-handed and had normal hearing abilities. Before the experiment, the participants gave their written consent for participation, including permission for scientific publication. As one subject was a minor, written informed consent from his/her parent was obtained. Intracerebral electrodes were stereotactically implanted within the participantsâ brains solely for clinical purposes. All analyses were performed offline and did not interfere with the clinical management of the subjects. The sEEG study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Sanbo Brain Hospital, Capital Medical University.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>SEEG recordings</title><p>Each 0.8 mm diameter intracerebral electrode contained 12â18 independent recording contacts of 2 mm in length and 1.5 mm apart from each other. The reference site was attached to the skin of each subjectâs forehead. For each subject, the cortical reconstruction and segmentation were computed based on the T1-weighted image obtained before the electrode implantation using BrainSuite software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brainsuite.org/">http://brainsuite.org/</ext-link>). Then, the CT with the electrode localizations and the anatomical images were co-registered and normalized to the MNI-152 template. The contact locations were identified and visualized with MNI coordinates using the Brainstorm toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neuroimgage.usc.edu/brainstorm/">http://neuroimgage.usc.edu/brainstorm/</ext-link>) and the BrainNetViewer toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/">https://www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/</ext-link>) in the MATLAB environment. The intracranial neural responses were collected with the Nicolet clinical amplifier. The sampling rate was 512 Hz in four subjects (subjects 1 to 4) and 2048 Hz in one subject (subject 5).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>SEEG procedures</title><p>The subjects listened to the same stimuli and performed the same task as the healthy subjects in the previous MEG experiment. The participants were asked to count in their mind every five numbers in a group (imagery-rate frequencyÂ =Â 0.8 Hz) following a sequence of 50 pure tones (stimulus-rate frequencyÂ =Â 4 Hz). The auditory stimuli and trial structure were identical to those used in the MEG study, except that at the end of each trial under the mental imagery condition, the participants were instructed to orally report whether they had counted correctly following all the sounds. Then, the experimenter recorded their subjective report (correct/incorrect). Only correct trials were included in the subsequent analyses. In addition, the number of trials under each condition was dependent on each patientâs physical status, while a fixed number of trials was used in the MEG experiment. Furthermore, to reduce the confusion caused by the imagery task among the patients, the baseline condition was presented first, followed by the mental imagery condition. Before the formal mental imagery trials, the participants engaged in a practice session to ensure that they had fully understood the imagery task.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>SEEG data processing</title><p>The sEEG data from each contact were first analyzed separately, and the high gamma activity, which is related to the neural firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mukamel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ray and Maunsell, 2011</xref>), was extracted by a bandpass filter of 60â100 Hz. The instantaneous amplitude envelope was obtained from the filtered data by applying the Hilbert transform and then converted to the frequency domain in each trial using the FFT. A significant spectrum peak was reported if the response power at the target frequency was significantly stronger than the average of its two neighboring frequencies using a one-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> test among all the trials under the same condition. This test was applied to all frequency bins between 0.5 and 4.5 Hz, and the p values were FDR corrected for multiple comparisons. The spectral power at each contact under both conditions was transformed to the <italic>Z</italic>-score for visual presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Specifically, the <italic>Z-</italic>score was computed as the difference between the power response in a frequency bin and the mean power response between 0.5 Hz and 4.5 Hz excluding the frequency bins of 0.8 Hz and 4 Hz divided by the standard deviation (SD) of the power response in these frequency bins.</p><p>To compare the responses among the contacts, the spectral peaks at each contact were first extracted and normalized as follows:<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mtext>Â </mml:mtext><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where Power<sub>target</sub> refers to the response power at a target frequency (i.e. 4 Hz), and Power<sub>neighboring</sub> refers to the averaged response power at the two frequency bins neighboring the target frequency.

What is required in a revision is a better justification of the term 'speech mental imagery' in the title and text or a reconsideration of this term.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the view that several cognitive components were involved in the rhythmic inner counting task when participants were asked to construct their speech mental imagery. Mental imagery has been proposed to be essentially an attention-guided memory retrieval process, for example, in the visual domain (Ishai et al., 2002). Mental imagery of speech not only recruits the pathway by which phonological, lexical, or semantic details are retrieved from the memory system but also requires planned articulation that is simulated internally to enable individuals to have subjective experiences of their mental imagery (Tian and Poeppel, 2012; Tian et al., 2016). Therefore, these cognitive components cannot be definitely isolated from the term speech mental imagery.</p><p>In our study, neural tracking of speech mental imagery refers to the detection of the cyclical neural signal induced by the task of rhythmic inner counting. This cyclical neural signal can be attributed to the top-down regulation of the generation of number imagery, specifically, the internal arrangement of numbers into groups. Such internal organization is primarily based on the details of the inner representation of number imagery. In this way, the imagery-rate neural activity is tagged in the frequency domain and can be captured using neurophysiological measurements. It is known that the activation patterns of the brain network underlying speech mental imagery can be modulated by the task requirements and contextual variation (Tian and Poeppel, 2012, 2013; Tian et al., 2018). Therefore, the most important point to note is the operational definition of the internal organization of mental imagery, which is the key factor that induces cyclical neural signals. Considering that the term âspeech mental imageryâ as used in the previous manuscript is not focused enough to provide sufficient information about the intention and methodology of our study, we have now revised the term by adding the operational definition of the internal organization of mental imagery, namely, the task of rhythmic inner counting. Correspondingly, in the revised manuscript, we have added relevant content to justify the use of âspeech mental imageryâ as follows:</p><p>[Title] âNeural tracking of speech mental imagery during rhythmic inner countingâ</p><p>[Discussion] âMental imagery has been proposed to be essentially an attention-guided memory retrieval process, for example, in the visual domain (Ishai et al., 2002). [â¦] The operational definition of speech mental imagery condition, namely, the rhythmic inner counting task, is not only related to the internal representations of speech but also requires high levels of working memory.â</p><p>Correspondingly, we have added the following references to the revised manuscript:</p><p>Ishai, Haxby and Ungerleider, 2002; Tian and Poeppel, 2012.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The ANOVA with MEG is biased because the MEG activity focus was first defined by the contrast between the respective condition and baseline.</p></disp-quote><p>ROI analysis between conditions can be biased when the ROIs are selected by contrasting between those conditions, leading to circular analysis that can distort the results (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009, Nature Neuroscience). To control the influence of circular analysis in our study, different statistical comparisons based on different null hypotheses were applied in ROI selection and ROI analysis. Specifically, we selected the ROIs from the significant activation maps, which were obtained by contrasting the whole brain activity at the target frequency bin and the average of its two neighbouring frequency bins <italic>under each condition.</italic> These activation maps illustrate the neural sources behind the rhythmic signals induced by mental imagery and auditory perception, respectively. The null hypothesis of the ROI selection was that there were no significant differences between the source-level activation at the target frequency bins and their neighbouring controllers. Different from the ROI selection criteria, we applied ANOVA on the ROI activation among three levels (at 0.8 Hz under the mental imagery condition, at 4 Hz under the mental imagery condition and at 4 Hz under the baseline condition) and 16 brain regions to identify the significant differences <italic>between conditions</italic>, which was done to quantitatively examine the activation difference in these brain regions between top-down and bottom-up processes. The null hypothesis for the ANOVA was that there were no significant differences in the neural activation among different conditions and brain regions, which differed from the assumption of the previous ROI selection criteria. In this way, we avoided circular analysis and reduced the distortion of our results caused by the ROI selection bias.</p><p>An important point to note is that, to some extent, the overlapping data subset applied for ROI selection and analysis might still cause bias due to the noise effect within the same data subset (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009). From this view, we agree with the comment that selection bias might enter into the ANOVA, despite the different statistical methods we have applied for ROI selection and analysis. We note that this statistical bias is not restricted to the current study; it potentially applies to any ROI analysis that attempts to compare ROI activity after defining the ROIs in the same data subset using non-independent ROI selection instead of independent selection criteria such as the anatomy atlas. Selection bias may cause overestimation of the results when comparing ROI data between conditions (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009). Critically, it should be noted that in our study, the results of ROI comparisons between conditions were <italic>not</italic> overestimated, as no condition difference was observed in the regions of IFG and SMG, which were the main neural clusters responsive for the top-down imagery construction according to source estimation, and the crucial findings were not based on the results of ROI analysis. However, we urge caution in interpreting the ROI results in the revised manuscript by adding the relevant content:</p><p>[Materials and methods] âHere, non-independent ROI selection criteria were chosen to quantitatively compare the source-level neural activation between conditions; thus, we interpreted the results with caution to avoid overestimation of the ROI data.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The independent repeated measures ANOVAs for each region is not the appropriate test here. Rather, an overall RM-ANOVA should be employed, with the test of interest being for a condition by region interaction. Post hoc tests should then be performed on marginal means, normalised for the overall effect of condition.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the suggestion, we have conducted an overall repeated measures ANOVA (condition by brain region) for the ROI data. As a result, we found significant main effects of both condition and brain region and a significant interaction between the two variables. Then, we performed post hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction on estimated marginal means to illustrate the differences between conditions for each brain region. We have revised the relevant content in the Results section as listed below:</p><p>âTwo-way repeated measures ANOVAs (condition Ã brain region) for ROI activation showed a significant main effect of condition (F<sub>2, 38</sub> = 23.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>Î·p</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.55), a significant main effect of brain region (F<sub>5.23, 99.41</sub> = 6.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>Î·p</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.26), and a significant interaction between the two variables (F<sub>8.09, 153.67</sub> = 5.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>Î·p</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.23). [â¦] No significant difference was observed in the brain activation levels at 4 Hz between the imagery condition and baseline condition, except in the right MFG, in which the activation at 4 Hz during mental imagery was stronger than that at baseline (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The activation of sensory-motor cortex is intriguing, but the claim that this area is involved in imagery speech as also claimed in (Bouchard et al., 2013) is not very compelling. For such a claim, it is necessary to ensure there was no articulatory movement (e.g. with EMG sensors). Otherwise, it could simply reflect a hardly noticeable yet existing muscle movement in the articulators as the subjects count the numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the comment on the point that it is necessary to exclude the influence of muscle movements to reach a compelling conclusion on the role of the sensorimotor cortex in speech mental imagery. We respond to two aspects of this helpful comment:</p><p>First, Bouchard et al. (2013) claimed that speech-articulator representations are arranged somatotopically in the ventral PrG and PoG during syllable production, while our study found that the ventral PrG and PoG were engaged in constructing speech imagery when participants were told to count numbers in their mind without moving their lips, jaw or tongue. Our result is consistent with previous findings concerning the involvement of the sensorimotor cortex in speech imagery. For example, Tian et al. (2016) reported that the sensorimotor cortex showed stronger activation in articulatory imagery in which participants generated kinaesthetic feelings of articulation than in hearing imagery in which motor-related imagery was discouraged, suggesting that speech mental imagery with motor-related feelings could activate the sensorimotor cortex. In addition, the neural signals directly recorded from the sensorimotor cortex contributed to the imagined-speech decoding in both hearing imagery without kinaesthetic representation (Martin et al., 2016) and silent reading of speech (Martin et al., 2014). We have now revised the statement and have drawn a more careful conclusion about the involvement of the sensorimotor cortex.</p><p>Second, an earlier study by Kleber et al. (2007) attempted to record the EMG sensor placed on the throat and ensured that the muscle movements in imagined singing were significantly weaker than those in overt singing and did not differ from those during the resting state. After taking EMG data into consideration, Kleber et al. (2007) still found activation in the sensorimotor cortex in imagined singing, which could not be accounted for by muscle movements in articulators. However, to our knowledge, most imagery studies have not strictly controlled for articulator movement using EMG recording (Tian et al., 2016; Martin et al., 2014, 2016) but primarily based the results on the assumption that participants followed the instructions on how to generate mental imagery. This valuable comment raises the importance of controlling the articulatory movement effect, which should be noted in future studies, especially when the activation of the sensorimotor cortex is observed in mental imagery studies.</p><p>Thus, to clarify the logic and to address the concerns about the effect of muscle movements, we have revised the relevant content in the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>âIn addition, our study shows that the ventral PrG and PoG are also activated during the construction of speech imagery, which is consistent with previous findings that stronger activation of the sensorimotor cortex induced by articulatory imagery than hearing imagery (Tian et al., 2016) and the direct neural signal from the sensorimotor cortex contributed to the decoding of imagined speech and silent reading (Martin et al., 2014, 2016). Nevertheless, a firm conclusion on the contribution of the sensorimotor cortex to the construction of speech mental imagery will only be possible after controlling for any articulator movement in future studies.â</p><p>Correspondingly, we have added relevant references to the manuscript:</p><p>Martin et al., 2016; Martin et al., 2014.</p></body></sub-article></article>
