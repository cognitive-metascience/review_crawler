that RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) must overcome during transcription. A high-resolution description of the barrier topography, its modulation by epigenetic modifications, and their effects on Pol II nucleosome crossing dynamics, is still missing. Here, we obtain topographic and transcriptional (Pol II residence time) maps of canonical, H2A.Z, and monoubiquitinated H2B (uH2B) nucleosomes at near base-pair resolution and accuracy. Pol II crossing dynamics are complex, displaying pauses at specific loci, backtracking, and nucleosome hopping between wrapped states. While H2A.Z widens the barrier, uH2B heightens it, and both modifications greatly lengthen Pol II crossing time. Using the dwell times of Pol II at each nucleosomal position we extract the energetics of the barrier. The orthogonal barrier modifications of H2A.Z and uH2B, and their effects on Pol II dynamics rationalize their observed enrichment in +1 nucleosomes and suggest a mechanism for selective control of gene expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nucleosome transcription</kwd><kwd>high-resolution optical tweezers</kwd><kwd>histone variant H2A.Z</kwd><kwd>epigenetic modifications</kwd><kwd>histone ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>transcription regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM032543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bustamante</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM071552</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bustamante</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM098401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Tingting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM097260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>Craig D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006151</institution-id><institution>Basic Energy Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Nanomachine Program under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bustamante</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

In canonical (hereafter referred to as WT) nucleosomes, a core histone octamer made up of two copies of histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, is wrapped by ~147 basepairs (bp) of DNA. Variations in DNA sequence, wrapping strength asymmetry, and position-dependent histone-DNA interactions are collectively responsible for the uneven character and polarity of the nucleosomal barrier to an elongating polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bondarenko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ngo et al., 2015</xref>). The topography of the nucleosomal barrier can be described using two parameters: its height at each position (i.e., the magnitude of the energy required to access the DNA) and its width (i.e., extension along the DNA). Although Pol II has been shown to be capable of transcribing through the nucleosome both in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bondarenko et al., 2006</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weber et al., 2014</xref>), the detailed, high-resolution dynamics of Pol II crossing the nucleosomal barrier have not been observed yet. Because the properties of the barrier likely determine the dynamics of a transcribing polymerase, obtaining high-resolution topographic and transcriptional maps of the barrier lies at the heart of understanding the regulation of gene expression.</p><p>The majority of eukaryotic genes have a well-defined +1 nucleosome (the first nucleosome encountered by Pol II following initiation), which is enriched in H2A.Z and uH2B histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rhee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Teves et al., 2014</xref>), and represents the highest barrier to transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Teves et al., 2014</xref>). Whether the high prevalence of H2A.Z and uH2B modifies the intrinsic barrier at the +1 nucleosome, results in a different local spatial organization of chromatin, plays a role in regulating the binding and/or activity of extrinsic transcription factors, or a combination of all of these, remains unknown. Early optical tweezers studies have shown that in front of a WT nucleosome, Pol II slows down, pauses, backtracks, and cannot actively ‘peel’ the DNA wrapped around the histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hodges et al., 2009</xref>). Instead, the polymerase functions as a fluctuating ratchet that advances by rectifying transient, spontaneous wrapping/unwrapping transitions of the nucleosomal DNA around the histone core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hodges et al., 2009</xref>). A similar study using tailless histones and mutated DNA sequences suggests that these nucleosomal elements modulate the topography of the barrier by affecting the density and duration of Pol II pauses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bintu et al., 2012</xref>). However, because of their low resolution, these studies failed to accurately map the topography of the barrier and its effects on the dynamics of transcription. A high-resolution transcriptional map around the nucleosome is necessary to ultimately understand how the interaction of trans-acting factors at specific and selective positions of the polymerase around the octamer regulate transcription across the barrier.</p><p>Prior attempts to characterize the nucleosomal barrier to transcription have suffered from two substantial limitations. First, previous assessment of nucleosome stability relied on pulling and unwrapping the nucleosome from both ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mihardja et al., 2006</xref>). These experiments, while providing a measure of the strength of DNA/histone interactions, may not fully recapitulate the physical process of nucleosome invasion by Pol II, which unidirectionally unwinds the nucleosomal DNA. Second, although we can now obtain transcription trajectories with millisecond temporal and near bp spatial resolution using optical tweezers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Righini et al., 2018</xref>), it is very difficult to determine the absolute location of the polymerase on the template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hodges et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bintu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fitz et al., 2016</xref>), what we term here ‘accuracy’. Here we surmount both limitations, obtaining high-resolution, high-accuracy topographic and transcriptional maps of WT and modified nucleosomes. By registering the dynamics of Pol II as a function of its position along the nucleosome, these maps provide a means to interrogate how variant and epigenetically modified histones affect the dynamics of transcription through the nucleosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-molecule unzipping of nucleosomal DNA maps the topography of the nucleosome barrier</title><p>To experimentally recapitulate the underlying physical process of barrier crossing, that is nucleosomal DNA unwinding, we mimicked the effect of Pol II passage through the nucleosome using mechanical force. To this end, we adapted a previously described single-molecule DNA unzipping assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rudnizky et al., 2016</xref>) in which the two strands of the nucleosomal DNA are held in two optical traps, resulting in a Y-shaped configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We engineered the stem ahead of the fork to consist of two consecutive segments of ‘601’ nucleosome positioning sequence (NPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lowary and Widom, 1998</xref>), and a short hairpin loop at the end to prevent tether breaking once all double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is converted into single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). During each experiment, we move the two traps apart at a constant speed of 20 nm/s. When the force reaches ~17 pN, the dsDNA at the stem begins to unzip. When the stem segment does not contain a nucleosome, the DNA unzips following a series of closely spaced transitions occurring in a narrow range of forces between 17–20 pN, dictated by the sequence of the template. Once all dsDNA has been fully converted into ssDNA, the force increases sharply at the hairpin end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The highly reproducible force-extension signatures from the two consecutive NPS regions allow us to align traces from different unzipping experiments by placing the force and dwell-time of the opening junction at each base pair into register (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Upon force relaxation (rezipping), the pattern of closely spaced transitions is reproduced in the inverse sense to that observed in the pulling direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48281.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dual-trap Optical Tweezers Single-molecule Unzipping Assay Unwinds Nucleosomal DNA and Maps Histone-DNA Interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Geometry of the single-molecule unzipping assay.

The unzipping force-extension signature of the first NPS matches those obtained above, but that of the nucleosome region deviates significantly due to histone-DNA contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Relaxation of the tether results in two identical, sequential rezipping signatures characteristic of the naked DNA in ~75% of the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), indicating that full DNA unzipping led to complete histone removal. However, in 25% of the cases, when we unzip the same molecule for the second time, the force reaches higher values than with bare DNA but lower than those observed the first time, likely reflecting residual histone-DNA interactions from nucleosomal relics. Since we have no knowledge of nucleosome integrity by the second round of unzipping, we only analyzed the first round of unzipping data for each molecule. Because we moved the trap at a constant speed, the dwell-time of the fork at each position reflects the local histone-DNA interaction strength at that force. Indeed, in these constant pulling velocity experiments, the forces applied to histone-DNA contacts lying deeper in the structure depend on the forces reached previously in undoing earlier contacts. This effect may lead to underestimation of the magnitude of later interactions. Accordingly, we also performed force-jump unzipping experiments on the same constructs in which we suddenly increased the force to 28 pN (this force was chosen to minimize the contribution of the dsDNA sequence to the dynamics of the fork) and held it constant while monitoring the unzipping fork dwell-time at each position along the NPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In these experiments, the bare DNA construct unzips to the hairpin end instantaneously, while the fork dwells in the WT nucleosome primarily at 25, 31, and 35 bp into the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Interestingly, the resistance diminishes significantly after the dyad, suggesting that unzipping the first half of the nucleosome destabilizes the histone-DNA interactions of the second half.

This observation probably reflects the strong histone-DNA contacts along the DNA minor groove every 10 bp observed in the crystal structure of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). Compared to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall et al., 2009</xref>), we noticed a shorter residence time near the nucleosome dyad, which we attribute to differences in pulling geometry, buffer conditions, and/or histone source.</p><p>Unzipping of tetrasomes (H3/H4 tetramer assembled on NPS) revealed a substantially diminished barrier compared to the octamer, with unzipping fork dwelling events mostly restricted to locations near the dyad, and much lower maximum force reached during the unzipping process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data indicate that the H2A/H2B dimer not only interacts locally with the DNA but it also affects the strength of the H3/H4 tetramer-DNA interaction near the dyad to orchestrate the overall nucleosome stability. As loss or exchange of H2A/H2B dimers has been implicated in important biological processes such as DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramachandran and Henikoff, 2015</xref>), transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramachandran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kireeva et al., 2002</xref>), repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ransom et al., 2010</xref>), and DNA supercoiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sheinin et al., 2013</xref>); these findings highlight the potential role of non-local histone-DNA interactions in those processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>H2A.Z and uH2B alter orthogonal parameters of the nucleosome topography map</title><p>Human H2A.Z and uH2B nucleosomes show altered topography maps when compared to their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). However, the relative magnitude and distribution of the peaks are differently affected by these two modifications. Specifically, uH2B nucleosomes stabilize the dimer region (16 and 25 bp peaks) with minor effects on the tetramer region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>), suggesting that the attachment of ubiquitin to H2B enhances the barrier height locally. The peaks after the dyad are less pronounced and correspond to regions where nucleosomal DNA interacts with the distal dimer. H2A.Z nucleosomes show enhanced peaks at 41 and 52 bp, while exhibiting much lower heights at 25 and 31 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>), indicating a global redistribution of the barrier’s strength along its width. Overall, in H2A.Z nucleosomes the dwell-time peaks are more broadly distributed throughout the first half of the barrier than in their WT or uH2B counterparts, while maintaining their 5 to 10 bp periodicity.</p><p>To determine whether this redistribution of the barrier strength reflects features of the individual H2A.Z nucleosomes or the superposition of barriers derived from a heterogeneous molecular population resulting from an enhanced lateral mobility of these nucleosomes, as has been previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rudnizky et al., 2016</xref>), we counted the number of transitions (rips) per unzipping trace in the nucleosome region. Indeed, the H2A.Z-containing nucleosome has on average one more transition per trace than its WT counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) but displays a similar standard deviation. This effect is also evident in constant force unzipping experiments on H2A.Z nucleosomes, in which more dwell-time peaks are observed along the NPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To check whether H2A.Z nucleosomes are more mobile compared to WT nucleosomes, we repeatedly unzipped-rezipped single WT or H2A.Z nucleosomes up to the proximal dimer region (maximum force reached to ~25–30 pN). If H2A.Z induces lateral mobility of the nucleosome, the position of initial force rise in the nucleosome region would shift between each partial unzipping-rezipping round, and should be quite evident in our finely registered traces. Surprisingly, in contrast to the report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rudnizky et al. (2016)</xref>, we observed no lateral mobility with either WT or H2A.Z nucleosomes, as indicated by the highly reversible and overlapping unzipping signatures in the proximal dimer region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the effect of the H2A.Z histone variant in our experiments is not to increase the heterogeneity of the nucleosome population but to significantly redistribute the strength of the barrier, effectively broadening it. This conclusion is also supported by the homogeneous migration of H2A.Z nucleosomes in native gels. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p><p>The distal dimer interaction peaks for H2A.Z nucleosomes are visibly diminished relative to those of WT and uH2B nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, we observed an increased cooperativity during the assembly of H2A.Z nucleosomes. As the ratio of octamer to DNA is increased during nucleosome reconstitution, we consistently observed significantly less hexasome formation with H2A.Z than with H2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). It is possible that the global decrease of DNA interaction with the distal dimer observed with H2A.Z nucleosomes could also reflect a more cooperative disassembly during unzipping. To pinpoint what regions within H2A.Z are responsible for its assembly cooperativity, we generated a series of sequence swap mutants between H2A and H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarkson et al., 1999</xref>). Swapping the sequences of the M3 or the M7 region in H2A.Z with the corresponding sequences in H2A promotes the appearance of hexasomes, indicating decreased cooperativity in assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistently, the topography map of M3_M7 nucleosomes (an M3 and M7 combined swap mutant) showed intermediate topographical features between H2A.Z and WT nucleosome, with the distal dimer interaction peaks (at 109 and 122 bp) becoming more pronounced than those of H2A.Z nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), consistent with the idea that cooperativity in disassembly correlates with this distal interaction. Structurally the M3 region corresponds to the ‘loop 1’ that mediates H2A.Z-H2A.Z interactions within the octamer, and the M7 region corresponds to the ‘docking domain’ that mediates H2A.Z interactions with H3-H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zlatanova and Thakar, 2008</xref>). These regions play important roles in the stability of the histone octamer. Thus, unique physical properties of the H2A.Z octamer likely account for the broadened barrier distribution we observed during unzipping.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Observation of multiple nucleosomal states at the proximal dimer region</title><p>One unique feature from the nucleosome unzipping traces is the presence of fast, reversible unzipping transitions within the proximal dimer region—spanning the first 40 bp of the NPS—that manifest as ‘hopping’ of force and extension in the unzipping experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hopping in this region is nucleosome-specific, as it is not observed during unzipping of bare NPS DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The reversible nature of this transition contrasts with the irreversible transitions observed deeper in the nucleosome, and may indicate a rapid, small scale unzipping that is not large enough to disrupt the structure of the octamer. With nucleosome unzipping occurring at approximately 20–30 pN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>), to observe hopping at our trap separation rate of 20 nm/s (with trap spring constant of approximately 0.3 pN/nm) requires the system to transition between states on timescales of approximately 2 s or less. To better capture these hopping dynamics, we fixed the trap distance such that the unzipping fork remained localized within the proximal dimer region and monitored the fluctuations of the force and extension (passive mode experiment). Within an empirically determined trap distance range, we obtained equilibrium extension hopping traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which show transitions on timescales of ~1 s, aligning with the necessary rate of transitions between states. At each fixed trap separation, we determined the number of unzipped bp to obtain a probability distribution for the length of unzipped DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For both bare and nucleosomal DNA, these distributions show consistent peaks, as expected on a heterogeneous energy landscape where the system populates discrete energy wells separated by transition barriers. We note that certain trap separations allow the system to sample multiple wells, giving rise to a multi-modal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom panel), analogous to the hopping observed in the constant pulling rate unzipping curves. Relative to bare DNA, WT nucleosomes display an additional peak in the distribution of unzipped bps, at approximately 28 bp after the start of the second NPS where the most significant contacts between DNA and the H2A-H2B dimer occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This peak implies the existence of a barrier to further unzipping that arises from binding of the DNA to histones, and its position is consistent with the dwell time peak observed in the unzipping traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, peak at 26 bp).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48281.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Observation of Multiple Nucleosomal States at the Proximal Dimer Region.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time traces of number of base pairs unzipped (relative to beginning of the second NPS) with hWT nucleosome for fixed trap separations of 1031 nm, 1045 nm, and 1060 nm (top to bottom).

First, the effect of the barrier begins immediately after the leading edge of Pol II touches the NPS (3 bp peak); the strength of the barrier is largest at 28 bp and 10–20 bp before the dyad, and is negligible after crossing this pseudo-symmetry axis. Second, we identified a region between 28–64 bp into the NPS where Pol II enters long-lived pauses and backtracks frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These pauses are consistent among different molecules and exhibit a ~ 10 bp periodicity (28, 38, 48, 57, and 64 bp into the NPS). Notably, this region coincides with the region of maximum resistance in the single-molecule unzipping assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>), implying that the transcriptional barrier encountered by Pol II while crossing the nucleosome reflects, to a first approximation, the barrier mapped by the unzipping assay. Third, some molecules were permanently arrested in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, gray trace), but those that managed to cross it typically succeeded in reaching the stall site shortly thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Thus, we speculate that this region (28–64 bp) may play an important regulatory role for barrier crossing by the enzyme. The observed asymmetry of the transcriptional map between both sides of the dyad axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) may reflect a substantial weakening of the histone-DNA interactions in the presence of the bulky resident enzyme halfway across the barrier. However, the transcriptional map asymmetry is similarly observed in the topographic map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), even though the bulkiness of the enzyme does not play a role in those experiments. It is also possible that the barrier asymmetry reflects changes in the nucleosome integrity by the invading polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kireeva et al., 2002</xref>) or the propagating unzipping fork.</p><p><italic>Xenopus</italic> histones are traditionally the most-widely used in nucleosome studies because they are well behaved in recombinant form. Since we employed recombinant human histones in the unzipping assays, it was of interest to compare the Pol II transcriptional maps of <italic>Xenopus</italic> nucleosomes with those obtained with their human counterparts utilizing the same 601 NPS. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, the maps are quite similar except that human nucleosomes confer a significantly higher barrier to transcription (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Videos 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">8</xref> for representative traces) than those of <italic>Xenopus</italic> in the proximal dimer region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, the 28 bp peak in orange and red panels).</p><media id="video7" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-48281-video7.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48281.020</object-id><label>Video 7.</label><caption><title>Pol II transcription through hWT nucleosome.</title></caption></media><media id="video8" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-48281-video8.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48281.021</object-id><label>Video 8.</label><caption><title>Pol II transcription through hWT nucleosome, NPS zoom.</title></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Dynamic interplay between pol II and the nucleosome during barrier crossing</title><p>Interestingly, we observed extensive two state transition dynamics while Pol II is paused at certain sites (frequently at 28 and 63 bp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). While Pol II hopping at 28 bp coincides with hopping of the unzipping fork near this region and probably reflects sampling of alternative nucleosomal states ahead of the enzyme, hopping at a much deeper location into the nucleosome (63 bp) may have a more complex origin. We hypothesize that these latter dynamics may be due to local Pol II-histone interactions or re-wrapping of the nucleosome in front of a backtracked enzyme. Indeed, these hopping dynamics occur exclusively after Pol II enters a deeply backtracked state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We also investigated whether Pol II remains functionally competent after the crossing. The pause-free velocity of Pol II after exiting the nucleosome resumed to 70% (28.6 ± 0.8 nt-s<sup>−1</sup>) of its value before the crossing (41.1 ± 1.0 nt-s<sup>−1</sup>). This observation seems to indicate that while the enzyme remains functionally competent, its dynamic state has been affected by the encounter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). It remains unknown what changes in the enzyme are responsible for this slowing down and if they are reversible. On the other hand, we probed the integrity of the nucleosome by pulling away the two beads after Pol II crossed the barrier. If the nucleosome survived the traversal by Pol II, it would now lie between the two tethering points, that is the upstream DNA handle and the polymerase. Rarely (&lt;5%) these pulling curves displayed the force-extension signature normally associated with the presence of a nucleosome, suggesting that in situ reassembly of the nucleosome following Pol II traversal was inefficient under our assay conditions. A similar low efficiency of nucleosome reassembly was observed from transcription assays in bulk in the absence of factors added in trans such as FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsieh et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>H2A.Z enhances the width and uH2B the height of the transcriptional barrier</title><p>Next, we investigated the effects of human H2A.Z and uH2B on Pol II transcription dynamics. Our unzipping assay revealed that H2A.Z and uH2B have distinct effects on the nucleosome barriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). Under the same buffer and force conditions, Pol II alone was capable of crossing either H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Videos 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video10">10</xref>) or uH2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Videos 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video12">12</xref>) nucleosomes. While the crossing probabilities of Pol II through H2A.Z and WT nucleosomes are similar (58% and 59%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>), the distributions of pause sites within the NPS are markedly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) in that H2A.Z is seen to cause a global redistribution of Pol II pause sites along the entire NPS. Such scattered distribution (3, 28, 36, 59, 66, 87, 101, 115, 125 and 138 bp) differs significantly from that of WT nucleosome (3, 28, 57, 64 bp) where most pauses occur before the dyad. This spreading of the barriers for H2A.Z nucleosomes is a further indication that the force applied to the upstream DNA (which is the same in both experiments) is not the dominant factor responsible for the asymmetry of the WT barrier across the dyad, but that the actual histone-DNA interactions are. Furthermore, these differences are unlikely to stem from H2A.Z nucleosomes being mis-positioned on the starting template, because the first pause site at ~3 bp, where the leading edge of Pol II begins to interact with the nucleosome, is observed in every molecular trajectory obtained with H2A.Z nucleosomes. Instead, we attribute them to broadened distributions of DNA-histone interactions as seen in the topography map for H2A.Z nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>, also see discussion on energetic profiles of H2A.Z nucleosome in next section).

The pause site distribution also resembles that of the hWT or the xWT nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), however, the median dwell-time of Pol II at pause sites near the dyad is more than double that for the WT nucleosome, suggesting that uH2B enhanced the height of the nucleosomal barrier to Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The overall pause-free velocities of Pol II transcription through H2A.Z (11.4 ± 7.1 nt-s<sup>−1</sup>) and uH2B nucleosomes (12.9 ± 3.4 nt-s<sup>−1</sup>) are lower than that through hWT (18.2 ± 7.1 nt-s<sup>−1</sup>) nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Consequently, the median crossing times of Pol II through H2A.Z (262 s) and uH2B (304 s) nucleosomes are longer than that through hWT nucleosomes (230 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Note, however, that pause-free velocity contributes negligibly to crossing time, as the latter is dominated by long pauses. Including pausing, translocation and backtracking, Pol II takes longer to cross uH2B or H2A.Z than hWT nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Similar to when traversing hWT nucleosomes, Pol II backtracks frequently during transcription through H2A.Z and uH2B nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,C and E</xref>). The average number of backtracks and backtrack depths are similar, but backtrack durations are longer when Pol II transcribes through H2A.Z nucleosomes than through WT and uH2B counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which may again reflect the broader extent of histone-DNA interactions in H2A.Z nucleosomes. Failure to recover from some backtracks seems to contribute to Pol II arrests, the positions of which were more scattered for Pol II transcribing through uH2B and H2A.Z than through WT nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Interestingly, backtracked Pol II frequently enters long-lived pauses, some of which are also accompanied by frequent two-state transition dynamics (hopping behavior) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D and F</xref>). During some of the long-lived pauses associated with crossing of uH2B nucleosomes, we also observed three-state hopping behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and large hopping transition events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, green trace) of Pol II. As this behavior is rarely observed in WT and H2A.Z traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we speculate that these dynamics of Pol II reflect the presence of the bulky ubiquitin attachment. Collectively, these data reveal that H2A.Z mainly enhances the width and uH2B mainly enhances the height of nucleosomal barrier to transcription. Consistent with the previously reported higher stability of uH2B nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Batta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chandrasekharan et al., 2009</xref>), they pose an overall higher barrier magnitude––especially in the region near the dyad––than their WT counterparts to the passage of polymerase. It is also worth noting that for WT and H2A.Z, but not for uH2B nucleosomes, the transcriptional map replicates the corresponding topography map, suggesting that there could be uH2B-Pol II specific interactions that are not present in the unzipping assay.</p><p>Our findings provide direct evidence that H2A.Z or uH2B by themselves affect the crossing dynamics of Pol II; and despite their differential effects on nucleosome topography, they both represent stronger barriers than WT nucleosomes for Pol II.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>A mechanical model for pol II transcription through the nucleosome</title><p>We use a simplified mechanical model to calculate the expected polymerase dwell times along nucleosomal DNA given a profile of DNA-octamer interaction energies.

(2013)</xref> to include interactions with the nucleosome. The individual polymerase steps are assumed to occur on an energy landscape that encompasses both the elastic energy of deforming the unwrapped DNA linker between Pol II and the nucleosome core particle, and the interaction energy between the wrapped DNA and the core particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). For a given Pol II position, the amount of unwrapped DNA is assumed to fluctuate rapidly around an energy minimum that balances these two contributions. As Pol II steps forward, the linker shortens and the elastic energy increases, with a longer linker entailing a smaller energy increase and thus a more rapid rate constant for polymerase forward motion. The interaction energy profile between the DNA and the histone octamer ahead of Pol II determines the ensemble of linker lengths and, thus, indirectly controls the average time spent by Pol II at each DNA base pair. This model allows us to calculate the expected dwell time of the polymerase at each position.</p><p>Accordingly, we use the DNA-octamer interaction energies extracted from equilibrium unzipping data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) to calculate the expected mean dwell times of polymerase in the proximal nucleosomal region. The dwell time peaks resulting from these equilibrium interaction energies approximately correspond to peaks in the experimental dwell time profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The DNA-octamer interaction energies cannot account for the first dwell time peak (the peak at ~3 bp in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) corresponding to the initial encounter between Pol II and the nucleosome. We hypothesize that this peak is the result of additional interactions between Pol II and the histone proteins rather than arising from the difficulty of peeling DNA from the nucleosome.</p><p>Because equilibrium interaction energy data was available only for the initial section of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), Pol II dwell times further into the nucleosomal sequence cannot be predicted from the data available. Instead, we solve the inverse problem: given the measured Pol II mean dwell times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), we fit the DNA-nucleosome interaction energies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, details in Methods) required to generate this dwell time profile. The dependence of dwell times on the nucleosome binding energy in this model is non-local—time spent at a particular bp depends on the energy required to unwrap a segment of DNA <italic>ahead</italic> of the polymerase. Consequently, peaks in the dwell time profile arise from interactions that involve both large energy values and span a substantial length of DNA (extended regions of strong binding). For example, the peaks at 29 bp in the dwell time profiles for hWT, uH2B, and H2A.Z nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), correspond to large peaks in the interaction energy at 32 bp, consistent with the interaction energy profiles obtained from equilibrium DNA unzipping data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). A two-peaked region of strong binding at roughly 43 bp in the H2A.Z and uH2B nucleosomes gives rise to corresponding double peaks in the dwell time profiles 41 bp into the nucleosomes, with substantially longer pausing times for H2A.Z nucleosomes in this region. An additional broad region of strong binding is seen just before the dyad axis, 62 bp in hWT and uH2B nucleosomes, resulting in the observed Pol II pausing peaks 59 bp into the nucleosome. Interestingly, according to our mechanical model, the predicted interaction energies necessary to generate the observed dwell-time profiles are similar in magnitude for all three nucleosomal types. However, wider peaks of strong binding give rise to increased pause durations in the uH2B transcriptional profile, while a distribution of many narrower peaks accounts for the increased number of pausing sites in the H2A.Z profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>For the last 20 years the crystal structure of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luger et al., 1997</xref>) has guided our view of the packaging unit of the genome and suggested its role as a regulator of gene expression. As a mechanical and energetic barrier, the nucleosome gates the accessibility of genomic DNA, constituting a fundamental regulatory mechanism for all DNA-templated processes including replication, transcription, repair, recombination, and chromatin remodeling. Epigenetic modifications and histone variants are known to modulate all of these processes. The question of whether this modulation results from the recruitment of trans-acting factors, or responds to changes in the intrinsic properties of the barrier, or both, has not previously been addressed.</p><p>Low-resolution single molecule assays showed that it is possible to follow molecules of Pol II as they cross the nucleosomal barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hodges et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bintu et al., 2012</xref>). However, these studies only yielded gross features of the barrier and failed to provide the crucial spatial-dependent dynamics of the crossing that are required to rationalize the effect of nucleosome modifications at the molecular level.</p><p>Very recently, cryo-EM structures of Pol II-nucleosome complexes have provided snapshots of Pol II paused at major histone-DNA contacts and suggested sites of interaction with other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farnung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kujirai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ehara et al., 2019</xref>). Missing from these structures is information about the dynamics of barrier crossing by the enzyme: what are the time windows available for in-trans interactions with these discrete sites, how are these related to the local energetic magnitude of the barrier, and how are they modulated by epigenetic modifications and histone variants. Using a ‘molecular ruler’, we have been able to locate individual Pol II molecules along the template with high precision and to extract their molecular trajectories as they transcribe through nucleosomes at near bp resolution and accuracy. These trajectories unveil unprecedented details on the general dynamics (translocating, pausing, hopping and backtracking) as well as the residence times of the enzyme at every position as it progresses through the nucleosome, providing insights into how gene expression is regulated spatially and temporally at a single nucleosome level.</p><p>Our results reveal that the proximal dimer region of the nucleosome (~28 bp) in the transcription direction is a major physical barrier for Pol II and may serve as an important regulatory checkpoint for gene expression. In this region, Pol II frequently enters long-lived pauses; this result is consistent with the observation of a major Pol II pause site at the superhelical location SHL(−5) reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kujirai et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, pausing at this location is accompanied by extensive hopping dynamics, likely reflecting unwrapping/rewrapping of the nucleosomal DNA around the octamer and/or structural rearrangements of the nucleosome. Indeed, partially unwrapped nucleosomal intermediates have been detected in vitro by time-resolved small angle X-ray scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilokapic et al., 2018</xref>) and in vivo by MNase-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramachandran et al., 2017</xref>). The location of these structural intermediates coincides with the different nucleosomal hopping states observed as the unzipping fork reaches the proximal dimer, reinforcing the interpretation that local DNA/histone interactions determine the dynamics of Pol II in this region and its ultimate progress beyond it.</p><p>Traditionally, the dyad has been viewed as the strongest histone-DNA contact point and therefore as the highest barrier position in WT nucleosomes. Unambiguously assigning Pol II’s residence time with bp resolution has allowed us to define a transcriptional map of the barrier, which indicates that the proximal dimer region and not the dyad represents the highest barrier to an elongating Pol II. This observation is consistent with the unzipping experiments that also reveal the proximal dimer region as mechanically the most stable. We posit here that the change in dynamics of the polymerase, progressing slowly in this region, provides a crucial time window to allow for other facilitative or inhibitory factors to bind and further modulate the strength of the barrier to the transcribing enzyme. For instance, FACT may bind to the nucleosome and remove one histone dimer ahead of the Pol II and reassemble the nucleosome after Pol II traversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belotserkovskaya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mason and Struhl, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). These early regulatory steps as Pol II invades the nucleosome not only gate gene expression but also permit the regulation of chromatin integrity and of epigenetic modifications. As Pol II progresses further into the nucleosome, the strength of the barrier appears to be dynamically modified either through nucleosome destabilization, the steric bulkiness of the enzyme, or both. Beyond the dyad, there is practically no barrier in WT nucleosomes, again in agreement with a recent cryo-EM structural report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kujirai et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with these observations, modifications that play important regulatory roles such as H2A.Z and uH2B, mainly affect the proximal dimer region, although their effects are not circumscribed to this location. Pol II transcription through nucleosomes bearing H2A.Z or uH2B reveal that these modifications strongly increase the strength of the barrier, but do so distinctively: H2A.Z increases the width of the barrier whereas uH2B increases its height. Significantly, the topographic map of the WT and H2A.Z barriers before the dyad, as determined here by force-induced nucleosomal DNA unwinding, closely parallels the transcriptional map of Pol II, indicating that to a first approximation, the ability of the enzyme to cross the barriers in this region is dictated by the energetic requirements of disrupting DNA-histone interactions.</p><p>In vitro, H2A.Z has been observed to either enhance or decrease nucleosome stability depending on the assays used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zlatanova and Thakar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bönisch and Hake, 2012</xref>). Our improved optical tweezers experiments offer unprecedented resolution that captures a more complex picture in which H2A.Z redistributes the strength of the barrier across and beyond the dyad, effectively increasing its width. Accordingly, the physical barriers across the H2A.Z nucleosome are lower, yet more globally distributed. The precise origin of this broader distribution is not known. A previous study suggested that H2A.Z nucleosomes are more mobile compared to their WT counterparts, although the extent and cause of the mobility remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rudnizky et al., 2016</xref>); however, we do not observe this enhanced mobility in our experiments. Like a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2004</xref>), our data support the idea that the H2A.Z octamer is more stable than its WT counterpart within the nucleosome. As a result, H2A.Z hexasomes are barely observed during nucleosome assembly and we find that the M3 and M7 regions within H2A.Z are important for conferring such increased octamer stability. We speculate that increased octamer stability strengthens the overall nucleosomal barrier as reflected in the increased crossing time of Pol II through such nucleosomes.</p><p>The effect of H2A.Z on the nucleosomal barrier can be seen as that of re-distributing the strength of the barrier from height to width. Interestingly, the Arrhenius dependence of barrier crossing time predicts that the time to cross a barrier of height n x h is proportional to the nth-power of the time to cross a barrier of height h. In contrast the time to cross n sequential barriers of height h is proportional to n times the time to cross each one of the barriers. Thus, based on these considerations alone, we would expect that H2.A.Z would decrease the crossing time of Pol II, not increase it, as observed. Therefore, factors other than barrier crossing time, but favored by the presence of the barrier (e.g. backtracking, pausing, etc), are the ones that dominate the overall crossing time in the case of H2A.Z nucleosomes. By dividing the height of the barrier into several smaller ones, H2A.Z nucleosomes provides the enzyme more opportunities at different locations to pause, backtrack and possibly interact with regulatory factors acting in trans such as chaperones and chromatin remodelers. In vivo, the effects of H2A.Z on transcription are complex and somewhat species-dependent. The strong barrier posed by H2A.Z nucleosomes may explain its role in poising quiescent genes for activation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Santisteban et al., 2011</xref>) and its prevalence in +1 nucleosomes across eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weber et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the observation that H2A.Z facilitates transcription in multi-cellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weber et al., 2014</xref>) is more likely due to recruitment of trans-acting factors.</p><p>Using homogeneous, chemically-defined recombinant nucleosomes, we also demonstrated that uH2B strengthens histone-DNA interactions at the dimer region and increases the overall barrier strength to Pol II. Interestingly, while uH2B occurs at the dimer region, its effect on Pol II transcription propagates to other regions of the nucleosome including the region preceding the dyad. Thus, the effects of epigenetic modifications are not merely local but may extend further into the barrier. Uncovering such position-dependent nucleosome properties and dynamics has been possible by the high resolution and accuracy achieved in our single-molecule assays.</p><p>In vivo, H2B ubiquitination is highly dynamic and both the addition and removal of ubiquitin are required for optimal transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wyce et al., 2007</xref>). Like H2A.Z, it is not known whether these phenotypes are due to altered nucleosome stability or to impaired or facilitated recruitment of trans-acting factors. Nevertheless, higher levels of H2A.Z and uH2B are observed in transcriptionally silent gene promoters in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Batta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Preventing H2B ubiquitination in yeast led to increased Pol II occupancy and transcription from quiescent promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Batta et al., 2011</xref>). These observations are consistent with our data that H2A.Z and uH2B provide orthogonal and selective means to enhance the transcription barrier thus contributing to the maintenance of the transcriptional ground state and to gene silencing. Our results show that while these modifications may also act indirectly through their actions on the binding of trans-acting factors, they exert a direct and significant effect on transcription dynamics by Pol II.</p><p>We have developed a unified mechanical model that uses the experimentally determined space-resolved residence times of the enzyme at each position on the nucleosome to determine the energetics of the barrier. This model is quite general and should prove useful in predicting the behavior of Pol II through alternative barriers, and in understanding the mechanics of barrier crossing for other molecular motors.</p><p>The dynamics of Pol II transcription through the nucleosome in vivo are affected by numerous other factors such as higher-order chromatin folding, DNA topology, and transcription regulators including histone chaperones, elongation factors, and chromatin remodelers. Integrating one or more of these elements in single-molecule assays such as the one presented here provides an interesting avenue for future work to fully elucidate the features and principles underlying this biologically crucial and biophysically complex molecular encounter. Because epigenetic modifications are potent regulators of eukaryotic gene expression, these results shed new light on the mechanistic link between modifications enriched on the +1 nucleosome and the barrier to transcription. More broadly, the real-time characterization of the dynamics of Pol II molecules traversing through nucleosomes at the highest resolution and accuracy reported so far, and the resulting nucleosome transcriptional map, constitute important steps towards uncovering the physical mechanisms underpinning the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

In this configuration, a 1064 nm laser is passed through an acousto-optic deflector, with the laser alternating in position between the two traps every 5 µs. The position of the beads relative to the traps was measured using back focal plane interferometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bustamante et al., 2009</xref>). Single tethers were formed in situ inside the chamber by trapping an oligo bead in one trap and an SA bead in the second trap, and bringing in close proximity the two traps to allow the biotin on the right arm of the Y to interact with streptavidin (Streptavidin bead).</p><p>The pulling experiments used to obtain the average dwell times in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref> are nonequilibrium in nature, reflecting an average over many out-of-equilibrium encounters with each nucleosome type, and are not direct indicators of equilibrium interaction strength alone. In particular, dwell times to rupture in a given trace will depend on the forces reached during a prior rupture event. Complementary probes of DNA-histone interaction strength (see below) verify that many of the peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref> are due to strong binding interactions.</p><p>Due to the nonequilibrium nature of the experiments used to obtain the residence times in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>, we caution against the use of such ‘pulling’ residence times alone to assess interaction strength with high resolution.

Unzipping was initiated by moving the two traps apart at a constant speed of 20 nm/s for a total of 875 nm. Under this condition, this pulling speed corresponds to a loading rate of 1.8–2.5 pN/s. Rezipping was conducted at the end of unzipping by bringing the two traps together to the initial trap position at the same speed. The tether was broken manually by increasing the trap distance and calibration was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg-Sørensen and Flyvbjerg, 2004</xref>). Data was acquired at 800 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Unzipping at 28 pN constant force</title><p>To unzip the construct at constant force, the tether was initially held at ~10 pN and force feedback was turned on to maintain the tether at a constant force of 28 pN. The position and distance between the two beads ware recorded at 800 Hz until the construct was fully unzipped. The force feedback was turned off and the tether was relaxed to ~0.5 pN. For the purpose of aligning the traces and accurately converting nanometer distance to basepairs unzipped, an unzipped trace using constant trap separation speed (as described above) was further obtained from the same tether.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Partial unzipping up to the proximal dimer region to test nucleosome mobility</title><p>Unzipping was performed at constant trap separation speed of 50 nm/s up to the proximal dimer region where the force starts to rise above the baseline of bare DNA construct, but does not reach 30 pN. The partial unzipping was followed by rezipping to the initial trap position. Typically, this results in a trap movement of ~620 nm. After repeating the unzipping-rezipping cycle for 5–10 times, a final unzipping that unzips all the way to the hairpin end (trap movement of 875 nm) was performed to disrupt the whole nucleosome. A bare DNA trace was also collected immediately following this final unzipping.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Unzipping at constant trap distances to record hopping traces near the proximal dimer interaction region</title><p>To capture hopping of the unzipping fork near the proximal dimer interaction region of the nucleosome, the trap was manually moved apart at a small distance increment of 7.1 nm. At each discrete trap position (passive mode), the distance between the two beads was recorded at 2.5 kHz for 10–300 s. Initially, only fast hopping events characteristic of dsDNA unwinding were present. Once the unzipping fork arrived at the proximal dimer interaction of the nucleosome, additional slow transition events, due to histones binding with and dissociating from dsDNA or ssDNA, could be seen. Recording was terminated when the force reached ~23 pN. The tether was then relaxed to ~0.5 pN. For the purpose of aligning the traces and accurately converting nanometer distance to basepairs unzipped, an unzipped trace using constant trap separation speed (as described above) was further obtained from the same tether.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Construction of the 8 × repeat ‘molecular ruler’ plasmid</title><p>The plasmid that contains a single repeat sequence (pGEM3z-1×repeat) was first cloned by modifying a pGEM3z-T7A1 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gabizon et al., 2018</xref>). The construction of the plasmid with eight tandem repeat sequences (pGEM3z-8×repeat) was carried out by following a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) using BglI, DraIII and EagI restriction sites.

Briefly, two fragments outside the 8 × repeat region of the plasmid were amplified using oligos ZC12-ZC13 and ZC14-ZC15, respectively, and assembled into one fragment using ZC12-ZC15. The assembled fragment, which is devoid of the internal BsaI site, was digested with SapI/EagI and ligated with SapI/EagI digested 8 × repeat fragment from pGM3z-8×repeat. The resulting plasmid pGM3z-8×repeat-2×BsaI contains the 8 × repeat sequence flanking by two BsaI sites, which are included in oligos ZC12 and ZC15.

The two beads were rubbed against each other until a tether is formed. If the tether has expected length, the pair of beads was moved to the experimental position, which is close to the outlet of the NTPs channel. Force feedback was turned on to maintain a constant force of 10 pN and the NTPs channel was opened to start transcription. Data acquisition was started right after force feedback was turned on and terminated once the polymerase reached the end or arrested for more than 300 s without dynamics. To probe the fate of transcribed nucleosomes, force feedback was turned off and the trap distance was reset to a value that gives less than 1 pN force on the tether. The two beads were pulled away from each other by increasing trap distance at a constant speed of 20 nm/s, until the force reaches above 40 pN. From these pulling curves, we rarely detected rips normally associated with nucleosome unwrapping. Trap distance was further increased to break the tether and the beads were calibrated.

However, the calculated distance obtained initially is typically different from this value of 197 bp. At this point, we rescaled the data along the x-axis (number of unzipped base pairs) to maintain 436 unzipped base pairs at the end of the unzipping curve and a distance of 197 base pairs between identical positions on the two NPS sequences.

Using this approach, we generated a mean residence histogram of the first NPS from all bare DNA unzipping traces. The rescaling factors were typically between 180 to 190. The requirement for rescaling to satisfy the periodicity may result from bead size variations or deviations from the models used to describe the pulling traces.</p><p>Third, once an aligned mean residence histogram of the first NPS was obtained from unzipping traces of bare DNA, a slightly modified operation was performed on unzipping traces of the nucleosome datasets. Again, the relaxation after complete unzipping was fit and the number of unzipped base pairs were calculated, and again rescaled using a range of rescaling factors. This time, the correlation between the residence time histogram of the first NPS in the nucleosome traces and the mean residence histogram of the first NPS obtained in the previous step was calculated and maximized. The rescaling factors for nucleosome data had the same range as for the bare DNA data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18-2"><title>Residence time analysis of unzipping traces</title><p>After obtaining the fitting parameters for both dsDNA and ssDNA, bead-to-bead distances of the unzipping traces were converted to unzipped basepairs. The unzipped basepairs of the traces were then aligned, scaled and normalized to the beginning of the second NPS by subtracting 248 bp (the second NPS begins at 249 bp of the Y stem region). For traces obtained at constant trap separation speed (20 nm/s), a force weighted residence time (RT) between each bp was calculated by summing the forces of all data points between two consecutive unzipped basepairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, long residence time (i.e. more data points) while under higher force within a particular bp would result in a high force-weighted RT in this analysis. The force-weighted RT accounts for force differences along the unzipping trace and serves as a proxy of the strength of histone-DNA interactions of the nucleosome. For constant force unzipping traces, residence time at each bp was calculated by counting intervening data points N. Because data frequency is 800 Hz, RT therefore equals to N/800 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

For each unzipping trace obtained at constant trap separation speed, we identified transition events by looking for maxima in the RT histogram and manually applying a threshold to avoid too many transitions (rips) from just bare DNA. The chosen threshold cannot be too high, as the RT for H2A.Z unzipping traces generally have more peaks but lower amplitude for each peak. This analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) revealed that on average, H2A.Z nucleosome unzipping traces have at least one more ripping transition than those of WT nucleosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18-4"><title>Analysis of the partial unzipping data to test mobility</title><p>The final unzipping trace or the bare DNA unzipping trace was used to fit the WLC model to obtain the elasticity, offset and scaling parameters of a particular tether.

Note, for both WT and H2A.Z nucleosomes, the initial force rise always occurs at the same position without lateral shifts.

They combine two single-molecule assays, DNA unzipping and transcription translocation, to probe the sequence-dependence of nucleosome unwrapping and transcription elongating. An impressive combination of technical innovations allowed them to achieve single base pair accuracy in both assays. Additional unzipping barriers due to the nucleosome were identified, predominantly at the proximal side. Histone variants H2A.Z and uH2B yielded different, larger barriers. A significant increase in pausing during transcription was observed when the substrate contained a nucleosome. Importantly, the location and amplitude of the pauses could be related to the unzipping energy landscape, and using a sophisticated model, a dwell-time distribution as well as an energy landscape for transcription along the nucleosome could be reconstructed. Though both H2A.Z and uH2B nucleosomes slowed down transcription relative to wild type nucleosomes, they introduce different modifications to the energy landscape: H2A.Z introduces a broader distribution of barriers to transcription whereas uH2B increases the height of some of the barriers.</p><p>This manuscript describes a major advance in the field. Technically, the accuracy improvements of both assays are significant and allow for a much more detailed interpretation of the data than was reported before. The reported hopping behavior of nucleosomal unwrapping for example has not been observed with such precision.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms that are extracted, including detailed energy landscapes, are new and provide the field with a detailed reference for other processes that involve nucleosome transactions.</p><p>The impact on our understanding of the biology is significant: the detailed insight reported here provides mechanistic, rather than correlational or kinetic understanding of epigenetic modifications.</p><p>Major point:</p><p>Regarding the analysis method used to construct the topographic maps (e.g., Figure 1): They point out that the dwell time for each force-vs.-extension contour reflects the strength of the local histone-DNA interaction. As they also point out, what really matters is the force where the transition occurs. The higher the transition force, yes, the longer the dwell time. But also the dwell time depends on where the force began, which depends on both the previous transition force and the amount of DNA released (gives the size of the resultant force drop). All the transitions are in a similar force range and the amount of released DNA vary by factors of 2-4. So it seems that the reported dwell times for a given rupture are just as dependent on how far the previous rupture dropped in force as they are on the magnitude of their own rupture force. This would create a strong convolution and severely scramble the conclusions drawn from the map. For example, in Figure 1C of hWT unzipping, we see two distinct ruptures at very high force near 30 pN. The first rupture has a very long dwell time because the preceding rupture occurred at only 22 pN, while the second has a very short dwell despite needing also 30 pN to rupture because the preceding rupture also occurred at 30 pN. So while these two transitions which required similarly high force to rupture get scored by this method very differently, with the second appearing as a very weak interaction. It seems they are aware of the possibility of such an underestimation of the interaction. But the same effects also overestimate the first rupture. Why can they not measure the distribution of rupture forces (similar to protein folding force spectroscopy methods) directly? Otherwise, they should validate their analysis method on e.g., a long well modeled hairpin or provide some better justification that the conclusions from this method are not seriously flawed.</p><p>We have attached the full reviews below, in case these may be of additional assistance to you.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Chen et al. and coworkers address the question of how RNA polymerase (Pol II) transcribes through the nucleosome, what does the energy landscape for transcribing through the nucleosome look like, and how is it modified by epigenetic markers.

The experimental method of pulling DNA off of the nucleosome by unwinding it from one end is very cool, though I have some concerns about the analysis methods to produce the so-called topographic map. The transcriptional map experiments seem very well done and seem like a very significant advancement. It seems like these are the most important measurements in the manuscript and they are mostly supported by the topography experiments (see my concerns about those below). It is not clear that the topography experiments themselves are necessary to interpret the transcription experiments. It is very exciting to see the distinct differences in the effects that H2A.Z vs. uH2B have on Pol II. The mechanical modeling seems sound. Overall, the paper is very strong and exciting and should be suitable to publication in <italic>eLife</italic> with the following analysis and interpretation concerns adequately addressed.</p><p>I have a serious concern regarding the analysis method used to construct the topographic maps (e.g., Figure 1). They point out that the dwell time for each force-vs.-extension contour reflects the strength of the local histone-DNA interaction. They also point out one complication: What really matters is the force where the transition occurs. The higher the transition force, yes, the longer the dwell time. But also the dwell time depends on where the force began, which depends on both the previous transition force and the amount of DNA released (gives the size of the resultant force drop).

From the initial presentation, it seems pulling on the NPS only is done very near equilibrium since it is shown that there is no hysteresis comparing pulling and relaxing. Later though, hopping is discussed and whether it is seen in the pulling curves and claim they pulled fast enough to not get hopping, i.e., out of equilibrium. But they say they do sometimes see hopping, for nucleosome pulling curves. This seems confusing and possibly contradictory. But either way, pulling curves should be shown plotted with sufficient bandwidth to say much about whether hopping does or doesn't occur. Hopping of bare hairpin DNA (no nucleosome) can be very fast, and the lack of hysteresis strongly suggests it is occurring faster than plotted. It would be helpful to the reader if they more clearly explained the pulling conditions and how the force ramp rate (pN/s) rather than trap displacement speed (nm/s) relates to the scale of unzipping and re-zipping times.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48281.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I have a serious concern regarding the analysis method used to construct the topographic maps (e.g., Figure 1).

First, we would like to point out that, using residence time of the unzipping fork to map the position and strength of histone-DNA interactions in a nucleosome is a well-validated approach (Hall et al., 2009). Notably, in the Hall et al. paper, they acknowledged that “When two interactions occurred in close vicinity, upon the disruption of the first interaction the force was unable to relax back to the baseline before being ramped up again for the second interaction, subjecting this subsequent interaction to a higher initial force. Therefore, for each region of interactions, the dwell time histogram highlighted the edge of the region first encountered”.This effect is present regardless of pulling or loading rate.</p><p>Accordingly, in our analysis method, we did not measure the simple residence time, but rather the <italic>force-weighted</italic> residence times, which take into account the contribution of the forces at which the transitions occur. We have clarified this point in the manuscript, in Figure 1E, and in the Materials and methods section “Residence time analysis of unzipping traces”. Measuring the distribution of rupture forces requires some underlying assumption regarding the number of transitions and where they occur. As our data showed, these factors changed significantly when the histones were modified, especially with H2A.Z, and therefore comparing rupture forces would be problematic as the transitions compared would be different. Measuring force-weighted residence times allows for an unbiased characterization of the nucleosome unzipping process, and the positions of ruptures and the strength of the interactions at these positions arise directly from the data. For this reason, we preferred the force-weighted residence time approach. We believe that comparison to the transcription data is highly insightful, as the transcription traces display a similar pattern of pausing to the patterns observed with unzipping, as well as similar effects of histone modifications. These indicate that the direct mechanical barrier to unzipping (which is mainly due to position-specific histone-DNA contacts) plays a major role in forming the transcriptional barrier to the polymerase, and the similarity also strengthens our confidence in the residence time analysis.</p><p>The “force-weighted residence times” plotted in Figure 1E (force integrated over time spent dwelling at that specific base pair) correspond to the work required to unzip that base pair, given the constant trap separation rate in our experimental protocol. In the case of a system pulled slowly compared to its equilibration rates (as for bare DNA), this work should give an accurate measurement of the interaction energy landscape (details described in the Materials and methods; extraction of interaction landscape directly from bare DNA pulling curves is shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D, E). In the presence of nucleosomes, the trajectories obtained are, of necessity, out of equilibrium. In these situations, ruptures are stochastic events, and the dwell times are selected from a distribution which depends on the height of energetic barriers to unzipping, as well as the force at which the barrier is approached. By averaging over many trajectories, however, we believe the force-weighted dwell times gives an approximate, if not perfect, indicator of histone-DNA interaction strength. To test the validity of our force-weighted residence time analysis, we also collected constant force unzipping data (Figure 2). In these experiments, we raised the force to 28 pN and we kept it constant throughout the nucleosome unzipping process. In these experiments each barrier experienced the same force and the dwell times at each position are therefore comparable and a measure of the strength of the interaction between the DNA and the histone core, without the bias of earlier on later contacts. This alternative approach yielded a topographic map very similar to that obtained with the first method.</p><p>Furthermore, acknowledging the limitations of non-equilibrium measurements, in Figure 3 we used a distinct approach that allowed the system to explore its equilibrium energy landscape in the nucleosome entry regions. The measured equilibrium occupation probabilities are converted directly to interaction energies (Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This technique yields a peak interaction energy that corresponds closely to one of the peaks observed in Figures 1E and 2B. Although the dwell time spectra of Figures 1E and 2B are fundamentally non-equilibrium, the differences in dwell times between different nucleosome types are still expected to reflect qualitative features of the specific DNA-nucleosome interactions.</p><p>To ensure that readers are aware of the limitations of the technique and data presented in Figures 1E and 2B, along with our discussion of those experimental results, we now write the following in the “Optical Tweezers assay for single-molecule” unzipping section:</p><p>“The pulling experiments used to obtain the average dwell times in Figures 1E and 2B are non-equilibrium in nature, reflecting an average over many out-of-equilibrium encounters with each nucleosome type, and are not direct indicators of equilibrium interaction strength alone. [...] Data from these pulling experiments is most useful when assessed in conjunction with data from other experimental techniques, such as the equilibrium hopping data in Figure 3, and the transcriptional residence times of Figures 6 and 7.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think there is some unnecessary confusion in the descriptions of the initial force-extension method.

The reviewer raises an important point and we revised the main text. We deleted the sentence that caused the confusion: “Surprisingly, hopping, which is a hallmark of equilibration, was observed at strand separation rates expected to drive and keep the system out of equilibrium throughout unzipping.”, and replaced it with “The reversible nature of this transition contrasts with the irreversible transitions observed deeper in the nucleosome, and may indicate a rapid, small scale unzipping that is not large enough to disrupt the structure of the octamer. To better capture these hopping dynamics, […]”</p><p>In order to observe hopping, two requirements must be met: (1) there must be multiple well-defined states accessible at a given trap separation, where the rate of transitions between states are slow compared to the data collection frequency (800Hz in our experiments) and (2) the transition rates between these states must be sufficiently fast compared to the pulling rate to enable several back-and-forth transitions across a single barrier before subsequent unzipping occurs. We observe hopping only in the presence of the nucleosomes and not for the bare NPS, which indicates multiple states at a single trap separation for nucleosome-bound DNA. This is confirmed by our equilibrium measurements (constant trap separation) in Figure 3B. For bare DNA, most trap separations result in a single most likely position of the unzipping fork. In the presence of a bound nucleosome however, there can be multiple peaks of comparable height at certain trap separations, allowing for hopping of the unzipping fork between two or more states. The hopping behavior in the proximal nucleosome region is consistent with the nucleosome interaction energy profile extracted from equilibrium data (see Figure 3D). Given that the initial pulling experiments were clearly out-of-equilibrium (as evidenced by the hysteresis) the presence of hopping indicates that the barrier to the reverse transition is sufficiently low to allow such transitions to occur before the next transition was reached. This behavior is consistent with the nucleosome interaction energy profile extracted from equilibrium data (Figure 3D). The energetic barrier marked with a * leads to a relatively rapid reverse transition, while the subsequent barrier is very high. Such a system would thus hop repeatedly between two local minima until the force increases to high enough values to overcome the next large barrier.</p><p>In our pulling curves, the hopping behavior begins at roughly a 20pN pulling force and is no longer observed once the pulling force reaches 30pN. Given the pulling rate of 20 nm/sec and the trap stiffness of 0.3 pN/nm, the maximum force increase rate is 6 pN/sec. Of course, as the system relaxes under the force, this increase rate is a ceiling. From our force-extension data, we calculated the loading rate to be ~1.8-2.5 pN/sec. Using this approximate force increase rate, we would expect hopping to be observable if the transition time is below a couple of seconds. Our equilibrium data (Figure 3A) indicates that hopping at the proximal nucleosomal region occurs on a timescale of ~1 sec, consistent with the observable hopping in the constant extension pulling curves.</p><p>To relate the force ramp rate to the trap displacement speed, we now write:</p><p>“With nucleosome unzipping occurring at approximately 20-30 pN (Figure 1C and D), to observe hopping at our trap separation rate of 20 nm/s (with trap spring constant of approximately 0.3 pN/nm) requires the system to transition between states on timescales of approximately 2s or less.”</p><p>“Within an empirically determined trap distance range, we obtained equilibrium extension hopping traces (Figure 3A), which show transitions on timescales of approximately 1s, aligning with the necessary rate of transitions between states.”</p><p>It is worth noting that the ‘hopping’ we observed in the proximal dimer region of the nucleosome occurs much slower compared to that of bare hairpin DNA. We attribute these nucleosome-specific, very slow hopping events to local, reversible histone-DNA interactions. We also plotted one example force-extension curve of bare DNA versus nucleosome sample at maximum bandwidth (800 Hz) in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B to highlight this slow hopping event. To better explain the pulling condition, we also added the estimated loading rate of 1.8-2.5 pN/s in the Materials and methods section “Unzipping at a constant trap separation speed”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
