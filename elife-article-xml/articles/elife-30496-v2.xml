their development remains poorly understood. In the context of human cytomegalovirus infection, a significant proportion of CD4 T cells displays cytotoxic functions. We observed that the transcriptional program of these cells was enriched in CD8 T cell lineage genes despite the absence of ThPOK downregulation. We further show that establishment of CD4<sub>CTX</sub>-specific transcriptional and epigenetic programs occurred in a stepwise fashion along the Th1-differentiation pathway. In vitro, prolonged activation of naive CD4 T cells in presence of Th1 polarizing cytokines led to the acquisition of perforin-dependent cytotoxic activity. This process was dependent on the Th1 transcription factor Runx3 and was limited by the sustained expression of ThPOK. This work elucidates the molecular program of human CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells and identifies potential targets for immunotherapy against viral infections and cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytotoxic CD4 T cell</kwd><kwd>Th1 differentiation</kwd><kwd>ThPOK</kwd><kwd>Runx3</kwd><kwd>T-bet</kwd><kwd>cytomegalovirus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serroukh</surname><given-names>Yasmina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Belgian Federal Public Planning Service Science Policy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Project Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goriely</surname><given-names>Stanislas</given-names></name><name><surname>Marchant</surname><given-names>Arnaud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Regional Development Fund and Walloon Region</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Project Grant (411132-957270)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goriely</surname><given-names>Stanislas</given-names></name><name><surname>Marchant</surname><given-names>Arnaud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Project Grant (PDR)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuks</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name><name><surname>Goriely</surname><given-names>Stanislas</given-names></name><name><surname>Marchant</surname><given-names>Arnaud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds Erasme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoyois</surname><given-names>Alice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The acquisition of cytotoxic function by human CD4 T cells is an integral part of the T helper 1 differentiation pathway and is limited by the transcription factor ThPOK.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The thymic differentiation of helper CD4 and cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes results from the opposite activity of key transcription factors (TF) including ThPOK and Runx3 repressing the expression of CD8 and CD4 T cell lineage genes, respectively. After emigration from the thymus, naive CD8 and CD4 T cells maintain the expression of Runx3 or ThPOK, respectively, suggesting that the lineage-defining role of these TF is also active in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vacchio and Bosselut, 2016</xref>). However, the repression of a cytotoxic program in peripheral CD4 T cells is not absolute as these cells can acquire perforin-dependent cytotoxic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appay et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van de Berg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheroutre and Husain, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Initially considered as a phenomenon of peripheral importance, the acquisition of cytotoxic function by CD4 T cells is now recognized as a key component of immunity against viruses and tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Swain et al., 2012</xref>) and correlates with positive outcome in multiple human and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilkinson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weiskopf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Quezada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fu et al., 2013</xref>). Beside their role in viral infections and cancer, cytotoxic CD4 (CD4<sub>CTX</sub>) T cells may also have a pathogenic role in chronic inflammatory disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dumitriu, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The development of CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells remains incompletely understood. In humans, CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cell function is a hallmark of terminally differentiated antigen-experienced cells producing large amounts of gamma interferon (IFNγ) and low levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appay et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casazza et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cell differentiation might be induced by the prolonged stimulation of Th1 lymphocytes. On the other hand, recent studies suggest that CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells form a distinct lineage emerging from precursors expressing class-I restricted T cell-associated molecule (CRTAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>). Several TF probably contribute to the differentiation of CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells within or outside the Th1 pathway. In the mouse intestine, the acquisition of cytotoxicity by CD4 T cells is associated with the down regulation of ThPOK and the upregulation of Runx3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mucida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sujino et al., 2016</xref>). In CD8 T cells, the cytotoxic program is activated by the cooperation of TF from the T-box family (T-bet and Eomes) and Runx3, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cruz-Guilloty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pearce et al., 2003</xref>). In mouse models of cancer or neuroinflammation, Eomes was required for the induction of CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Curran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raveney et al., 2015</xref>). In murine influenza infection, Blimp1 was required for CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marshall et al., 2017</xref>). The role of these TF in human CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cell differentiation remains to be determined.</p><p>The transcriptional program and lineage fate of effector T cells are established and maintained at the epigenetic level through DNA and histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Araki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sellars et al., 2015</xref>). Hypomethylation of the <italic>PRF1</italic> promoter, the gene encoding perforin, is associated with increased perforin expression in human CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaplan et al., 2004</xref>). The epigenetic modifications underlying the differentiation of CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells have not been determined.</p><p>Here, we studied circulating CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells isolated from the peripheral blood of cytomegalovirus-seropositive (CMV<sup>+</sup>) healthy adults. Compared to mouse models of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2012</xref>) or cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Curran et al., 2013</xref>), this situation allows access to a significant number of cells presenting a fully established cytotoxic functional program at steady state. Using transcriptomic and epigenomic approaches, we defined the molecular events that dictate human CD4<sub>CTX</sub> differentiation. We further show that the increased expression of Runx3 and T-bet and key epigenetic modifications at the <italic>PRF1</italic> promoter, without downregulation of ThPOK, underlie the acquisition of cytotoxic function by human Th1 lymphocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phenotype and function of in vivo differentiated perforin<sup>+</sup> human CD4 T cells</title><p>In healthy humans, chronic CMV infection is associated with the expansion of perforin<sup>+</sup>/granzyme B<sup>+</sup> CD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Leeuwen et al., 2004</xref>). In order to use this model for transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses of CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T lymphocytes, we characterized their phenotype and function in CMV<sup>+</sup> healthy adults and compared them to cytotoxic CD8 T cells. As previously reported, high perforin expression was observed in terminally differentiated CD4 and CD8 T cells that had downregulated the co-stimulatory molecules CD28 and CD27, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van de Berg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Appay et al., 2002b</xref>). Perforin<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells were CD8β-negative and a minority expressed low levels of CD8α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). Further analyses were conducted on sorted naive (CD45RO<sup>-</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup>) and terminally differentiated (CD28<sup>-</sup>) CD4 T cells and on naive (CD45RO<sup>-</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>) and terminally differentiated (CD27<sup>-</sup>) CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Increased <italic>PRF1</italic> gene expression by CD28<sup>-</sup> CD4 and CD27<sup>-</sup> CD8 T cells was confirmed by mRNA quantification and was associated with potent cytotoxic activity in a polyclonal cell lysis assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). This activity was abolished by Concanamycin A, supporting a perforin-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kataoka et al., 1996</xref>). Bisulphite sequencing indicated an inverse correlation between the expression of the <italic>PRF1</italic> gene and the DNA methylation status of its promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Whereas <italic>PRF1</italic> promoter was hypermethylated in a perforin<sup>-</sup> fibroblastic cell line (HEL-299), all CpG sites were hypomethylated in CD28<sup>-</sup> CD4 and CD27<sup>-</sup> CD8 T cells. Low DNA methylation levels were detected at intermediate (16 to 28; middle grey line on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) CpG sites in naive CD8 T cells and at proximal (CpG sites 29 to 34; right grey line) sites in both naive CD4 and CD8 T cells, suggesting that the <italic>PRF1</italic> gene is transcriptionally poised in naive T lymphocytes. Together, these results indicate that CD28<sup>-</sup> CD4 T cells exert a cytotoxic activity comparable to CD27<sup>-</sup> CD8 T cells and that this subset can therefore be used as a relevant model of in vivo differentiated CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30496.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phenotype and function of in vivo differentiated perforin<sup>+</sup>human CD4 T cells.</title><p>(<bold>a–b</bold>).

In this model, human naive CD4 T cells stimulated in the presence of Th1, and not Th2 or Th17, polarizing cytokines differentiated in perforin<sup>+</sup>granzyme B<sup>+</sup> cells with potent cytotoxic activity. This could be due to the promotion of the cytotoxic phenotype by Th1 cytokines or to its repression by the Th2 or Th17 transcriptional programs, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parronchi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciucci et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast to the rapid acquisition of <italic>IFNG</italic> expression, naive CD4 T cells expressed high levels of <italic>PRF1</italic> 1 to 2 weeks after stimulation. This observation also contrasts with the more rapid acquisition of cytotoxic function by CD8 T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Araki et al., 2008</xref>) and suggests that the initial steps of Th1 cell differentiation provide the required epigenetic and transcriptional signals promoting the expression of <italic>PRF1</italic>. The relatively delayed acquisition of cytotoxicity also suggests that CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells are induced by prolonged antigen stimulation in vivo and may intervene when Th1 and CD8 T cells do not adequately control pathogens.</p><p>The acquisition of cytotoxic function within the Th1 lineage was promoted by Runx3 and T-bet. Runx3 knockdown reduced the expression of perforin, granzyme B and granulysin by CD4<sub>CTX</sub> and decreased their cytotoxic activity. In contrast to mouse Th1 cells, Runx3 did not influence IFN-γ mRNA expression by human Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Djuretic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). This discrepancy may be related to inter-species differences or to incompleteness of the knockdown in our experimental conditions. T-bet knockdown reduced the expression of IFN-γ and cytotoxic molecules but had a more moderate impact than Runx3 knockdown on the acquisition of cytotoxic activity. This result is in line with a recent report indicating a role of T-bet in the induction of cytotoxic molecules by TCR-engineered tumor-specific CD4 T cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jha et al., 2015</xref>). Together these results indicate that human Th1 cells acquire cytotoxic functions under the control of the master regulator Runx3 cooperating with T-bet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cruz-Guilloty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jha et al., 2015</xref>). Runx3 and T-bet also controlled the expression of other TF that were not directly involved in the acquisition of cytotoxic function in these experimental conditions, including Eomes and Hopx.</p><p>Eomes was upregulated in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells as compared to naive cells in vivo but its expression was less correlated with perforin than Runx3 and T-bet. In vitro, Eomes was neither sufficient nor necessary to induce cytotoxicity as it was upregulated in Th2 cells that did not express perforin and its knockdown did not impact the expression of perforin in Th1 cells. Together, these results suggest that the role of Eomes in the acquisition of cytotoxic function by human CD4 T cells may be limited. This contrasts with a report indicating that overexpression of Eomes induces cytotoxic function in CD4 T cell lines, suggesting that this TF may promote cytotoxicity when expressed at high levels in CD4 T cells, as observed in CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pearce et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eshima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Intlekofer et al., 2008</xref>). The role of Eomes could also be restricted to specific conditions of co-stimulation as recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mittal et al., 2018</xref>). The expression of Hopx by CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells showed a similar pattern as T-bet and Runx3 both in vivo and in vitro. Its knockdown reduced the expression of granzyme B but did not significantly impact perforin. Therefore, the primary role of Hopx in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells may not be the induction of cytotoxicity but may include other functions, including survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Two other TF, Hobit (<italic>ZNF683</italic>) and ZEB2, were specifically expressed by CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells in vivo but not in vitro. Hobit is upregulated in human effector CD8 T cells and murine NKT cells and therefore appears to be part of a signature common to cytotoxic lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Gisbergen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vieira Braga et al., 2015a2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vieira Braga et al., 2015b</xref>). A recent study revealed that Hobit induces a transcriptional program promoting tissue residency of memory T cells and suggests that it could regulate cytotoxic function in murine NKT1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mackay et al., 2016</xref>). Its role in the promotion of cytotoxic function by CD4 T cells in vivo therefore remains to be established. Similarly, further studies should establish the role of ZEB2 in terminally differentiated CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dominguez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Omilusik et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In parallel with the positive regulation operated by T-bet and Runx3, the cytotoxic function of human CD4 T cells was negatively regulated by ThPOK. In CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> thymocytes, ThPOK decreases the expression of Runx3 and perforin and promotes the development of the CD4 T cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). In the periphery, ThPOK also inhibits the expression of Runx3, T-bet and Eomes by mouse CD4 T cells and restricts their cytotoxic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). We observed that the expression of Runx3 and ThPOK is not mutually exclusive in human CD4<sub>CTX</sub> and CD8<sub>CTX</sub> T cells. Co-expression of Runx3 and ThPOK has been observed in murine Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Djuretic et al., 2007</xref>) and in simian MHCII-restricted CD8<sub>αα</sub> T cells after CD4 downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vinton et al., 2017</xref>). Also, ThPOK is up regulated by mouse effector CD8 T cells during acute viral infection and promotes their expansion and effector function upon rechallenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Setoguchi et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, ThPOK is required for the development of other murine lymphoid subsets with cytotoxic potential including CD4<sup>+</sup> NKT cells and γδ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2010</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that the expression of high levels of ThPOK is compatible with the expression of Runx3 and with cytotoxic function. Yet, the in vitro model of T cell differentiation revealed that ThPOK is an important regulator of the cytotoxic activity of human CD4 and possibly CD8 T lymphocytes. This observation suggests that ThPOK may contribute to the regulation of antiviral, anticancer and immunopathological properties of Th1 cells in vivo.</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows that Runx3 and ThPOK cross-regulate the acquisition of cytotoxic function by Th1 lymphocytes and therefore represent targets for interventions against viral infections, cancer and autoimmune disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (mouse leukemia)</td><td>RAW 264.7</td><td>ATCC Cat# TIB-71</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0493">CVCL_0493</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human kidney cell line)</td><td>HEK-293 human kidney cell line</td><td>ATCC Cat# CRL-1573,</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0045">CVCL_0045</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>HEL 299</td><td>ATCC Cat# CCL-137,</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_2480">CVCL_2480</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Transfected constructs</td><td>References of all shRNAs are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2f</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody-ChIP</td><td>References of used antibodies are indicated in the method section</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody-cytometry</td><td>References of all used cytometry antibodies, including company and clone are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>.</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>All sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2c, d and e</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Concanamycin A</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich (Merck, Germany)</td><td>C 9705</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>PKH26 staining</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich (Merck, Germany) <break/><break/></td><td>Catalog numbers MINI26 and PKH26GL</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell collection and purification</title><p>Blood samples were collected from CMV-seropositive or seronegative healthy adult volunteers, aged 26 to 60 (median (interquartile range): 45 (39.5–51.25)) years.

GSEA was also used to quantify the correlation between gene expression and methylation. The identifiers of the genes included in the GeneSets were transformed to match the DNA methylation probe identifiers (Perl scripts included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). GSEA Pre‐ranked analysis was then used to assess the enrichment of our expression-based GeneSets on the pairwise comparisons of the pre-ranked methylation delta β values. Genesets of catalog c3 from MsigDB were similarly converted to probe identifiers and added to our GeneSet file for robust statistical evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-4"><title>Single-cell qPCR</title><p>Data mining was performed using the Fluidigm Real-time PCR analysis (V1.4.3), and data analysis was performed using the Genex6 MultiD software as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ståhlberg et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Remy Bosselut, whose comments have been incorporated with those of the other referees below.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Serroukh et al. investigate the transcriptional control of human CD4 cytotoxic cell differentiation. They demonstrate that these cells express transcription factors Runx3, Eomes and T-bet, and maintain high levels of the CD4-differentiating factor Thpok. The latter result contrasts with previous studies on mouse IELs by the Cheroutre and Mucida groups. Combining in vitro cytotoxic CD4 T cell differentiation and shRNA knock-down, the manuscript further shows that T-bet and Runx3, but not Eomes, are important for the acquisition of cytotoxic properties. Conversely, in agreement with mouse studies (including NI, 15:947), Thpok knock-down increases expression of T-bet, Runx3, Eomes and CD8α.</p><p>CD4 cytotoxic cells are increasingly focusing interest because of their frequency in human viral infections and their potential in anti-tumor responses. Thus, the present investigation of their transcriptional landscape is timely and should be of interest to a broad audience. The data are of high quality and well presented. While many results recapitulate observations in mouse models, others, including the persistent Thpok expression, would not have been predicted from such studies. Additionally, the extensive analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation in human effector T cells will be a useful resource.</p><p>Major comments requiring attention:</p><p>1) Various sets of data related to key findings could be improved by adding extra information or quantification. For example, flow cytometry profiles of transcription factors are usually not very clear. The authors use this technique a few times during their work. In particular, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> ThPOK level in CD8 CTX mRNA does not match the protein level as well as EOMES in the CD8 N. Do the authors have an explanation for this? It is also vital to introduce some sort of quantification when analyzing the protein level of these transcription factors. It would be advisable to add the respective MFIs on the plots.</p><p>2) The non-essential effect of Eomes in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> cells is an interesting finding. The authors should further build on this point through comparing the relative importance of T-bet and Eomes in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> and CD8<sub>CTX</sub> cells. The authors should also clarify whether ThPOK is indeed expressed by CD8<sub>CTX</sub> cells and whether knocking-down ThPOK in CD8<sub>CTX</sub> cells has any effect on their cytotoxic function.</p><p>3) Even though they differentiate in vitro from bulk populations, one key question is whether the ex vivo CD4 cytotoxic effectors are conventional MHC-II restricted cells, or include non-conventional T cells. Analyses of TCR Vβ expression are needed to address this question, and would also provide insight into the clonality of ex vivo cytotoxic cells. Staining for PLZF expression would also be informative. It is not clear whether the &quot;CD4<sub>CTX</sub>&quot; cells generated in vitro under Th1 culture conditions can represent CD4<sub>CTX</sub> cells found in vivo. Have the authors compared the transcriptomes of these cells? The authors should try to knockdown Runx3, T-bet etc. in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> cells isolated from PBMC to assess the effect on cytotoxic function.</p><p>4) RT-PCR or staining for Eomes is needed to resolve the contrast between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (Eomes up-regulated in cytotoxic CD4s by microarray) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (mutually exclusive with perforin in single cell analyses).</p><p>5) Eomes knock-down is actually modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and the conclusion that cytotoxic gene expression in CD4 cells is Eomes-independent should be toned down. Because shRNA experiments are notoriously difficult and prone to off-target effects, the study would be much strengthened if the authors verified shRNA impact on their target by immunoblot analyses of protein expression rather than RT-PCR or the rather inconclusive flow cytometry data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p><p>6) The conclusion that stepwise changes in the chromatin environment promote expression of cytotoxic genes should be tempered. The supporting data is correlative only and the population-level changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications may simply reflect increased fractions of cytotoxic cells in each population.</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, authors only compared CD4<sub>CTX</sub> and CD8<sub>CTX</sub> cells with naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells. Other memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, such as CMTh1, EMTh1 and CD27+ CD8 T cells, should be included for comparison to reach a solid conclusion on similarity between CD4<sub>CTX</sub> and CD8<sub>CTX</sub> cells, at least for Figure.2A, 2B and 2D. These cells should also be included as controls in the cell lysis assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.</p><p>8) Is CD28 downregulated in perforin+ Th1 cells generated in vitro compared to perforin- Th1 cells in the same culture? If so, the authors should separate CD28+ and CD28- Th1 cells to test their progressive development model. An alternative explanation for increased Granzyme+Perforin+ cells over time is that these cells were selectively expanded.</p><p>9) It is surprising (possibly important and novel) that Eomes does not play an important role in the acquisition of cytotoxicity by CD4<sub>CTX</sub> cells. Can this shRNA affect the cytotoxicity of CD8<sub>CTX</sub> cells? Are Runx3 and T-bet important for CD8<sub>CTX</sub> cells? It is also curious that Eomes mRNA does not co-express with PRF1 in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> cells. Co-staining of Eomes and PRF1 protein should be shown.</p><p>10) In the beginning of the study the authors define two major populations of CD4 T cells, naïve and cytotoxic. However, it seems the naïve subset is defined using CD45RO and the cytotoxic using perforin. There is no reference or explanation on why the authors use CD45RO. They should be consistent in using Perforin or CD45RO to distinguish between these two populations and ideally identify such populations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, and not only in Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</p><p>11) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> it is not clear why the authors use EM CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells versus total CD4. Furthermore, the figure legend only mentions the ChIP done on the CD4 subsets. This CD8 population is never defined and the total CD4 population is very heterogeneous, limited the conclusions that can be drawn by the authors. In this regard, the ChIP peaks should be shown for the different populations of CD4 T cells that are further shown in the plots with the normalized enrichment.</p><p>12) It would be suitable that a further quantification of the protein level of perforin would be depicted upon the knockdown of the different subsets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. A simple set of representative plots is not enough to draw proper conclusions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The transcription factors Runx3 and ThPOK cross-regulate acquisition of cytotoxic function by human Th1 lymphocytes&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. As you can see, these focus on the issue of quantification of some of the key data added to the paper. We hope that these issues can be rapidly addressed without additional experimentation and, provided the quantification supports the claims made, the revised paper can be rapidly reviewed by the editor for a final decision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>[Minor comments not shown.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have addressed my previous concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors have extensively revised their original manuscript providing now a much more compelling and complete story. In this revised version, the authors have addressed all my previous concerns. There are however two main points that require further attention.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> the authors have added the much needed quantification of the expression of the different transcription factors in the populations of interest. This is represented by a FACS plot and the respective MFI quantification in a dot plot. Yet, the FACS plots are lacking the respective gates that give rise to the MFI quantification. It would vital that these gates are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. Specially, since TBX21 and EOMES expression in CD8s appears to be across 3 populations for perforin expression, making it unclear which one was considered CD8 N and CD8<sub>CTX</sub>.</p><p>Additionally, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> the authors claim that there was no apparent difference in the methylation of the ZBTB7B promoter between CD4<sub>CTX</sub> and CD8<sub>CTX</sub>. The data shown is inconclusive and subjective to the reader's interpretation. If anything it appears that ZBTB7B promoter is more hypomethylated in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> compared to CD8<sub>CTX</sub> but without any sort of quantification all of these conclusions are very individual specific. The authors conclusions on this piece of data need to be tempered down.</p><p>[Minor comments not shown.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30496.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments requiring attention:</p><p>1) Various sets of data related to key findings could be improved by adding extra information or quantification.

Overall, these data confirm the conclusions proposed in our initial manuscript. In particular, ThPOK and Eomes protein expression data confirmed mRNA expression data in CD8 T cell subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The only observed discrepancy relates to ThPOK expression in CD4 T cell subsets where mRNA data indicate a higher expression in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> as compared to naive T cells whereas protein data indicate a high and similar expression in both subsets. This difference may be related to post-transcriptional regulation of ThPOK gene expression or to a higher sensitivity of the quantitative PCR as compared to flow cytometry. We consider that both results confirm our conclusion that the differentiation of human CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells is not associated with, and does not require the down regulation of ThPOK expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The non-essential effect of Eomes in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> cells is an interesting finding.

The authors should also clarify whether ThPOK is indeed expressed by CD8<sub>CTX</sub> cells and whether knocking-down ThPOK in CD8<sub>CTX</sub> cells has any effect on their cytotoxic function.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we examined the expression and role of ThPOK and Eomes in the in vitro differentiation of CD8<sub>CTX</sub> T cells. In three independent experiments, CD8<sub>CTX</sub> T cells expressed high levels of Eomes and ThPOK. ThPOK knockdown up regulated the expression of granzyme B but did not consistently modify the expression of perforin. These results suggest that ThPOK may limit the cytotoxic activity of CD8<sub>CTX</sub> T cells through the regulation of granzyme B expression and are presented in Supplementary Figure 10. The results are also in line with the notion that ThPOK promotes the anti-viral functions of CD8 T cells and the differentiation of cytotoxic innate T lymphocytes (1-3).</p><p>In the same experiments, Eomes knockdown did not impact the expression of perforin or granzyme B. This negative result could be related to the relatively moderate knockdown of the transcription factor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and/or to a non-essential role of Eomes in our experimental system. It is important to note that, to our knowledge, the existing literature does not provide a direct demonstration of a role for endogenous Eomes in the differentiation of CD8<sub>CTX</sub> T cells. Ectopic expression of Eomes is sufficient to induce cytotoxicity in both CD4 and CD8 T cells (Cheroutre and Husain, 2013) and the inhibition of the common sequence of T-bet and Eomes (T-box cassette) decreases perforin expression (5). However, to our knowledge, data on the impact of Eomes knockdown in mice or humans are lacking. We consider that this important point requires more in-depth analyses and that it would not be appropriate to include these results in our manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30496.031</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Influence of Eomes on the differentiation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells.</title><p>Naive CD8 T cells were submitted to polyclonal stimulation with PHA in the presence of irradiated allogeneic feeder cells, IL-2, IL-15 and Th1 polarizing cytokines for 7 to 14 days.

The authors should try to knockdown Runx3, T-bet etc. in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> cells isolated from PBMC to assess the effect on cytotoxic function.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the suggestion of the reviewers, we analysed TCR repertoire and PLZF expression analyses on in vitro differentiated CD4 T cells. TCR α and β CDR3 sequencing revealed that CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells included a diverse repertoire of clonotypes with similar proportions of large and intermediate expansions as compared to Th17 and Th2 cells. Furthermore, CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells expressed low levels of PLZF. These results indicate that in vitro differentiated CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells are conventional and not innate-type effector T lymphocytes and are presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We consider that our analysis of the expression of cytotoxic molecules, cytokines, chemokine receptor and transcription factors by in vitro differentiated CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells and of their perforin-dependent cytotoxic activity shows that these cells express key features of CD4<sub>CTX</sub> differentiated in vivo.

Our attempts to grow sorted CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells have not been successful.

The in vitromodel of CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cell differentiation was developed to overcome this constraint.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) RT-PCR or staining for Eomes is needed to resolve the contrast between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (Eomes up-regulated in cytotoxic CD4s by microarray) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (mutually exclusive with perforin in single cell analyses).</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide staining and protein quantification data of Eomes and perforin expression by CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These data confirm that Eomes is expressed at higher levels in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> as compared to naive cells but they also indicate that the magnitude of this up regulation is lower than those of Runx3 and T-bet and does not reach the levels observed in CD8<sub>CTX</sub>. RT-PCR data were included in our initial manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and indicated that, in contrast to perforin, the expression of Eomes mRNA was not higher in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> as compared to CD28<sup>+</sup> EM<sub>Th1</sub> cells. Data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> did not indicate a mutually exclusive expression of Eomes and perforin in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells but rather that only a fraction of CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells expressed Eomes mRNA whereas all expressed perforin mRNA. We realize that the Results section and the figure legend were not sufficiently clear and that this generated some confusion. They have now been amended to indicate more clearly that data are proportions of perforin<sup>+</sup> cells co-expressing individual transcription factors. We performed RT-PCR verification of Eomes expression to further validate our observation. A somewhat higher proportion of Eomes<sup>+</sup> cells was detected in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells as compared to our initial experiment. This did not change the observation that a lower proportion of perforin<sup>+</sup> CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells co-expressed Eomes as compared to the other co-expressed transcription factors. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> has been amended to include these results. The colour code of the figure has also been amended, avoiding the use of white colour, to make it clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Eomes knock-down is actually modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and the conclusion that cytotoxic gene expression in CD4 cells is Eomes-independent should be toned down. Because shRNA experiments are notoriously difficult and prone to off-target effects, the study would be much strengthened if the authors verified shRNA impact on their target by immunoblot analyses of protein expression rather than RT-PCR or the rather inconclusive flow cytometry data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide quantification of transcription factors knockdown by flow cytometry and we increased the number of experiments to perform statistical analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results confirmed the knockdown of Eomes by specific shRNA. We acknowledge in our manuscript that the relatively low magnitude of the knockdown may have contributed to the absence of impact on perforin expression. We discuss these results as well as the Eomes/perforin co-expression data obtained in vivo and in vitro and we suggest that, together, these observations do not support an essential role of Eomes in the acquisition of cytotoxic function by human CD4 T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The conclusion that stepwise changes in the chromatin environment promote expression of cytotoxic genes should be tempered. The supporting data is correlative only and the population-level changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications may simply reflect increased fractions of cytotoxic cells in each population.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the comment of the reviewers and we have amended our manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, authors only compared CD4<sub>CTX</sub> and CD8<sub>CTX</sub> cells with naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells. Other memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, such as CMTh1, EMTh1 and CD27+ CD8 T cells, should be included for comparison to reach a solid conclusion on similarity between CD4<sub>CTX</sub> and CD8<sub>CTX</sub> cells, at least for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, 2B and 2D</xref>. These cells should also be included as controls in the cell lysis assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>Data on the expression of transcription factor mRNA by CM<sub>TH1</sub> and EM<sub>TH1</sub> cells were already included in our initial manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Following the suggestion of the reviewer, we now also provide transcriptome data for CM<sub>Th1</sub> cells in Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. These data indicate that the transcriptional program of CD4<sub>CTX</sub> is closer than the one of CM<sub>Th1</sub> cells to the transcriptional program of CD8<sub>CTX</sub> T cells. We did not conduct transcriptome analysis of EM CD28<sup>+</sup><sub>Th1</sub> cells because the perforin expression profile of this subset was more variable between donors than that of CM<sub>Th1</sub> cells. Also, we did not conduct cytotoxicity assays with CM<sub>Th1</sub> and EM CD28<sup>+</sup><sub>Th1</sub> cells because these subsets did not show significantly different expression of perforin protein as compared to naive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Is CD28 downregulated in perforin+ Th1 cells generated in vitro compared to perforin- Th1 cells in the same culture? If so, the authors should separate CD28+ and CD28- Th1 cells to test their progressive development model. An alternative explanation for increased Granzyme+Perforin+ cells over time is that these cells were selectively expanded.</p></disp-quote><p>The expression of CD28 was not downregulated by in vitro differentiated CD4<sub>CTX</sub> T cells after 2 weeks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).

Can this shRNA affect the cytotoxicity of CD8<sub>CTX</sub> cells? Are Runx3 and T-bet important for CD8<sub>CTX</sub> cells? It is also curious that Eomes mRNA does not co-express with PRF1 in CD4<sub>CTX</sub> cells. Co-staining of Eomes and PRF1 protein should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Answers to this comment are provided under comments 2 and 4. Our attempts to knockdown the expression of Runx3 and T-bet in in vitro differentiated CD8<sub>CTX</sub> T cells with specific shRNA have not been successful. Also, we consider that a detailed analysis of the transcription factors involved in the in vitro differentiation of human CD8<sub>CTX</sub> T cells goes beyond the scope of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In the beginning of the study the authors define two major populations of CD4 T cells, naïve and cytotoxic. However, it seems the naïve subset is defined using CD45RO and the cytotoxic using perforin. There is no reference or explanation on why the authors use CD45RO. They should be consistent in using Perforin or CD45RO to distinguish between these two populations and ideally identify such populations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, and not only in Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this helpful suggestion. We now explain more carefully the gating strategy of naive and cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T cells and we illustrate this strategy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> it is not clear why the authors use EM CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells versus total CD4. Furthermore, the figure legend only mentions the ChIP done on the CD4 subsets. This CD8 population is never defined and the total CD4 population is very heterogeneous, limited the conclusions that can be drawn by the authors. In this regard, the ChIP peaks should be shown for the different populations of CD4 T cells that are further shown in the plots with the normalized enrichment.</p></disp-quote><p>The comment of the reviewers indicate that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> was not clear. The EM CD8 and total CD4 T cell data had been obtained from a public database and were meant to illustrate the regulatory regions in the perforin promoter.
