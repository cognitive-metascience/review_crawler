Colonization and infection depend on specific molecular interactions at the host-microbe interface that involve microbial surface proteins, or adhesins. To date, adhesins are only known to bind to host receptors non-covalently. Here we show that the streptococcal surface protein SfbI mediates covalent interaction with the host protein fibrinogen using an unusual internal thioester bond as a ‘chemical harpoon’. This cross-linking reaction allows bacterial attachment to fibrin and SfbI binding to human cells in a model of inflammation. Thioester-containing domains are unexpectedly prevalent in Gram-positive bacteria, including many clinically relevant pathogens. Our findings support bacterial-encoded covalent binding as a new molecular principle in host-microbe interactions. This represents an as yet unexploited target to treat bacterial infection and may also offer novel opportunities for engineering beneficial interactions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06638.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06638.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06638.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human body is home to many trillions of microbes; most are harmless, but some may cause disease. To live inside a host, microbes must first attach to host tissues. This process involves multiple proteins on each microbe's surface, called adhesins, which interact with the molecules that make up these tissues.</p><p>Like all proteins, adhesins are long chains of simpler building blocks called amino acids, and each amino acid is connected to the next via a strong ‘covalent’ bond. Adhesins, however, typically attach bacteria to host molecules through the combined strength of many weak ‘non-covalent’ interactions.</p><p>It was recently discovered that one adhesin from a bacterium called <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> contains a rare, extra covalent bond—called a thioester—in an unusual location between two of its amino acids. <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> is a common cause of throat infections in humans, and can also cause the life-threatening ‘flesh-eating disease’.</p><p>Walden, Edwards et al. have now used a range of computational, biochemical, structural biology and cell-based techniques to study other adhesins that have thioester bonds in more detail. Computational searches identified hundreds of bacterial proteins containing similar bonds. These included many from bacteria that infect humans: such as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, which is the most common cause of pneumonia in adults; and <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>, which is notorious for causing severe gut infections in hospital patients. Closer examination of the three-dimensional structures of three of these proteins—including one called SfbI from <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>—revealed that each had a clear thioester bond. Biochemical tests of an additional nine of the identified proteins strongly suggested they too contained thioester bonds.</p><p>Walden, Edwards et al. then showed that SfbI was able to not only attach to tissues like conventional adhesins, but also chemically react with fibrinogen: a human protein that is essential for blood clotting and commonly found in inflamed tissues and healing wounds. This chemical reaction results in the formation of a covalent bond between SfbI and fibrinogen, which is as stable as the bonds that link the amino acids in a protein chain. Further experiments revealed that SfbI strongly binds to human cells grown in the lab under conditions that mimic tissue inflammation. Finally, Walden, Edwards et al. made a mutant version of SfbI that did not contain a thioester, and found that it could not interact with fibrinogen nor bind to human cells.</p><p>Together, these findings suggest that thioesters in bacterial adhesins act like ‘chemical harpoons’, which microbes can use to irreversibly attach themselves to molecules within their host's tissues. This attachment mechanism has not been seen before in host-microbe interactions, and further research is now needed to explore whether interfering with this process could represent a new way to treat bacterial infections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06638.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06638.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For commensal and pathogenic bacteria, adhesion to host surfaces is a pre-requisite for colonization and infection, and is mediated by surface-presented adhesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pizarro-Cerdá and Cossart, 2006</xref>). Through specific interactions, these proteins can define host and tissue tropism, providing niche environments and a competitive advantage in the search for nutrients. Bacterial adhesins bind either directly to integral host cell surface components, such as integrins or carbohydrates, or they interact with components of the extracellular matrix resulting in indirect binding to receptors on the host cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kline et al., 2009</xref>). Such molecular interactions that define the host-microbe interface are generally non-covalent in nature and frequently involve extensive intermolecular interfaces and multivalent binding. The surprising discovery of internal thioester bonds in the pilus tip adhesin Cpa from the Gram-positive human pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> raised the possibility of pathogen-encoded covalent adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pointon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Linke-Winnebeck et al., 2014</xref>). Internal thioester bonds are formed between the side chains of Cys and Gln residues, most likely self-generated by a favorable environment during protein folding. Internal thioesters have previously only been observed in mammalian complement proteins C3 and C4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Law and Dodds, 1997</xref>) and related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dodds and Law, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cherry and Silverman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong and Dessen, 2014</xref>). Complement thioester proteins are large, multi-domain constructs that upon proteolytic activation undergo a conformational change that exposes the reactive thioester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janssen et al., 2006</xref>). This is thought to react with nucleophiles on the surface of pathogens, thus mediating irreversible host-encoded covalent tagging of the pathogens for elimination by the host immune system. However, to the best of our knowledge, definitive evidence that internal thioesters in complement proteins deliver an intermolecular bond with a pathogen target is lacking, and it is not clear if target binding is specific or non-specific. Cpa and complement proteins share no identifiable sequence or structural relationship and therefore appear to be evolutionarily distinct. The thioester domains of Cpa are found in a much less complex structural context and do not require proteolytic activation. The only similarity to complement appears to be that the same strategy, a ‘chemical harpoon’, has evolved independently in bacteria and complement-related proteins for the purpose of irreversible binding.</p><p>Internal thioesters are one of the three unexpected self-generating cross-links between amino acid side chains found in subunits of pili and other adhesins of Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwarz-Linek and Banfield, 2014</xref>), with the others being intramolecular isopeptide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang and Baker, 2011</xref>) and ester bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike intramolecular isopeptide or ester bonds, the role of thioesters does not appear to be protein stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walden et al., 2014</xref>). Instead, by analogy to complement, thioesters presented on bacterial surfaces may react with nucleophilic groups on host tissue targets, thus establishing pathogen-encoded covalent adhesion. Indeed, binding of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> to mammalian cells in vitro is severely impaired when an engineered Cpa variant lacking the thioester is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pointon et al., 2010</xref>). While this does not confirm covalent attachment, it supports a role for the reactive bond in bacterial adhesion. Interestingly, a recent study showed covalent bond formation between a Cpa thioester domain and the small molecule nucleophile spermidine, confirming the accessibility and reactivity of the thioester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Linke-Winnebeck et al., 2014</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms of targeting and covalent binding to a relevant host receptor have yet to be discovered.</p><p>Here we experimentally demonstrate that thioester domains are prevalent in Gram-positive surface proteins, and that they share a conserved three-dimensional structure despite being divergent in protein sequence. This suggests that thioester domains may target distinct receptors and have a widespread but currently unappreciated role in mediating pathogen adhesion to hosts. Further, we present the identification of host fibrinogen as a covalently bound target of the streptococcal surface protein SfbI. In a thioester-dependent mechanism, SfbI reacts with one specific lysine residue in fibrinogen, forming a very stable intermolecular amide bond. Using a combination of computational, biochemical, structural and cell-based assays we reveal a novel mechanism for host adhesion mediated by a pathogen-encoded covalent interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of diverse, putative thioester-containing proteins in Gram-positive bacteria</title><p>The discovery of thioester-containing domains (TEDs) in Cpa prompted us to look for similar domains in other proteins. Using a TED of Cpa (Cpa-TED2) as a template, extensive PSI-BLAST similarity searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) yielded hundreds of potential hits, exclusively in Gram-positive bacteria. 54 sequences from 40 species were analyzed further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Putative TEDs appear in a variety of domain architectures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), but are almost always located at the N-termini of proteins containing secretion signals and C-terminal LPXTG cell wall-anchoring motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schneewind and Missiakas, 2014</xref>). Most TED-containing proteins are also predicted to contain intramolecular isopeptide and/or ester domains, usually present in tandem repeat arrays. Like isopeptide domains (sIPDs) in pilus assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2007</xref>), these repeats probably act as ‘stalks’ presenting the TED away from the bacterial surface. We refer to these as TIE (thioester, isopeptide, ester domain) proteins.

Each protein displayed an experimental molecular mass, as determined by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), ∼17 Da lower than predicted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This is consistent with loss of one molecule of ammonia, as would occur upon internal thioester formation. Seven TEDs were produced as Cys to Ala variants, targeting the Cys of the [YFL]CΦζ motif. For each of these variants, the experimentally determined molecular masses conformed to predicted values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), confirming that the −17 Da differences observed for the native proteins are attributable to internal thioesters. For class-II TEDs (BaTIE, SaTIE and CdTEP) the presence of internal thioesters and the identities of the thioester-forming Gln were established by tryptic-digest LC-MS/MS of the proteins after reacting the thioester bond with the small nucleophile methylamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This analysis lends confidence to our definition of domain boundaries of class-II TEDs, which often lack an obvious ΦQζΦΦ motif to define the thioester-forming Gln from sequence alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06638.007</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Protein intact mass MS analysis</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06638.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06638.007</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Protein</th><th rowspan="2">Vector</th><th colspan="3">Molecular mass (Da)</th></tr><tr><th>Calculated</th><th>Observed</th><th>Δ</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SfbI-A40-TED</td><td>pOPIN-F<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></td><td>24,156.9</td><td>24,139.6</td><td>−17.3</td></tr><tr><td>SfbI-A40-TED:Cys109Ala</td><td>pOPIN-F<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></td><td>24,124.9</td><td>24,124.7</td><td>−0.2</td></tr><tr><td>SfbI-A346-TED</td><td>pDEST<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">†</xref></td><td>24,835.8</td><td>24,818.2</td><td>−17.6</td></tr><tr><td>SfbI-A346-TED:Cys103Ala</td><td>pOPIN-E<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn3">‡</xref></td><td>25,626.6</td><td>25,626.3</td><td>−0.3</td></tr><tr><td>SfbI-A20-TED</td><td>pOPIN-E<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn3">‡</xref></td><td>25,996.1</td><td>25,978.5</td><td>−17.6</td></tr><tr><td>SfbI-A20-TED:Cys97Ala</td><td>pOPIN-E<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn3">‡</xref></td><td>25,964.1</td><td>25,963.6</td><td>−0.5</td></tr><tr><td>GfbA-TED</td><td>pDEST<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">†</xref></td><td>24,382.4</td><td>24,364.7</td><td>−17.7</td></tr><tr><td>FbaB-TED</td><td>pOPIN-F<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></td><td>21,683.0</td><td>21,665.6</td><td>−17.4</td></tr><tr><td>FbaB-TED:Cys94Ala</td><td>pOPIN-E<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn4">§</xref></td><td>22,447.7</td><td>22,447.5</td><td>−0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Cpa-TED2</td><td>pOPIN-F<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></td><td>22,377.8</td><td>22,360.5</td><td>−17.3</td></tr><tr><td>CpTIE-TED</td><td>pOPIN-F<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></td><td>21,261.0</td><td>21,243.7</td><td>−17.3</td></tr><tr><td>CpTIE-TED:Cys138Ala</td><td>pOPIN-F<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></td><td>21,228.9</td><td>21,227.8</td><td>−1.1</td></tr><tr><td>CodTIE-TED</td><td>pOPIN-F<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></td><td>25,011.6</td><td>24,994.3</td><td>−17.3</td></tr><tr><td>CodTIE-TED:Cys157Ala</td><td>pOPIN-F<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></td><td>24,979.5</td><td>24,979.1</td><td>−0.4</td></tr><tr><td>PnTIE-TED</td><td>pDEST<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">†</xref></td><td>25,779.0</td><td>25,761.7</td><td>−17.3</td></tr><tr><td>PnTIE-TED:Cys94Ala</td><td>pHisTEV<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">†</xref></td><td>25,746.9</td><td>25,746.5</td><td>−0.4</td></tr><tr><td>BaTIE-TED</td><td>pHisTEV<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">†</xref></td><td>28,541.1</td><td>28,523.7</td><td>−17.4</td></tr><tr><td>SaTIE-TED</td><td>pHisTEV<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">†</xref></td><td>33,167.9</td><td>33,151.3</td><td>−16.6</td></tr><tr><td>CdTEP-TED</td><td>pHisTEV<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn5">#</xref></td><td>46,363.7</td><td>46,345.7</td><td>−18.0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><label>*</label><p>Non-native residues remaining after 3C cleavage: N-terminal GP.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><label>†</label><p>Non-native residues remaining after TEV cleavage: N-terminal GAM.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn3"><label>‡</label><p>Non-native residues remaining: N-terminal M, C-terminal KHHHHHH.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn4"><label>§</label><p>Non-native residues remaining: C-terminal KHHHHH only.

Despite pairwise sequence identities as low as 12% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), implying no difference from chance, the overall structures of all TEDs solved to date are remarkably similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The three native TED structures determined here show continuous electron density between the Cys and Gln side chains predicted to form the thioesters (SfbI-A40-TED: Cys109-Gln261, PnTIE-TED: Cys94-Gln247, CpTIE-TED: Cys138-Gln267, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pointon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Linke-Winnebeck et al., 2014</xref>), the thioesters are largely buried at the interface between α-helical and β-barrel subdomains. The thioester Cys backbone carbonyl and amide groups form hydrogen bonds to the Gln, and in some cases Trp, side chains of the TQxxΦWΦxζ motif of the central helix, but from the structures no obvious role of this motif for thioester bond formation is apparent. One notable difference between the TED structures is the position of the loop between the first two strands of the β-barrel, which lies adjacent to the thioester and results in very different protein surfaces around this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). Given the proximity to the thioester, we suggest that this loop may be involved in interactions that define thioester target specificity, although this has yet to be tested. Furthermore, the α-helical subdomain shows a larger degree of structural variation than the β-barrel subdomain. The structure of CpTIE-TED:Cys138Ala is essentially identical to the native protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>), confirming that internal thioesters are not structural determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walden et al., 2014</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06638.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Crystal structures of TEDs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representations of crystal structures of SfbI-A40-TED (blue), CpTIE-TED (burgundy) and PnTIE-TED (yellow) with thioesters shown as sticks.

Of our panel of twelve TED proteins, the streptococcal protein SfbI is the most thoroughly characterized. SfbI mediates internalization of bacteria by host cells through binding to the extracellular protein fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwarz-Linek et al., 2006</xref>). The N-terminal domain of SfbI (revealed here to be a TED) is not strictly required for this process, but defines the uptake mechanism and is a determinant of intracellular bacterial survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rohde et al., 2011</xref>). It has also been reported to interact with fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katerov et al., 1998</xref>). We investigated if this interaction involves thioester-dependent covalent bond formation by mixing purified TEDs with fibrinogen and analyzing the resulting samples by SDS-PAGE. For all three SfbI-TED variants (SfbI-A40-TED, SfbI-A346-TED, SfbI-A20-TED), and FbaB-TED, a new band is present at a molecular mass consistent with an adduct of each TED with one fibrinogen subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, a group of protein bands corresponding to the heterogeneous fibrinogen Aα chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mosesson et al., 1972</xref>) show depletion in the adduct samples, which is clearest for SfbI-A20-TED with the conditions used here. This suggested that SfbI-TED and FbaB-TED were covalently binding to the Aα chain of fibrinogen. When fibrinogen is incubated with the Cys/Ala variants of the SfbI-TEDs and FbaB-TED, no adduct bands are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting their formation critically depends on the thioesters. Other TEDs did not form a fibrinogen adduct under the conditions of the assay, indicating this activity is not a generic, non-specific property of TEDs.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06638.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>SDS-PAGE analysis of TED:fibrinogen (Fg) adduct formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stable adducts between fibrinogen and TEDs revealed by SDS-PAGE.

Peptides from the fibrinogen γ (but not the Bβ) chain were observed at comparably low scores. This can be explained by the presence of a fibrinogen γ dimer, commonly observed in fibrinogen samples, which has a mass similar to the TED-Aα cross-linked protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The MS results implicate a site in the fibrinogen Aα chain as the target of SfbI- and FbaB-TEDs. Acetylation of primary amines in fibrinogen abrogates TED/fibrinogen adduct formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting Lys side chains as the likely nucleophiles to react with the thioester. This would result in formation of an intermolecular isopeptide bond to the side chain carbonyl group of the TED Gln in the ΦQζΦΦ motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SfbI-TED specifically forms an adduct with fibrinogen Aα in blood plasma</title><p>To assess the specificity of SfbI-TED and FbaB-TED binding to fibrinogen, pull-down assays using human blood plasma were performed. TEDs were immobilized using isopeptide domain (IPD) complementation; a strategy that allowed us to use a toolbox approach for many constructs that were used in both pull-down and cell binding (described below) experiments. IPD complementation relies on the spontaneous amide bond formation between a truncated, or split, IPD of the streptococcal FbaB protein that lacks the C-terminal β-strand (sIPD), and a peptide representing this missing strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zakeri et al., 2012</xref>). The peptide, named here isopep-tag (iPT) is used as an expression tag fused as bait to the C-termini of TEDs (TED-iPT) while the sIPD is immobilized on sepharose beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The advantage of this covalent pull-down strategy is the ability to greatly reduce the amount of non-specific binding. Each of the SfbI-TEDs pulled down fibrinogen from this complex biologically relevant sample by forming an adduct with fibrinogen Aα, although to differing degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For FbaB-TED, little fibrinogen was detectable and the protein appeared to bind non-covalently to albumin. All TED Cys/Ala variants failed to pull down fibrinogen from plasma. There is no evidence for covalent binding of TEDs to any other protein in plasma pull-downs. Gel bands present in samples eluted from the beads were analyzed by MS and contained sequences matching fibrinogen, or the TED-sIPD pull-down constructs. For FbaB, the albumin band contained no TED peptides.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06638.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>TED:fibrinogen (Fg) adduct formation in plasma pull down assays.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the isopeptide domain (green) complementation used in the pull-down assays.

Acetylation results in specific modification of solvent-accessible Lys ε-amine groups. Following proteolytic digests of bands corresponding to fibrinogen Aα and the SfbI-A40-TED:fibrinogen Aα covalent adduct, we observed near-complete coverage of the Aα sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of all Aα-Lys residues, only Lys100 was acetylated in the free, but not the bound form of fibrinogen. One other Lys residue, Lys446, was not covered by the analyses of either free or bound fibrinogen. nanoLC-MS<sup>E</sup> spectra were scrutinized for potential cross-links between the tryptic peptide containing this Lys residue and TEDs, but no matching precursor peptide masses could be found.</p><p>All available evidence supports reaction of SfbI and FbaB TEDs with fibrinogen Aα-Lys100 exclusively. If binding were not specific for a single Lys, we would expect to observe multiple binding of TEDs to different Lys residues on a single fibrinogen molecule. We do not see evidence for such higher-order complexes in SDS-PAGE gels. Further, if only one TED can covalently bind to fibrinogen, but through different Lys residues, this would result in a mixed population of cross-linked species with the same molecular mass, but different acetylation and tryptic digest patterns. There is no evidence to support such events in our exhaustive MS analyses, which only support modification of Aα-Lys100.</p><p>Aα-Lys100 is presented on the surface of the α-helical coiled-coil region of fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

It is however also produced by extrahepatic epithelial cells, and is present in the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pereira et al., 2002</xref>), the provisional matrix in wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 1982</xref>) and in inflamed tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawrence and Simpson-Haidaris, 2004</xref>). Fibrinogen expression is upregulated during inflammatory acute phase response in hepatocytes, but also in epithelial cells by the synergistic action of corticosteroids and interleukin-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Snyers et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haidaris, 1997</xref>). This inflammatory response can be induced in cell culture by incubation with dexamethasone and interleukin-6. Under these conditions human A549 lung epithelial cells express and secrete fibrinogen, which remains associated with cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guadiz et al., 1997</xref>). We investigated if SfbI-TEDs interact with such induced A549 cells. SfbI-TED binding to unfixed, viable, adherent cells was visualized by conjugating TED-iPT constructs via IPD complementation to GFP fused to sIPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zakeri et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). SfbI-A40-TED bound to A549 cells only after they had been pre-incubated with dexamethasone and interleukin-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). SfbI-A40-TED:Cys109Ala binding to A549 cells was not detectable with or without induction. To obtain direct evidence for fibrinogen binding, Western blot analyses of cell homogenates using an anti-fibrinogen α antibody were performed. These confirmed upregulation of fibrinogen expression following exposure of cells to dexamethasone/interleukin-6, in agreement with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Snyers et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haidaris, 1997</xref>).

The lack of this band in homogenates from induced cells incubated with SfbI-A40-TED:Cys109Ala confirms formation of this adduct is dependent on the thioester. These data show that SfbI-A40-TED adherence to A549 cells under conditions mimicking inflammation depends on thioester-mediated covalent binding to cell surface-associated fibrinogen.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06638.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Thioester-dependent binding of SfbI-A40-TED to A549 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the covalent cell labeling experiment.

Two well-studied examples for bacterial fibrinogen-binding proteins involved in invasive infections are clumping factor A of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ganesh et al., 2008</xref>) and the M1 protein of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Macheboeuf et al., 2011</xref>). In this study we have not investigated the role of SfbI binding to fibrinogen during bacterial infection. However, <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> is known to target epithelial and endothelial cells for adhesion and invasion, and to cause invasive infections involving dissemination in the blood stream. Therefore our experiments using fibrin and epithelial cells represent meaningful biological models to probe the role of thioester-dependent covalent interaction in infections. Perhaps most significantly our data suggest that fibrinogen may have an unappreciated role as a host cell-surface associated adhesion target for bacteria. Potentially SfbI through its fibrinogen-binding activity may confer a tropism for inflamed tissue or the provisional matrix of healing wounds.</p><p>To mediate strong attachment, bacterial adhesion complexes typically present extensive, multivalent binding interfaces. Our results show that a wide and diverse range of Gram-positive bacteria have evolved a mechanism for covalent bond formation with specific host factors via a pathogen-encoded reactive internal thioester. Thioester proteins could form a continuous covalent bridge between the bacterial cell envelope and host adhesion targets. This would provide rapid, mechanically very strong attachment that may be particularly advantageous under conditions of shear stress. Lack of similarity in the amino acid sequences of TEDs, together with the observation that only a small subset of those tested here bind fibrinogen, suggests there are undiscovered targets of these proteins. Thioester-dependent covalent adhesion may be a common molecular mechanism in host-microbe interactions, playing a key role in host colonization by both commensal and pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. As such, TEDs are potentially attractive targets for the design of small molecules to inhibit infection, but they also present an opportunity to engineer beneficial interactions. TEDs hold promise as reactive protein fusion tags for use in tissue engineering, diagnostics or as tools for cell and molecular biology. While we think it is likely that many thioester-containing bacterial proteins will play a role in host-microbe interactions, it is also possible that they function in other processes such as bacteria–bacteria interactions and biofilm formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Sequence alignments</title><p>The multiple sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) was produced with MAFFT/L-INS-i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katoh et al., 2002</xref>), refined and formatted using BioEdit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall, 1999</xref>) taking into account structural data and secondary structure predictions by JPred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cole et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Expression vectors for protein production</title><p>Five <italic>E. coli</italic> expression vectors were used to encode TED proteins: pOPIN-F, pOPIN-E, pHisTEV, pDEST and pDEST-iPT.

Peptides were trapped using a pre-column (Symmetry C18, 5 µm, 180 µm × 20 mm, Waters), which was switched in-line to an analytical column (BEH C18, 1.7 µm, 75 µm × 250 mm, Waters) for separation. Peptides were eluted with an 8–50% acetonitrile gradient in water/0.1% formic acid at 0.75% per minute (250 nl/min). The column was connected to a 10 µm SilicaTip nanospray emitter (New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA) for infusion into the mass spectrometer. [Glu<sup>1</sup>]-fibrinopeptide B (1 pmol/µl, Sigma) was infused at 0.5 µl/min as a lock mass and measured every 30 s. The spectrometer was controlled by the Masslynx 4.1 software (Waters) and operated in positive MS<sup>E</sup> and sensitivity mode with capillary voltage of 3 kV, cone voltage, 40 V. Scan time was 1 s over the range 50–2000 m/z range. For the low energy scan the trap collision was off, and for the high energy scan the trap collision energy (CE) was ramped from 20–60 V. For de novo identification of proteins, raw files were processed in Protein Lynx Global Server 2.5.2 (Waters), including a search on a <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> protein database to which the TED protein sequences had been added.</p><p>Acquisition in MS<sup>E</sup> mode uses alternating low and high CE scans and generates 2 separate chromatograms. To detect the TED-fibrinogen Aα cross-linked peptides, extracted ion chromatograms were generated from the high CE trace in Masslynx 4.1. and inspected for characteristic y-ions expected from C-terminal TED-peptide fragments starting with proline. Peptides are known to fragment to the N-terminus of prolines, and the sequences searched for here were Pro (116.071 Da, SfbI-A40-TED-fibrinogen), Pro–Lys (244.166 Da, SfbI-A346-TED- and SfbI-A20-TED-fibrinogen) and Pro-Gly-Ser-Arg (416.226 Da, SfbI-A40-TED- and SfbI-A20-TED-plasma). Detected peaks for those y-ions were aligned with the corresponding low CE traces, which reliably lead to the detection of masses consistent with the cross-linked precursor peptides. In some cases we also searched the low CE trace for masses consistent with all possible combinations of tryptic fibrinogen Aα peptides, cross-linked with the relevant TED peptides, but we could find no evidence for additional combinations. Precursor spectra and high CE fragment spectra were inspected for the presence of characteristic fragment ions of the identified cross-linked peptides.</p><p>The lysine-acetylated TED-fibrinogen complex was generated by incubation of 20 µM fibrinogen with a fivefold molar excess of SfbI-A40-TED at 37°C for 1 hr. Sulfo-NHS-acetate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was then added to a concentration of 10 mM and the reaction mixture incubated at 37°C for 2 hr. The sample components were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the TED-fibrinogen Aα adduct bands excised for analysis by MS. For comparison lysine-acetylated fibrinogen bands were produced by the same protocol, with the omission of the TED reaction step.</p><p>Excised gel bands were digested with either trypsin or endoproteinase GluC or, in the case of the TED-fibrinogen adduct, chymotrypsin. The extracted peptides were analyzed by nanoLC-MSMS by the same protocol used for identification of Gln residues involved in thioester bond formation. Peptides with charges +2 to +5 with an ion count over 150 were selected for MSMS, and then excluded for further analysis for 15 s. A rolling CE was applied to fragment the peptides. The data was searched using the Mascot algorithm against an in-house database containing fibrinogen sequences. Carboamidomethyl modification of cysteines was set as a fixed modification, acetylation on lysine and oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications. MS tolerance was ± 20 ppm and MSMS tolerance ± 0.1 Da.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Lactococcus heterologous protein expression</title><p><italic>L. lactis</italic> was grown at 30°C in M17 medium plus 0.5% glucose (GM17). <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> was grown at 37°C in Todd-Hewitt broth plus 0.5% yeast extract.

Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “An internal thioester in a pathogen surface protein mediates covalent host binding” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The editors and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, Walden et al. defined a Cys-Gln-linked thioester-containing domain (TED) present in a large number of Gram-positive bacterial adhesin/surface proteins through bioinformatics analyses. They experimentally confirmed the internal thioester bond in 12 TEDs recombinantly produced in bacteria. They also determined the crystal structures of three TEDs (Sfbl-A40-TED, CpTIE-TED and PnTIE-TED), which are highly similar to the previously determined Cpa-TED2 structure despite the overall limited sequence similarity. This substantiates the definition of the large TED family. The second part of the story shows that SfbI-TEDs and FbaB-TED both from <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> can crosslink with host fibrinogen both in vitro and in the plasma, which is dependent upon the critical glutamine in the TEDs. Mass spec analyses show that Lysine-100 in fibrinogen Aα subunit reacts with the Cys-Gln thioester and forms an isopeptide bond with the glutamine side chain. Engineered <italic>L. lactis</italic> expressing SfbI-TED exhibit intimate adherence to fibrin and this requires the thioester Cys that activates the glutamine for being attacked by the lysine in fibrinogen. Lastly, the authors show a thioester-dependent binding of SfbI-TED to human A549 lung epithelial cells, which occurs when the cells have been stimulated with dexamethasone and IL-6 to mimic the inflammation.</p><p>The first part of the study is an expansion of previous studies (Pointon JA et al., JBC 2010 and Linke-Winnebeck C, JBC 2014), but is more thorough and compelling. The second part is significant; it is the first time to demonstrate that the thioester domain can form a covalent link with the host and to identify fibrinogen could be a host target of the TED. The only previously-known example of such a mechanism is in the human complement system. The current story represents a beautiful example of convergent evolution in which the same weapon has arisen in both bacterial pathogens and their animal hosts. Overall, the study is well designed and the data are convincing and of highly quality. The insights provided shall be interesting and significant to the field of bacteria-host interaction, and also of high value to understanding clinically important Gram-positive pathogens such as <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus.</italic></p><p>Major issues:</p><p>The reviewers have identified some weaknesses in the present study that are presented in detail below. The paper would be strengthened if these points could be addressed satisfactorily, although we shall not insist on extensive new experimentation in order to respond to these points. Please consider how you may best address these issues in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1) The paper would be improved if the authors could provide more evidence that fibrinogen is the relevant host target of one TED-containing protein during in vivo bacterial infection. Otherwise, the significance of the story is only limited to demonstrating that TED does have the ability to crosslink with another protein and the current presentation about fibrinogen could be misleading to the pathogenesis field.</p><p>2) More work is needed for substantiating the target specificity of SfbI-TEDs and FbaB-TED. In particular, the reviewers wonder if the authors have evidence that fibrinogen is the only protein in the extracellular and plasma membrane fractions that can be covalently pulled-down by SfbI-TEDs or FbaB-TED. As for the site specificity, the current mass spec data are not sufficient to demonstrate that Lysine-100 is a specific targeting site. Have the authors made further efforts to investigate the site specificity? In fact, if only Lysine-100, among numerous lysines in fibrinogen, can react with SfbI-TEDs or FbaB-TED, it will add significantly to the confidence that fibrinogen is a specific host target of the TEDs.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, SfbI-A40-TED:GFP bound to A549 cells only after the cells had been pre-incubated with dexamethasone and IL-6. We understand that the treatment is designed to mimic inflammation conditions. But, why is that? Does the stimulation increase the expression and secretion of fibrinogen or provide a more favorable chemical environment for isopeptide bond formation between fibrinogen and the TED? Without further explanation, the data are quite puzzling.</p><p>Other issues to consider:</p><p>1) In the second paragraph of the subsection headed “Identification of diverse, putative thioester-containing proteins in Gram-positive bacteria”, the statement: “Both motifs are predicted to reside in a β-sheet secondary structure context”. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, the second structure of Cpa-TED is shown for all TEDs. The authors should comment whether all the TEDs have a similar predicted second structure profile, as PSI-BLAST search is based on the conserved motif but not the second structure.</p><p>2) In the same subsection, when you state that “mutagenesis of a Cpa-TED demonstrated that neither the Gln nor Trp […] by lack of full conservation of any TQxxΦWΦxζ motif residue”, what is the function of the “TQxxΦWΦxζ α-helical motif”? It is highly conserved among the TEDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). While it is not essential for thioester formation in Cpa-TED, is it also the case for other TEDs? Since the authors have determined and analyzed 4 TED structures, they should clarify more about the role of this motif. Related to this, at the end of the subsection headed “Experimental validation of putative TEDs”, what do the authors mean by “this analysis lends confidence to our definition of class-II TEDs, which often lack an obvious ΦQζΦΦ motif”?</p><p>3) Thioester formation data for SaTie and CdTEP are not sufficient. We presume that the two proteins are difficult to purify and therefore the authors cannot show their total mass as they did with the other 10 TEDs. However, the methylamine modification of the glutamine does not necessarily mean that the glutamine had a thioester bond with the cysteine. Is the glutamine the only one modified by methylamine from the mass spec data? Is there any other way to show the thioester in SaTie and CdTEP or any other Class II TED (otherwise, there will only be one Class II TED experimentally confirmed in the study)?</p><p>4) In the subsection headed “TED crystal structures reveal a conserved fold and adaptations that may target different receptors”, the statement: “this may suggest a role for this loop in defining thioester target specificity.” Have the authors experimentally tested this? If so, it shall be interesting to include the data. Otherwise, it is probably a little overstated.</p><p>5) In the first paragraph of the subsection headed “Thioester-dependent adduct formation of SfbI and FbaB with the Aα subunit of fibrinogen”, the sentence: “a group of protein bands corresponding to the heterogeneous fibrinogen Aα subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mosesson et al., 1972</xref>) were clearly depleted in the SfbI-A20-TED sample”. Why were they were not depleted in other TED reactions as their crosslinking efficiency appears to be comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>)?

Otherwise, the significance of the story is only limited to demonstrating that TED does have the ability to crosslink with another protein and the current presentation about fibrinogen could be misleading to the pathogenesis field</italic>.</p><p>We agree that it would be desirable to obtain data that show significance of fibrinogen binding to TEDs in infections. However, this would require a substantial experimental effort, and would be very difficult to prove unless fibrinogen knockout animal models for <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> nasopharyngeal colonization and invasive infections are established. This is clearly beyond the scope of our study.</p><p>We feel the significance of our study is not limited to the finding of covalent bond formation between a TED and another protein. We do demonstrate covalent bond formation between two out of twelve TEDs to one specific site in one specific protein (fibrinogen). As acknowledged by the reviewers this is the most important finding of our study. However, we report other data that we consider to be of high significance: the first experimental evidence for internal thioester bonds in highly diverse and very widespread bacterial surface proteins other than streptococcal Cpa, and the first demonstration of a role for TEDs in binding to host tissue (blood/fibrin) and host cells.</p><p>We have changed the manuscript to dispel any concern that the presentation of our data on fibrinogen binding is misleading. Binding to fibrinogen is highly specific in two respects. Firstly, there is no evidence for covalent bond formation between SfbI/FbaB-TEDs and other proteins in pull-downs from a highly complex biological sample (blood plasma). Secondly, the covalent TED binding site on fibrinogen is also highly specific. We have added new experimental evidence to further support that binding occurs through a covalent bond between TEDs and exclusively Lys100 on the Aα subunit of fibrinogen.</p><p>While we do not know at which stage of an infection streptococci would target fibrinogen through SfbI/FbaB-TED, we make two reasonable assumptions, and test these experimentally. Both the blood stream and epithelial cells are implicated in infections caused by <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>. The plasma pull-down and the bacteria binding experiments are of relevance for invasive infections, where bacteria would be exposed to high concentrations of fibrinogen and fibrin in the blood stream and on the surface of epithelial cells. Perhaps more interestingly, we also provide compelling evidence for a role of fibrinogen in attachment of SfbI-TED to epithelial cells. We have included additional data demonstrating the formation of a fibrinogen/TED covalent complex upon cell binding. We have rewritten the section on cell binding to clarify why we believe this is a finding of high significance for the field of bacterial pathogenicity research.</p><p><italic>2) More work is needed for substantiating the target specificity of SfbI-TEDs and FbaB-TED. In particular, the reviewers wonder if the authors have evidence that fibrinogen is the only protein in the extracellular and plasma membrane fractions that can be covalently pulled-down by SfbI-TEDs or FbaB-TED. As for the site specificity, the current mass spec data are not sufficient to demonstrate that Lysine-100 is a specific targeting site. Have the authors made further efforts to investigate the site specificity? In fact, if only Lysine-100, among numerous lysines in fibrinogen, can react with SfbI-TEDs or FbaB-TED, it will add significantly to the confidence that fibrinogen is a specific host target of the TEDs</italic>.</p><p>The question of target specificity was not addressed clearly enough in the original manuscript. We have strengthened the relevant section of the paper and have added two new sets of data to support specificity. Firstly, we provide direct evidence for thioester-dependent TED-fibrinogen cross-link formation on cell surfaces (Western blot, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Secondly, we provide additional MS data further supporting highly specific covalent bond formation between TEDs and Lys100 in the Aα subunit of fibrinogen. Lys100 is the only residue in the Aα subunit that that can be acetylated in the free form of the protein, but not when fibrinogen is bound to SfbI-TED (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>, SfbI-A40-TED:GFP bound to A549 cells only after the cells had been pre-incubated with dexamethasone and IL-6. We understand that the treatment is designed to mimic inflammation conditions. But, why is that? Does the stimulation increase the expression and secretion of fibrinogen or provide a more favorable chemical environment for isopeptide bond formation between fibrinogen and the TED? Without further explanation, the data are quite puzzling</italic>.</p><p>We have expanded the relevant section of our paper to address these points. Indeed, upregulation of fibrinogen expression, and its deposition on epithelial cell surfaces after treatment with dexamethasone and interleukin-6, has been established in studies cited in our manuscript. We have added new data (Western blot, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) demonstrating upregulation of fibrinogen after eliciting an inflammatory response in our experiments, in agreement with published data. The mechanism for in vitro induction of an inflammatory response in epithelial cells by the combination of dexamethasone and interleukin-6 has been described in publications cited here. We see no reason why induction of an inflammatory response in epithelial cells should change the chemical environment to favor isopeptide bond formation.</p><p><italic>Other issues to consider</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) In the second paragraph of the subsection headed “Identification of diverse, putative thioester-containing proteins in Gram-positive bacteria”, the statement:</italic> “<italic>Both motifs are predicted to reside in a β-sheet secondary structure context</italic>”<italic>.

While the TQxxΦWΦxζ motif is located close to the thioester bond, the structures do not allow any definitive conclusions concerning the putative role of this motif in bond formation, and we do not wish to speculate about it here. It is not our primary focus, and beyond the scope of our study. However, we are presently working on this in our labs. As for Cpa-TED, preliminary data for SfbI-A40-TED supports a non-essential, and so far unknown, role for this motif.</p><p>The ΦQζΦΦ motif contains the Gln residue that, with the Cys, forms the internal thioester bond.

These data, coupled with the specific modification of a single Gln in the proteins by methylamine, is strong evidence for formation of a thioester in these proteins. We can confirm that only a single Gln is modified by methylamine, as determined by mass spec. In absence of a structure, methylation of a Gln in a TED is, in fact, the best evidence for a thioester bond since it distinguishes this bond from other cross-links such as isopeptides, which also give rise to a –17 Da difference in mass. Amide carbonyl carbons are poor electrophiles and will not react with methylamine, unless the carbonyl group is activated, which in the case of TEDs is achieved by transformation of the amide bond into a thioester.</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection headed “TED crystal structures reveal a conserved fold and adaptations that may target different receptors”, the statement:</italic> “<italic>this may suggest a role for this loop in defining thioester target specificity.</italic>” <italic>Have the authors experimentally tested this?
