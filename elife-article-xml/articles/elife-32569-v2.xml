gradient that drives neurotransmitter loading. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is needed for the formation of new SVs, yet it is unclear when endocytosed vesicles acidify and refill at the synapse. Here, we isolated clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) from mouse brain to measure their acidification directly at the single vesicle level. We observed that the ATP-induced acidification of CCVs was strikingly reduced in comparison to SVs. Remarkably, when the coat was removed from CCVs, uncoated vesicles regained ATP-dependent acidification, demonstrating that CCVs contain the functional vATPase, yet its function is inhibited by the clathrin coat. Considering the known structures of the vATPase and clathrin coat, we propose a model in which the formation of the coat surrounds the vATPase and blocks its activity. Such inhibition is likely fundamental for the proper timing of SV refilling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic vesicle</kwd><kwd>proton pump</kwd><kwd>clathrin coat</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>vATPase</kwd><kwd>acidification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Engelhorn Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoc fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farsi</surname><given-names>Zohreh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Synaptic System</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gowrisankaran</surname><given-names>Sindhuja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118933</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lafer</surname><given-names>Eileen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator Grant RGY0074/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mim</surname><given-names>Carsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emmy Noether Young Investigator Award MI-1702/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milosevic</surname><given-names>Ira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schram Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T287/25457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milosevic</surname><given-names>Ira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB88/A8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milosevic</surname><given-names>Ira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parallel measurements of pH gradient and membrane potential at the single vesicle level have revealed that the synaptic vesicle acidification is initiated by removal of its clathrin coat, which blocks vesicular ATPase activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal synapses are capable of regenerating SVs locally with high efficiency and fidelity in order to meet the demands of neuronal activity. The uniquely homogeneous sizes of SVs and their defined protein composition suggest the existence of a precise endocytic machinery that shapes and promotes the fission of SVs, either from the plasma membrane and/or endosome-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saheki and De Camilli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Soykan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Milosevic, 2018a</xref>). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a classic example of vesicle formation mediated by a coat assembly, and it occurs at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saheki and De Camilli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Milosevic, 2018a</xref>). It has been intensely studied for over four decades, yet numerous details, including when the endocytosed vesicle initiates acidification, remain unclear. The timing and regulation of vesicle acidification is an essential question, not only in the context of SV recycling and neurotransmitter uptake, but also for other endocytic pathways where lowering of the luminal pH is vital for a range of functions, such as separation of cargo from receptor (e.g. iron from transferrin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grant and Donaldson, 2009</xref>) or the activation of viral fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">White et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Acidification of endocytic compartments is primarily mediated by vATPases. These proton pumps are large complexes composed of 14 different subunits that are organized into an ATP-hydrolytic domain (V<sub>1</sub>) and a proton-translocation domain (V<sub>o</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Imamura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Marshansky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cotter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2016</xref>). vATPases are particularly well studied at the synapse, where they traffic with other SV proteins through the SV cycle and generate a proton electrochemical gradient (∆µ<sub>H+</sub>) across the vesicular membrane, fueling the reloading of SVs with neurotransmitters. Yet, many details are not well understood: is vATPase fully active during the entire SV cycle, or is it regulated? If it is regulated, how and when is that done? While some have suggested that endocytic coated vesicles do not have acidic internal pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Orci, 1988</xref>), other studies have shown that membrane-permeable, pH-sensitive, weak bases accumulate in the lumen of CCVs, indicating that acidification occurs in the presence of the coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Forgac et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Dyke et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Van Dyke et al., 1985</xref>). To weigh in on this debate, and to investigate whether vATPase is active on CCVs, we have performed a full characterization of the ∆µ<sub>H+</sub> at the single CCV level.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We have prepared CCVs from mouse brain by adapting a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maycox et al., 1992</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Immunoblotting for organellar marker proteins revealed high enrichment of synaptic vesicle proteins as well as clathrin and clathrin adaptors, whereas no significant presence of plasma membrane, endosome and proteasomal proteins was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Detailed analysis of CCV samples by mass spectrometry revealed that the large majority of CCVs seems to be derived from the synapses, yet some CCV come from neuronal cell body/intracellular membranes (according to the AP2/AP1 ratio; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Furthermore, cryo-EM classification of 43,711 individual particles revealed that the majority of vesicles had an intact clathrin coat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The reconstruction from major classes of the imaged particles resulted in a highly symmetric structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>)(<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), which was comparable in size and symmetry to reconstructed ‘barrel-like’ empty clathrin cages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fotin et al., 2004</xref>).

From those five classes, we have selected two most abundant classes (classes 3 and 4) for the further processing (due to particle abundance, quality and sizes comparable to the size of previously reported ‘barrel-like’ clathrin coat). The length of each image is 123.5 nm. (<bold>B</bold>) The selected particles were classified into sixteen 3D classes without any symmetry (=C1) enforced.

Both ∆µ<sub>H+</sub> components are important for the efficient import of different neurotransmitters, and can be regulated differently in various organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farsi et al., 2017</xref>). To fully characterize the ∆µ<sub>H+</sub> in CCVs, we performed measurements of ∆pH and ∆ψ at a single vesicle level, as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Farsi et al., 2016</xref>). ∆pH was measured in CCVs isolated from brains of mice expressing synaptopHluorin (spH, super-ecliptic pHluorin tagged to the luminal domain of VAMP2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2005</xref>) in the vesicular lumen (spH-CCVs), while ∆ψ was measured in CCVs isolated from the wild-type mouse brains after labeling with the potentiometric probe VF2.1.Cl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). The isolated CCVs were immobilized on glass coverslips, imaged under total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) illumination, and their fluorescence in response to ATP was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The same measurements, as well as the basic characterization of vesicle acidification properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), were performed with SVs isolated from the brains of transgenic mice (spH-SVs) and wild-type mice after labeling with VF2.1.Cl. Upon addition of ATP, only a minor fluorescence change was detected in CCVs when compared to the respective signals from the SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>), indicating that the ATP-induced change in pH and membrane potential was much smaller in CCVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). The distribution of fluorescence response of single CCVs and SVs clearly showed that the majority of the CCVs did not display any ATP-induced acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). The same results were obtained in the presence of chloride in the glycine buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The histogram of luminal pH of CCVs after ATP addition was fit to two Gaussian models revealing that a subpopulation composed of ~6% of the total CCVs acidified to the same mean extent as SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–K</xref>). Acidification of this small subpopulation is likely due to the presence of small SV contamination and/or damaged clathrin coats, as revealed by EM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Altogether, our data provide evidence that a significantly smaller ∆µ<sub>H+</sub> is formed across the vesicular membrane in the presence of a clathrin coat.

In this scenario, vATPases should regain their function once the coat is removed. To test this hypothesis, we performed an in vitro uncoating by treating the CCVs with 300 mM Tris-buffer pH 9.0 (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maycox et al., 1992</xref>), followed by the measurements of ∆pH and ∆ψ in uncoated vesicles in the buffer with the neutral pH, as described above. Firstly, we checked for the uncoating efficiency after alkaline Tris-buffer treatment with negative-staining EM, and observed that almost all vesicles were uncoated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The immunoblot analysis against clathrin heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) as well as adaptor proteins AP180 and AP2 on the uncoated vesicles and in the supernatant after uncoating has revealed that almost no clathrin HC,clathrin LC AP2 and AP180 proteins were detected on uncoated vesicles (all proteins were detected in the supernatant, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), providing further evidence for a complete loss of clathrin lattice. When ∆pH and ∆ψ in uncoated vesicles was determined, we observed, intriguingly, that uncoated vesicles reached the same luminal pH and membrane potential as SVs upon application of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). As a control, we performed the same alkaline Tris-buffer treatment with SVs, and observed no difference in the magnitude of ∆µ<sub>H+</sub> in Tris-treated SVs, ruling out any perturbation caused by alkaline Tris-buffer to the vATPase function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). In addition to the uncoating of CCVs as detailed above, we have used other approaches to uncoat CCVs, namely by treating CCVs with 500 mM Tris pH 7.0, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF at 4°C for 4 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prasad and Keen, 1991</xref>), or by adding purified auxilin, Hsp70 and Hsp110 proteins (to mimic physiological conditions) for 15 min at room temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schuermann et al., 2008</xref>). Both treatments have successfully uncoated all CCVs as verified by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and we have detected full acidification of uncoated vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

To see how the vATPase fits within the clathrin coat, we used the information provided by our structural analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and Suppl.

Considering the size of vATPase and its V<sub>1</sub> domain (~25 nm and ~16 nm, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oot et al.

Data). Previously published studies, as well as our cryo-EM analysis of the clathrin coat, have revealed that upon complete hexagonal ring formation, the terminals of clathrin HCs are placed in a very close proximity (&lt;5 nm) to the vesicle membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). These terminal domains are suggested to form barrels with diameters ~ 10 nm at the inside surface of the cage (our data and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fotin et al., 2004</xref>). To fit in, the neck region of the vATPase (~13 nm) where the regulatory V<sub>1</sub>H-subunit of the catalytic V<sub>1</sub> domain is located would need to be constricted (for more information, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and Suppl data). Thus, we propose a hypothetical model where the steric hindrance provided by the formation of the clathrin coat around the vesicles blocks the vATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>).

Solved structures of vATPase, AP2 complex and clathrin tripods were used to see how vATPase fits within the clathrin lattice, thus all proteins have their ‘true’ dimensions. The plasma membrane is depicted in light beige, clathrin triskelia in dark beige/brown; vATPase complex in gray (when inactive), light blue/gray/dark green (when active; dark green = V<sub>1</sub>H-subunit), AP2 complex in purple/blue/light green. The plasma membrane starts as a flat surface on which the clathrin triskelia begin forming the ring formation around the vATPase (in clockwise direction). Only two AP2 complexes are depicted: upon cargo (yellow) binding, the AP2 complex alters its structure and recruits clathrin triskelia that start the formation of a clathrin ring around the vATPase. For the clathin ring to be ‘closed’, the ‘last’ triskelion to be inserted into the ring collides (gets in direct contact) with the vATPase, namely its regulatory V<sub>1</sub>H-subunit. We hypothesize that the regulatory V<sub>1</sub>H-subunit needs to be displaced inwards, resulting in the inhibition of the stalk rotation and thus block of the vATPase activity. So, upon insertion of the last triskelion in the clathrin ring, the vATPase becomes inactive (shown by a loss of color). The mechanical work of the clathrin coat proteins results in the membrane being pulled in, and as vesicle formation progresses, more clathrin triskelia are added. After vesicle is endocytosed, the clathrin coat disassembles (i.e. clathrin and adaptor proteins dissociate from the newly-formed vesicle), and the vATPase becomes active again.

It contributes to better understanding of the discrete steps of the SV cycle, now requiring clathrin uncoating upstream of acidification and neurotransmitter refilling. Interestingly, our model suggests that even partial formation of the clathrin coat around the vATPase may be sufficient to block its activity - such regulation may conserve ATP at the synapse. Finally, our finding that CCVs isolated from brain do not acidify matches findings in liver CCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuchs et al., 1994</xref>), and may provide insight into other cellular processes that involve both clathrin and vATPases.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32569.020</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Antibodies used in this study.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Antibody</th><th valign="top">Characteristics</th><th valign="top">Producer</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">ATP6V1A</td><td valign="top">NBP1-33021 Polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Novus-Biologicals</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ATP6V1H</td><td valign="top">Ab187706 Polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ATP6V1C1</td><td valign="top">Ab87163 Polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ATP6V1E1</td><td valign="top">Ab111733 Polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">AP-2</td><td valign="top">A2730 Monoclonal</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">AP-180</td><td valign="top">155002 Polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems (SySy)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Clathrin-heavy chain (HC)</td><td valign="top">Ab2731 Monoclonal</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Clathrin-light chain (LC)</td><td valign="top">Ab9884 Polyclonal</td><td valign="top">EMD-Millipore</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">EEA1</td><td valign="top">PA1-063A Polyclonal</td><td valign="top">ThermoFischer Scientific</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase</td><td valign="top">Ab7671 Monoclonal</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">RPT4 (PMSF)</td><td valign="top">Ab14715 Monoclonal</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Proton ATPase (116 kDa subunit)</td><td valign="top">109003 Polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems (SySy)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Synaptotagmin-1</td><td valign="top">105 011 Monoclonal</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems (SySy)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Synaptophysin-1</td><td valign="top">101 011 Monoclonal</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems (SySy)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Synaptobrevin-2/VAMP-2</td><td valign="top">104 211 Monoclonal</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems (SySy)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">anti-mouse IgG (IR680)</td><td valign="top">P/N 925–68070</td><td valign="top">LI-COR</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">anti-rabbit IgG (IR800)</td><td valign="top">P/N 926–32211</td><td valign="top">LI-COR</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">anti-mouse IgG (H + L) HRP</td><td valign="top">62–6520</td><td valign="top">ThermoFischer Scientific</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) HRP</td><td valign="top">65–6120</td><td valign="top">ThermoFischer Scientific</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>spH21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2005</xref>) mice were provided by Dr. V.

We observed no difference between ratiometric values of spH in purified vesicles before and after addition of carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazon (FCCP) at pH 7.4, while acidifying the lumen by incubation of vesicles at pH 5.5 in the presence of FCCP significantly decreased the ratiometric value. This indicates that vesicles lose their luminal proton contents and reach equilibrium with their surrounding buffer during purification of vesicles and immobilization on glass coverslips. Acidification measurements were performed with vesicles isolated from the brain of transgenic mice (spH-vesicles). Potentiometric measurements were performed with the vesicles isolated from brains of wild-type animals after labeling with 100 nM of VF2.1.Cl. Acidification and potentiometric assays were performed in glycine buffer (300 mM glycine, 4 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.4) which was free of membrane-permeable ions. Thus, it could be assumed that the contribution of ions other than protons to the acidification was negligible. Moreover, it can be assumed that these buffer conditions vATPase was the main protein responsible for the observed difference between SVs and CCVs.

It also allows for multiple layers of clathrin-coat formation regulation and provides a simple, yet elegant way by which the presence of a clathrin coat on the vesicle surface blocks the acidification process during its formation.</p><p>The animated 3D model of the vATPase block by clathrin coat was constructed using the original structures (as detailed below) and the custom-written plug-ins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/IraMilosevic/eLife-Farsi-Milosevic">https://github.com/IraMilosevic/eLife-Farsi-Milosevic</ext-link>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/eLife-Farsi-Milosevic">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/eLife-Farsi-Milosevic</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Milosevic, 2018b</xref>) for the 3D software Autodesk Maya (Autodesk Inc., San Rafael, CA). Information on protein structures was obtained from PDB based coordinates and the Uniprot database (PDB codes: 1XI4, 5TJ5: complete 3J9T, 3J9U, 3J9V, autoinhibited 5BW9). References used to model clathrin coat, AP2 and vATPase are listed in the Reference section. All proteins have their ‘true’ dimensions. The α- and β-linkers of AP2 are constructed to enable them to reach their maximal length. vATPase states are defined according to the ~120 ̊rotations: since autoinhibited V<sub>1</sub> is crystalized in state 2, and autoinhibited V<sub>o</sub> is crystalized in state 3, we chose state two to be the state where the stalk rotation is stopped when the clathrin N-terminus pushes it. We depict interplay of clathrin coat and vATPase in the context of a bare vesicle (40 nm in diameter): there are obviously many proteins on the vesicle, yet the proteins are likely mobile. Further, we detected all vATPase subunits on the CCVs, meaning that none of the subunit gets removed from the vATPase complex.</p><p>We referred to clathrin HC as ‘HC’; V<sub>o</sub> subunits were referred to using lowercase letters i.e. ‘d’, and V<sub>1</sub> subunits were referred to using uppercase letters that is, ‘D’; 'V<sub>o</sub>'/'V<sub>1</sub>' lock refers to inactive vATPases; (structure) means that the protein/complex structure in this conformation is available. We considered five possible models:</p><p>(1)'HC' acts on 'd'/'D'/'F' -&gt; 'V<sub>o</sub>'/'V<sub>1</sub>' lock;</p><p>(2a) 'HC' acts on 'H' -&gt; 'H' acts on 'D' (structure), possibly deforming/pushing it (structure) -&gt; 'V<sub>o</sub>'/'V<sub>1</sub>' lock;</p><p>(2b) 'HC' acts on 'H' -&gt; 'H' acts on 'D' (structure), possibly deforming/pushing it (structure) -&gt; 'V<sub>1</sub>' lock, 'd'/'D' interface disturbed -&gt; 'V<sub>o</sub>' lock;</p><p>(3)'HC' acts on 'C' -&gt; 'C' acts on 'd'/'D' -&gt; 'V<sub>o</sub>'/'V<sub>1</sub>' lock;</p><p>(4)'HC' acts only on 'a' -&gt; 'a' acts on 'd' -&gt; 'V<sub>o</sub>'/'V<sub>1</sub>' lock;</p><p>(5)'HC' acts on unknown protein on the vesicle -&gt; 'V<sub>o</sub>'/'V<sub>1</sub>' lock.</p><p>While all of these models may be possible, based on our data and the published literature we consider that the model (2) is the most likely way how clathrin coat inhibits vATPases. Specifically, clathrin HCs that have their N-termini located directly around vATPase will have at least one N-terminus at which the structures collide at the level of the regulatory V<sub>1</sub>H-subunit. Thus, V<sub>1</sub>H-subunit should be displaced in order for the clathrin hexagonal ring to reach its final position. Notably, the cytosolic part of the vATPase (structure 5BW9) adopts an autoinhibited structure that shows the V<sub>1</sub>H subunit affecting the V<sub>1</sub>D subunit. We hypothesize that the formation of clathrin lattice leads to a similar structure in which the proton pump rotation is blocked. Such a model is animated in 3D, and presented in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates the role of the clathrin coat in regulating the vATPase activity of the underlying vesicle. The authors made use of a transgenic mouse expressing synaptopHluorin (spH), a chimeric construct consisting of VAMP2 followed by the pH-sensitive GFP derivative pHluorin. They then used well-established methods to prepare either clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV)-enriched fractions or synaptic vesicle (SV)-enriched fractions from the brains of both the transgenic mice and wild-type mice. The vesicles were immobilised onto coverslips, ATP was added, and TIRF microscopy was used to measure either the change in pH, using vesicles from the spH-expressing mice, or the change in membrane potential, using vesicles from the wt mice and a potentiometric probe. In both cases, the ATP-induced changes were much greater in the SVs than in the CCVs. However, they found that if they first uncoated the CCVs by treating them with a pH 9.0 buffer, the uncoated vesicles displayed the same ATP-dependent changes in lumenal pH and membrane potential as the SVs. These data strongly indicate that the coat inhibits the vesicle's vATPase activity.</p><p>The reviewers all found the work interesting, particularly the way the authors used the spH transgenic mouse to carry out studies on individual CCVs and SVs. However, they also all agreed that the model proposed by the authors is very speculative, that the assay used for uncoating the CCVs is far from physiological, and that some additional experiments are needed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors mention in their cover letter that they had tried uncoating the CCVs using similar conditions to those that are used in the cell, i.e. via auxilin and Hsc70, and didn't get full uncoating. However, it would be good to see the actual data. How incomplete was the uncoating? Did the authors see at least a partial increase in vesicle acidification? All three reviewers wanted to see data on vesicle uncoating under more physiological conditions, so it is likely that the readers will too.</p><p>2) Another key experiment, suggested by one of the reviewers and supported by the others, is to add back coat components to the uncoated vesicles. This would both help to establish that the uncoating method they used is valid, and also allow the authors to look at the role of individual coat proteins (i.e., not only clathrin but also AP-2, AP180, etc.).</p><p>3) The model needs to be toned down because there is really no experimental evidence to support it. If they can show, by carrying out the experiment suggested above, that it is clathrin and only clathrin that is inhibiting the vATPase, then their model has some support, but the method they used for uncoating clearly removes other proteins as well.</p><p>4) There are some problems with the immunoblots.</p><p>4a) First, there is no information anywhere about what antibodies were used. This is essential information because there is so much variability in the quality of individual antibodies. Was the same anti-clathrin heavy chain antibody used throughout? In Figure 1C, lots of non-specific bands seem to be appearing, while in Supplementary Figure 8, it gives the sort of strong and specific signal one would expect, especially in purified CCVs.</p><p>4b) The dot blots (Figure 4B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1) are not acceptable. The dots are of varying sizes and appearances, and the method assumes that all of the antibodies are entirely monospecific, when clearly some of them are not. They need to be replaced by Western blots.</p><p>4c) There are some inconsistencies in the Western blots. In particular, in the blot in Figure 3A, where equal amounts of protein were loaded into the SV and CCV lanes, there is a stronger signal for VAMP2 and other SV proteins in the SV lane than in the CCV lane, which is understandable because much of the protein in the CCV lane is clathrin and other coat proteins. Similarly, in Supplementary Figure 8, there is a stronger signal for VAMP2 in the SV lane. However, there is also a stronger signal for α-adaptin (AP-2) in the SV lane, which doesn't make sense. Moreover, the iBAQ values, which are reasonably quantitative within a single sample, clearly indicate that this is not the case. If one normalizes the iBAQ data to assume that there is twice as much VAMP2 in the SVs as in the CCVs (which is the sort of difference suggested by the Western blot), then there should be about four times as much α-adaptin in the CCVs as in the SVs, not less α-adaptin in the CCVs.</p><p>5) The authors say: &quot;Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a classic example of vesicle formation mediated by a coat assembly, and it is the prominent endocytic pathway at the synapse.&quot; This sentence should be toned down as CME is not necessarily the sole endocytosis pathway for synaptic vesicle endocytosis (Watanabe et al. 2013; Kononenko et al. 2014). Moreover, it is very relevant to this study to know where clathrin is used. If it is on the plasma membrane, then acidification will take place in the CCV or, as proposed here, after uncoating. However, if clathrin is required on endosome-like vesicles (Watanabe et al., 2014) then acidification could occur before clathrin coated bud formation, making the issue of acidification less relevant.</p><p>6) The difference in CCVs vs. SVs is revealed by assays performed in a buffer composed of 300 mM glycine, 4 mM MgSO4, 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, devoid of &quot;membrane permeable ions&quot;. How is the pH equilibrated to 7.4? In this buffer, SVs can acidify only to pH 7.0, far from the physiological pH. In the &quot;full characterization&quot; of SVs, Figure 2—figure supplement 2, by adding 30 mM chloride SVs can acidify to pH 5.5, the physiological pH. Why did the authors use the buffer without membrane permeable ions? They should repeat the measures with chloride to assess whether CCVs are able to acidify or not in this more physiological context.</p><p>7) Is there any evidence that acidification is delayed at synaptic terminals? Available data on acidification, based on spH measurements in cultured neurons, seems to be at odds with a significant delay (Atluri and Ryan 2006; Leitz and Kavalali 2011; Soykan et al., 2017). This should be discussed. Moreover, there are mutant mice (synaptojanin KO, endophilin TKO) for which CCV uncoating seems to be delayed. Is there any indication that acidification is delayed in these mice?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32569.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors mention in their cover letter that they had tried uncoating the CCVs using similar conditions to those that are used in the cell, i.e. via auxilin and Hsc70, and didn't get full uncoating.

In the previous version, we used 300mM Tris-buffer pH 9 for 15 min to uncoat CCVs, as described by Maycox et al. JCB 1992. We have now also uncoated CCVs while maintaining neutral pH by treating them with the buffer containing 500mM Tris, pH 7.0, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF at 4C for 4 hours ̊ – these conditions are commonly used to extract coat proteins including clathrin, adaptor proteins and/or auxilin from purified coated vesicles for further purification (e.g., Prasad and Keen, Biochemistry 1991). Full uncoating of CCVs and recovery of full acidification was observed (see new Figure 4 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Second, as requested by the reviewers, we have carried out uncoating experiments using purified auxilin, Hsc70 and Hsp110 proteins (through collaboration with Prof Eileen Lafer, San Antonio, TX, USA). We were pleased to observe that the addition of highly purified auxilin, Hsc70 and Hsp110 for 15 min at room temperature has uncoated all CCVs efficiently, and revealed that uncoated vesicles acidify (see new Figure 4).</p><p>In sum, as presented in new Figure 4, uncoating enhances acidification of the CCV sample to the level of SV sample regardless of whether uncoating was achieved enzymatically, or by treatment with “non-physiological” uncoating buffers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another key experiment, suggested by one of the reviewers and supported by the others, is to add back coat components to the uncoated vesicles. This would both help to establish that the uncoating method they used is valid, and also allow the authors to look at the role of individual coat proteins (i.e., not only clathrin but also AP-2, AP180, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that such an experiment would be highly attractive, however, while the formation of empty clathrin cages in vitro (without vesicle) is well established for over a decade, we are not aware of any reports showing that uncoated vesicles can be re-coated in vitro by adding coat components.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have tried several conditions to recoat recently uncoated vesicles. In one of the approaches, we first uncoated freshly prepared CCVs using the aforementioned 300 mM Tris-buffer approach, and then added recombinant clathrin HC and LC obtained from Prof Lafer. While we have detected partial recoating (clathin coats were detected on ~9% of vesicles by EM, no coated vesicles were detected in uncoated samples) and a shift towards lower membrane potential values was observed when averaging the whole vesicle population, the recoating was not very efficient under these conditions. These data are now included below as additional data for reviewers. We spent several months trying to address this point, but apparently this is far from trivial as suggested by the lack of published evidence showing that such recoating can be achieved in vitro.</p><p>Additional data for reviewers:</p><p>Recoating of uncoated clathrin-coated vesicles</p><p>To remove the clathrin coat from the CCVs, ~20 µg of isolated CCVs were diluted in 300 µl of pre-warmed uncoating buffer (Tris/Cl 300 mM, pH 9.0), and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The sample was then transferred to dialysis cassette (Slide-A-Lyser 2K, Thermo Scientific) and dialysed overnight at 4°C against MES 100 mM pH 7.0, imidazole 20 mM, KCl 25 mM, (NH<sub>4)2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> 10 mM, Mg-acetate 2mM, DTT 2mM. Additional 1h was allowed at room temperature before the sample was carefully taken out of the dialysis cassette. The vesicles were immobilized on the PLL-coated coverslips and labeled with VF2.1.Cl as detailed above. Alternatively, for the EM experiments, the sample taken out of the dialysis cassette was centrifuged at the table-top centrifuge at maximal speed for 20 minutes, and 3-5 µl taken from the bottom of the tube were put to the formvar carbon coated 100-mesh grids. The samples are the stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 1 min at RT, dipped in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O, dried and subsequently inspected by JEM 1011 microscope (80kV, JEOL, Germany).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32569.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Partial recoating of previously uncoated CCVs was not robust enough to produce a significant difference in acidification assay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electron micrographs of negatively stained sample after the vernight “recoating” treatment as detailed in Materials and methods.

Our title, Abstract and manuscript text state clearly that it is the complete clathrin coat that controls synaptic vesicle acidification, and not clathrin itself. The proposed model is based on the contribution of adaptor proteins since adaptor proteins (e.g. AP2, AP180) are essential for recruiting clathin triskelia to the membrane in order to initiate and organize the formation of clathrin coat around the vesicle. It is not possible to form clathrin coats around vesicles without adaptor proteins. vATPase is the largest protein complex on synaptic vesicles that is, due to its size, most likely positioned in one of the hexagon rings of the clathrin coat. Given that we find the whole vATPase complex on CCVs (Figure 3 and the proteomics data), and that the structure of vATPase and clathrin coat are known, we have examined, by using the original structures in their real dimensions, how clathrin coat can accommodate the large vATPase complex. While we are not yet able to detect vATPase at CCVs in the cryo-EM experiments, we have succeeded in generating a reconstruction of most abundant CCV moiety (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 1D), and we have docked the published vATPase structure into this reconstruction (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). The collision between vATPase structure and our reconstructed CCV (identical to the clathrin lattice in Fotin et al. Nature 2004, albeit our structure contains the vesicle) occurs primarily at the level of V<sub>1</sub>H regulatory subunit, a part of vATPase suggested to regulate the vATPase activity by numerous reports.</p><p>In order to obtain additional experimental evidence for the model, we have performed cryo-electron tomography on purified CCVs, and on purified CCVs that were partially uncoated (vATPase is not well visible in the tightly packed clathrin-coated vesicles) with a help of Dr Ruben Fernandez-Busnadiego at the MPI for Biochemistry, Munich, Germany. We have detected signals reminiscent of clathrin “filaments” in the close proximity of the signals reminiscent of vATPases, and the measured dimensions were in agreement with our model (see Video 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>), but more work is needed here to ensure that the observed signals correspond to clathrin and vATPase. Thus, we prefer not to report on the cryo-electron tomography data at this stage.</p><p>We have now added additional data and information in the revised manuscript, and would like to stress that we consider that the clathrin coat, and not clathrin or adaptor proteins alone, block the vATPase activity. We have prepared an animation using original structures and following numerous cited literature, and we have stated at several instances that this is just a hypothetical model, and that more experimental work is needed to understand how clathrin coat inhibits the vATPase activity while the vesicles are coated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are some problems with the immunoblots.</p><p>4a) First, there is no information anywhere about what antibodies were used. This is essential information because there is so much variability in the quality of individual antibodies. Was the same anti-clathrin heavy chain antibody used throughout? In Figure 1C, lots of non-specific bands seem to be appearing, while in Supplementary Figure 8, it gives the sort of strong and specific signal one would expect, especially in purified CCVs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a table that lists all antibodies and their sources (see new Table 2). In the original manuscript, several different antibodies against clathrin LC and HC were used. We have repeated all experiments with anti-clathrin HC and LC antibodies obtained from Abcam and Millipore, respectively (see new Figure 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4b) The dot blots (Figure 4B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1) are not acceptable. The dots are of varying sizes and appearances, and the method assumes that all of the antibodies are entirely monospecific, when clearly some of them are not. They need to be replaced by Western blots.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1: Please note that the dot blots were used just to optimize the CCV purification protocol. Specifically, we have monitored the distribution of clathrin and VAMP2, an integral synaptic vesicle protein, in the D<sub>2</sub>O/sucrose gradient by dot blot, since there was not enough material to run the classical Western blot. We have chosen anti- VAMP2 (SySy) and anti-clathrin LC (Millipore) antibodies, which are affinity-purified antibodies with proven specificity (numerous publications and manufacturers’ web pages, we have verified the specificity of these antibodies ourselves as well). If the reviewers still consider these data not acceptable, we will remove them. However, we consider that it is useful to show a key protocol optimization step in more details.</p><p>Figure 4B: It was reported that incubation with the Tris-buffer removes clathrin coat proteins (Maycox et al., 1992), and similar “stripping” approaches were often used to extract coat proteins (e.g., clathrin, adaptor proteins, auxilin) from coated vesicles for further purification. We have verified this also in our experiments, and dot blots were replaced by Western blots (see new Figure 4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4c) There are some inconsistencies in the Western blots. In particular, in the blot in Figure 3A, where equal amounts of protein were loaded into the SV and CCV lanes, there is a stronger signal for VAMP2 and other SV proteins in the SV lane than in the CCV lane, which is understandable because much of the protein in the CCV lane is clathrin and other coat proteins.

We have quantified the protein concentration in both SV and CCV samples, and have loaded the same amount of protein to be able to compare two samples. As correctly pointed out by the reviewers, much of the protein in the CCV sample is contributed by clathrins and other coat proteins, hence a difference in the overall level of integral SV proteins (e.g. VAMP2). We have repeated Western blots for α-adaptin, with the similar vexing result as originally reported. At present, we cannot explain this discrepancy (maybe it is a problem of the antibody). Given that this minor point is not relevant for the key message of the manuscript, we have removed the α-adaptin Western blot data from the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors say: &quot;Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a classic example of vesicle formation mediated by a coat assembly, and it is the prominent endocytic pathway at the synapse.&quot; This sentence should be toned down as CME is not necessarily the sole endocytosis pathway for synaptic vesicle endocytosis (Watanabe et al. 2013; Kononenko et al. 2014).

Note that a significant difference between SV and CCV samples is present also under these conditions (new Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><p>Regarding the question about luminal pH of vesicles being equilibrated to 7.4, we have shown in our previous work (Farsi et al., 2016) that we did not observe any difference between ratiometric values of pHluorin-probe in purified vesicles before and after addition of FCCP (a proton ionophore) at pH 7.4, while acidifying the lumen by incubation of vesicles at pH 5.5 in the presence of FCCP significantly decreased the ratiometric value. This indicates that vesicles equilibrate with their surrounding buffer during purification and subsequent immobilization on glass coverslips.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Is there any evidence that acidification is delayed at synaptic terminals? Available data on acidification, based on spH measurements in cultured neurons, seems to be at odds with a significant delay (Atluri and Ryan 2006; Leitz and Kavalali 2011; Soykan et al., 2017). This should be discussed. Moreover, there are mutant mice (synaptojanin KO, endophilin TKO) for which CCV uncoating seems to be delayed. Is there any indication that acidification is delayed in these mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Quenching of the pH-sensitive fluorescent protein pHluorin reflects the combined rate of endocytosis and re-acidification of SV proteins tagged with pHluorin (e.g., Miesenböck et al., 1998; Granseth et al., 2006; Atluri and Ryan 2006; Balaji and Ryan, 2007; Balaji et al., 2008; Leitz and Kavalali 2011). Studies with pHluorin-based probes are useful, but not straight-forward since these probes are affected both by endocytic and/or acidification processes, and such processes are stimulation-, model- and temperature-dependent. By using synaptopHluorin, Atluri and Ryan (2006) have suggested that SVs re-acidify within approximately 4-5s. By using vGLUT-pHluorin, Leitz and Kavalali (2011) found that majority of endocytic events happen within 4s after stimulation. Using the rapid application of quenching solutions to separate endocytosis from acidification, Soykan et al. (2017) have also detected two endocytic phases, rapid and slow, at 37°C. In addition, Balaji et al. (2008) tried to separate the components of endocytosis and acidification: they found that the endocytic time constant (measured by the vGLUT-pHluorin probe) was ~6s at 36°C, and ~14s at 25°C, while vesicle acidification took ~4s.</p><p>Recent morphological studies based on optogenetic stimulation followed by rapid freezing proposed the existence of “ultrafast endocytosis” that can recover synaptic vesicle membrane with 30-300 ms after stimulation through the formation of synaptic endosomes (Watanabe et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2014). These synaptic endosomes could be further resolved by clathrin-mediated endocytic process into coated vesicles as fast as ~3s after stimulation (Watanabe et al., 2014).</p><p>Our finding that clathrin coat blocks vesicle acidification until the coat is removed corroborates several of aforementioned studies, and it contributes to the better understanding of these processes. Yet, as apparent from this short overview, the kinetics of vesicle recycling at the synapses is still intensely studied, and the contributions of temperature and stimulation strength are presently being examined. In addition, the nature of intermediates that occur after stimulation is not well understood. This is a complex topic that requires a detailed technical context to be adequately addressed, however, if is considered absolutely necessary, we will include it.</p><p>The delayed post-stimulus recovery observed through pHluorin quenching in auxilin (Yim et al., 2010), synaptojanin-1 KO (Mani et al., Neuron 2007) and endophilin-A TKO (Milosevic et al., Neuron 2011) mutants suggests a delayed kinetics of endocytic process, a delay in the acidification of the newly formed vesicles, or both (note that both mutants accumulate CCVs and endosome-like structures). Notably, based on our data (Milosevic et al. Neuron 2011) as well as Mani et al. (2007) and Yim et al. (2010), the loss of endophilin, synaptojanin-1 or auxilin does not cause a block in uncoating, but a kinetic delay. Similarly, neurotransmission is impaired, but not abolished, and functional vesicles can eventually be regenerated from coated structures (Milosevic et al., 2011). This point is now mentioned in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
