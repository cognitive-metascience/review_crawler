The complete 90S is a gigantic complex with a molecular mass of approximately five megadaltons. Here, we report the nearly complete architecture of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> 90S determined from three cryo-electron microscopy single particle reconstructions at 4.5 to 8.7 angstrom resolution. The majority of the density maps were modeled and assigned to specific RNA and protein components. The nascent ribosome is assembled into isolated native-like substructures that are stabilized by abundant assembly factors. The 5' external transcribed spacer and U3 snoRNA nucleate a large subcomplex that scaffolds the nascent ribosome. U3 binds four sites of pre-rRNA, including a novel site on helix 27 but not the 3' side of the central pseudoknot, and crucially organizes the 90S structure. The 90S model provides significant insight into the principle of small subunit assembly and the function of assembly factors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22086.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22086.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ribosome assembly</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>90S pre-ribosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014CB84980001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Meng-Qiu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91540201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Keqiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB08010203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Keqiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31430024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Keqiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31325007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Keqiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The nearly complete architecture of the gigantic 90S precursor of small ribosomal subunit is determined by cryo-EM.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The small 40S and large 60S subunit (SSU and LSU) of eukaryotic ribosomes are assembled from four ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and 79 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) in a highly complicated and dynamic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henras et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kressler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woolford and Baserga, 2013</xref>). Numerous assembly factors (AFs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) associate with the two subunits to assist their maturation. Mutations in the genes of r-proteins and AFs have been found to cause various diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freed et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The 18S rRNA in the SSU and the 5.8S and 25S rRNA in the LSU are co-transcribed into a long 35S precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA) in the nucleolus in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (Sc). The pre-rRNA also encodes four spacer sequences that need to be removed during processing. The 5' region of pre-rRNA that consists of the 5' external transcribed spacer (5' ETS), 18S rRNA and the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) is co-transcriptionally packed into a terminal ball of ~40 nm in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Osheim et al., 2004</xref>). These particles represent the earliest assembly intermediates of 40S and are known as the 90S pre-ribosome or the SSU processome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Trapman et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dragon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grandi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Phipps et al., 2011</xref>). Within 90S, the pre-rRNA is cleaved at sites A0 and A1 in the 5' ETS and site A2 in the ITS1, yielding a 20S pre-rRNA intermediate. The 20S pre-rRNA is packed in the pre-40S particle and processed at site D in the cytoplasm to generate the mature 18S rRNA.</p><p>The 90S pre-ribosome is assembled progressively in a 5' to 3' order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaker-Margot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>). The 5' ETS associates with U3 snoRNA and 28 AFs into a 2.1 MDa particle. A subset of 5' ETS-associated factors exist as pre-assembled subcomplexes: UTPA, UTPB and U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Watkins et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grandi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krogan et al., 2004</xref>). As the 18S rRNA region is transcribed, the U14 and snR30 snoRNAs and at least 37 AFs are recruited. The assembly of 90S is also highly dynamic. When the 18S rRNA is close to completion, U14 and snR30 snoRNAs and at least 14 protein factors assembled earlier to the 18S region begin to dissociate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>). The fully assembled 90S contains an unprocessed pre-18S rRNA, U3 snoRNA, approximately 51 assembly factors and 18 r-proteins with a molecular mass of 5.0 megadaltons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>Elucidating the molecular mechanism of ribosome assembly requires detailed structural information of pre-ribosomes at different assembly stages. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has been used to reveal structure for 60S pre-ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leidig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrio-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) and a late pre-40S particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Strunk et al., 2011</xref>). These structures represent late assembly intermediates in which ribosomal subunits already take shape. Very recently, a cryo-EM structure of <italic>Chaetomonum thermophilum</italic> (Ct) 90S was determined at 7.3 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kornprobst et al., 2016</xref>). However, the reported model was rather incomplete with many unmodeled and unassigned densities due to limited resolution. Here, we determined three cryo-EM maps of Sc 90S pre-ribosome with resolution from 4.5 to 8.7 Å. The majority of the maps have been modeled and assigned to specific RNA and protein component based on fitting of crystal structures, de novo model building, chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry (CXMS) data. Our maps also contain many densities unseen in the Ct 90S map. The nearly complete 90S model provides major insights into the early assembly events of 40S subunit and the function of AFs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure determination</title><p>We affinity purified 90S from yeast using Noc4 fused to a C-terminal tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag as bait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grandi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>). The purified Noc4-TAP sample contains a large number of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We first constructed a density map for the Noc4-TAP particle at approximately 25 Å by using negative stain EM and with the mature 40S structure as the initial model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). Then, we analyzed its structure with cryo-EM and obtained a density map with a resolution range of 6–20 Å and an overall resolution of 8.7 Å by the gold standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). RNA duplexes, protein α-helices and WD β-propeller structures were readily recognized in the density. However, the densities at the top and some peripheral regions are weak, probably due to the heterogeneity of Noc4-TAP particles that contain both unprocessed and processed pre-rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>). We next attempted to improve the sample homogeneity by genetic approach. The RNA helicases Dhr1 and Mtr4 function after the A0 cleavage of pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de la Cruz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sardana et al., 2015</xref>). To stall ribosome maturation at certain stages, Dhr1 or Mtr4 was depleted and 90S was purified using Enp1-TAP as bait. Although Enp1 is present in both 90S and pre-40S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schafer et al., 2003</xref>), the Enp1-TAP samples purified after Dhr1 or Mtr4 depletion contained mainly 90S particles, suggesting that 90S failed to develop into pre-40S. The two samples were subsequently analyzed by cryo-EM. Three density maps were constructed from the ΔDhr1 sample with resolution ranges of 6–20 Å and 7.8 to 9.5 Å overall resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). One map (state 1) is highly similar to but more complete than the Noc4-TAP map and the other two maps reveal different states of 90S and will be discussed elsewhere. The ΔMtr4 sample yielded a density map of a resolution range of 4–20 Å and an overall resolution of 4.5 Å that is also highly similar with the Noc4-TAP map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Some bulky side chains of proteins are visible at the core region of the ΔMtr4 map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The three maps were essentially superimposable other than differences in resolution and local occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A–B</xref>). The initial Noc4-TAP map, the more complete ΔDhr1 map and the high-resolution ΔMtr4 map allowed us to build a more complete and accurate model.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22086.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM analysis of 90S.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Local resolution cryo-EM maps of 90S derived from the Noc4-TAP (<bold>A</bold>), ΔDhr1 (state 1) (<bold>B</bold>) and ΔMtr4 (<bold>C</bold>) samples.

Helix 6, the binding site for U14 snoRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liang and Fournier, 1995</xref>), is disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). U14 transiently associates with the early assembly intermediates of 90S and is released in our samples that contain mainly complete 90S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>). The peripheral RNA helices ES3A and ES3B are shifted or disordered as a result of Utp20 binding.</p><p>A pre-rRNA fragment that terminates after the 5' apical subdomain (position 435) was shown to recruit Enp2, Bfr2, Lcp5, Efg1 and other unstable factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>). Enp2 is assigned to the only WD domain that is located around the 5' apical subdomain and contacts S8 and helix 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). A large block of density is associated with the WD domain of Enp2 and the N-terminal domain of S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5J</xref>). The density shows a complex fold and probably comes from the rest part of Enp2, Bfr2, Lcp5 and Efg1.</p><p>Opposite to the Enp2-binding site, a very long density wraps around the 5' apical subdomain in about 3/4 circles and then extends to bind the central domain, forming a large S on the top of 90S structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5I</xref>).

Utp20 is the longest protein (2493 residues) in 90S and contains helical HEAT repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dez et al., 2007</xref>). Utp20 contacts both the 5' domain and the central domain and appears to stabilize their conformation in the partially assembled ribosome and facilitate their joining into the body as the ribosome assembly proceeds.</p><p>The 5' basal subdomain is buried in the main body of the 90S structure and contacted by Bms1, U3 snoRNP and a few unassigned α-helices from the structure interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D and F</xref>).

Bms1 consists of four domains (D1-D4) and interacts extensively with the 18S RNA. The D1 GTPase domain binds helices 3 and 4 and the D3 and D4 domains bind helix 18. The binding site of Bms1 overlaps significantly with that of Tsr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Strunk et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that Bms1 is replaced by Tsr1 during the transition of 90S to pre-40S.</p><p>Rcl1, which binds a middle sequence (residues 547–636) of Bms1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delprato et al., 2014</xref>), is located next to Bms1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D and F</xref>). In addition, Rcl1 also contacts the D2 and D3 domain of Bms1. The Bms1 and Rcl1 complex is positioned at the front face of 90S structure and makes multiple interactions with other structural modules.

In 90S, Pno1 is located near the center of UTPB with interactions to the CTD of Utp21 and the WD domain of Utp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). A density that is suggestive of a short RNA hairpin is sandwiched between Pno1 and the WD domain of Utp13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5N</xref>). Because the D site RNA potentially forms a short hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) and binds Pno1, the density was temporarily assigned to the D site RNA. Although the D site RNA was found by chemical probing to be single-stranded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lamanna and Karbstein, 2009</xref>), this result may mainly reflect the structure of pre-rRNA in the more abundant pre-40S ribosome. In the 90S model, the first KH domain of Pno1, which contains a degenerated RNA-binding motif, contacts the duplex part of the hairpin. The second KH domain of Pno1 binds at the 5' single-stranded region of 18S rRNA with the conserved RNA-binding surface, consistent with the known RNA-binding model of KH domain. The linker between helix 44 and D site and major part of ITS1 were not detected. During the stepwise assembly process of 90S, Pno1 is bound after the transcription of helix 44 and before the emergence of the D site sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>). This suggests that Pno1 is initially recruited by the protein-protein interaction with the UTPB complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The 90S model contains a large fraction of stably associated AFs and most likely represents the complete 90S particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>). One main function of 90S is to process the pre-rRNA transcript at the A0, A1 and A2 sites. Unfortunately, the current model does not include these processing sites that appear to locate at the periphery or outside of the 90S core structure. Although the three analyzed 90S samples contain multiple processing intermediates of pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>), all reconstructions led to similar structures, suggesting that pre-rRNA cleavage may not significantly affect the global architecture of 90S.</p><p>The 90S model provides significant insight into the early assembly principle of small subunit. The four domains of 18S are assembled with 19 core r-proteins into isolated subdomain structures that correspond to the early folding units of small subunits. These structures are generally similar to the corresponding structure in the mature subunit, although deviations in local structure are prevalent. The 5' domain and the central domain are assembled to great extents and primed to combine into the body. In contrast, the 3' major domain and the minor domain are significantly deviated from their native structures. Large structural reorganization is required to establish the global architecture of 40S during the subsequent 90S-to-pre-40S transition.</p><p>The current 90S model includes structures for 36 AFs and the 5' ETS and U3 RNA, providing major insight into the function of these components in ribosome assembly. Many AFs directly bind to the nascent ribosome and appear to stabilize the partially assembled structures at stages when some contacts present in the mature subunit have not been established. For example, Krr1 appears to substitute the structural role of helix 45 and S26 in the partially assembled platform.</p><p>The 5' ETS subcomplex acts as a large base to support and arrange individual ribosomal substructures in 90S. U3 is a prominent component in the 5' ETS subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaker-Margot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>). The 5' domain of U3 is located at the heart of 90S and crucially organizes its architecture by making four helices with the 5' ETS and 18S RNA. We show that U3 binds 18S RNA in a way different from the previously proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the mature 40S structure, the 5' end of 18S base pairs with a central region (nt 1140–1144) to form the central pseudoknot (CPK). U3 has been long thought to bind both sides of the CPK and chaperone its formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hughes, 1996</xref>). However, our structure shows that U3 pairs with the 5' end of 18S, but not with the 3' side of the CPK. Previous mutational studies also support the former, but not the latter, interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sharma and Tollervey, 1999</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that the 5' end of U3 makes a novel evolutionarily conserved interaction with the helix 27 sequence upstream of the 3' side of the CPK. By bringing the 5' end and the central region of 18S close, U3 would facilitate the formation of the CPK and the overall architecture of mature 40S after cleavage of sites A0-A2 and during the transition of 90S to pre-40S.</p><p>The 90S structure assembles in a stepwise manner as the pre-rRNA transcript extends in 5' to 3' direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaker-Margot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>). The structural organization of 90S is consistent with the ordered assembly pathway of the 5' ETS, the 5' domain and the central domain as these RNA sequences can form rather independent structures with the associated AFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). The transcription of helix 44 was shown to trigger a dramatic assembly event, which involves association of 12 late factors and release of U14, snR30 and about 14 AFs bound earlier, and eventually leads to the compaction of 90S particle and acquirement of cleavage competency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Osheim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>). The structural role of helix 44 and six assigned late factors (Utp30, Enp1, Bms1, Rcl1, Pno1, Utp20) in the 90S structure provide insight into the last major assembly event. They function to assemble the 3' major domain (Utp30, Enp1), the 3' minor domain (Pno1) and the 5' basal subdomain (Bms1) and to establish long range connections between ribosomal subdomains (helix 44, Bms1/Rcl1, Utp20). Specifically, helix 44 links helix 28 to Utp22, establishing a connection between the 3' major domain and the central domain. Binding of helix 44 to the tandem WD domains of Utp12 and Utp13 would lock their conformation. Consequently, Utp13 would promote the association of Pno1 and the D site RNA and Utp12 would induce the closure of the front face by stabilizing the Bms1/Rcl1 complex that also connects the 5' basal subdomain and the 3' basal subdomain. The elongated Utp20 molecule ties up the central domain and the 5' domain. These assembly events, triggered by helix 44, likely occur cooperatively to establish the global architecture of 90S.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22086.027</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Stepwise assembly of 90S.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Components are added by their known assembly order.

However, the Sc map is more complete than the Ct map. The Ct 90S map lacks densities for the Utp22-Rrp7 complex, Rrp5, Utp18 (in our assignment) and helix 44 and has extremely weak densities for the beak subdomain and bound Enp1. These differences in the density map may be caused by species-specific features, different maturation stages of purified 90S and different sample preparation procedures. The two models have different assignment for Utp6, Utp18, the N domain of Utp10 and Kre33. The bulky density around the 5' apical major domain was assigned to two Kre33 molecules in the Ct 90S, but was tentatively assigned to Bfr2, Lcp5 and Efg1 in our study. We have modeled the 5' ETS and the 5' domain of U3 snoRNA and assigned all UTPA proteins, Sof1, Utp7, Utp11, Enp2, Enp1, Utp22, Rrp7, Rrp5, Krr1 and Pno1. Our model is based on the cryo-EM maps of better resolution and completeness, additional high-resolution crystal structures and chemical crosslinking data and is of much higher quality over the Ct model. Nevertheless, some assignments, especially those without high-resolution crystal structures, should be considered tentative at the current resolution of cryo-EM map.</p><p>The nearly complete cryo-EM structure of 90S provides a platform to understand the large body of genetic and biochemical data on 18S rRNA processing and SSU assembly and sets the stage to investigate the mechanism and dynamics of early SSU assembly at the level of entire 90S structure.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>All strains were derived from BY4741 (Mat a, leu2Δ0, Met15Δ0, ura3Δ0).

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom, Alan Hinnebusch (Reviewer #1) and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Tollervey (Reviewer #3) and Yaser Hashem (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes a cryoEM reconstruction of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> 90S pre-ribosome that was affinity purified using Noc4-TAP or Enp1-Tap as bait proteins, and in the latter case isolated from strains lacking processing factors Dhr1 or Mtr4 in an effort to stall the maturation at a discrete stage. Three similar maps were obtained and discussed here, a Noc4-TAP complex at 8.7A, a ΔDhr1 complex at 8.7A, and a ΔMtr1 complex at 4.5A. (Two other ΔDhr1 complexes were analyzed but are being presented elsewhere.) The ΔMtr1 complex was also analyzed by chemical crosslinking and MS (CXMS) to obtain 340 intermolecular and 255 intramolecular linkages to assist in assignment of EM densities. Crystal structures of 19 of the 33 40S ribosomal proteins (RPs) that could be identified in the structure, and of ~27 different assembly factors (AFs), including a number of unpublished x-ray structures determined by the authors and not yet deposited in RCSB, were modeled into the EM densities. Other densities corresponding to β-propellers were fitted with known structures of other WD40 repeat proteins, or were modeled as poly-alanine helical segments or A-form RNA helices. The structure contains a total of 19 RPs, 35AFs, the 5' external transcribed spacer (ETS), and the U3 RNA. A cryoEM model of <italic>Chaetomonium thermophilum</italic> (Ct) 90S at 7.3A was recently reported. It is stated that the current Sc map is more complete than the Ct map, containing densities not assigned in the Ct map. In addition, a number of densities are assigned differently here compared to the Ct map. Hence, the current map seems to represent a valuable addition to the literature of the 90S pre-ribosome.</p><p>Among the interesting findings is that the 4 subdomains of the mature 40S are evident in the 90S, with deviations in local structure of different extents for the different subdomains; but large-scale reorganization is required to achieve the interdomain arrangements of the mature 40S. They present evidence that U3 binds 18S rRNA in a manner distinct from a previous model and also does not interact with both sides of the central pseudoknot. The structure shows how the 90S can assemble co-transcriptionally in a step-wise fashion as the pre-rRNA transcript is produced. It is observed that helix 44 (h44), not visible in the Ct map, assembles with late AFs and establishes a long-range connection between the 3' major and central domains to help establish the global architecture of the 90S; and that h44 undergoes a major re-location between the 90S and mature 40S.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There was general agreement among the reviewers that the paper is potentially suitable for publication but that additional source data must be supplied to the reviewers to allow an evaluation of certain key assignments of electron density, that extensive revisions of text and figures will be required, and that Northern analysis of the rRNAs present in each of the solved complexes is needed. It is necessary for the authors to make the density map available to the reviewers to allow first-hand evaluation of some of the most unexpected assignments, including a revised base-pairing scheme for U3, a dramatic reorganization of helix 44, and a stem-loop at the D cleavage site. It is also imperative that the pdb files for all of the novel crystal structures be deposited prior to publication and be made available to the referees for inspection during the review of the revised manuscript. The authors also need to document the cross-linking/MS data and indicate when it was used to guide an assignment, and whether each crosslink is consistent with the final structure. The authors must do a better job of citing the previous literature. The paper is a challenge to read and each of the reviewers has specific suggestions for how the presentation of data can be improved, both in text and figures. In addition it is important that the authors address in a more thorough and transparent way the discrepancies between their assignments and those of the recent structure published by Kornprobst et al., and their objective justifications for their assignments. In short, the readers/reviewers of this paper must be able to assess the quality of the interpretation and the model from the data provided by the manuscript, knowing that some of these assignments are provisional, and the authors must do their best to facilitate this assessment. The essential revisions can be found in the reviews below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper describes a cryoEM reconstruction of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> 90S pre-ribosome that was affinity purified using Noc4-TAP or Enp1-Tap as bait proteins, and in the latter case isolated from strains lacking processing factors Dhr1 or Mtr4 in an effort to stall the maturation at a discrete stage.

The details of the model building are fairly well described in the Materials and methods section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, with the exception that the manner in which the CXMS data was enlisted to justify the assignment of ambiguous densities was not documented or explained at all. This information could be added to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> to indicate which crosslinks tabulated in the Supplementary Dataset 1 were used to justify each assignment. Similarly, the Supplementary Dataset 1 should be annotated to indicate whether each crosslink is consistent with the final structure and if it was used to make any assignments of density. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> could also be expanded to include published interactions of each AF that were taken into account in density assignments. At a maximal resolution of 4.5A, it can be difficult to trace the proteins and so it is imperative that the authors thoroughly document everything that went into each assignment so that at least readers can judge how convincing each assignment is.</p><p>It also seems important that the pdb file be deposited in RSCB for every novel crystal structure being cited here and employed in density assignments.</p><p>The paper is a very difficult read. This is partly because the structure is so massive and there are so many noteworthy features to be discussed.

It is impossible to evaluate this claim without having access to the map. This is a general comment for EM papers. Reviewers need to have access to the data, because they otherwise cannot evaluate them properly (we get access to biochemical data, sequencing data, why not structural data?). E.g. in the Kornprobst paper the authors incorrectly assigned Kre33. This is obvious once you look into the density (as the density is not symmetrical), but not necessarily from the manuscript. In any case, without access to the map it is impossible to judge whether the authors correctly assigned the helices base pairing with U3.</p><p>3) Along the same lines, the authors make a number of surprising assignments, including that of H44 at a very different location. This would be a neat finding, but again is hard to judge without a map. Even more surprising is the assignment of the D-site. I am sure the map provides confidence in a stem-loop. However, there are hundreds of stemloops in this molecule. How the authors decide it is a stemloop at the D-site, which has been essentially disproven to exist is totally unclear.</p><p>4) What is the RNA in the molecule? The authors should show a Northern blot.</p><p>5) The authors use a lot of &quot;unpublished crystal structures&quot; to fit their structure. These structures need to be shown as supplemental data, and pdb files need to be submitted and referenced herein.

Correll and co-workers have shown that they function together. Thus, they should be shown together. There should also be references to that work.

This Figure, in my mind was presented really poorly, and I would strongly urge the authors to give a different view. I realize that this will be effort as they need to remake some Figures, but I think it will lead to most people reading this paper and not the Kornprobst paper. Specifically, I would like to suggest that they orient the complex such that the 5'-domain is in the canonical view from the subunit interface (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and G</xref>), where it is at the bottom and not at 2 o'clock (on an imaginary clock). This would also require a rewrite of the overall structure description.

Reports the structure of the 90S complex, an early maturing pre-40S complex, from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> by cryo-EM at an average resolution of 4.5Å. In their work, Ye et al. reveals an intermediate to high -resolution structure of this fascinating complex composed of numerous proteins and RNA where a partially folded 40S structure can be observed engulfed by a very sophisticated scaffold made by the multiple assembly factors (AFs). The authors have attempted several affinity purifications and were successful in pulling down a homogeneous complex, depleted in Mtr4 that appears to yield similar complexes compared to their two other δ-Dhr1 and Noc4-TAP alternative purifications.</p><p>Overall, the paper is very rich in content and presents a highly interesting structure that was thoroughly analyzed. This work follows up on the recent the work by Kornprobst et al. published in Cell last July 2016 from the Beckmann and Hurt labs. The structure by Ye et al. although submitted several months after the Kornprobst et al. presents significant differences that in my opinion warrant its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. One can only regret that these two studies were not submitted as back-to-back publications in the same journal.</p><p>The structure by Ye et al. presents an average overall resolution of 4.5Å, which is almost 3Å better than the structure by Kornprobst et al. derived from <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic>. The structure by Ye et al. is &quot;more complete&quot;, as several additional densities can be observed compared to the structure reported by Kornprobst et al. Namely, the densities attributed to Utp22 and h44 are unresolved in the latter study. Also, the two models (Yet et al. and Kornprobst et al.) have &quot;different assignment&quot; for Utp6, Utp18, the N-domain of Utp10, Utp24 and Kre33 (&quot;The bulky density around the 5' apical major domain was assigned to two Kre33 molecules in the <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> 90S, but was tentatively assigned to Bfr2, Lcp5 and Efg1 in our study&quot;).</p><p>The interpretation of this so-far elusive complex remains to some extent arbitrary, similarly to the study by Kornprobst et al. Indeed, it's not clear how the authors can be sure of their assignment of the rRNA and some proteins and AFs. However, the assignment was made according the same standards compared to those of Kornprobst et al., and it's really difficult to judge of the accuracy of the assignment in both cases. Both studies present various important discrepancies, and the interpretation was mainly based on shape similarity to solved structures of ribosomal proteins and AFs, which can be accurate provided that the resolution of the map is sufficient. In the case of Ye et al., the resolution is higher than in the study by Kornprobst et al., which may suggest a more accurate assignment. However, some features were interpreted in both papers based on structural similarities to &quot;predicted models&quot;, which is risky and might be revealed later as inaccurate. The presence of cross-linking data validates some of these interpretations, however cross-linking can be inaccurate as observed in numerous cases for several reasons.</p><p>Other than the contrasted assignments, Ye et al. were able to interpret more in depth the different constitutive complexes of the 90S. Indeed, UTP-B is interpreted in more details, such as the CTD tetramer of UTP-B composed of Utp 21, 13, 1 and 12, a feature that was only referred to as &quot;UTP-B oligo&quot; in Kornprobst et al. Also Ye et al. have modeled the 5' ETS and the 5' domain of U3 snoRNA and assigned all UTP-A proteins, Sof1, Utp7, Utp11, Enp2, Enp1, Utp22, Rrp7, Rrp5, Krr1 and Pno1.</p><p>The interpretation of the U3 snoRNP is consistent between both papers.</p><p>Briefly, I would like to pledge in favor of the manuscript by Ye et al. for the good reason that the community accepted the assignment method reported by Kornprobst et al., and it would only be fair to accord the same credit to Ye et al., but one must keep in mind that some assignments might be inaccurate and have to be handled with caution. The reported assignment must be considered as a first basis of work that can later be revealed accurate or inaccurate, and these two papers must be considered together. In future studies, it will be necessary to perform more direct experiments to validate some of the uncertain assignments, such as immuno-cryo-EM.</p><p>I only have one major concern:</p><p>Ye et al. argue that some of the assignment differences relatively to Kornprobst et al. could be due to species-specificity although the 90S appears very well conserved. While politically correct, I find this statement a bit weak and invite Ye et al. to provide arguments and to discuss the chosen contrasted assignments compared to those by Kornprobst et al. Indeed it is capital that the reader understands their assignment and whether Ye et al. believes that their interpretation is more accurate and why! Otherwise the assignment appears only arbitrary and a matter of personal preference.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Molecular architecture of the 90S small subunit pre-ribosome&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been substantially improved but there are few remaining issues raised by reviewer #2 that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) (Relating to the following comment in the previous review) &quot;The manuscript makes very provocative claims, most importantly about the base pairing of U3. It is impossible to evaluate this claim without having access to the map.&quot; My inspection of the map indicates that it does not support the claim that U3 base pairs with H27. Rather, the map shows a duplex, which the authors have assigned as U3 and H27. However, there is no way of telling that H27 is part of this duplex, because there is no density connecting it to either H26 or H28, and indeed 20 nt are missing on either side. In addition, it is unclear that U3 is the other part of the duplex, because there is no EM density for parts of it. The authors must remove the claim that U3 base pairs to helix 27. Similarly, the map does not support the placement of Mpp10, as it is free floating, and the authors should make the speculative nature of their assignment of Mpp10 helices more clear. As in: &quot;Based on the known interactions with Imp3 and Imp4, we assign these to Mpp10, although they could come from other nearby proteins as well.&quot;</p><p>2) (Relating to the following comment in the previous review) &quot;The authors make a number of surprising assignments, including that of H44 at a very different location.&quot; In their response to this comment the authors indicate that H44 has been assigned based on its interaction with Pno1, which is assigned confidently. However, Pno1 has been shown to bind single stranded RNA, not double stranded RNA, and Lamanna and Karbstein have shown that D-site is single stranded not in a hairpin. Thus, there is no &quot;predicted&quot; duplex. Reviewer 3 had similar concerns. Moreover, looking at the map, I actually have no faith that this is a hairpin. There is density extending from the loop, which shouldn't be there, if it really were a hairpin. I strongly suggest the authors take out the assignment of the D-site hairpin. Minimally, the authors must present this logic in the paper, and add that the identified density might be a hairpin, and if so, could be the D-site hairpin, although previous data on later intermediates indicate that at that stage D-site is single stranded. In other words, this interpretation rests on assumptions, which are unproven, and probably untrue.</p><p>3) (Relating to the following comment in the previous review) &quot;What is the RNA in the molecule? The authors should show a Northern blot.&quot; Interestingly, even though the majority of the RNA is 22S, the model still has the 5'-ETS. Thus, either it remains bound through non-covalent interactions, or the EM preferentially shows a minor population. The authors must discuss this.</p><p>4) Discussion section: Osheim did not show that transcription of H44 brings by a compaction event; Osheim showed that there is compaction after transcription of nearly all of ITS1, and that cleavage requires transcription of 25S.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22086.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>There was general agreement among the reviewers that the paper is potentially suitable for publication but that additional source data must be supplied to the reviewers to allow an evaluation of certain key assignments of electron density, that extensive revisions of text and figures will be required, and that Northern analysis of the rRNAs present in each of the solved complexes is needed. It is necessary for the authors to make the density map available to the reviewers to allow first-hand evaluation of some of the most unexpected assignments, including a revised base-pairing scheme for U3, a dramatic reorganization of helix 44, and a stem-loop at the D cleavage site. It is also imperative that the pdb files for all of the novel crystal structures be deposited prior to publication and be made available to the referees for inspection during the review of the revised manuscript. The authors also need to document the cross-linking/MS data and indicate when it was used to guide an assignment, and whether each crosslink is consistent with the final structure. The authors must do a better job of citing the previous literature. The paper is a challenge to read and each of the reviewers has specific suggestions for how the presentation of data can be improved, both in text and figures. In addition it is important that the authors address in a more thorough and transparent way the discrepancies between their assignments and those of the recent structure published by Kornprobst et al., and their objective justifications for their assignments. In short, the readers/reviewers of this paper must be able to assess the quality of the interpretation and the model from the data provided by the manuscript, knowing that some of these assignments are provisional, and the authors must do their best to facilitate this assessment.

In addition, it is unclear that U3 is the other part of the duplex, because there is no EM density for parts of it. The authors must remove the claim that U3 base pairs to helix 27. Similarly, the map does not support the placement of Mpp10, as it is free floating, and the authors should make the speculative nature of their assignment of Mpp10 helices more clear. As in: &quot;Based on the known interactions with Imp3 and Imp4, we assign these to Mpp10, although they could come from other nearby proteins as well.&quot;</italic> </p><p>The Hd helix is an important feature of 90S structure and we respectfully disagree with this reviewer's suggestion to remove the assignment. In fact, our assignment of the Hd helix to U3 and H27 was supported by ample evidence and clear logic. 1) The Hc helix, which is adjacent to Hd, can be confidently assigned to nt 15-22 of U3 and nt 9-16 of 18S rRNA. 2) The U3 strand of Hc is connected to one strand of Hd by continuous densities, indicating that the Hd helix must contain nt 1-13 of U3. 3) The length of Hd matches exactly the length of nt 1-13 of U3. 4) The H27 sequence is complementary to nt 1-13 of U3 in an evolutionarily conserved manner and is the best candidate for the other stand of Hd. 5) The modeled H27 sequence is located at a middle position between H26 and H28. This arrangement allows H27 be linked to H26 and H28 by ~20 nt at either sides, although both the linkers are not modeled in the map. 6) All other unassigned duplexes in the 5' ETS, 18S rRNA and ITS1 are located too far away and not of the right size (13 bp) to be considered as Hd. Therefore, the assignment of Hd is scientific and solid.</p><p>Two α-helices of Mpp10 were assigned. One helix bound to Imp3 can be confidently assigned based on the crystal structure of the Imp3-Mpp10 complex (PDB 5WXM). As to the helix bound to Imp4, the related sentence has been revised to &quot;A short α-helix bound at the protein-binding pocket of Imp4 was tentatively assigned to Mpp10 based on the known interaction between Imp4 and Mpp10 (Lee and Baserga 1999; Wehner and Baserga 2002)&quot;</p><p><italic>2) (Relating to the following comment in the previous review) &quot;the authors make a number of surprising assignments, including that of H44 at a very different location.&quot; In their response to this comment the authors indicate that H44 has been assigned based on its interaction with Pno1, which is assigned confidently. However, Pno1 has been shown to bind single stranded RNA, not double stranded RNA, and Lamanna and Karbstein have shown that D-site is single stranded not in a hairpin. Thus, there is no &quot;predicted&quot; duplex. Reviewer 3 had similar concerns. Moreover, looking at the map, I actually have no faith that this is a hairpin. There is density extending from the loop, which shouldn't be there, if it really were a hairpin. I strongly suggest the authors take out the assignment of the D-site hairpin. Minimally, the authors must present this logic in the paper, and add that the identified density might be a hairpin, and if so, could be the D-site hairpin, although previous data on later intermediates indicate that at that stage D-site is single stranded. In other words, this interpretation rests on assumptions, which are unproven, and probably untrue.</italic> </p><p>We assume that this reviewer is talking about the D-site hairpin, not H44. Pno1 contains a degenerated KH domain at the N-terminus and a classic KH domain at the C-terminus. In our model, the degenerated KH domain contacts the duplex part of the D-site hairpin whereas the classic KH domain would bind the 5' single-stranded region adjacent to the hairpin. Therefore, the interaction between Pno1 and the D-site hairpin is still consistent with the known RNA-binding model of KH domain.</p><p>As to the D-site hairpin assignment, we have revised the related sentences: &quot;A density that is suggestive of a short RNA hairpin is sandwiched between Pno1 and the WD domain of Utp13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5N</xref>). Because the D site RNA potentially forms a short hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) and binds Pno1, the density was temporarily assigned to the D site RNA. Although the D site RNA was found by chemical probing to be single-stranded (Lamanna and Karbstein 2009), this result may mainly reflect the structure of pre-rRNA in the more abundant pre-40S ribosome.&quot;</p><p><italic>3) (Relating to the following comment in the previous review) &quot;What is the RNA in the molecule? The authors should show a Northern blot.&quot; Interestingly, even though the majority of the RNA is 22S, the model still has the 5'-ETS. Thus, either it remains bound through non-covalent interactions, or the EM preferentially shows a minor population. The authors must discuss this.</italic> </p><p>The cleaved 5'-A0 fragment of 5' ETS indeed still binds 90S, as the Northern blot shows that the 5'-A0 fragment has a comparable amount to the U3 snoRNA in the Noc4-TAP and ΔMtr4 particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, probe 5' -A0). This has been discussed in the revised manuscript Results section paragraph four.</p><p><italic>4) Discussion section: Osheim did not show that transcription of H44 brings by a compaction event; Osheim showed that there is compaction after transcription of nearly all of ITS1, and that cleavage requires transcription of 25S.</italic> </p><p>Analysis of the assembly of 3'-truncated pre-rRNA fragments shows that transcription of helix 44 triggers the assembly of a mature 90S, but this approach does not consider the kinetics in pre-ribosome assembly. The chromatin spread experiment by Osheim et al. provides a real-time image of pre-ribosome folding. The delayed appearance of 90S in the chromatin spread can be accounted for by the time taken to compact 90S.</p></body></sub-article></article>
