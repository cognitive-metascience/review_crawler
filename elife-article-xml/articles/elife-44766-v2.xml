It has been a challenge to characterize these fluctuations, under native like conditions. Here, the conformational dynamics of the full-length (23-231) mouse prion protein were studied under native conditions, using photoinduced electron transfer coupled to fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (PET-FCS). The slowest fluctuations could be associated with the folding of the unfolded state to an intermediate state, by the use of microsecond mixing experiments. The two faster fluctuations observed by PET-FCS, could be attributed to fluctuations within the native state ensemble. The addition of salt, which is known to initiate the aggregation of the protein, resulted in an enhancement in the time scale of fluctuations in the core of the protein. The results indicate the importance of native state dynamics in initiating the aggregation of proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mouse prion protein</kwd><kwd>Native state dynamics</kwd><kwd>PET-FCS</kwd><kwd>microsecond fluctuations</kwd><kwd>microsecond mixing</kwd><kwd>dry molten globule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001405</institution-id><institution>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goluguri</surname><given-names>Rama Reddy</given-names></name><name><surname>Sen</surname><given-names>Sreemantee</given-names></name><name><surname>Udgaonkar</surname><given-names>Jayant</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Udgaonkar</surname><given-names>Jayant</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Native state dynamics of mouse prion protein were measured, and these motions were shown to be having a role in initiation of aggregation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Structural fluctuations in proteins are not only critical for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henzler-Wildman and Kern, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2014</xref>) and folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wani and Udgaonkar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Malhotra and Udgaonkar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frauenfelder et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 1995</xref>), but also have a role to play in protein misfolding and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scheibel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiti and Dobson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Singh and Udgaonkar, 2015a</xref>). Thermal fluctuations can lead to the sampling of partially unfolded conformations, which may or may not be populated transiently on protein folding and unfolding pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matouschek and Fersht, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sridevi and Udgaonkar, 2002</xref>), and which may be aggregation-prone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamid Wani and Udgaonkar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moulick and Udgaonkar, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Booth et al., 1997</xref>). It is important to determine whether aggregation-competent conformations are indeed formed on the protein (un)folding pathway, to determine their structures, and to define the timescales of the structural fluctuations that lead to their transient accumulation. This is particularly true in the case of the prion protein, because 85% of prion diseases occur in a sporadic manner, presumably through stochastic fluctuations in the native state of the protein. In this context, it is important to note that the prion protein has a structure that is highly dynamic, as reflected in its unusually high native state heat capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moulick and Udgaonkar, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the case of the prion protein, misfolding and aggregation are linked to several fatal neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collinge, 2001</xref>). The cellular form of the prion protein, PrP<sup>C</sup>, is composed of an unstructured N-terminal region, and a structured C-terminal domain that is comprised of three α-helices (α1, α2, α3) and two short β-strands (β1, β2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Riek et al., 1996</xref>). Prion disease is caused by the infectious scrapie form, PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, which is multimeric, β-sheet rich, partially resistant to proteinase K digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caughey et al., 1991</xref>), and is capable of forming amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prusiner, 1998</xref>). Spontaneous conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, appears to occur in 85% of prion diseases, but the nature and time scales of prion protein dynamics that dictate this conformational conversion are not well understood.</p><p>It has been suggested that sub-domain separation of β-strands, β1 and β2, along with helix1 (α1) from the core helices, α2 and α3, initiates the aggregation of the prion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eghiaian et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The aggregation of pathogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Singh and Udgaonkar, 2015a</xref>) and stabilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Singh et al., 2014</xref>) variants of mouse prion protein (moPrP) has also been shown to proceed through a similar sub-domain separation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Singh and Udgaonkar, 2015b</xref>). It is not known to what extent such sub-domain separation happens during the stochastic excursions within the N state ensemble to misfolding-prone conformational states, under equilibrium native-like conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44766.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of moPrP.</title><p>Full length moPrP (23-231) is shown (PDB ID: 1AG2).

Native state HDX studies carried out under conditions that facilitate prion misfolding and aggregation, identified partially unfolded forms (PUFs) in equilibrium with the N state, which have been implicated in the aggregation of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moulick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moulick and Udgaonkar, 2017</xref>). The HDX studies did not, however, allow the temporal sequence of the structural transitions to be determined. Moreover, because the prion protein folds and unfolds within a millisecond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Honda et al., 2015</xref>), it was not possible to ascertain whether the PUFs observed in the native-state HDX studies are also populated on the folding/unfolding pathway of the protein. To fully understand the nature of native state fluctuations at equilibrium, it becomes necessary to also carry out kinetic studies of folding and unfolding in the microsecond time domain.</p><p>Studies of the folding and unfolding of several prion proteins have identified states intermediate in their structures to the structures of the native (N) and unfolded (U) states, whose accumulation has been linked to prion protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apetri and Surewicz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apetri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Honda et al., 2015</xref>). Little is, however, known about the structures of these (un)folding intermediates, and it is not known whether misfolding originates directly from the identified intermediates. This is important to demonstrate because under native-like conditions, proteins may sample not only bonafide (un)folding intermediates, but also partially unfolded forms that may not be <italic>en route</italic> to the globally unfolded state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sridevi and Udgaonkar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matouschek and Fersht, 1993</xref>). Ascertaining whether the aggregation prone intermediate forms on or off the folding pathways has a direct bearing on the development of strategies to combat aggregation because on-pathway intermediate forms could be expected to be longer-lived than transiently sampled native-like states.</p><p>The FCS methodology has been used extensively to study the nature of the fluctuations of the native state, and of the conformations transiently sampled under native equilibrium conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elson and Magde, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maiti et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haupts et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chattopadhyay et al., 2005</xref>). Fluorescence quenching of oxazine fluorophores by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) when combined with FCS, results in the dynamics of the protein appearing as fluorescence fluctuations. PET-FCS has been used extensively to measure the dynamics of proteins in the native (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doose et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ries et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neuweiler et al., 2009</xref>), unfolded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sherman and Haran, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daidone et al., 2010</xref>) and intermediate states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Neuweiler et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, PET-FCS measurements have been used together with kinetic measurements of the folding and unfolding of moPrP, to understand the dynamics of the mouse prion protein. PET probes were placed at two different locations to probe the dynamics between helices α1-α3 and α2-α3, in order to understand the role of sub-domain separation in initiating the aggregation of the prion protein.</p><p>Conformational dynamics across helices α1 and α3, and across helices α2 and α3, were monitored separately in two mutant variants of the protein designed for PET-FCS measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In each mutant variant, the dynamics leading to the quenching of an Atto 655 moiety introduced into the protein, by a suitably placed Trp residue, when the two come within contact quenching distance (&lt;1 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vaiana et al., 2003</xref>), was measured as fluctuations in the Atto 655 fluorescence. Autocorrelation functions (ACFs) for both the distances show three exponential processes, arising from sub-millisecond dynamics in the protein. The slow exponential process was found to represent the dynamics of folding from the U state to an intermediate state (I), by comparing the kinetics obtained from PET-FCS to the kinetics of folding of the Atto 655-labeled protein. The two faster exponential processes could be attributed to fluctuations in the native state. Overall, it is shown that the native state dynamics of moPrP result in global unfolding <italic>via</italic> an intermediate. The addition of salt which is known to initiate aggregation, resulted in an enhancement in the time scale of fluctuations in the core of the protein. The current study detects fluctuations in the native state that lead to the sampling of aggregation-competent conformations of the protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>moPrP constructs for PET-FCS experiments</title><p>In the current study, Trp and Cys residues were engineered at different positions in moPrP in such a way that they would come in contact due to relative motion of helices in the native state of the protein. In the case of W144/C199-Atto moPrP, W144 was used as the PET quencher of the Atto 655 moiety attached to the Cys residue at position 199, to report on the dynamics across helices α1 and α3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the case of W171/C225-Atto moPrP, W144 was mutated to a Phe residue, and a Trp residue was introduced at position 171. A Cys residue was incorporated at position 225, and this construct (W171/C225) is expected to report on the dynamics between helices α2 and α3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Labeling with Atto 655 did not result in any alteration in the secondary structure of the protein, as indicated by the far-UV circular dichroism measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PET-FCS can be used to measure the rate constants of conformational fluctuations</title><p>In the current study, PET-FCS was used to determine the kinetics of protein fluctuations that enable the formation of quenching-competent dye-Trp complexes in which quenching of the fluorescence of the oxazine dye by PET from the Trp side-chain, can occur. It is known that such quenching occurs primarily by a static quenching mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sauer and Neuweiler, 2014</xref>). After the formation of productive dye-Trp complexes, in which the dye and quencher are in van der Waals contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vaiana et al., 2003</xref>), PET from the Trp side-chain leads to the quenching of the dye fluorescence, resulting in essentially a non-fluorescent ground state complex. Since PET occurs within a few picoseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lakowicz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhong and Zewail, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doose et al., 2005</xref>), and because dissociation of the dye-Trp complex is much slower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sherman and Haran, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soranno et al., 2017</xref>), the observed rate constant of the overall quenching reaction reflects the rate constant for the formation of the dye-Trp complex.</p><p>It is known that PET occurs by a distance-dependent quenching mechanism, in which the electron transfer rate constant decreases exponentially with an increase in the distance separating the fluorophore from the Trp side-chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lakowicz, 1999</xref>). This would mean that if there were a distribution of fluorophore-Trp distances in the protein molecules comprising the native state ensemble, the observed transfer rate constant in PET would represent a rate constant averaged across all distances, as is the case for the rate constant of energy transfer observed in FRET measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schuler and Hofmann, 2013</xref>). However, in PET, the probability of electron transfer decreases asymptotically to near zero within less than a nanometer of separation; and the quenching distance, above which electron transfer cannot occur, is about 0.5 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vaiana et al., 2003</xref>), which corresponds to van der Waals contact between the dye and Trp side-chain. Since diffusive fluctuations over such small distances will occur on the nanosecond time scale, it is very unlikely that the ~1 μs and slower dynamics observed in the current study are the result of distance-dependent ensemble-averaging of the quenching process. It is because quenching occurs only when the dye and Trp side chain are in van der Waals contact in dye-Trp complexes, that it has been referred to as an on-off process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schuler and Hofmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sauer and Neuweiler, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In studies of the PET quenching of free dye by free tryptophan, it was observed that the observed quenching rate constant was 2 to 3 times slower than the bimolecular collision rate constant for a diffusion-controlled reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soranno et al., 2017</xref>). It appeared that only one in two or three collisions led to the formation of a productive complex in which the dye and Trp possessed the appropriate geometries of stacking of the indole ring of the Trp with the aromatic groups of the dye, which enabled PET to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haenni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doose et al., 2005</xref>). When the dye and Trp are attached to a protein chain, as in the current study, then the rate constant at which quenching will be observed will depend on the rate constant of the protein fluctuation/conformational change that allows the dye and Trp to associate to form a quenching-competent complex. In the current study, the observed kinetics of quenching, which reflects the kinetics of formation of a quenching-competent complex, have been used as a measure of the kinetics of conformational dynamics of the protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>moPrP shows three reaction kinetic phases in the sub-millisecond time scale</title><p>The ACFs of both W144/C199-Atto moPrP and W171/C225-Atto moPrP, showed three exponential components, in addition to the diffusion component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>).

These experiments were carried out at a final protein concentration of 2–20 nM; at these concentrations the protein is not expected to aggregate within the time scale of measurement. This was directly confirmed by experimentally determining the value of the diffusion coefficient, which was found to be 90 ± 10 µm<sup>2</sup>/s for the different variants. The hydrodynamic radius calculated from the diffusion coefficient obtained from the PET-FCS measurements was 2.8 nm, which matches well with the R<sub>H</sub> measured by dynamic light scattering experiments in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jain and Udgaonkar, 2008</xref>). Another advantage of using PET FCS for measuring the conformational dynamics of proteins, is that the dynamics can be directly monitored, as the actual PET process is very fast and happens on the picoseconds time scale.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Structural fluctuations within the native state ensemble give rise to the faster exponential components in the PET-FCS experiments</title><p>The Cys and Trp residues in the two PET constructs were engineered at positions that are expected to come in contact with each other due to motions in the N state of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Such a strategy has been used previously to study the native state dynamics of the ionotropic glutamate receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jensen et al., 2011</xref>), spider silk protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ries et al., 2014</xref>) and Hsp 90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schulze et al., 2016</xref>). The quenching of the Atto 655 dye fluorescence by PET from the Trp residue in the two PET constructs will result in a fraction of molecules existing in non-fluorescent states. Consequently, the fluorescence emission intensity of the Trp-containing PET construct will be lower than that of the corresponding Trp-less PET construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). With the assumption that the quenched states are completely non-fluorescent, the relative fluorescence intensity of the Trp-containing protein compared to Trp-less PET construct directly gives the fraction of molecules in the native state ensemble, in which the Atto 655 fluorescence is not quenched by PET from a Trp side-chain.</p><p>The observation of two conformational fluctuations in the 0.5–20 µs time domain in PET-FCS measurements of the native state suggested that conformational fluctuations of fluorescent N in the native state ensemble lead to the sampling of two non-fluorescent states, N* and N**(see below). Conformational fluctuations on this time scale have been observed in the native state ensembles of other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jensen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ries et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schulze et al., 2016</xref>).

The current study cannot distinguish between the possibilities, and the model with one fluorescent N state and the two non-fluorescent N* and N** states, has been chosen only because it seems to be the simpler alternative. It should be noted that the alternative possibility does not affect any of the conclusions drawn in the current study. In both cases the fluctuations arise from N sampling N* and N** in the native state ensemble.</p><p>In the case of the unfolded state, the Atto 655 fluorescence spectrum of the Trp-containing protein overlapped with that of the corresponding Trp-less protein, for both the PET constructs (insets of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>), which could be due either to the absence of PET quenching in the unfolded state, which is very unlikely, or to a decrease in the efficiency of the PET process at high concentration of denaturant, which is known to happen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sherman and Haran, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soranno et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the total amplitude of the exponential components seen in PET-FCS experiments carried out with W144/C199-Atto moPrP in 6 M urea, was more than 10-fold lower than the amplitude observed in the absence of urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, Atto 655 fluorescence-monitored equilibrium unfolding experiments showed a 4-fold and a 2-fold enhancement in fluorescence upon unfolding for W144/C199-Atto moPrP and W171/C225-Atto moPrP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The increase in fluorescence upon unfolding observed for both the PET constructs can be explained by the release of quenching of Atto 655 fluorescence, which occurs in the native state of the protein. The fluorescence of W171/C225-Atto moPrP in the unfolded baseline was found to be less than that of W144/C225-Atto moPrP, and also had a very strong dependence on denaturant concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This could be because of the presence of residual structure in the unfolded state of W171/C225-Atto moPrP, due to the presence of the disulphide bridge between α2 and α3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The U↔I transition gives rise to the slow exponential component in the PET-FCS experiments</title><p>There are three possible explanations for the slowest exponential component observed in the PET-FCS experiments. One explanation is that it represents slow dynamics in the unfolded state. While some studies have suggested that unfolded state dynamics can occur in the microsecond time domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Waldauer et al., 2010</xref>), other studies have reported unfolded dynamics in the nanosecond time domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Möglich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hagen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lapidus et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soranno et al., 2017</xref>). Another explanation is that it represents slow dynamics in the native ensemble, or perhaps even the sampling of a partially unfolded intermediate by N. This explanation cannot be fully ruled out. A third explanation is that the slowest component represents a fluctuation which drives the folding of the U state to an early folding intermediate.</p><p>To determine which of these alternative explanations is correct, the folding/unfolding dynamics of W144/C199-Atto moPrP were characterized using microsecond mixing experiments, which were carried out using a custom-built continuous-flow setup with a mixing dead time of 37 µs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goluguri and Udgaonkar, 2016</xref>).

The data fit well to a two-exponential equation, as seen by the random distribution of residuals as well as visual inspection of the fit through the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The simplest explanation for the observation of two kinetic phases is that folding occurs <italic>via</italic> an U↔ I ↔ N mechanism, in which I is a folding intermediate. The rate constant of the fast kinetic phase was found not to depend on the total flow rate during mixing and observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). The slow kinetic phase had a rate constant of ~500 s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), and accounted for about 33% of the total amplitude of the decrease in fluorescence seen for folding from U to N. It is straightforward to assign the fast kinetic phase to the U ↔ I step, and the slow kinetic phase to the I ↔ N step of the U↔ I ↔ N mechanism. It should be noted that the possibility that I is, instead, an off-pathway intermediate, cannot be ruled out, even though several previous kinetic studies of the folding of the mouse prion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Honda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moulick et al., 2019</xref>) and of other mammalian prion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apetri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2011</xref>) have implicated an on-pathway intermediate being formed on a time scale similar to that observed in this study. It should be noted that the observation that I like N is destabilized upon the addition of salt, suggests that the salt-perturbed native interaction is also present in I, which is also consistent with I being populated on the pathway from U to N.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> shows that the dependence on denaturant concentration of the rate constant of the fast phase observed in the microsecond mixing experiments, extrapolates into the dependence on denaturant concentration of the rate constant of the slower exponential process observed in the PET-FCS measurements. It should be noted that the PET quenching efficiency, which reflects the probability of forming the quenching-competent complex from the encounter complex, can be suppressed by denaturant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doose et al., 2005</xref>), but not at the low concentrations (&lt;0.75 M) used in the current PET-FCS study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soranno et al., 2017</xref>): the sum of the amplitudes of the exponential processes was found not to be affected by urea concentrations up to 0.75 M. It is also seen that the rate constant of the slow exponential process measured in 0.75 M urea by PET-FCS, matches the fast rate constant of folding in 0.75 M urea. It is important to note that the fast rate constants of folding in 1.25 to 2.5 M urea, where the quenching efficiency is suppressed, extrapolate to the rate constant of folding in 0.75 M urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), where the quenching efficiency is unaffected by urea. This observation indicates that any suppression of the PET quenching efficiency that occurs at the high urea concentrations, does not significantly affect the time courses of folding at those urea concentrations.</p><p>The observation that the rate constant of the fast phase of folding observed in the microsecond mixing experiments was identical with the rate constant of the slow exponential process seen in the PET-FCS experiments, indicated that the same transition was being monitored in both measurements. This transition must be the U ↔ I transition, because the time constant (2 ms) of the I ↔ N transition is too slow to be measured by PET-FCS, given that τ<sub>D</sub> has a measured value of ~300 µs. The structural segments spanning the two distances probed in the current study, showed similar timescales for the folding/unfolding dynamics when monitored by PET-FCS. It is important to note that the slowest exponential process seen in the PET-FCS experiments, represents a conformational fluctuation of the unfolded state at low concentrations of urea, which is not a random fluctuation, but which leads to the formation of a productive folding intermediate.</p><p>The amplitudes of the exponential quenching processes observed by PET-FCS correspond to the equilibrium constants between two conformations only when the fluorescence of one of the conformations is completely quenched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sauer and Neuweiler, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). In the case of the two faster exponential processes corresponding to fluctuations between N and N*, and between N and N**, this criterion appears to be approximately met (see above). It is not possible, at the present time, to be certain that the fluorescence of the Atto moiety is completely quenched by the Trp residue, in I. There is, however, no data to support the dye-Trp complex being different in I than in the N ensemble. If complete quenching does not occur in the dye-Trp complex, then the amplitude of the slowest exponential process observed by PET-FCS would not correspond to the true equilibrium constant for the pre-equilibrium established between U and I during the fast kinetic phase of folding. In the absence of knowledge about the extent of fluorescence quenching in I, it is also difficult to determine the extent to which I is populated at the end of the fast phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Folding scheme of moPrP</title><p>The results of the PET-FCS and microsecond mixing experiments can be explained by the reaction scheme shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

However, the mechanism of folding for a few proteins has been shown to be different, under native conditions, from what is expected from such refolding studies carried out in the presence of denaturant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sridevi and Udgaonkar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matouschek and Fersht, 1993</xref>). In some cases, denaturants have been shown to affect the cooperativity of the folding reaction and the ruggedness of the energy landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malhotra and Udgaonkar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malhotra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jethva and Udgaonkar, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moulick et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, in light of the fact that denaturants can potentially modulate the folding landscape of a protein, it was important to study the folding pathway of the prion protein under native conditions.</p><p>The PET-FCS methodology is an ideal probe for monitoring the folding/unfolding dynamics of proteins that fold in the microsecond time regime, under native conditions. It has been employed successfully to study the folding reactions of a few fast folders, including the Trp-cage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neuweiler et al., 2005</xref>), BBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neuweiler et al., 2009</xref>), Engrailed Homeodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Neuweiler et al., 2010</xref>) and spider silk protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ries et al., 2014</xref>). In these earlier studies, fluorescent and non-fluorescent (quenched) states could be identified as distinct states present on the folding pathway. In the current study, the slower exponential process observed by PET-FCS was identified by microsecond mixing folding experiments to arise from the U ↔ I folding transition, with U being the fluorescent state, and I being the non-fluorescent state. The observation that exponential extrapolation of the rate constants obtained from kinetic experiments of refolding at higher denaturant concentration, predicts the rate constant at zero denaturant (determined by PET-FCS) indicates that moPrP folds through same pathway in both the presence and absence of urea, although the possibility of the operation of multiple folding routes cannot be negated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The two faster PET-FCS fluctuations likely represent native state fluctuations</title><p>While the slow exponential process observed by PET-FCS could attributed to the U ↔ I step in the U↔ I ↔ N mechanism describing folding, the two faster exponential processes could arise from fluctuations in any of the three states, that is U, I or N. The U state of any protein is very dynamic. In the case of moPrP, the native state has been shown to be unusually dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moulick and Udgaonkar, 2014</xref>). Moreover, the native state has been shown to exist in equilibrium with two high free energy, partially unfolded forms (PUFs), although the time scale of the dynamics that results in the sampling of these PUFs is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moulick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moulick and Udgaonkar, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Several observations suggest that the most likely origin of the faster exponential component observed by PET-FCS is the dynamics within the native state ensemble. (1) There is reasonable quantitative agreement between the values obtained for the fraction of N molecules in non-fluorescent states (N*, N**), determined from the combined amplitude of the two faster exponential components measured by PET-FCS, and from the intensities of the fluorescence spectra of either Atto-labeled protein and its corresponding Trp-less analog (see Results). This validates the assumption that the two faster exponential components arise from native state fluctuations, between fluorescent N and non-fluorescent N* and N**. Moreover, the native state is less fluorescent than the U state for both Atto-labeled proteins, due to the quenching of Atto fluorescence by the nearby Trp-residue in N* and N** within the native state ensemble. Upon unfolding, the quenching is released, and the resulting increase in fluorescence correlated well with the amplitude of the two fast exponential components. (2) The absence of a burst phase change in fluorescence during refolding suggests that the fluorescence of U is similar at high and low denaturant concentrations, ruling out the possibility that a significant fraction of molecules in the U state at high denaturant concentration, exists in the quenched state, as would be the case if the two faster PET-FCS detected fluctuations occur in the U state. (3) When the PET-FCS experiment was carried out at pH 4, where moPrP is destabilized by ~1 kcal/mole, and hence, the U state would be populated more, the amplitude and time constants of the two faster exponential components (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) were not significantly different from the values observed at pH 7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These considerations suggest that the two faster exponential components do not represent the dynamics of the U state. In future, it would be important to validate this interpretation of the two faster exponential components, by measuring conformational fluctuations in the U state by FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schuler and Hofmann, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The possibility that the faster exponential component has contributions from fluctuations in the I state cannot, however, be ruled out at the present time.

The fluctuations between N and N* and between N and N** seen in the case of the W144/C199-Atto moPrP, occur on a similar time scale and lead to the separation of the α1-β1-β2 segment from the α2-α3 segment in N*and N**. It is therefore possible N*and N** could therefore be DMG like conformations which are populated within the native state ensemble. N* and N** form on the native side of the free energy barrier and are very dynamic, which might be due to loss of packing interactions in the core of the protein. While N* and N** appear to qualify to be dry molten globules, further validation by structural probes such as FRET is required to confirm whether they are indeed so. It will be important in the future to carry out molecular dynamics simulations to obtain atomistic details about the transitions between N and N* and N**.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sub-domain separation and aggregation of prion protein</title><p>Aggregation-prone sequences in proteins are normally found sequestered within their cores, resulting in deleterious inter-molecular interactions and consequent aggregation being avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Camilloni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Simone et al., 2011</xref>). Stochastic fluctuations within the native state ensemble can, however, result in the transient exposure of these aggregation-competent patches, and in the initiation of aggregation.

The results from the current study suggest that the addition of salt affects the conformational fluctuations occurring within the native state ensemble, which are then expected to result in the sampling of aggregation-competent states. Salt affects both the faster exponential components that appear to originate from fluctuations in the N state which result in the sampling of non-fluorescent N* and N** states.

This is likely because of the structural constraints imposed by the disulphide bond present in moPrP, which staples together the α2-α3 segment, and also by the packing interactions and salt bridges present in the core, which restrict the conformational dynamics in this region. On the other hand, the α1-β1-β2 sub-domain is attached to the core α2-α3 domain through a long flexible loop, which allows rapid structural fluctuations.</p><p>The addition of salt had a significant effect on the rate constants of both the N → N** and N** → N transitions measured for the α2-α3 segment, but had a negligible effect on the rate constants measured for the α1-α3 segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).

It seems that disruption of this salt bridge by the addition of salt increases flexibility in this region, leading to an increase in the rate constants for fluctuations in the α2-α3 segment. The absence of the salt bridge would also result in an enhancement of the rate constant of helix separation within the α2-α3 segment, which occurs during the N → N* and N → N** transitions, as there would be fewer ionic interactions to keep the helices together for a long time. Taken all together, the PET-FCS experiments indicate that the addition of salt results in an enhancement in the structural fluctuations in the core of the protein.</p><p>Earlier studies have indicated that the dynamics in the U state of prion protein play a role in initiating misfolding and oligomerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Srivastava and Lapidus, 2017</xref>).

Thus, the population of I relative to N will be more in the presence of salt. Since misfolding and aggregation are facilitated in the presence of salt, this result suggests that I might play a direct role in misfolding. It seems therefore that both the more unfolded I and the native-like N*, N** are important in the initiation of misfolding and aggregation. The barrier between N and N* as well between N and N** is, however, much smaller than the barrier between N and I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>); hence, N*, N** will be sampled much more frequently than I, <italic>via</italic> fluctuations within the native state ensemble. In future work, it will be important to delineate the relative roles of I, N* and N** in misfolding. It will also be important to determine whether N*and N** form from I on the folding pathway: they are sufficiently similar in structure that contact quenching of the Atto moiety by a Trp residue, occurs in two different structural segments of the protein.</p><p>Two earlier studies had suggested that the sampling of conformations that were aggregation-prone, might be driven by fluctuations in the unfolded state of the prion protein. Force spectroscopy studies of the Syrian hamster prion protein (SHaPrP), had suggested that the U state sampled three off-pathway compact intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu et al., 2012</xref>), and that the occupancy of some of these intermediates was more for a disease-linked mutant variant of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). It should, however, be noted that the protein used in that study was very different from that used in the current study. The current study was carried out with full length (23-231) moPrP, while the force spectroscopy study had been carried out on truncated SHaPrP (90-231). More importantly, unlike the protein used in the current study, the protein used for the force spectroscopy measurements had a disrupted disulphide bond, and it is known that disruption of the disulphide bond in the prion protein leads to its unfolding to a molten globule form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maiti and Surewicz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Honda, 2018</xref>). Fluctuations in SHaPrP (90-231), which could be important in aggregation, had also been identified using Trp-Cys contact quenching experiments carried out at pH 4.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Srivastava and Lapidus, 2017</xref>). In that study, the data appeared to suggest that the fluctuations might arise from the U state, but that could not have been the case because several other studies have shown that SHaPrP (90-231) is natively structured at acidic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bjorndahl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donne et al., 1997</xref>), including at pH 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khan et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, aggregation-linked fluctuations of SHaPrP (90-231) need not arise only from the U state. Instead, as suggested by the current study of the dynamics of moPrP, at least some of them are likely to arise from the native state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study of the native state dynamics of moPrP, across the α1-α3 and α2-α3 segments, monitored by the PET-FCS methodology, using carefully designed single-free cysteine and single-tryptophan-containing variants, reveals three distinct processes, well-separated in time. The faster processes (~0.5–20 μs time constants) represent dynamics within the native state ensemble leading to the formation of the non-fluorescent complexes N* and N**. The slow process (50–100 μs time constant) reports on the U ↔ I transition of folding. The rate constant of the N →N** transition, in the absence of salt, is an order of magnitude slower when measured by monitoring fluctuations across α2-α3, than for the fluctuations across α1-α3, possibly because the fluctuations across α2-α3 are slowed down by the disulphide bond, packing interactions and salt bridges in the core of the protein. The folding landscape and the fluctuations within the native state ensemble are modulated by salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The addition of salt results in an increase in the rate constants of both the N → N** and N** → N transitions, possibly because critical ionic interactions are lost. The enhancement of the time scale of native state fluctuations upon the addition of salt, suggest that these fluctuations play a role in the initiation of misfolding of the protein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 Star (DE3))</td><td><italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 DE3*</td><td>Thermo Fisher scientific</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent (plasmid pET 22b)</td><td>Plasmid expressing W144/C199 moPrP</td><td>Generated by Dr. Ishita Sengupta (Udgaonkar lab)</td><td/><td>The results of the publication are under communication</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent (plasmid pET 22b)</td><td>Plasmid expressing Trp-less control protein C199 moPrP</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>This construct was made by site directed mutagenesis</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent (plasmid pET 22b)</td><td>Plasmid expressing W171/C225 moPrP</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>This construct was made by site directed mutagenesis</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent (plasmid pET 22b)</td><td>Plasmid expressing Trp-less control protein C225 moPrP</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>This construct was made by site directed mutagenesis</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SigmaPlot</td><td>Systat Software Inc</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Symphotime-64</td><td>PicoQuant</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Buffers and reagents</title><p>All the chemicals used for the study were of the highest purity grade, and were obtained from Sigma.

The constructs used in the current study have all the Trp residues mutated to Phe residues, except for a single Trp residue in the CTD at position 144. All the single-cysteine and single-tryptophan containing proteins, as well as the tryptophan-less control proteins, used in the current study contain three cysteine residues, two of which form a disulphide bond in the native protein. These variants were purified using a modified purification protocol for moPrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sengupta and Udgaonkar, 2017</xref>). Briefly, the proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 DE3* cells and purified from inclusion bodies, using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jain and Udgaonkar, 2008</xref>). The protein was eluted from the Ni-NTA column in 20 mM Tris buffer at pH 8, containing 6 M GdnHCl and 1 mM reduced glutathione (GSH). This was followed by dialysis first against 3 M GdnHCl, and then against 1 M GdnHCl in the same buffer. 0.2 mM oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was added to the protein in 1 M GdnHCl. The final step was dialysis against 20 mM Tris at pH 8. The protein was further purified using cation exchange chromatography, using a CM-FF column (GE Healthcare). The eluate from the ion exchange column was treated with a 5-fold molar excess of Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride to remove the GSH adduct from the free cysteine residue, and then dialyzed against milli-Q water. The protein was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.</p><p>The free cysteine thiol in each variant was labeled with Atto 655 dye by mixing it with a two-fold molar excess of Atto 655 maleimide (ATTO-TEC, GmbH). The labeling reaction was carried out in 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7 at 25°C in the dark for 2 hr. The free dye was removed from the reaction mixture by using a HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare) or by cation exchange chromatography using HiTrap CM FF column (GE Healthcare), and the protein was buffer-exchanged into milli-Q water, flash frozen, and stored at −80 C. The labeling with Atto 655 resulted in a 650 Da increase in the mass of the protein, which was verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The concentration of the labeled protein was estimated by measuring the absorbance of the sample at 663 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 1,25,000 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Equilibrium unfolding experiments</title><p>Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding experiments for the Atto 655-labeled moPrP variants, where the fluorescence of the Atto 655-moeity was monitored, were carried out using a FluoroMax-3 (JobinYvon Horiba) spectrofluorometer. The samples were excited at 640 nm, and the fluorescence emission was collected from 645 to 730 nm using an emission bandwidth of 5 nm. The path length of the cuvette used was 1 cm, and the protein concentration used was 10–30 nM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>PET-FCS experiments</title><p>PET-FCS experiments were carried out using a time-resolved confocal microscope, the Micro Time 200 (MT-200) (PicoQuant, Berlin). The light from the 637 nm laser (at 30 µW power) pulsing at 40 MHz was focused on to the sample using a 60 x magnification, 1.2 numerical aperture (NA) objective (Olympus). The fluorescence was collected through the same objective in the epifluorescence mode using a dual band dichroic 480/645 (Chroma). A band pass filter at 690 ± 35 nm was used to eliminate the excitation light, and a 50 µm pinhole was placed in the light path to eliminate out-of-focus light. The fluorescence was split on to two single photon sensitive avalanche photodiodes (MPD-SPAD) using a 50/50 beam splitting cube. The fluorescence from the two SPADs was cross correlated to remove the after-pulsing artifact. Auto correlation functions (ACFs) were generated and fitted to an appropriate model using the Symphotime-64 or SigmaPlot software. The confocal volume was calibrated in each experiment by measuring the ACF of free Atto 655 dye. The concentration of the sample used was 2–20 nM, and the number of molecules in the confocal volume varied from 1 to 8. The cover slips used for the measurements were coated with poly ethylene glycol to suppress surface adsorption of the protein. The ACFs were acquired for 15 min to 1 hr for each sample. The errors reported were from at least two independent measurements. The addition of denaturant resulted in a slowing down of the exponential components, resulting in a partial overlap with the diffusion component. Hence, the experiments with denaturants were carried out using a 100 µm pinhole instead of the 50 µm pinhole. The diffusion time was two-fold longer with the 100 µm pinhole, facilitating reliable measurement of the slower exponential component.</p><p>In order to rule out a photo physical phenomenon, such as triplet state formation by the Atto moiety, contributing to the exponential components observed in the PET-FCS experiments, several control experiments were carried out. (a) The excitation power of the laser used was varied between 15 and 60 µW, to determine whether the time constants and amplitudes of the two exponential processes were independent of the laser power or not. (b) The experiments were repeated with the corresponding Trp-less proteins labeled with Atto 655 to determine whether the sub-millisecond exponential components were present or not. (c) The experiments were repeated after an additional buffer exchange step using a 10 kDa centrifugal filter unit (Amicon) which resulted in a further 1000-fold dilution of any free Atto 655 dye present in the sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Microsecond mixing experiments</title><p>Sub-millisecond folding experiments were carried out using a custom-built continuous-flow setup, which has been described in detail earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goluguri and Udgaonkar, 2016</xref>). The sub-millisecond folding experiments were carried out by monitoring the fluorescence of the Atto 655 moiety attached to the protein. The Atto moiety was excited using a Stradus 637 nm cw diode laser from Vortan laser technology. The fluorescence from the mixing chip was collected in the epifluorescence mode using a dual band dichroic 480/645 (Chroma). The fluorescence was collected at 680 nm using a band-pass filter with a band width of 10 nm (Asahi spectra). Microsecond mixing experiments were carried out at two different combined mixing flow rates. The combined flow rate of 7 mL/min resulted in mixing dead time of 37 µs and total observation time of 1.4 ms. The combined flow rate of 3.5 mL / min resulted in mixing dead time of 75 µs and total observation time of 3 ms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis: Fitting of the ACFs obtained from the PET-FCS measurements</title><p>The FCS autocorrelation functions obtained for all proteins were fit to an equation having a diffusion component, as well as three faster chemical reaction components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krichevsky and Bonnet, 2002</xref>).<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"> <mml:mi/> <mml:mi/> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Here G (t) is the auto correlation value, N is the number of molecules in the confocal volume, t is the lag time, ω is the aspect ratio of the confocal volume, which was calculated to be five for the current system, τ<sub>D</sub> is the diffusion time, K<sub>1</sub>, K<sub>2</sub> and K<sub>3</sub> are the amplitudes of the three exponential processes.

Specifically, the assignment of conformational states N, N* and N**, the identification of a dry molten globule, and the formation of an on-pathway intermediate appear to be not fully supported by the data presented. Additional concerns involve the nature of the PET fluorescence-quenched state and additional controls that may rule out potential experimental artefacts.

Prion proteins are linked to neurodegenerative diseases and it has been suggested that domain separation within the native protein causes fatal aggregation. Goluguri et al., use photoinduced electron transfer in combination with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (PET-FCS) to site-specifically probe native-state dynamics of the moPrP from two different sites. They engineer pairs of extrinsic fluorophore and tryptophan (Trp) as PET reporters to probe motions of helices α1/α3 and α2/α3. The authors find sub-millisecond decays in the autocorrelation functions, which they assign to PET fluorescence fluctuations, and which fit to a sum of three exponentials. The slowest ~100-µs kinetic phase is assigned to folding/unfolding transition through comparison with continuous-flow fluorescence kinetic transients. The faster bi-exponential kinetic phase, which is on the 1-20 µs scale, is assigned to native-state fluctuations, which are suggested to reflect transitions to aggregation-prone conformations. These kinetics are modulated by salt, which is known to induce aggregation of the prion protein.</p><p>The molecular origins of neurodegenerative disease are a current and important research topic in our aging society. The pathways along which prion proteins misfold and convert to pathological aggregates are not yet explored. Little is known about heterogeneity of the native state of the moPrP, where transiently populated conformations are suggested to be responsible for aggregation. Here, Golguri et al., provide important new insights by measuring sub-millisecond conformational dynamics of the native state of moPrP, which have not been seen before. The PET-FCS data they present exhibit decays of substantial amplitude that originate from conformational motions signalled by engineered PET fluorescence reporters. The dynamics show that native-state heterogeneity is indeed present in the moPrP and involves thermally activated helix motions with populated states that interconvert rapidly.</p><p>I have some concerns that should be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) The authors state in the Introduction that &quot;addition of salt leads to an enhancement of fluctuations in the core of the protein&quot;; and in the Conclusion &quot;the increase in the amplitude of the native state fluctuations upon addition of salt suggests that they play a role in the initiation of aggregation&quot;. But, the amplitudes K1 and K2 measured with and without salt are within error (Table 1). There appears to be hardly an increase of amplitudes with salt, except for amplitude K1 of W171/C225, which increases significantly. The authors should modify their statement and discussion. What is the rational for inferring that conformational fluctuations of moPrP play a role in aggregation from changes in the fluctuation amplitude measured at low and high salt?</p><p>2) The authors state (subsection “Structural fluctuations within the native state ensemble give rise to the faster exponential components in the PET-FCS experiments”) that the two fast fluctuations originate from transitions between a fluorescent conformation N and two non-fluorescent conformations N* and N**. But it could also be the other way around. The relaxations might reflect transitions between a non-fluorescent N and two fluorescent N* and N**.</p><p>3) How are amplitudes K1 and K2 calculated from steady-state fluorescence spectra? Details are missing. Further: the differences in fluorescence intensity in the spectra should contain K1, K2 and K3. K3 is also an equilibrium transition between a fluorescent and fluorescence-quenched state that contributes to the spectra (albeit originating from folding).</p><p>4) On the discussion of the origin of the slow exponential phase in PET-FCS (subsection “The U↔I transition gives rise to the slow exponential component in the PET-FCS experiments”): It may be excluded that these slow fluctuations originate from transitions within the unfolded state because it is hardly populated under the experimental conditions. The authors show evidence that it reflects a U-to-I transition from comparison with continuous-flow data. A fluctuation in N, however, cannot be fully ruled out.</p><p>5) The authors subsection &quot;Fluctuations lead to population of a dry molten globule within the native state ensemble&quot;. It is problematic to infer structure from kinetics, in general. The observed µs conformational fluctuations do not provide much information on the structure of fluctuating globule.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Goluguri et al., investigated the timescale of conformational fluctuations of the mouse prion protein. Since aggregation-related pathologies arise from non-native conformations of the protein, understanding the type, amounts, and timescales at which such non-native states form is of utmost importance for understanding the early stages of the prion disease. The authors used tryptophan quenching (PET) of a well-known reporter dye (Atto 655) in FCS experiments to monitor native state fluctuations. Three processes with relaxation times from 0.5 to 300us were found consistently in two protein variants that map interactions between helices 1 – 3, and 2 – 3, respectively. The experiments were complemented with continuous flow kinetics to identify the global folding/unfolding mechanism and the associated rates. The authors interpret their results in terms of two near-native conformations (N* and N**) that are in equilibrium with the native state (N) and an intermediate (I). Based on plausibility, the authors suggest that (I) forms quickly from the unfolded state, a process that agrees well with the slowest relaxation time (300 us) in the PET-quenching FCS data. The native ensemble (N, N*, N**) is then formed in a slower process (1 ms) from (I). In my opinion, the interpretation sounds plausible and the authors provide good controls to confirm the determined amplitudes in their FCS experiments. However, I think that more evidence is required to proof the suggested mechanism. In the following, I detail a few comments that the authors may want to address before publication is considered:</p><p>1) Assigning K3 and τ3 (in FCS) and the fast folding phase to the formation of an on-pathway intermediate is certainly plausible, but not the only explanation of the data. The alternative is the formation of an off-pathway intermediate (I). Can the authors provide further evidence that (I) is indeed on-pathway? The question is particularly relevant because a previous optical tweezer study (Yu et al., (2012)) suggests that PrP forms off-pathway intermediates.</p><p>2) The authors stress their assumption that Atto655 is non-fluorescent in the quenched state several times. What is the experimental evidence either from their work or from others that confirms this assumption?</p><p>3) One statement confused me. In subsection “Structural fluctuations within the native state ensemble give rise to the faster exponential components in the PET-FCS experiment”, the authors state that values for K1+K2 when calculated from FCS and from fluorescence spectra are similar. The similarity is found for both protein variants (1.8 vs. 2 for W144/C199) and (0.5 vs. 0.7 for W171/C225) as shown in Table 2. Then the authors conclude that the two decay-components 1 and 2 arise from fluctuations across helices α1-α3 and α2-α3. Do the authors want to imply that both distances (α1-α3 and α2-α3) are mapped with each of the variants? If yes, how can this conclusion be drawn from Table 2 that only shows agreement between two methods (FCS and Spectra), but not between variants?</p><p>4) Contrary to assumption that the Atto655 fluorescence is always fully quenched in complex with Trp, the authors speculate that the fluorescence is not fully quenched in the I-state (subsection “The U↔I transition gives rise to the slow exponential component in the PET-FCS experiments”). Why? The fact that (I) is only partially structured does not imply that the Atto-Trp complex is different. According to their full-quench hypothesis, only the encounter rate would be affected but not necessarily the fluorescence properties of the complex. This is a problem of consistency (logic) rather than an experimental problem.</p><p>5) The authors used 0.05% Tween 20 in their experiments while the critical micelle concentration is 0.007%. Thus, micelle formation may affect the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the protein. Are the results confirmed at lower Tween 20 concentrations? Other groups typically only use 0.001% Tween 20 in the past ten years.</p><p>6) The authors introduce one additional Cys residue in a protein with a disulphide bond. The refolding from IB's therefore requires disulfide shuffling, thus explaining the use of GSH/GSSG. However, have the authors confirmed that the resulting preparations are devoid of mis-folded impurities? Already 5% may cause significant amplitudes in the PET-FCS experiments. Control CD-spectra of the wildtype protein should be compared to those of the labelled and unlabelled spectra obtained for the variants (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>7) The unfolding transition of W171/C225 does not look very cooperative (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B). To understand the fit and the data better, it would help to indicate the native and unfolded state baseline in these experiments.</p><p>8) I would have wished to see a discussion of the results in light of the previous experiments form the Woodside group that seem to conflict with an on-pathway intermediate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In the submitted article, Goluguri et al., studied folding and unfolding of the full-length mouse Prion protein. Although the topic has been in the scope of the scientific community for a longer time and there exists a large amount of the literature data, the approach introduced by the authors brings a certain level of novelty to the field. Specifically, the here-in used methods combining PET quenching with FCS is capable to monitor the conformational fluctuations of the particular protein regions in real time. By means of this method, the authors identified the time-scales of the folding dynamics of PrP spanning the microsecond to submillisecond time-scale, which brings novel information on the PrP behavior. Another strong part of the work is a careful design of the experimental system. The mutations inserted into the wild-type proteins were well thought over, they address the interesting protein regions and fulfill all the pre-requisites for the successful implementation of PET-FCS experiments. Moreover, conformations of the two PrP variants do not seem to be affected by the mutations. The interpretation and evaluation of the PET-FCS experiments (including the salt data), providing the insight into the microsecond protein dynamics, are carried out in a satisfactory manner.</p><p>In contrast, the stop-flow experiments appear to be more questionable. As correctly stated by the authors urea disrupts the quenching of the Atto655 by Trp. This does not hold true only in the case of PET-FCS, but also for the PET-stop flow experiments. Therefore, the folding and unfolding rates deduced from the stop flow experiments are likely to be the combination of the folding/unfolding dynamics and destabilization of the dye-Trp complex by urea. Moreover, the applied model comprising I &lt;-&gt; U transition does not seem to be valid for mutant W171/C225-Atto moPrP, which show rather complex behavior (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B).</p><p>Another weak point of the manuscript seems to be the over-interpretation of the collected data. For instance, there is no evidence given that N-state represent the fluorescent form, while N* and N** are non-fluorescent ones. The character of the N* and N** states as the dry molten globule needs further justification. The fact that PET-FCS rate constants overlap with the fast constants of the stop-flow measurements do not automatically imply that the same conformational motions are followed by these different approaches. Without additional methods (for instance molecular dynamics simulations), it is speculative to draw the conclusions on the atomistic level as in section &quot;The two faster PET-FCS fluctuations likely represent native state fluctuations&quot;.</p><p>In conclusion, the article brings novel findings on the fast microsecond dynamics of the mouse PrP protein, which might be of interest.

But, the amplitudes K1 and K2 measured with and without salt are within error (Table 1). There appears to be hardly an increase of amplitudes with salt, except for amplitude K1 of W171/C225, which increases significantly. The authors should modify their statement and discussion. What is the rational for inferring that conformational fluctuations of moPrP play a role in aggregation from changes in the fluctuation amplitude measured at low and high salt?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct: the amplitudes of the fast fluctuations are hardly affected by salt. The time scale of fluctuations, is however, affected. We have now modified the sentences in the Introduction and Conclusion section, to clarify that the time scale of fluctuations in the core of the protein is enhanced in the presence of salt. The rationale for inferring that conformational fluctuations in the N state of moPrP play a role in initiation of misfolding is the observation that the time scale of fluctuations became faster upon addition of salt, which is also evident from Figure 6. We no longer infer this from the amplitudes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors state (subsection “Structural fluctuations within the native state ensemble give rise to the faster exponential components in the PET-FCS experiments”) that the two fast fluctuations originate from transitions between a fluorescent conformation N and two non-fluorescent conformations N* and N**. But it could also be the other way around. The relaxations might reflect transitions between a non-fluorescent N and two fluorescent N* and N**.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the two fast fluctuations of the N state could also arise from sampling of two fluorescent N states by a non-fluorescent N state. We have included this possibility in the revised manuscript. It should, however, be noted that this alternative possibility will not affect any of our results and the conclusion drawn from them. in subsection “Structural fluctuations within the native state ensemble give rise to the faster exponential components in the PET-FCS experiments” we now state “It is also possible that, instead, N is non-fluorescent and that N* and N** are fluorescent. The current study cannot distinguish between these possibilities, and the model with one fluorescent N state and the two non-fluorescent N* and N** states, has been chosen only because it seems to be the simpler alternative. It should be noted that the alternative possibility does not affect any of the conclusions drawn in the current study. In both cases the fluctuations arise from N sampling N* and N** in the native state ensemble.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How are amplitudes K1 and K2 calculated from steady-state fluorescence spectra? Details are missing. Further: the differences in fluorescence intensity in the spectra should contain K1, K2 and K3. K3 is also an equilibrium transition between a fluorescent and fluorescence-quenched state that contributes to the spectra (albeit originating from folding).</p></disp-quote><p>The procedure is described in the footnote of Table 2. K3 is not included because U and I are hardly populated under the native conditions in which the spectra shown in Figure 2 were acquired. We realize that an error in the legend to Figure 2 (now corrected) may have confused the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) On the discussion of the origin of the slow exponential phase in PET-FCS (subsection “The U↔I transition gives rise to the slow exponential component in the PET-FCS experiments”): It may be excluded that these slow fluctuations originate from transitions within the unfolded state because it is hardly populated under the experimental conditions. The authors show evidence that it reflects a U-to-I transition from comparison with continuous-flow data. A fluctuation in N, however, cannot be fully ruled out.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. In subsection “The U↔I transition gives rise to the slow exponential component in the PET-FCS experiments”, we now state: “Another explanation is that it represents slow dynamics in the native ensemble, or perhaps even the sampling of a partially unfolded intermediate by N. This explanation cannot be fully ruled out.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors subsection &quot;Fluctuations lead to population of a dry molten globule within the native state ensemble&quot;. It is problematic to infer structure from kinetics, in general. The observed µs conformational fluctuations do not provide much information on the structure of fluctuating globule.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and in fact, state in subsection “N* and N** may be dry molten globules within the native state ensemble” that “while N* and N** appear to qualify to be dry molten globules, further validation by structural probes such as FRET is required to confirm whether they are indeed so.” We realize, however, that our section heading, quoted by the reviewer was misleading and we have changed it suitably. We have decreased the emphasis on N* and N** being dry molten globule-like and we have removed this claim from the abstract and conclusions of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) Assigning K3 and τ3 (in FCS) and the fast folding phase to the formation of an on-pathway intermediate is certainly plausible, but not the only explanation of the data. The alternative is the formation of an off-pathway intermediate (I). Can the authors provide further evidence that (I) is indeed on-pathway? The question is particularly relevant because a previous optical tweezer study (Yu et al., (2012)) suggests that PrP forms off-pathway intermediates.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, and in subsection “The U↔I transition gives rise to the slow exponential component in the PET-FCS experiments” we now state: “It should be noted that the possibility that I is, instead, an off-pathway intermediate cannot be ruled out, even though several previous kinetic studies of the folding of the mouse prion protein (R. P. Honda et al., 2015; Moulick, Goluguri and Udgaonkar, 2019) and of other mammalian prion proteins (Apetri et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2011) have implicated an on-pathway intermediate being formed on a time scale similar to that observed in this study. It should be noted that the observation that I like N is destabilized upon the addition of salt, suggests that the salt-perturbed native interaction is also present in I, which is also consistent with I being populated on the pathway from U to N.”</p><p>We have now included a paragraph comparing the results of the current study to the results of the previous optical tweezer study (Yu et al., 2012) and Trp-Cys quenching study (Srivastava and Lapidus, 2017): In the subsection “Role of intermediates in initiating prion protein aggregation”, we now state: “Two earlier studies had suggested that the sampling of conformations that were aggregation-prone, might be driven by fluctuations in the unfolded state of the prion protein. […] Hence, aggregation-linked fluctuations of SHaPrP (90-231) need not arise only from the U state. Instead, as suggested by the current study of the dynamics of moPrP, at least some of them are likely to arise from the native state.”</p><p>Hence, the results of the current PET-FCS study are not in contradiction of the results of the previous studies on prion protein that probed the dynamics of the unfolded state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors stress their assumption that Atto655 is non-fluorescent in the quenched state several times. What is the experimental evidence either from their work or from others that confirms this assumption?</p></disp-quote><p>In a previous study of the quenching of organic dyes MR121 and Atto 655 by tryptophan it was shown that the dye forms a non-fluorescent complex with tryptophan by comparing the equilibrium constant obtained from FCS experiments with the equilibrium constants obtained from steady state fluorescence spectra (Doose et al., 2005). In the subsection “The two faster PET 428 -FCS fluctuations likely represent native state fluctuations”, we explain how our results are results are consistent with the dye being fully quenched in N* and N**. We state: “There is reasonable quantitative agreement between the values obtained for the fraction of N molecules in non-fluorescent states (N*, N**), determined from the combined amplitude of the two faster exponential components measured by PET-FCS, and from the intensities of the fluorescence spectra of either Atto-labeled protein and its corresponding Trp-less analog (see Results section). This validates the assumption that the two faster exponential components arise from native state fluctuations, between fluorescent N and non-fluorescent N* and N.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One statement confused me. In subsection “Structural fluctuations within the native state ensemble give rise to the faster exponential components in the PET-FCS experiment”, the authors state that values for K1+K2 when calculated from FCS and from fluorescence spectra are similar. The similarity is found for both protein variants (1.8 vs. 2 for W144/C199) and (0.5 vs. 0.7 for W171/C225) as shown in Table 2. Then the authors conclude that the two decay-components 1 and 2 arise from fluctuations across helices α1-α3 and α2-α3. Do the authors want to imply that both distances (α1-α3 and α2-α3) are mapped with each of the variants? If yes, how can this conclusion be drawn from Table 2 that only shows agreement between two methods (FCS and Spectra), but not between variants?</p></disp-quote><p>We realize that our construction of the sentence was misleading. We did not want to imply that both distances are mapped with each of the variants. Our conclusion, as we now state in subsection “Structural fluctuations within the native state ensemble give rise to the faster exponential components in the PET-FCS experiments” is only: This similarity suggested that the two faster exponential components in the ACFs arise from structural fluctuations within the native state ensemble of moPrP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Contrary to assumption that the Atto655 fluorescence is always fully quenched in complex with Trp, the authors speculate that the fluorescence is not fully quenched in the I-state (subsection “The U↔I transition gives rise to the slow exponential component in the PET-FCS experiments”). Why? The fact that (I) is only partially structured does not imply that the Atto-Trp complex is different. According to their full-quench hypothesis, only the encounter rate would be affected but not necessarily the fluorescence properties of the complex. This is a problem of consistency (logic) rather than an experimental problem.</p></disp-quote><p>We realize that it was not right to imply that the Atto-dye complex in I is different from that in the N ensemble. Comparison of data from PET FCS and ensemble fluorescence measurements indicated that the fluorescence of Atto moiety is completely quenched in N state of moPrP (see response to query#2). We do not have such an experimental evidence for the extent of quenching happening in I state. We now state in subsection “The U↔I transition gives rise to the slow exponential component in the PET-FCS experiments”: “It is not possible, at the present time, to be certain that the fluorescence of the Atto moiety is completely quenched by the Trp residue, in I. There is, however, no data to support the dye-Trp complex being different in I than in the N ensemble. If complete quenching does not occur in the dye-Trp complex, then the amplitude of the slowest exponential process observed by PET-FCS would not correspond to the true equilibrium constant for the pre-equilibrium established between U and I during the fast kinetic phase of folding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors used 0.05% Tween 20 in their experiments while the critical micelle concentration is 0.007%. Thus, micelle formation may affect the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the protein. Are the results confirmed at lower Tween 20 concentrations? Other groups typically only use 0.001% Tween 20 in the past ten years.</p></disp-quote><p>As we now state in subsection “Protein purification and Atto 655 labeling”, we have used the same Tween 20 concentration as used in other studies of protein dynamics that utilized PET-FCS (Daidone et al., 2010; Doose et al., 2005; Jensen et al., 2011; Neuweiler et al., 2010; Neuweiler et al., 2005; Neuweiler et al., 2009; Ries et al., 2014; Schulze et al., 2016). While this concentration is above the CMC, our results indicate that the protein does not interact with micelles: the hydrodynamic radius determined for the protein is the same as measured previously by DLS in the absence of any Tween 20 (see subsection “moPrP shows three reaction kinetic phases in the sub-millisecond time scale”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors introduce one additional Cys residue in a protein with a disulphide bond. The refolding from IB's therefore requires disulfide shuffling, thus explaining the use of GSH/GSSG. However, have the authors confirmed that the resulting preparations are devoid of mis-folded impurities? Already 5% may cause significant amplitudes in the PET-FCS experiments. Control CD-spectra of the wildtype protein should be compared to those of the labelled and unlabelled spectra obtained for the variants (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the CD spectrum of the wildtype protein is Figure 1—figure supplement 1. The spectrum of the wild type protein looks very similar to those of the mutant variants used in the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The unfolding transition of W171/C225 does not look very cooperative (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B). To understand the fit and the data better, it would help to indicate the native and unfolded state baseline in these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 3 has been modified to indicate the native and unfolded state baselines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. I would have wished to see a discussion of the results in light of the previous experiments form the Woodside group that seem to conflict with an on-pathway intermediate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a paragraph in subsection “Role of intermediates in initiating prion protein aggregation” which states: “Two earlier studies had suggested that the sampling of conformations that were aggregation-prone, might be driven by fluctuations in the unfolded state of the prion protein. […] Hence, aggregation-linked fluctuations of SHaPrP (90-231) need not arise only from the U state. Instead, as suggested by the current study of the dynamics of moPrP, at least some of them are likely to arise from the native state.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In the submitted article, Goluguri et al., studied folding and unfolding of the full-length mouse Prion protein. Although the topic has been in the scope of the scientific community for a longer time and there exists a large amount of the literature data, the approach introduced by the authors brings a certain level of novelty to the field. Specifically, the here-in used methods combining PET quenching with FCS is capable to monitor the conformational fluctuations of the particular protein regions in real time. By means of this method, the authors identified the time-scales of the folding dynamics of PrP spanning the microsecond to submillisecond time-scale, which brings novel information on the PrP behavior. Another strong part of the work is a careful design of the experimental system. The mutations inserted into the wild-type proteins were well thought over, they address the interesting protein regions and fulfill all the pre-requisites for the successful implementation of PET-FCS experiments. Moreover, conformations of the two PrP variants do not seem to be affected by the mutations. The interpretation and evaluation of the PET-FCS experiments (including the salt data), providing the insight into the microsecond protein dynamics, are carried out in a satisfactory manner.</p><p>In contrast, the stop-flow experiments appear to be more questionable. As correctly stated by the authors urea disrupts the quenching of the Atto655 by Trp. This does not hold true only in the case of PET-FCS, but also for the PET-stop flow experiments. Therefore, the folding and unfolding rates deduced from the stop flow experiments are likely to be the combination of the folding/unfolding dynamics and destabilization of the dye-Trp complex by urea. Moreover, the applied model comprising I &lt;-&gt; U transition does not seem to be valid for mutant W171/C225-Atto moPrP, which show rather complex behavior (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer suggests that the measured rate constant for the formation of I may not be the true rate constant of folding, because urea will interfere with dye-Trp complex formation which occurs as a consequence of folding. This is certainly possible, but there is data suggesting that this not happen. As we now state in subsection “The U↔I transition gives rise to the slow exponential component in the PET-FCS experiments”; “It is also seen that the rate constant of the slow exponential process measured in 0.75 M urea by PET FCS, matches the fast rate constant of folding in 0.75 M urea. It is important to note that the fast rate constants of folding in 1.25 to 2.5 M urea, where the quenching efficiency is suppressed, extrapolate to the rate constant of folding in 0.75 M urea (Figure 3D), where the quenching efficiency is unaffected by urea. This observation indicates that any suppression of the PET quenching efficiency that occurs at the high urea concentrations does not significantly affect the time courses of folding at those urea concentrations.”</p><p>It is true that W171/C225 Atto moPrP exhibits an unusual urea-induced equilibrium unfolding curve. Nevertheless, given that the time constant and amplitude of the slowest exponential component observed in the ACF of this protein are similar to those observed for W144/C199 Atto moPrP, it is expected that the slow exponential ACF component seen for W171/C225 Atto moPrP also represents the folding of U to I. In future studies, it will be important to test whether this is true. Such studies are also expected to provide an understanding of the complex urea-induced equilibrium unfolding curve of W171/C225 Atto moPrP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another weak point of the manuscript seems to be the over-interpretation of the collected data. For instance, there is no evidence given that N-state represent the fluorescent form, while N* and N** are non-fluorescent ones. The character of the N* and N** states as the dry molten globule needs further justification. The fact that PET-FCS rate constants overlap with the fast constants of the stop-flow measurements do not automatically imply that the same conformational motions are followed by these different approaches. Without additional methods (for instance molecular dynamics simulations), it is speculative to draw the conclusions on the atomistic level as in section &quot;The two faster PET-FCS fluctuations likely represent native state fluctuations&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We now address these concerns.</p><p>In subsection “Structural fluctuations within the native state ensemble give rise to the faster exponential components in the PET-FCS experiments”, we now state: “It is also possible that N is non-fluorescent and that N* and N** are fluorescent.

In both cases the fluctuations arise from N sampling N* and N** in the native state ensemble.”</p><p>We realize that in the absence of definitive evidence, it was wrong to so strongly posit that N* and N** are dry molten globules. We have toned down the text, and state in subsection “N* and N** may be dry molten globules within the native state ensemble” that “while N* and N** appear to qualify to be dry molten globules, further validation by structural probes such as FRET is required to confirm whether they are indeed so.” We also realize that our section heading, quoted by the reviewer was misleading, and we have changed it suitably.
