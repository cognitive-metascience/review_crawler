However, it remains unknown whether and how stem cell centrosomes are uniquely regulated and how this regulation may contribute to stem cell fate. Here we identify Klp10A, a microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin of the kinesin-13 family, as the first protein enriched in the stem cell centrosome in <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline stem cells (GSCs). Depletion of <italic>klp10A</italic> results in abnormal elongation of the mother centrosomes in GSCs, suggesting the existence of a stem cell-specific centrosome regulation program. Concomitant with mother centrosome elongation, GSCs form asymmetric spindle, wherein the elongated mother centrosome organizes considerably larger half spindle than the other. This leads to asymmetric cell size, yielding a smaller differentiating daughter cell. We propose that <italic>klp10A</italic> functions to counteract undesirable asymmetries that may result as a by-product of achieving asymmetries essential for successful stem cell divisions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20977.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20977.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>asymmetric cell division</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Yukiko M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM118308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Yukiko M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin, Klp10A, prevents overgrowth of the mother centrosome to prevent undesirable asymmetries during asymmetric divisions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Asymmetric cell division (ACD) is a key process that balances stem cell self-renewal and differentiation by producing one stem cell and one differentiating cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inaba and Yamashita, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Morrison and Kimble, 2006</xref>). ACD is also critical for generating diverse cell types during embryonic development. During ACD, many cellular components have been reported to segregate asymmetrically, including fate determinants, certain organelles, sister chromatids/histones and damaged proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tajbakhsh and Gonzalez, 2009</xref>). Although cellular asymmetries are critical aspects of ACD, the essence of successful cell division is the precise replication and segregation of cellular contents, such as chromosomes and essential organelles. It has been underexplored how cells may achieve productive ACD without interfering with the basic requirement of cell divisions.</p><p>The stereotypical inheritance of mother and daughter centrosomes during ACD has been observed in several stem cell systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Conduit and Raff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Habib et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Januschke et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rebollo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rusan and Peifer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). As the major microtubule-organizing centers in the cell, the centrosomes have the ability to influence the segregation of many cellular components during cell division: most critically, the centrosomes play a fundamental role as spindle poles during mitosis to achieve faithful, equal segregation of sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meraldi, 2016</xref>). On the other hand, it is reported that aggresomes (damaged protein aggregates) are segregated asymmetrically to only one cells during cell division, by being associated with a centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rujano et al., 2006</xref>). It is also reported that proteins destined for degradation are targeted to the centrosomes and segregated asymmetrically during human embryonic stem cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fuentealba et al., 2008</xref>). We have shown that biased segregation of sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yadlapalli and Yamashita, 2013</xref>) and asymmetric inheritance of the midbody ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salzmann et al., 2014</xref>) depend on the centrosomes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline stem cells (GSCs). In these examples, it is plausible that a slight difference in MTOC activities between the mother and the daughter centrosomes is utilized to achieve asymmetric segregation of cellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tajbakhsh and Gonzalez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>). This raises two critical questions: (1) how might the mother and daughter centrosomes be distinctly regulated within the stem cells to achieve asymmetric segregation of certain cellular components? And (2) how do the mother and daughter centrosomes achieve the critical balance of segregating certain cellular components asymmetrically, while achieving equal segregation of other components such as sister chromatids?</p><p>Asymmetric centrosome inheritance was first described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> male GSCs, where the mother centrosome is consistently inherited by the stem cell while the daughter centrosome is inherited by the differentiating cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>). ACD of GSCs is influenced by their stem cell niche, which secretes self-renewal ligands and specifies GSC identity. GSCs attach to the hub cells, which function as a major niche component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The mother centrosomes in the GSCs are positioned near the hub cells throughout the cell cycle, whereas the daughter centrosomes migrate toward the distal side of the GSCs, and are inherited by the gonialblasts (GBs), the differentiating daughters of GSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2007</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Such stereotypical positioning of centrosomes helps orient the mitotic spindle perpendicular to the hub cells, leading to retention of GSCs within the niche and displacement of GBs away from the niche and ensuring the asymmetric outcome of the stem cell divisions. Although it is clear that this stereotypical centrosome positioning would help orient the mitotic spindle to achieve ACD, many intriguing questions surrounding the phenomenon of asymmetric centrosome inheritance remain to be answered: Do the mother and/or daughter centrosomes carry fate determinants or any characteristics that contribute to fate determination? Are stem cell centrosomes regulated differently than the centrosomes in non-stem cells?<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20977.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Klp10A localizes to the GSC centrosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Centrosome behavior in male GSCs.

Klp10A is a member of the kinesin-13 family of microtubule-depolymerizing motors, playing roles in regulation of primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobayashi et al., 2011</xref>) and MT-nanotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inaba et al., 2015</xref>) and in bipolar spindle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>). Whereas Klp10A localizes to the GSC centrosomes throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, arrows), its localization to the centrosomes of spermatogonia (SGs), the differentiating progeny of GSCs, is limited to mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>).

To our knowledge, this is the first protein reported to date to be enriched on the stem cell centrosomes compared to the centrosomes of non-stem cells.

In wild-type GSCs, the mother and daughter centrosomes are equal in size with the mother centrosome located near the hub throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2007</xref>). However, in <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>or <italic>klp10A<sup>ThbA</sup></italic> testes, the centrosomes proximal to the hub cells (presumably the mother centrosomes) in the GSCs elongated dramatically, reaching up to ~7 µm (average of 1.7 ± 1.1 µm, compared to an average of 0.56 ± 0.2 µm in control GSCs, N = 50 GSCs for each genotype), whereas the distal centrosomes (presumably the daughter centrosomes) in the GSCs were slightly shorter than the control centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). 46.6% of GSCs examined contained a visibly elongated centrosome (n = 277, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that it was indeed an elongated centrosome, not a primary cilium, because it lacked the surrounding membrane found on primary cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,C’</xref>). Elongated centrosomes were positive for three centrosomal markers examined along their entire length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), further confirming their identity as centrosomes. Centrosomes in SGs were not elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that Klp10A’s role in preventing centrosome elongation is unique to GSCs. The centrosomes in spermatocytes in <italic>klp10A<sup>ThbA</sup></italic> hypomorphic mutant were slightly elongated, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delgehyr et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

This notion was further supported by using a mother-centrosome–labeling method reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>). In this method, flies express PACT-GFP under control of the <italic>NGT40-gal4</italic> driver, which preferentially labels the mother centrosome. We found that the elongated centrosomes were preferentially labeled by PACT-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>): 73% of elongated centrosomes in <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup> </italic>GSCs were labeled by PACT-GFP (n = 40/55), whereas the shorter centrosome was labeled by PACT-GFP in 0% of GSCs. In the remaining 27% of cases (n = 15/55), both centrosomes were similar in size and the correlation between the centrosome age (mother/daughter) and length could not be determined. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that PACT is preferentially incorporated into the larger centrosome (irrespective of age) in <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup> </italic>GSCs, the above data indicate that it is likely the mother centrosome that elongates upon loss of <italic>klp10A</italic> function.</p><p>Interestingly, after the induction of <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup> </italic>GSC clones (<italic>hs-FLP; nos&gt;stop&gt;gal4; UAS-GFP, UAS-klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>), the centrosomes elongated gradually, reaching ~3–4 µm in length after eight days from the normal size of 0.56 ± 0.2 µm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). This result suggests that the centrosome that stays in the GSC (i.e. the mother centrosomes) continuously and gradually elongates. In contrast, the GSC daughter centrosomes do not elongate even after they mature to become the mother centrosome once in differentiating germ cells (GBs/SGs). These results reveal that the GSC mother centrosomes have an inherent tendency to elongate, which is counteracted by the function of Klp10A. This might be because of the need of the GSC mother centrosomes to be constantly anchored to the hub-GSC junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>), necessitating stronger microtubule nucleating activity throughout the cell cycle.

It has been documented that the sister chromatids of chromosome 4, easily identified by its small size, segregate to the spindle poles before the onset of anaphase and are visualized as phosphor-histone H3 (PH3)-positive dots near the spindle poles during metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dej et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Orr-Weaver, 1995</xref>). In control metaphase cells, PH3-positive chromosome 4 s were always observed at both spindle poles, and missegregation was never observed (0%, n = 14 mitotic GSCs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, in 90% of <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> metaphase GSCs with asymmetric centrosome size, PH3 signal was observed only near the elongated centrosomes, whereas the shorter centrosomes were not associated with any PH3 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, n = 21 mitotic GSCs). Although it remains possible that missegregation of chromosome 4 is due to Klp10A’s function on the kinetochore, the following observation favors the possibility that asymmetric spindle force is the major cause of chromosome 4 missegregation: we observed that the frequency of chromosome 4 missegregation was considerably lower in <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> metaphase GSCs, when the two centrosomes appear to be similar in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, 22%, n = 9 mitotic GSCs).

Previously, we have shown that there is a basal level of germ cell death under normal conditions (i.e. with optimal nutrient conditions in young flies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang and Yamashita, 2015</xref>). Germ cell death is characterized by acidification of dying cells that is detectable by Lysotracker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yacobi-Sharon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang and Yamashita, 2015</xref>). In control testes, most cell death was observed at the 16-cell stage of SGs, whereas GBs were rarely observed to die (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang and Yamashita, 2015</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> testis, there was a marked increase in the death of GBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). This might be because GBs that are too small cannot maintain their viability, and undergo cell death. Although it is difficult to establish a causative relationship between small GB size and increased GB death, the fact that <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> increases cell death and decreases cell size specifically in GBs (but not GSCs or SGs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,F</xref>) implies such a relationship. In support of this idea, time-lapse live observation captured an example of GB death following GSC division, where a small GB eventually lost nuclear integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To explore the underlying cause(s) of GB death in <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> GSCs, we examined the segregation of major cellular components: chromosomes, Golgi and mitochondria. As described above, sister chromatids of fourth chromosomes were missegregated during mitoses of <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). However, we did not detect missegregation of major chromosomes (X, Y, second and third chromosomes). By employing FISH method using chromosome specific probes, we found no evidence for chromosome missegregation for major chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that the chromosome missegregation is the cause of GB death. Next we examined the segregation patterns of cellular organelles. Mitochondria segregated equally during GSC division in control/wild type, whereas more mitochondria were inherited by GB in <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup> </italic>testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). Because GBs inherited more mitochondria than GSCs, it is unlikely that missegregation of mitochondria explains the higher frequency of GB death. It is of note that the GBs, which have less MTOC activity, inherit more mitochondria. The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is currently unclear. Golgi was observed to be inherited predominantly by GBs during control/wild type GSC divisions, whereas GSCs inherited more Golgi upon knockdown of <italic>klp10A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). If the amount of Golgi is essential for GB viability, this might explain why GBs die more frequently. In summary, although it remains unclear whether the perturbed segregation patterns of any single organelle can explain the frequent GB death, these data suggest that asymmetric spindle in <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup> </italic>GSCs results in altered patterns of organelle segregation, which might collectively compromise the viability of GBs. Alternatively, a cell size checkpoint may be in operation, possibly eliminating cells that are too small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kellogg, 2003</xref>). It is also possible that a cell competition mechanism might lead to elimination of unfit cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnston, 2009</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20977.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Segregation of mitochondria and Golgi is affected in <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> testes.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Mito-GFP distribution in control (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup> </italic>(<bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold>) GSC-GB pairs.

Asymmetric behavior of the mother and daughter centrosomes in these stem cell populations further led to the speculation that the mother and daughter centrosomes might be different not only from each other but also different from the centrosomes in non-stem cells, potentially contributing to asymmetric cell fate determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pelletier and Yamashita, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tajbakhsh and Gonzalez, 2009</xref>). However, it remained unknown whether stem cell centrosomes are indeed unique, and whether the stem cell mother centrosome is distinct from the daughter centrosome.</p><p>In this study, we identified Klp10A as the first protein that is enriched in interphase centrosomes specifically in stem cells. Its localization and mutant phenotype provide important insights into centrosome biology of stem cells. Klp10A’s enrichment on the stem cell centrosomes but not on the centrosomes of differentiating SGs suggests the presence of cellular mechanisms unique to stem cell centrosomes. Moreover, <italic>klp10A</italic> knockdown/mutation led to elongation of the mother centrosome specifically within stem cells; neither the daughter centrosome in GSCs nor any centrosomes in SGs were elongated. This phenotype demonstrates that the stem cell mother centrosome has unique characteristics and modes of regulation and indicates that the GSC mother centrosome has an inherent tendency to elongate, which must be counteracted by Klp10A. The mother centrosome in GSCs may have distinct microtubule dynamics, partly because of the necessity for the mother centrosome to be anchored to the hub-GSC interface throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>). It is worth noting that the centrosome size itself might not be the cause of asymmetric force generation. It was recently reported that loss of function of <italic>asterless (asl),</italic> the gene that encodes a core centriolar component, results in mother centrosome-specific elongation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> male GSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galletta et al., 2016</xref>). However, <italic>asl</italic> mutant did not lead to asymmetric spindle formation or daughter cell size, suggesting a unique function for Klp10A.</p><p>Asymmetric spindles, where one half of the spindle is considerably larger than the other, are often observed during normal developmental processes. This results in asymmetry in cell sizes as well. For example, <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts divide asymmetrically to produce another neuroblast and a differentiating cell (either ganglion mother cell in type I neuroblast lineage, or intermediate neural progenitor cell in type II neuroblast lineage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doe and Bowerman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Prehoda, 2009</xref>). In neuroblast divisions, the self-renewing neuroblast is considerably larger than its differentiating daughter cell. Similarly, the first mitosis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote is also characterized by asymmetric daughter cell sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rose and Gonczy, 2014</xref>). Asymmetric spindle morphology contributes to cell size asymmetry together with a myosin-dependent pathway that controls cleavage furrow positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cabernard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knoblich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pacquelet et al., 2015</xref>). These examples highlight that the asymmetry in daughter cell sizes can be a programmed process and does not inherently lead to cell death, as observed in <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> GSC divisions. More interestingly, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> Q lineage neuroblasts, which divide asymmetrically by spindle pulling and asymmetric Myosin localization, the smaller daughter undergoes apoptosis reminiscent of GBs in <italic>klp10A<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ou et al., 2010</xref>). This implies that death of daughter cells that are born too small might be utilized in the context of normal development. Our observations described in this study suggest that multiple aspects of ACDs (e.g. asymmetric segregation of fate determinants, spindle orientation, daughter cell size asymmetry) are carefully calibrated processes to achieve successful ACD unique to individual systems.</p><p>In summary, our study illuminates a critical mechanism for ACD, in which the MT-depolymerizing kinesin, Klp10A, counterbalances the mechanism that generates asymmetric centrosome behavior of mother and daughter centrosomes. Whereas asymmetry-generating mechanisms are critical for proper spindle orientation and thus ACD of GSCs, the lack of a counteracting force by Klp10A results in excessive asymmetries, leading to frequent death of GBs. We propose that ACD is achieved by fine-tuned symmetries and asymmetries, failure of which can lead to unsuccessful cell divisions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly husbandry and strains</title><p>All fly stocks were raised in standard Bloomington medium. <italic>ubi-asl-YFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Varmark et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>cnb-YFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Januschke et al., 2011</xref>) (a gift of Cayetano Gonzalez, IRB Barcelona), <italic>nos-gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Van Doren et al., 1998</xref>), <italic>UAS-klp10A-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inaba et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>klp10A<sup>TRiP.HMS00920</sup></italic> (obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center), <italic>UAS-α-tubGFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieder et al., 2000</xref>) (a gift of Allan Spradling, Carnegie Institution of Washington), and <italic>UAS-mito-GFP</italic> (obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cox and Spradling, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Immunofluorescence staining, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and microscopy</title><p>Immunofluorescence staining was conducted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>).

Note that the probes for second and third chromosomes also hybridize to Y chromosome.</p><p>Images were taken using a Leica TCS SP5 or a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with a 63× oil-immersion objective (NA = 1.4) and processed using Adobe Photoshop software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Time-lapse live imaging</title><p>Testes from newly eclosed flies were dissected into Schneider’s <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The testis tips were placed inside a sterile glass-bottom chamber and were mounted on a three-axis computer-controlled piezoelectric stage. An inverted Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with a 63× oil immersion objective (NA = 1.4) was used for imaging and images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Cell size analysis following GSC and GB mitosis was determined using area ratio of two daughter cells by manually drawing regions of interest in ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Quantification of cell death</title><p>For detection of germ cell death, testes were stained with Lysotracker Red DND-99 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 30 min prior to formaldehyde fixation. Anti-Adducin staining (described above) was used to distinguish various SG stage. Dying SGs were scored according to stage by counting the number of Lysotracker+ germ cell nuclei within a cyst.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> testes were dissected in 1× PBS and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde (EM grade) in 0.1 M cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 5 min at room temperature. This step was followed by an additional 25 min fixation on ice. The tissue was rinsed three times for 10 min each in cacodylate buffer, and then post-fixed for 30 min in 2% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer on ice. Next, the samples were rinsed in double-distilled water, and then <italic>en bloc</italic> stained for one hour in aqueous 7% uranyl acetate. The samples were then dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, treated with propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon epoxy resin. Semi-thin sections were stained with toluidine blue for tissue identification. Selected regions of interest were serial-sectioned (70 nm thickness) and mounted on Formvar/carbon-coated slotted grids. The grids were post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and samples were examined using a Philips CM100 electron microscope at 60 KV. Images were recorded digitally using a Hamamatsu ORCA-HR digital camera system, which was operated using AMTsoftware (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp., Danvers, MA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Clemens Cabernard (Reviewer #1) and Tomer Avidor-Reiss (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Asymmetric cell division can be manifested in the biased segregation of cell fate determinants and organelles or cell size differences between daughter cells. Recent observations have shown that centrosomes are intrinsically asymmetric and can also segregate asymmetrically. For instance, in male germline stem cells, centrosomes containing the old mother centriole remain in the stem cell whereas the daughter-centriole containing centrosome segregates into the differentiating gonialblasts. It was proposed that centrosomes contain stem cell specific factors, contributing to cell fate decisions. However, no such factors have currently been identified.</p><p>In the manuscript by Cuie Chen et al., the authors report the identification of Klp10A, a microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin of the kinesin-13 family, as a cell-specific centrosomal protein in <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline stem cells (GSCs). The authors claim that Klp10A is predominantly localized to mother centrosomes in interphase GSCs. Loss of function experiments further revealed that mother centrosomes elongate, specifically in GSCs. This elongation induces asymmetric spindles in mitotic GSCs, causing physical asymmetric divisions. The authors further observe an increase in cell death and propose that physical asymmetric GSC divisions produce smaller than normal differentiating cells which die more frequently.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is an interesting paper, that could potentially provide novel insight into centrosome asymmetry and basic stem cell biology. However, we recommend that the authors carefully address the following critiques:</p><p>1) We are not entirely convinced about the authors claim that Klp10A is a GSC specific centrosomal protein. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows, other non-GSC cells also show Klp10A localization on centrosomes.</p><p>2) The authors are using RNAi and a hypomorphic allele to remove Klp10A and claim that the RNAi line almost completely abolishes Klp10A protein expression. However, it is very difficult to judge from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> whether Klp10A is efficiently removed due to a considerable background signal. An ideal experiment would be to show this in RNAi clones, allowing the comparison between wild type and RNAi expressing GSCs. Alternatively, high magnification images showing Klp10A expressing GSCs stained for Klp10A and the centriolar marker Asl should be provided.</p><p>3) The authors claim that Klp10A specifically prevents centrosome elongation in GSCs. However, in spermatocytes, centrosomes also elongate, albeit not restricted to mother centrosomes. It is not quite clear why the authors maintain that Klp10A is GSC specific (see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) below).</p><p>4) To show that Klp10A specifically affects mother centrosomes, Chen et al. express PACT-GFP, observing that elongated centrosomes predominantly carry this label. However, an alternative explanation could be that this centrosomal marker does not discriminate between mother and daughter centrosome but simply incorporates into the biggest centrosome. In wild type GSCs centrosome size might correlate with centrosome age, however, that does not have to be the case in Klp10A mutants. Thus, although likely, it has not been formally proven that Klp10A specifically compromises mother centrosomes. Due to the lack of mother centrosome specific markers, it might be best change the wording accordingly.</p><p>5) It is unclear if the essential activity of Klp10A in the centrosome mediates the other activities during mitosis, or if Klp10A has multiple independent sites of action that mediate the various activities. In this regard, it would be useful to identify a site on Klp10A that controls its localization/enrichment to the GSC centrosome (but not to the spindle) and test if the centrosome localization is critical to all the reported activities of Klp10A. This type of experiment would allow substantiation of the claim that &quot;Abnormal elongation of the mother centrosome leads to asymmetric spindle formation, which in turn results in asymmetric cell size.&quot; Without this type of an experiment, this claim would need to be deleted.</p><p>6) Given the striking nature of the loss of function phenotype, it might be interesting to test whether over-expressing Klp10A is sufficient to decrease centrosome size. The authors may want to see if this suggested experiment can be done within a reasonable (&lt;2months) time.</p><p>7) We are convinced by the observation that mitotic GSCs devoid of Klp10A show asymmetric MTOC activity, resulting in asymmetric spindles. However, the live cell imaging shows that once cytokinesis is completed, both sibling cells seem to be similar in cell size, comparable to wild type. Furthermore, the authors claim that gonialblasts are smaller in size after knocking-down Klp10A. The authors only provide ratio's but not absolute cell size values that could be compared to wild type. Thus, it is not clear whether GBs indeed are smaller or if GSCs are bigger compared to wild type. To support their claim, the authors should provide cell size or cell diameter measurements.</p><p>8) Also, whether cell size indeed correlates with cell viability is not shown. To that end, the authors would have to track the fate of GBs, resulting from asymmetric GSC divisions. We are not sure this is an experiment that is technically feasible in this system. Thus, it remains unclear whether the increase in cell death is indeed a consequence of reduced gonialblast size.</p><p>9) In the Discussion, the authors claim that cell size asymmetry is dictated by spindle morphology. This is not entirely true since studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuroblasts have shown that Myosin localization is also an important determinant of sibling cell size. Thus, this statement should be corrected.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20977.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><bold><italic>[…]</italic></bold></p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is an interesting paper, that could potentially provide novel insight into centrosome asymmetry and basic stem cell biology.

We have published the validation of klp10A-RNAi already (Inaba et al., 2015 Nature). But in the Inaba paper, we did not have a space to show the actual data to demonstrate efficient knockdown. Thus, we added such data (Klp10A-RNAi germline clone stained with anti-Klp10A), which clearly demonstrate efficient knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and also cited the Inaba (2015).</p><p><italic>3) The authors claim that Klp10A specifically prevents centrosome elongation in GSCs.

Our intention was 1) centrosome elongation is considerably more dramatic in GSCs (compared to spermatocytes), and 2) Klp10A mutant would have ‘asymmetric centrosome’ problem only in GSCs (but not in spermatocytes, because both centrosomes elongates in spermatocytes).

We modified the text accordingly. (Indeed, it is of our future interest to study localization specific function of Klp10A. However, such experiments cannot be done in a timely manner, especially because there is a possibility that a Klp10A mutant protein that is defective in localizing to one location (e.g. centrosome) might fail to localize another location (e.g. kinetochore)). However, please note that asymmetric spindle formation correlated very well with mother centrosome elongation (on the contrary, even when klp10A knockdown is complete, if the mother centrosome has not elongated, such GSCs did not lead to asymmetric spindle formation). Considering these points, we modified the text to clarify that 1) we do not have sufficient data to attribute all klp10A mutant phenotype to Klp10A’s function on the centrosome, and 2) yet mother centrosome elongation correlate well with the observed phenotype.</p><p>Now the relevant part of the Abstract reads: Depletion of <italic>klp10A</italic> results in abnormal elongation of the mother centrosomes in GSCs, suggesting the existence of a stem cell-specific centrosome regulation program. Concomitant with mother centrosome elongation, GSCs form asymmetric spindle, wherein the elongated mother centrosome organizes considerably larger half spindle than the other half. This leads to asymmetric cell size, yielding a much smaller differentiating daughter that dies more frequently.</p><p>We also modified the text throughout to reflect these notions.</p><p><italic>6) Given the striking nature of the loss of function phenotype, it might be interesting to test whether over-expressing Klp10A is sufficient to decrease centrosome size. The authors may want to see if this suggested experiment can be done within a reasonable (&lt;2months) time.</italic> </p><p>We have done this, and observed no shortening of the centrosome upon overexpression of the klp10A. 0.69 ± 0.26(sd) µm in control GSCs vs. 0.71 ± 0.22 µm in klp10A-RNAi GSCs (N=67 GSCs for each genotype, p=0.70). (the same UAS-Klp10A expression construct perfectly rescues centrosome elongation phenotype of Klp10A-RNAi, demonstrating that this construct certainly express functional Klp10A). We incorporated this information in the revised text.</p><p><italic>7) We are convinced by the observation that mitotic GSCs devoid of Klp10A show asymmetric MTOC activity, resulting in asymmetric spindles. However, the live cell imaging shows that once cytokinesis is completed, both sibling cells seem to be similar in cell size, comparable to wild type. Furthermore, the authors claim that gonialblasts are smaller in size after knocking-down Klp10A. The authors only provide ratio's but not absolute cell size values that could be compared to wild type. Thus, it is not clear whether GBs indeed are smaller or if GSCs are bigger compared to wild type. To support their claim, the authors should provide cell size or cell diameter measurements.</italic> </p><p>We have re-made the graph to show actual GSC/GB sizes, instead of the ratio. Please note that panel C is GSC-GB size when they are clearly in the next G1 phase. Although GB seems to grow back in G1 in panel B (and GSC-GB size difference seems to be more striking in telophase), the GSC-GB size were measured in next G1 (after clear completion of mitosis), and panel C reflects the measurement in the next G1 phase.</p><p>Indeed, we think that some GB can grow back to a (semi)normal size, and not all of them die. We have conducted live observation to follow GSC-GB fate following their division with unequal cell size. GSC cell cycle is 12-16 hours based on several studies (including ours, Yadlapalli 2011 JCS, Inaba 2015 <italic>eLife</italic>). Thus, following cell division and subsequent GB fate in the time frame of live observation (up to 20 hours) is somewhat challenging. However, out of 10 such movies, we captured one example, where GB lost nuclear integrity and apparently started dying. Now we incorporate this data as supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>8) Also, whether cell size indeed correlates with cell viability is not shown. To that end, the authors would have to track the fate of GBs, resulting from asymmetric GSC divisions. We are not sure this is an experiment that is technically feasible in this system. Thus, it remains unclear whether the increase in cell death is indeed a consequence of reduced gonialblast size.</italic> </p><p>As described above, now we add a result of live observations. However, challenging nature of live observation to track GSC-GB division AND subsequent GB fate (death) makes it difficult to ‘correlate’ GB size and their death. Therefore, we modified the text not to mislead the readers, and more modestly stated our conclusion.</p><p><italic>9) In the Discussion, the authors claim that cell size asymmetry is dictated by spindle morphology. This is not entirely true since studies in Drosophila and C. elegans neuroblasts have shown that Myosin localization is also an important determinant of sibling cell size. Thus, this statement should be corrected.</italic> </p><p>Agreed. In the original version, we were simply making a comparison between neuroblasts and klp10A mutant GSCs regarding spindle-mediated cell size asymmetry (which were not a complete description of the knowledge in the field). In the revised version, we clearly stated that spindle asymmetry is not the only mechanism to account for asymmetric daughter cell sizes and that myosin localization contributes to cell size asymmetry.</p></body></sub-article></article>
