Protein Kinase A (PKA) in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs). We examined whether dopaminergic neuromodulation regulates activity-dependent glutamatergic synapse formation in the developing striatum. Systemic in vivo treatment with Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled G-protein receptors (GPCRs) agonists enhanced excitatory synapses on direct pathway striatal spiny projection neurons (dSPNs), whereas rapid production of excitatory synapses on indirect pathway neurons (iSPNs) required the activation of Gα<sub>s</sub> GPCRs in SPNs of both pathways. Nevertheless, in vitro Gα<sub>s</sub> activation was sufficient to enhance spinogenesis induced by glutamate photolysis in both dSPNs and iSPNs, suggesting that iSPNs in intact neural circuits have additional requirements for rapid synaptic development. We evaluated the in vivo effects of enhanced glutamate release from corticostriatal axons and postsynaptic PKA and discovered a mechanism of developmental plasticity wherein rapid synaptogenesis is promoted by the coordinated actions of glutamate and postsynaptic Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10111.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10111.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10111.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain is composed of intricate circuits of connected neurons that communicate via a combination of electrical and chemical signals. Some signals (referred to as excitatory signals) increase the probability that the neuron receiving the chemical message will produce an electrical impulse. On the other hand, inhibitory messages decrease the likelihood of this activity. Both of these kinds of signals are fast, and act over milliseconds. There is also a diverse set of slower signals, referred to as neuromodulation, which regulates the faster signals. A signaling chemical called dopamine is involved in neuromodulation and is essential for rewarding behavior and complex motor actions. The importance of dopamine is clear from the profound lack of movement seen in individuals with Parkinson’s disease, which is caused by the death of dopamine producing brain cells.</p><p>Many nerve endings from dopamine-releasing neurons connect to a part of the brain’s reward system called the striatum. The neurons in this region are organized into two pathways that have opposing impacts on behavior. Dopamine activates different kinds of receptors called “G protein-coupled dopamine receptors” on neurons from each pathway. This allows dopamine to alter the activity of a protein called Protein Kinase A (or PKA) and alter the signaling state of these neurons.</p><p>The impact of dopamine on neural circuits in adults has been extensively studied. However it was unknown whether dopamine might influence how neural circuits are wired during brain development. Because the nerve endings from dopamine-releasing neurons reach the striatum before most excitatory connections between the neurons are formed, dopamine stands to influence the development of connections in the striatum.</p><p>Kozorovitskiy et al. have now investigated the role of neuromodulation in brain development in young mice. This involved measuring the formation of excitatory connections or synapses and the electrical activity of different striatal neurons during the maturation of brain circuits that occurs after birth. This analysis revealed that turning on dopamine receptors that increase PKA activity rapidly enhances the number of excitatory synapses on the neurons that express this receptor.</p><p>Kozorovitskiy et al. then used a variety of approaches to investigate whether there is cooperation between G protein-coupled receptors, PKA activity and a signaling molecule called glutamate in striatal development. This revealed a more general mechanism by which the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors interacts with glutamate (the primary excitatory signal sent between neurons) in order to produce new synapses. These results reveal a previously unknown role for neuromodulation in “wiring up” the brain and open the possibility of new therapies to treat neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10111.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10111.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>basal ganglia</kwd><kwd>circuit development</kwd><kwd>corticostriatal</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>pka</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saunders</surname><given-names>Arpiar</given-names></name><name><surname>Sabatini</surname><given-names>Bernardo L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sabatini</surname><given-names>Bernardo L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007429</institution-id><institution>Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kozorovitskiy</surname><given-names>Yevgenia</given-names></name><name><surname>Peixoto</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>William N. and Bernice E.

Classical models of dopaminergic signaling in adult animals propose that the activity of dopamine-producing neurons encodes reward prediction errors and that released dopamine regulates the strength of corticostriatal excitatory glutamatergic inputs. This process is thought to favor the execution of a specific action that previously led to reward, at the expense of competing motor programs. An important element of this model is the distinct action of dopamine on the direct and indirect pathways, comprised of two classes of striatal spiny projection output neurons that express different types of dopamine receptors, project to separate downstream targets, and regulate complementary aspects of motor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bateup et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2013</xref>). Dopamine differentially regulates biochemical signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nishi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1997</xref>), neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity in these two classes of striatal neurons, promoting synaptic potentiation and depression through different receptor subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Less is known about the function of dopamine in the postnatal development of basal ganglia, when goal-oriented motor programs are first expressed and activity-dependent synapse formation occurs in the striatum. Therefore, we investigated whether dopamine modulates activity-dependent striatal plasticity and synapse formation during this time. In mice, the second postnatal week of life is a period of rapid growth of excitatory synapses on SPNs, a process driven by the release of glutamate from corticostriatal axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012</xref>), among other striatal glutamatergic projections. Furthermore, the balance of activity in direct and indirect pathway SPNs (dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively) influences activity in the neocortex, potentially altering the firing patterns of corticostriatal neurons via recurrent circuit interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oldenburg and Sabatini, 2015</xref>). Thus, positive feedback in recurrent circuits can amplify early glutamatergic signaling, rapidly changing network connectivity. If dopamine modulates glutamatergic synapse function in developing SPNs as it does in mature circuits, it likely interacts with glutamate-dependent neural circuit development during the early postnatal period. In dSPNs, dopamine acts on type 1 dopamine receptor (Drd1), a Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCR to activate PKA, a critical enzyme involved in cell growth and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nishi et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, in iSPNs, dopamine activates type 2 dopamine receptors (Drd2), Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled GPCRs, decreasing PKA activity. Since PKA activity levels influence spinogenesis and synaptogenesis in cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kwon and Sabatini, 2011</xref>), dopamine may directly set the threshold for activity-dependent synaptogenesis in striatal SPNs.</p><p>Dopamine is poised to regulate striatal signaling early in postnatal life, since embryonic striatum receives substantial dopaminergic innervation from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as is evidenced by neuroanatomical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2004</xref>) and direct functional assays showing embryonic dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferrari et al., 2012</xref>). Two observations indirectly support the involvement of dopamine in the developmental wiring of the striatum. First, dysfunctions of the dopaminergic system are linked to numerous diseases that are postulated to have a developmental origin, including schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Laruelle, 2014</xref>), obsessive compulsive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nikolaus et al., 2010</xref>) and Tourette Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buse et al., 2013</xref>). Second, embryonic exposure to drugs of abuse that act on the dopaminergic system, such as methamphetamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heller et al., 2001</xref>), induces profound brain and behavioral abnormalities in the offspring.</p><p>Here we tested the hypothesis that neuromodulators, and specifically dopamine, regulate glutamate-dependent synaptogenesis during striatal development. We found a potentially general mechanism of developmental synaptogenesis that relies on the coordinated actions of glutamate and the activation of PKA via Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Consistent with early development of the dopaminergic projection from SNc/VTA to striatum, the dopamine transporter promoter is active and dopaminergic axons are found in the neonatal striatum on postnatal day 1 (P1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Comparisons of dendritic spine density and spontaneous miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) were made between slices prepared from mice injected 1 hr previously with saline or ligands for GPCRs differentially expressed by dSPNs and iSPNs.</p><p>We observed that in acute mouse brain slices prepared 1 hr after systemic injection of the Drd1 agonist SKF 81297 (5 mg/kg), both dendritic spine density and mEPSC frequency in dSPNs were increased compared to saline-injected littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–G</xref>). The frequency of mEPSCs in Drd1 agonist exposed SPNs was 593 ± 168% of that in saline-treated controls (N = 7 and 8 neurons from 4 mice/group, Kruskal-Wallis test p = 0.0063, with p&lt;0.05 for Dunn’s multiple comparison post hoc test). mEPSC amplitude was 10.8 ± 1.6 and 12.7 ± 1.1 pA for control and Drd1 agonist groups and was not significantly different (one way ANOVA, p = 0.313). Dendritic spine density was 0.29 ± 0.02 spines/µm and 0.60 ± 0.04 spines/µm for saline control and Drd1 agonist groups respectively (p&lt;0.001 on Dunnett’s multiple comparison test after one-way ANOVA; N = 36 dendrites, 12 neurons from 3 mice and 21 dendrites in 7 neurons from 3 mice). Pretreating mice with a PKA antagonist H-89 (5 mg/kg) 30 min prior to agonist injection prevented the effects on mEPSC frequency and spine density (mEPSC frequency, 122 ± 47% of control with Drd1 agonist, N = 6 and 8 neurons from 2 mice/group, p&gt;0.05 for Dunn’s multiple comparison post hoc test; spine density, 0.27 ± 0.02 spines/µm vs. 0.29 ± 0.02 spines/µm in control and Drd1 agonist treatment conditions, N = 18 dendrites in 6 neurons from 2 mice, and 24 dendrites in 8 neurons from 2 mice). These results suggest a PKA-dependent increase in the number of AMPA receptor-containing glutamatergic synapses induced by in vivo Drd1 activation. However, Drd1 receptor activation alone is insufficient to increase synapse number, as changes in mEPSC frequency or amplitude were not observed with incubation of acute brain slices in SKF 81297 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. For mEPSC frequency, 107 ± 23% of ACSF control values with Drd1 stimulation; N = 6 neurons from 2 mice/group, t-test p = 0.83. The amplitude of mEPSCs was 12.3 ± 1.9 and 13.8 ± 2.2 pA for control and Drd1 stimulation groups respectively, t-test p = 0.51). Thus, dSPN excitatory synapse enhancement by a single, acute dose of a Drd1 receptor agonist alone requires intact circuitry, as it cannot be induced in the slice.</p><p>In contrast to the effects seen in dSPNs, in vivo administration of SKF 81297 had no effects on excitatory synapses in iSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), consistent with the lack of expression of Drd1 receptor on these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gerfen et al., 1990</xref>) (mEPSC frequency, 73.3 ± 30.1% of control values in presence of Drd1 agonist; N = 6 neurons from 4 mice and 8 neurons from 2 mice). iSPNs express Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled Adenosine 2a (A2a) receptor, which also enhances PKA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higley and Sabatini 2010</xref>) – nevertheless, administration of an agonist of A2aRs (CGS 21680, 0.1 mg/kg) had no significant effect on iSPN dendritic spine density or mEPSC rate, within the rapid time-frame of 1 hr (140 ± 63% of control, p&gt;0.05 for control vs. A2aR agonist post-hoc comparison; N = 11 neurons from 3 mice). Similarly, administering an agonist of Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled Drd2 receptors (quinpirole 0.5 mg/kg) also resulted in no significant differences from controls (132 ± 17.0% of control, p&gt;0.05 for control vs. Drd2 agonist post hoc comparison; N = 8 neurons from 3 mice). However, co-administration of Drd1 and A2a receptor agonists increased mEPSC frequency and dendritic spine density in iSPNs, with no change in mEPSC amplitude, suggesting an increase in the number of functional excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) (mEPSC frequency, 470 ± 124% of control values with CGS 21680/SKF 81297, one-way ANOVA p&lt;0.0008, Bonferroni post hoc p&lt;0.05; N = 6 neurons from 4 mice and 5 neurons from 2 mice for this comparison.

Instead, neuromodulatory GPCR signaling may be a permissive, or facilitating, signal that acts in concert with other stimuli to induce synaptogenesis in vivo. We hypothesized that GPCR activation modulates glutamate-induced, activity-dependent synaptogenesis. Since Drd1 activation also increases dSPN excitability, which in turn may increase recurrent corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission onto SPNs by altering cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oldenburg and Sabatini, 2015</xref>), then activation of this receptor alone in vivo will (1) activate PKA and (2) enhance glutamate release. This may be sufficient to drive synapse formation. Such stimulatory effects of dopamine on basal ganglia circuitry are consistent with the observation of Drd1 receptor activation-induced locomotion observed in pups, which normally show limited mobility at P8-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dehorter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wills et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This acute locomotion induction has lasting consequences for behavior and brain development, since priming with Drd1 receptor agonist administration at P9 potentiated agonist-evoked locomotion at P11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast to dSPNs, iSPNs would be expected to have more complex requirements for synaptogenesis, since iSPN activity is negatively coupled to intrastriatal glutamate release in the adult, via regulation of cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oldenburg and Sabatini, 2015</xref>). We hypothesize that the cooperation of presynaptic glutamate release and postsynaptic PKA signaling explains why coincident activation of Drd1 receptors (to recurrently drive glutamate release) and A2aRs (to enhance PKA signaling) is required in vivo to increase synaptogenesis in iSPNs.</p><p>We directly tested this hypothesis ex vivo by examining the ability of exogenous glutamate exposure, through focal photolysis of MNI-L-glutamate, to trigger synaptogenesis in SPNs under different states of GPCR activation. Spatio-temporally controlled glutamate release can focally and rapidly induce de novo formation of a synapse-bearing dendritic spine on young cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kwon and Sabatini, 2011</xref>). Cre-dependent AAV was used to induce GFP expression in Cre-expressing dSPNs or iSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>), allowing visualization of the cellular and dendritic morphology of sparsely labeled neurons of either pathway. Repeated glutamate uncaging (40 pulses at 2 Hz) with a variety of pulse durations (0.5–4 ms) was applied near a GFP-positive dendrite under conditions that maximally activate NMDA-type glutamate receptors (0 mM added extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>). In a subset of cases, this protocol induced de novo growth of a dendritic spine-like protrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

For both dSPNs and iSPNs, the success rate for inductions with stimulation 1–2 µm away from a labeled dendrite was ~20–50%, with longer uncaging pulses associated with a greater probability of spinogenesis (dSPNs, N = 146 and 174 trials in 10 mice for control group and in presence of GPCR agonist, respectively, balanced across conditions; iSPNs, N = 132 and 164 trials in 11 mice). The probability of spinogenesis increased in the presence of SKF 81297 for dSPNs, and CGS 21680 for iSPNs, respectively (the proportion of success trials was 0.23, 0.40, and 0.57 in the control condition, for varied length glutamate uncaging pulses, and 0.44, 0.62, and 0.76 in presence of Drd1 receptor agonist for dSPNs; for iSPNs, the respective proportions were 0.19, 0.46, and 0.49 in the control condition vs. 0.73, 0.74, and 0.70 for iSPNs with A2aR stimulation; two-tailed Z tests for proportions, p = 0.040, 0.015, and 0.018 for dSPNs, and p&lt;0.0001, p = 0.018, and 0.008 for iSPNs).

Whereas spine growth occurs rapidly in all conditions, as observed in pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kwon and Sabatini, 2011</xref>), SKF 81297 and CGS 21680 accelerated the onset of spinogenesis for dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively. We compared the number of photoactivation pulses to threshold, defined as 50% fluorescence increase over baseline in the uncaging location, leading to an appearance of a spine-like extension from the dendrite. At 2 Hz stimulation, for successful trials, threshold pulse number was 21.3 without drug and 6.0 in the presence of Gα<sub>s</sub> agonist for dSPNs, and 17.4 vs. 8.7 pulses for iSPNs (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.0025 and p = 0.0048 for d- and iSPN comparisons, respectively; N = 12 and 13 induction trials for dSPN control vs. in the presence of agonist, with 16 and 17 induction trials for iSPNs, respectively). Given that glutamate was exogenously controlled and Gα<sub>s</sub> receptors were stimulated by agonist bath application, these findings suggest the presence of cell-autonomous mechanisms for neuromodulatory regulation of glutamate-dependent spinogenesis.</p><p>If a similar interaction of neuromodulation and glutamate release controls synapse formation in vivo, it should be possible to bias rapidly developing networks towards increased synaptogenesis by briefly enhancing either PKA signaling or glutamate release. To test this prediction for PKA signaling, we used a pharmacogenetic approach based on Rs1, a modified Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCR sensitive to a small, exogenous, blood-brain-barrier permeable ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Srinivasan et al., 2003</xref>). The efficacy of this GPCR coupling to Gα<sub>s</sub> was examined in engineered HEK293 cells, in which GPCR coupling to Gα<sub>s</sub> elevates cyclic AMP and activates a transcriptional cAMP response element, leading to the production of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liberles and Buck, 2006</xref>).

This co-injection resulted in broad expression in dorsal striatum SPNs of the injected hemisphere in both dSPNs and iSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) (0% vs. 98% co-labeling, N = 750 and 728 neurons in control and injected hemispheres, from 3 mice). P8-13 infected mice were injected with the Rs1 ligand RS 67333 (3 mg/kg) and acute brain slices were prepared 1.5 hr later for analysis. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were used to monitor pharmacologically isolated, AMPAR-mediated blue light-evoked corticostriatal EPSCs, which were recorded from SPNs in dorsal striatum, located either in the control or in the infected hemisphere. Although this strategy results in ChR2 expression in SPNs, the brief time of expression from a single floxed ChR2 allele yielded negligible direct ChR2-evoked currents in SPNs under whole-cell voltage clamp configuration (<italic>e.g</italic>., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). With this strategy, both the control and infected striatum were exposed to RS 67333 and comparisons were made across SPNs from control and infected hemispheres in the same animal. In the control condition, there was a strong age dependence of peak amplitude of EPSCs, ranging from an average of 10 pA to an average of 196 pA per age group, in a cohort of P8-P13/14 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; light evoked EPSC amplitude across age, N = 14 neurons from 3 mice, 30 neurons from 6 mice and 14 neurons from 3 mice/group.

Consistent with our hypothesis, light-evoked EPSC amplitude was increased in virally transduced SPNs, compared to control hemisphere SPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; light-evoked EPSC amplitude, 68.6 ± 29.9 pA control vs. 150.3 ± 55.8 pA injected hemisphere; N = 21 and 23 neurons from 4 mice/group, t-test p = 0.039). Thus, in vivo transient activation of a Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCR in SPNs is sufficient to rapidly enhance corticostriatal connectivity, in the presence of otherwise normal corticostriatal transmission. The observed sufficiency of pharmacogenetic PKA activation to enhance corticostriatal connectivity for iSPNs (in contrast to stimulating iSPNs with an A2aR agonist, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) stems from the likelihood that the concurrent pharmacogenetic activation of Gα<sub>s</sub> cascades in dSPNs enhances corticostriatal glutamatergic drive via recurrent connections and regulating cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oldenburg and Sabatini, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, to examine whether increased glutamate release in vivo is able to enhance corticostriatal transmission during this developmental period, a small blue light LED was mounted over somatosensory cortex on one hemisphere and used to activate ChR2-expressing Rbp4-Cre positive neurons in cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Both peak EPSC amplitude and charge transfer were increased on the stimulated side (light-evoked EPSC amplitude, 9.6 ± 2.4 pA vs. 23.4 ± 4.3 pA for control vs. stimulated hemisphere; charge transfer, 0.64 ± 0.14 and 1.2 ± 0.26 pC for the same comparison; N = 19 and 26 neurons from 4 mice/group). These data demonstrate that a major component of the functional reorganization induced through brief in vivo stimulation of corticostriatal afferents in young mice is locally expressed in the striatum. We further probed the pharmacological dependence of this form of plasticity and found that it was blocked by either pre-administration of PKA inhibitor H-89 (5 mg/kg), or by a combination of Drd1 and A2aR blockers SKF 83566 (0.5 mg/kg) and istradefylline/KW-6002 (2.5 mg/kg), administered 30 min before optogenetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>). Light-evoked EPSC amplitude, in presence of H-89, was 18.8 ± 4.4 pA vs. 13.8 ± 3.3 pA in neurons from control and stimulated hemispheres (t-test p = 0.376, N = 22 and 19 neurons from 3 mice/group).

Thus, SPN changes induced by glutamatergic stimulation require PKA signaling, which in turn is activated via Drd1 and A2aR for dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively. Increasing either pre-synaptic glutamatergic drive or enhancing striatal PKA signaling is sufficient to rapidly alter SPN synaptogenesis, supporting the idea of cooperative, neuromodulation-dependent circuit remodeling during striatal development.</p><p>In order to directly evaluate whether PKA activation and glutamate release within striatum are sufficient for strengthening corticostriatal synapses, we performed ex vivo plasticity induction using optogenetic stimulation of corticostriatal afferents in the presence of drugs activating PKA in SPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We found that the same optogenetic stimulation parameters that evoked PKA-dependent enhancements in evoked responses in vivo were sufficient to produce a moderate enhancement in light-evoked corticostriatal responses in vitro. In experiments using within-mouse controls, the amplitude of evoked responses was 528.8 ± 69 pA and 694.4 ± 79 pA, for neurons in control and stimulated slices respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>) (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.037, N = 64 and 61 neurons from 4 mice). In contrast, incubation in PKA agonists alone was insufficient to alter evoked response amplitude (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.6, N = 19 and 14 neurons). These data directly confirm the existence of a mechanism for cooperative, neuromodulation-dependent circuit remodeling during striatal development.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10111.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Glutamate release and Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptor activation are sufficient to rapidly enhance corticostriatal connectivity in brain slices.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental schematic for optogenetic stimulation parameters.

Instead of a privileged action of dopamine in striatal synapse development, we discovered a mechanism of regulated synaptogenesis requiring cooperative action of glutamatergic drive and neuromodulation. Our data reveal that neuromodulation, through the activity of PKA, enhances the probability of dendritic spine formation and lowers the amount of glutamate necessary to trigger spinogenesis in the developing striatum.</p><p>These findings must be integrated into the context of basal ganglia circuitry, where inhibitory outputs of the direct and indirect pathways form functionally complementary loops that provide polysynaptic recurrent positive and negative feedback for excitatory striatal synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012</xref>). Because dopamine tends to increase dSPN PKA activity and decrease iSPN PKA activity (models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>), iSPN spinogenesis may be effectively yoked to dSPN development, as described below. Dopamine is abundant in the developing striatum, and it enhances PKA activity in dSPNs. This allows dSPNs to strongly respond to glutamate release from the first invading axons, becoming integrated into early basal ganglia circuits. On the other hand, iSPN activity and PKA levels are decreased by dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez-Lopez et al., 2000</xref>) and their excitatory wiring may rely either on the positive feedback through direct pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012</xref>) to increase glutamate release in the striatum, or on striatal adenosine levels that may be driven by local activity. This scenario predicts a transient developmental bias in pathway innervation towards dSPNs, which we have previously observed in the frequency of mEPSCs, as well as in dendritic spine density at P14-15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) (mEPSC frequency, 0.61 ± 0.1 and 0.35 ± 0.1 Hz for d- and iSPNs, t-test p = 0.019; mEPSC amplitude, 14.3 ± 0.5 and 14.0 ± 0.5 pA, p = 0.679; dendritic spine density, 0.74 ± 0.025 and 0.52 ± 0.013 spines/µm, p&lt;0.0001; N = 55 neurons from 12 mice and 56 neurons from 11 mice for electrophysiology; a distributed subset of recorded neurons was imaged for dendritic spine density analyses, 67 dSPN dendrites from 22 neurons and 93 iSPN dendrites from 31 neurons). Thus, the palette of neuromodulators and their postsynaptic coupling in a given brain region or developmental time window orchestrate the integration of each neuronal population into functional circuitry.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10111.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Pathway bias and neuromodulatory control of SPN excitatory synaptogenesis during development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic summarizing the key result of this study. Neuromodulation, acting via PKA, regulates glutamate-dependent developmental synaptogenesis. (<bold>B</bold>) These results fit into the larger framework of the basal ganglia model, which indicates that through polysynaptic recurrent loops involving the neocortex, dSPN activity is positively coupled to striatal glutamate release onto SPNs of both pathways, whereas indirect pathway activity provides negative feedback. (<bold>C</bold>) Together the two models can account for a transient developmental bias towards the earlier innervation of dSPNs over iSPNs. During development, dSPNs have greater dendritic spine density and miniature EPSC frequency but not amplitude, compared to iSPNs.

Alexa Fluor 594 (10–20 µM) was added to internal to visualize cell morphology and confirm cell identity as SPN. Recordings were made from cells held at -70 mV using Axoclamp 200B or 700B amplifiers (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) at room temperature. Data were filtered at 3 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Series resistance, measured with a 5 mV hyperpolarizing pulse in voltage clamp, was under 20 MΩ and was left uncompensated. All responses were examined for light-evoked EPSC analysis.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor (Marlene Bartos) and three reviewers, one of whom has agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Palmiter.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your study was intensely discussed by the Reviewing editor and three reviewers who came to the conclusion that your manuscript has the potential to be published in <italic>eLife</italic> after major revision. Reviewer 1 stated that the findings only show that neuromodulation can transiently enhance synaptogenesis but that the experiments do not demonstrate that the dopamine effect is 'necessary' for synaptogenesis. Thus, conclusions such as &quot;general role for neuromodulators acting on Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs during neural circuit development would transform our understanding of core principle in developmental neurobiology&quot; (in the Discussion) should be toned down throughout the manuscript. Moreover, reviewer 1 was asking whether a critical time window exists during which the observed phenomena exist. Reviewers 2 and 3 expressed interest in the main findings of the manuscript, in particular that D1Rs and A2aRs can specifically enhance synaptogenesis in dSPN and iSPN, respectively. However, they ask for additional in vitro experiments which demonstrate that the effects of D1 or A2aR agonists are specific to the striatum and not caused by alterations in other cortical areas upon in vivo systemic administration of drugs which reduces/block synaptogenesis. They formulated some key experiments which are attached below. The reviewers and the Reviewing editor felt that these control experiments are critical to support the finding that the observed effects reflect specific actions on iSPNs/dSPNs, but that these should not take more than a month to conduct once the animals are ready.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>1)The authors demonstrate transient effects of D1R activation on synapse function and locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), but they never demonstrate that these transient effects translate into any long-term changes in synapses or behavior. The details for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> are not included, but I assume that pups (about P15) were treated with SKF and locomotor activity was assayed for the 30 min following drug administration.

The evidence for spinogenesis in slices is very strong, and the optogenetic and chemogenetic experiments provide supporting evidence for this scheme in vivo. The optogenetic and chemogenetic experiments provide additional evidence for a corticostriatal interaction. Furthermore, the in vivo pharmacology is entirely consistent with the proposed mechanism. In general, I have relatively minor concerns.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, the authors show the effect of SKF81297 on mEPSC frequency, but don't show the amplitude data. This should be added.</p><p>2) Related to the last point, is there a reason why the authors rely on mEPSCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> vs evoked EPSCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>? Evoked EPSCs are relevant, but do not as readily allow one to argue for synaptogenesis vs increased synaptic strength.</p><p>3) In light of the experiments from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, is there a reason why the authors didn't try to optogenetically stimulate cortical inputs in the presence of SKF81297 in slice for 1 hr to elicit an increase an innervation? Demonstrating this mechanism in a reduced preparation (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) provides confidence that the phenomenon can be reduced to cortical afferent activity and PKA activation. I don't see this as essential, but it would strengthen their hypothesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The paper by Kozorovitskiy et al. follows earlier work by these authors showing that inactivation of dMSNs and iMSNs leads to opposing changes on synapse number in the striatum. That paper, along with others from the Sabatini lab have argued that synaptogenesis in the striatum depends on recurrent feedback from the cortex. Here, the authors argue that in addition to excitatory cortical feedback, synaptogenesis depends on neuromodulation, specifically activation of Gα<sub>s</sub> by D1Rs or A2aRs in dMSNs or iMSNs, respectively. The idea that neuromodulation gates the ability of cortical feedback to drive synaptogenesis is interesting, as is the possible dependence on Gα<sub>s</sub>.</p><p>1) All of the experiments have been done by systemically administering drugs to block synaptogenesis in vivo. Thus, it is unclear whether the effects specifically reflect actions within the basal ganglia. When drugs act to block synaptogenesis, they could be doing so by reducing cortical activity through actions in the cortex or thalamus.</p><p>a) To resolve this issue, the authors should ideally perform experiments in striatal brain slices with the cortex cut off. They could use ChR2 stimulation of cortical terminals to elicit excitatory cortical feedback in the presence/absence of drugs to activate/block D1Rs or A2aRs, then measure the effects on synaptogenesis physiologically (by measuring changes in light-evoked EPSCs) or morphologically (by examining spine density). Another possibility would be local infusion of these drugs into the striatum but this is slightly less preferred because there could still be indirect effects of such a manipulation on cortical activity – it would be ideal to have separate control over cortical activity and striatal neuromodulatory state as would be possible in a slice preparation.</p><p>b) In order to truly test the hypothesis that D1R or A2aR activation are specifically necessary in dMSNs vs. iMSNs, the authors should also examine the effects of antagonizing D1Rs or A2aRs separately, and also separate out recordings from dMSNs and iMSNs, rather than lumping all four conditions (2 cell types x 2 receptor antagonists) together as has been done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10111.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:1)The authors demonstrate transient effects of D1R activation on synapse function and locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), but they never demonstrate that these transient effects translate into any long-term changes in synapses or behavior.

We have completed the proposed experiment, at the ages that matched previous experiments in our study. As was anticipated by the reviewer, we observed that priming with Drd1 receptor agonist SKF 81297 translated into a heightened response to a second dose of the agonist 48 hr later. These observations point toward a lasting effect of a single stimulus enhancing Drd1 receptor signaling.

We found that in the presence of blockers of Gα<sub>s</sub>–coupled receptors expressed by spiny projection neurons, optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic projections was no longer sufficient to strengthen light-evoked evoked responses in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This result indicates that Gα<sub>s</sub>–coupled receptor signaling (although not necessarily dopamine specifically) is necessary to strengthen excitatory synapses onto striatal spiny projection neurons.</p><p>Reviewer #2:1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, the authors show the effect of SKF81297 on mEPSC frequency, but don't show the amplitude data.

Evoked EPSCs are relevant, but do not as readily allow one to argue for synaptogenesis vs increased synaptic strength.</p> <p>We believe that the study is strengthened by including multiple metrics related to synaptogenesis and specifically designed the experiments to consider miniature responses, dendritic spine density, glutamate-evoked spinogenesis and optogenetically evoked cortico-striatal responses. Including evoked responses is critical, since an increase in the number of functional excitatory synapses should translate into a greater corticostriatal response – a more direct measure of an increase in connectivity, compared to miniEPSCs and dendritic spine density combinations.</p><p>3) In light of the experiments from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, is there a reason why the authors didn't try to optogenetically stimulate cortical inputs in the presence of SKF81297 in slice for 1 hr to elicit an increase an innervation? Demonstrating this mechanism in a reduced preparation (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) provides confidence that the phenomenon can be reduced to cortical afferent activity and PKA activation. I don't see this as essential, but it would strengthen their hypothesis.</p> <p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this experiment, which directly tests the cooperative action of PKA signaling and glutamate release in strengthening glutamatergic connections onto spiny projection neurons. Our results, described in a new figure and reflected in text, demonstrate that indeed, cortical afferent activity and PKA activation are sufficient for inducing this form of plasticity.</p><p>Reviewer #3:in vivo</p><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that drugs acting to alter synaptogenesis should have circuit level consequences. In order to demonstrate that intra-striatal interactions between cortico-striatal glutamate release and PKA activity are sufficient to rapidly enhance connectivity, we have now performed plasticity induction in the acute slice, though the combination of optogenetic glutamate release and PKA activity stimulation. Figures and text were updated accordingly.</p><p> <italic>a) To resolve this issue, the authors should ideally perform experiments in striatal brain slices with the cortex cut off.

Compared to optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic axons alone, the combination of PKA activating drugs with optogenetic stimulation, induced plasticity, as is evidenced by changed in light-evoked EPSCs. Stimulation of PKA activity alone was insufficient. These data, described in a new figure and text, remove potential confounds of recurrent cortical feedback.</p><p>b) In order to truly test the hypothesis that D1R or A2aR activation are specifically necessary in dMSNs vs. iMSNs, the authors should also examine the effects of antagonizing D1Rs or A2aRs separately, and also separate out recordings from dMSNs and iMSNs, rather than lumping all four conditions (2 cell types x 2 receptor antagonists) together as has been done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>.</p><p>We agree that this is an interesting experiment and we hope to do it one day. However, realistically it would take at least 1 year to do so. The experiment requires that we analyze mice with 3 alleles (Cre, floxed ChR2, cell marker) with comparisons across hemispheres (stimulated and control) and two cell types (marker and non-marker). Because of the strong dependence of corticostriatal transmission on litter size (documented in our previous studies), it is necessary to perform all comparisons in each mouse. Thus, we need to try to get sufficient data in each mouse to compare 4 conditions (2 hemispheres x 2 cell types). Then we need to repeat this in control, D1R antagonist, A2A receptor antagonist, and possibly dual D1R/A2A antagonists treated animals (the latter to have a complete block). In total this experiment requires measurements from 4 cellular conditions in 4 pharmacological conditions in 2 different genotypes, each of which includes 3 transgenes. Each experiment also includes acute surgical implantation of a head mounted LED in a young pup and optogenetic stimulation – these are not easy manipulations and are relatively low yield. We hope that the referee agrees that this immense amount of work is beyond the scope of this study and, when considered in conjunction with the rest of the study, is not necessary to support its main conclusions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
