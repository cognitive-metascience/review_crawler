regulating gene expression. However, our understanding of how histone modifications directly affect chromatin function remains limited. In this study, we investigate acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 64 (H3K64ac), a previously uncharacterized acetylation on the lateral surface of the histone octamer. We show that H3K64ac regulates nucleosome stability and facilitates nucleosome eviction and hence gene expression in vivo. In line with this, we demonstrate that H3K64ac is enriched in vivo at the transcriptional start sites of active genes and it defines transcriptionally active chromatin. Moreover, we find that the p300 co-activator acetylates H3K64, and consistent with a transcriptional activation function, H3K64ac opposes its repressive counterpart H3K64me3. Our findings reveal an important role for a histone modification within the nucleosome core as a regulator of chromatin function and they demonstrate that lateral surface modifications can define functionally opposing chromatin states.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01632.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01632.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01632.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA is a very long molecule, so it needs to be packaged carefully to fit into the nucleus of a cell. To achieve this, the DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones to form a structure termed a nucleosome, which is the building block of a more compacted substance called chromatin. However, to express the genes in the DNA it is necessary to open up parts of the chromatin to give various enzymes access to the DNA.</p><p>Cells often chemically modify histones by adding acetyl or methyl groups, and these modifications are known to influence what proteins can bind to the nucleosomes, which ultimately influences what genes are expressed in the cell at a given time. It has been suspected for some time that histone modifications can also influence gene expression more directly, but there has been little evidence for this idea.</p><p>Now Di Cerbo et al. have studied what happens when acetyl or methyl groups are added to a specific site within a histone called H3K64, which is close to where the DNA wraps around this histone. These experiments showed that this site tends to be acetylated when a nearby gene is active, and to be unmodified or methylated when this gene is not active. It appears that the addition of the acetyl group makes this region of the chromatin less stable: this, in turn, makes it easier for the chromatin to be unpacked, thus giving access to the enzymes that transcribe the DNA and allowing transcription to take place. The work of Di Cerbo et al. shows that methylation and acetylation at the same site within a histone can define two opposing states of chromatin and DNA: an active state and a repressive state.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01632.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01632.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

regulation of all chromatin-based processes. Four core histones—H3, H4, H2A, and H2B—comprise the nucleosomal core particle, and each may be decorated with multiple covalent modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>). To date, most attention has focused on modifications within the flexible N-terminal tails of histones, which extend from their own nucleosome. Due to their accessibility, ‘reader’ or effector proteins selectively bind to modified sites in the tails to mediate downstream effects. In this way ‘readers’ can provide a relatively simple mechanism enabling cells to decipher the so-called ‘histone-code’, to facilitate the regulation of biological processes such as transcription, DNA replication, and damage repair.</p><p>Interestingly, covalent modifications also occur within the globular domain of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia, 2009</xref>), especially at positions that are in close contact with the nucleosomal DNA wrapped around each octamer. In particular, modifications on the outer surface of the histone octamer, the so-called lateral surface, have the potential to directly influence chromatin structure by altering histone–histone or histone–DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cosgrove, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tropberger and Schneider, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tropberger et al., 2013</xref>). Because of their structurally important position close to the DNA, one can directly address the mechanism(s) by which these lateral surface modifications impact on nucleosome dynamics and chromatin function. This is in contrast to tail modifications that play a mainly indirect role in chromatin regulation through recruitment of effector proteins.</p><p>Understanding how histone modifications ultimately impact on chromatin function is still an open challenge and this has not been helped by the fact that the repertoire of known modifications is far from complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tan et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we have investigated the functional mechanism of an uncharacterized acetylation site, lysine 64 of histone H3 (H3K64ac), which lies within the H3 globular domain. We demonstrate that this lateral surface modification can directly influence nucleosomal stability and dynamics, which consequently affects transcriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>H3K64ac is a novel histone modification enriched in euchromatin</title><p>We used mass spectrometry to identify novel histone modifications and found an uncharacterized acetylation site on histone H3 lysine 64 (H3K64ac) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

This antibody specifically detects endogenous acetylated histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and recognizes a K64-acetylated peptide with a high degree of specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>) compared to other H3 acetylated lysines. Its recognition of H3 was efficiently competed by the immunizing peptide, but not by other peptides containing acetylated, methylated, or unmodified histone regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Furthermore, limited tryptic digestion of native nucleosomes, which removes the H3 tails whilst leaving the DNA-protected H3 core region largely intact, confirmed the antibody’s specificity. Indeed, this digestion treatment resulted in the loss of signal for the tail modifications, such as H3K9ac, H3K18ac, and H3K27ac. In contrast, the truncated H3 core was still recognized by the H3K64ac antibody at levels comparable to the undigested H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>).</p><p>Using this antibody, we found that H3K64ac is present in a variety of mouse and human cell lines and tissues suggesting a rather ubiquitous function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>). Upon HDAC-inhibitor treatment, H3K64 acetylation levels increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>). Immunofluorescence (IF) showed a distinct nuclear localization of H3K64ac with a relative depletion from heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, compare panels 5 and 6, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>). Interestingly, this localization pattern is the opposite to that of H3K64me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We previously established that H3K64me3 is a novel repressive mark enriched in pericentromeric heterochromatin that might help to ‘lock’ the conformation and/or position of the nucleosome, and consequently the surrounding chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daujat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lange et al., 2013</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>H3K64ac associates with active regulatory genomic regions</title><p>To obtain a comprehensive picture of the genomic distribution of H3K64ac, we performed ChIP-on-chip assays using chromatin isolated from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and Nimblegen tiling microarrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lienert et al., 2011</xref>). In line with the euchromatic localization detected in IF, we found strong enrichment of H3K64ac at the transcriptional start site (TSS) of active genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). At TSSs, we detected a strong correlation between the enrichment of H3K64ac and RNA Polymerase II occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), as well as with the presence of active histone marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting a role for H3K64ac in transcriptional activation. Of note, local H3K64ac enrichment is indicative of the steady-state mRNA level of the respective gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and it is not simply due to increased histone H3 density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Consistent with this, H3K64ac enrichment is anti-correlated with repressive marks such as H3K27me3 and H3K64me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, we find H3K64ac strongly enriched at enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), with a preference for active enhancers, where it co-localizes with established enhancer marks such as H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and p300-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>).

To investigate this, we produced recombinant histone H3 acetylated on K64 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> using site-specific genetically directed incorporation of acetyl-lysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neumann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). To address effects on chromatin remodelling, we incubated H3K64ac and unmodified nucleosomes with two different chromatin remodelers belonging to two different Snf2 subfamilies, Chd1 and RSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>).

This was not the case when we used the RSC enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that acetylation of H3K64 could differentially affect remodelling enzymes. Next, we sought to investigate whether H3K64ac also impacts on passive fluctuations in nucleosome structure and interrogated whether H3K64ac affects the stability of DNA association with histone octamers within nucleosomes. To do this, we attached fluorescent dyes to specific sites on the DNA, 35 bp from each end of the nucleosomal DNA, and performed FRET measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neumann et al., 2009</xref>). Using this strategy, we observed that the FRET interaction for H3K64ac nucleosomes was more sensitive to salt-disruption than unmodified nucleosomes at NaCl concentrations ranging between ∼0.5 M and 1.0 M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In parallel, we also measured the salt-dependent nucleosome stability by single-molecule FRET, which again resulted in a lower stability of H3K64ac nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together these data demonstrate a decreased stability of H3K64ac nucleosomes, distinguishing this acetylation from H3K56ac that was reported not to significantly affect nucleosome stability under comparable conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neumann et al., 2009</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01632.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>H3K64 acetylation affects DNA-octamer interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) H3K64ac nucleosomes are more sensitive to salt-induced disruption in in vitro FRET assays.

To address whether H3K64ac affects the affinity of histone–DNA binding, we performed competitive nucleosome reconstitution assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thåström et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows that H3K64ac reduces the level of nucleosome assembly, relative to unmodified H3, indicating that H3K64 acetylation reduces histone–DNA binding affinity. In contrast, acetylation at H3K9 had no detectable effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), illustrating functional differences between acetylation of lateral surface and histone tail lysines. In concert, these observations demonstrate that H3K64ac directly influences histone–DNA association and nucleosome stability. This could provide a mechanistic explanation as to why H3K64ac is found in vivo at sites where increased nucleosome mobility/instability is required, such as the TSS of active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Segal et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In vivo, one of the most dramatic chromatin-reorganization events that require nucleosome instability occurs during spermatogenesis. In mammalian elongating spermatids, histones are initially replaced by the transition proteins and then by protamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaucher et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2012</xref>). In spermatocytes and round spermatids H3K64ac was below the limit of detection. However, the levels of H3K64ac dramatically increased in elongating spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). At approximately the same time, we also detected the presence of some specific H3 tail acetylations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Notably, we observed this increase in H3K64ac precisely during the period of nucleosome disassembly and replacement of histones by transition proteins in spermiogenesis. Our present data suggest a potential role for lateral surface modifications, such as H3K64ac, in this replacement process by creating a less stable, more ‘open’ chromatin state. In contrast to this, H3K64me3 is enriched in the part of the spermatid where genomic regions that undergo late histone replacement are located, suggesting that H3K64me3 may ‘stabilize’ particular regions of chromatin thereby protecting them from histone exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>H3K64ac can promote histone eviction and facilitate transcription</title><p>To test whether H3K64ac can indeed promote histone displacement from chromatin, we assembled chromatin with unmodified H3, H3K64R, or H3K64ac octamers on a template containing five GAL4-binding sites in front of a MLP promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and performed a histone eviction assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, left panel).

This could explain at least in part how H3K64ac can directly impact on nucleosome stability at active promoters and is in line with our observation that H3K64ac is associated with regions of the genome that are transcriptionally active or require histone exchange/turnover. Of note, we detected equivalent binding of Nap1 to each of the H3 species used (unmodified, K64R, or K64ac) indicating that the observed difference in histone eviction is not due to differential Nap1 histone binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01632.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>H3K64ac can promote histone eviction and facilitate transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) H3K64ac promotes histone eviction.

The observed transcriptional effects due to a single acetylation mimic within the globular domain strongly suggest that H3K64ac has an intrinsic ability to impact upon transcription mechanisms in vivo. Taken together, our results provide novel mechanistic insights into how a single histone modification, H3K64ac, within a nucleosome could specifically regulate nucleosome stability and transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have identified and functionally characterized a novel histone modification located on the octamer’s lateral surface in close proximity to the DNA backbone of the inner gyre. The main chain atoms of H3K64 are in direct contact with the DNA phosphate backbone and this places the H3K64 side chain close enough to potentially contact the DNA, with the average H3K64 side-chain nitrogen-to-DNA distance approximately 6.1 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>). Lysine acetylation results in increased bulk and charge neutralization of the lysine side-chain, and it is likely that acetylation of lateral surface lysines (e.g., H3K64) could interfere with histone–DNA interactions. Interestingly, in the high-resolution crystal structure of the nucleosome (PDB 1KX5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davey et al., 2002</xref>) H3K64 is found to be involved in an extensive network of water-mediated hydrogen bonds that link numerous water molecules, histone side- and main-chain atoms and the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Acetylation of H3K64 would be predicted to disrupt this hydrogen bond network. Davey et al. estimate from their crystallographic analysis that water-bridged interactions between histones and DNA are as important to nucleosome stability as the direct histone–DNA contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davey et al., 2002</xref>). These water-bridges provide a plasticity that allows the histone core to adapt to myriad variations in the DNA sequence and conformation. They postulate that disruption of even a single water–bridge interaction (e.g., acetylation of H3K64) has the potential to significantly affect nucleosome stability. This is indeed fully supported by our findings—we demonstrate that H3K64ac exerts a direct effect on nucleosome stability and facilitates histone eviction.</p><p>H3K64 acetylation could cause the reduced FRET signal we observed in the salt-dependent dissociation assay in multiple ways. A pre-requisite for the loss of histones from the nucleosome is the dissociation of DNA from the surface of the histone octamer. Given the proximity of H3K64ac to DNA it is likely that it may facilitate this dissociation. This loss of histone–DNA contacts caused by H3K64ac may aid the loss of H2A–H2B dimers, contributing to the observed change in FRET signal. Alternatively, following the loss of H2A–H2B dimers H3K64ac may favour dissociation of DNA from histones H3 and H4, or H3K64ac may affect water-mediated hydrogen bonds that directly influence the association of H2A–H2B dimers. These modes of action are not mutually exclusive and they are consistent with the observed effects of H3K64ac in chromatin assembly in vitro. They also all have the potential to influence chromatin organization during cycles of assembly/disassembly at gene regulatory elements. We detect an approximately 60 mM decrease in the salt-dependent stability between H3K64ac and unmodified/H3K9ac nucleosomes. This difference in salt stability of H3K64ac appears to be in a range consistent with the observed changes in nucleosome dynamics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gansen et al. (2013)</xref> showed that simultaneous acetylation of all sites in H3 results in a decrease in nucleosome salt stability of approximately 100–130 mM NaCl. Furthermore, a fundamental change in the histone content of the nucleosome via incorporation of the histone H2A variant H2A.Z, increases salt stability by up to ∼70 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, the observed enrichment of H3K64ac at active gene promoters and during chromatin reorganization in spermiogenesis argues for a role of H3K64ac in creating an open, permissive chromatin state. Indeed, this is supported by increased histone eviction and the finding that a mutation mimicking constitutive acetylation, H3K64 to Q, can promote transcription of at least certain genes. We consider a twofold higher transcription due to a single histone mutation as biologically important.</p><p>Additional lysines on the octamer’s lateral surface have been found to be acetylated, such as H3K56, which is located closer to the ends of the nucleosomal DNA. Interestingly, these acetylations can mediate distinct effects on nucleosomes (this work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neumann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tropberger et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, specificity exists in the way that the biomechanical properties of nucleosomes are affected differentially by acetylation at different sites within the globular domain of H3.</p><p>Despite considerable efforts, we have so far been unable to detect specific readers, or binders of H3K64ac. Consequently, we prefer a model in which it acts via direct effects. However, H3K64ac may also function by preventing H3K64me3 from being laid down at key genomic regions. We have previously suggested that methylation of H3K64 is involved in the creation of repressive chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daujat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lange et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, H3K64ac might serve to prevent the nucleosome from adopting a repressive conformation, thereby maintaining chromatin in a transcriptionally competent state. Our working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) proposes that opposing chromatin states can be defined via the mutually exclusive presence of H3K64ac or H3K64me3. This model is reinforced by the observed distinct and largely mutually exclusive genomic distribution patterns of these two H3K64 modifications.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01632.025</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic model for H3K64ac function.</title><p>H3K64ac (bottom) helps to create an open, permissive chromatin environment.

Average titration curves were calculated from normalised data from three separate titrations (using different nucleosome reconstitutions) for unmodified and acetylated nucleosomes and fit again with the sigmoid function to determine the average NaCl concentration at which the normalised qF (qF<sub>norm</sub>) is 0.5 (<sub>C0.5</sub>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>q</mml:mtext><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>A</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><italic>A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic> are the lower and upper plateau values, respectively, <italic>C</italic> the NaCl concentration and <italic>dC</italic> a constant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Competitive nucleosome assembly experiments</title><p>The competitive reconstitution procedure is based on that described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thåström et al. (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manohar et al. (2009)</xref>. However, we found that using the dilution method described below gave more consistent results than the double-dialysis method. Reactions were initially set up in 14.5 µl 1× TE and 2 M NaCl and contained 5 µg UltraPure sheared salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen) as non-specific competitor, 1 μg Cy3-labelled 0A0 DNA as the specific assembly fragment, 80 pmol H2A/H2B dimer, 40 pmol of unmodified or acetylated H3/H4 tetramer. A mastermix containing all components except the tetramer was assembled, split into separate reaction tubes, and the required amount of concentration-matched unmodified/acetylated tetramer added. This was to ensure the maximum amount of consistency between the reactions. The NaCl concentration was then decreased by addition of 1× TE 0.1 mM DTT to give concentrations of 1.5, 1.0, 0.75, 0.6, and 0.4 M, with sufficient time given for the reactions to equilibrate at each NaCl concentration (15–30 min). Once reactions had reached 0.4 M NaCl they were split into two separate microdialysis buttons and dialysed against 1× TE 0.1 mM DTT for several hours to reduce the NaCl to 0 M. The reactions were split in two to assess variability during dialysis; however, we found they did not vary by more than 3%. The reactions were then mixed with sucrose to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) and run on 0.2× TBE 6% native polyacrylamide gels run at 200 V for 75 min at 4°C. Reactions using unmodified and acetylated tetramer were always set up side-by-side. The data are the average of three different batches of assembly reactions performed on different days. Band intensities were quantified in AIDA software. The average assembly efficiency of the unmodified nucleosome reactions from each batch was defined as 1.0 and used as a reference for normalisation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>ATP-driven remodelling reactions</title><p>Nucleosomes were assembled on Cy3- or Cy5-labelled 54A18 DNA for RSC remodelling reactions or 54A0 for Chd1 reactions.

PCR products were purified by DNA precipitation followed by size exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).</p><p>DNA and histone octamers containing either unmodified H3 or H3K64ac were assembled to mononucleosomes by salt-gradient dialysis according to the double-dialysis method described above, but placing microdialysis buttons into 300 ml 0.5× TE-NP40 and 2 M NaCl, and dialysing them overnight against 3 l of 0.5× TE-NP40 and 50 mM NaCl at 4°C. Finally, the buttons were placed in 1 L 0.5× TE-NP40 buffer for 1 hr. A 1:20 mixture of labelled and unlabelled DNA was used for the assembly to generate a mixture of labelled and unlabelled nucleosomes and thus avoid nucleosome disruption due to low nucleosome concentration during the single-molecule experiments.</p><p>For smFRET measurements, nucleosomes were diluted in measurement buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% NP40, 0.1 mg/ml BSA and varying amounts of NaCl, ranging from 0 to 1 M) to a concentration in the order of 500 pM, corresponding to a picomolar concentration of the fluorescent species. Samples were then kept at 4°C for at least 18 hr to allow for adaptation to the respective final salt concentration. A 20 µl drop was placed on a PEG-coated coverslip and measurements were performed for 10 min at room temperature. At least three measurements were performed for each salt concentration on a custom built confocal microscope using freely diffusing molecules and time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC), as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bönisch et al.

For each burst, FRET efficiency and stoichiometry were calculated from the recorded signals as explained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bönisch et al. (2012)</xref>. Only bursts with more than 50 photons in total were considered for further analysis.

Thus, two FRET populations, represented by two Gaussian distance distributions, were fitted to the data by probability distribution analysis (PDA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonik et al., 2006</xref>) assuming a Förster radius of 60 nm. Additional measurement allowed us to estimate a background signal of 0.2 kHz in all channels, 4% crosstalk, and a γ-factor of 0.7, as a correction factor for differences in the quantum yields of the dyes and the wavelength-dependent detection efficiencies of the setup. Measures of the higher FRET efficiency corresponded to the fraction of intact nucleosomes at the respective salt concentration. These values were normalized to the higher FRET efficiency value at 0 mM NaCl to allow comparison between unmodified and acetylated nucleosomes. The sigmoidal fit function described in the section <italic>‘</italic>Salt-dependent disassembly of nucleosomes monitored by quenched fluorescence (qF) of AlexaFluor488 (AF488)<italic>’</italic> was used to fit the data and retrieve C<sub>0.5</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Histone eviction assay</title><p>The histone eviction assay was adapted from a protocol developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al.

Then, a mixture of radioactive <sup>3</sup>H-acetyl-CoA and 100 µM cold acetyl-CoA was added to the samples and incubated for 40 min at 30°C. Before this last incubation, each reaction was supplemented with 1 µg of a supercoiled plasmid, on which the evicted octamers are assembled by Nap1.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, the authors identified and characterized a novel histone acetylation site at H3K64. This residue, located on the outer (lateral) surface of the histone octamer, is close to the DNA within the nucleosome structure and is thus potentially interesting because its acetylation may disrupt the nucleosome in a manner similar to that caused by H3K56ac. H3K64ac was identified by mass spec and found to be present in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Genome-wide analyses revealed that H3K64ac correlated with enhancers as well as active promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref>). Acetylation of H3K64 appears to be performed largely, but not necessarily exclusively, by p300/CBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Acetylation of H3K64 may cause a slight destabilization of nucleosomes at NaCl concentrations greater than 0.35 M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The localization of H3K64ac during spermatogenesis was also examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> addresses, somewhat incompletely, the possible role of H3K64ac in histone eviction and transcription.</p><p>Hence, this study describes acetylation of H3K64 in mice and humans and finds that p300/CBP largely contribute to this acetylation. In a manner similar to other acetylation marks in H3, H3K64ac is found in transcriptionally active chromatin. H3K64ac may destabilize nucleosome stability and facilitate transcription. The main strengths of this work are the identification of H3K64ac, the prominent role of p300/CBP in acetylating H3K64, and the association of H3K64ac with active chromatin. Two key concerns are the specificity of the H3K64ac antibodies and the abundance of H3K64ac relative to H3K18ac and H3K27ac, which are also generated by p300/CBP. The functional studies are also less convincing.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The authors need to test more thoroughly the specificity of the H3K64ac antibodies, as many results depend upon whether or not the antibodies are specific. In particular, the authors need to test whether singly acetylated peptides containing H3K18ac or H3K27ac (sites that are also acetylated by p300/CBP) are recognized by the H3K64ac antisera. Thus, both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2C</xref> should be expanded to test these peptides.</p><p>2) It is essential to determine the relative abundance (by mass spec) of H3K64ac compared to H3K18ac and H3K27ac, as this issue is relevant to the possible roles of H3K64ac in the cell.</p><p>3) In addition, if the abundance of H3K64ac relative to H3K18ac or H3K27ac is very low, then the specificity of the antibodies (point 1 above) becomes even more critical. In this scenario, the authors should make the H3K64R mutation in the epitope tagged H3.1 and H3.3 histones that they use in later figures, express it in cells and show by western blot that their antibody no longer recognizes the tagged H3 from cells to prove specificity of the antibody. This is especially important because CBP is the apparent HAT for H3K64ac and the pattern of localization of the H3K64ac antibodies to promoters is similar to that of other H3 acetylation marks.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The meta gene analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows a dramatic dip right over the TSS and a peak on either side for H3K64ac signal normalized by Input. It is well-known that there is histone displacement at the TSS to proximal regions to allow for the regulatory machinery to bind. Therefore, the meta gene results could be indicative of higher H3 concentration in the proximal regions of the TSS (and corresponding depletion over TSS) rather than a specific increase in H3K64ac. The authors should normalize the signal ChIP to H3 rather than input for this particular case.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The experiments on H3K64ac being involved in histone eviction are problematic. First, the line is a poor fit to the data. The actual data points indicate that there is, at best, roughly a 50 mM difference in the NaCl concentration between the H3K64ac data and the other data.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> is incomplete. For each different histone (unmod, K64R, K64ac), data needs to be shown for +/- NAP1, +/- Gal4-VP16, +/- p300, and +/- AcCoA. It is not possible to interpret the data in the absence of the missing conditions. Also, does the supernatant contain nucleosomes as shown in the Figure? If so, do the nucleosomes have NAP1 bound to them as shown in the Figure? In this experiment, is it simply possible that NAP1 cannot recognize H3K64R?</p><p>7) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> are interpreted as showing that a K to Q mimic of lysine 64 increases transcription.

In particular, the authors need to test whether singly acetylated peptides containing H3K18ac or H3K27ac (sites that are also acetylated by p300/CBP) are recognized by the H3K64ac antisera. Thus, both</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 2C</italic></xref> <italic>should be expanded to test these peptides</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that testing the H3K64ac antibody for recognition of other p300/CBP acetylation sites is an important control. To this end we:</p><p>A) Synthesized H3K18ac and H3K27ac peptides and included these peptides in our specificity screening. As shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2D and E</xref> we found that apparently our serum recognises H3K64ac with an affinity significantly greater than the other acetylated peptides.</p><p>B) Have additionally included H3K18ac and H3K27ac peptides in our peptide competition assays. In this assay we observe complete competition with the H3K64ac peptide. In stark contrast, we observe no competition using the H3K18ac or H3K27ac peptides (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2F</xref>). Together, these data provide strong evidence that the H3K64ac antibody preparation is indeed highly selective.</p><p><italic>2) It is essential to determine the relative abundance (by mass spec) of H3K64ac compared to H3K18ac and H3K27ac, as this issue is relevant to the possible roles of H3K64ac in the cell</italic>.</p><p>To address this point we performed quantitative mass spec analysis of H3K18ac, H3K27ac and H3K64ac. We find a relative abundance of ∼200:2:1 for these three acetylation sites. We would like to point out that the rather unexpected ratio of H3K18ac to H3K27ac (200:2) is in line with that reported recently in a systematic mass spectrometrical study (LeRoy et al. 2013) and that the abundance of H3K64ac and H3K27ac we found is comparable. H3K27ac is an established signature for active regulatory elements (and to some extent also active genes) and we show that H3K64ac is specifically marking active transcription start sites. These findings fit well with the similar abundances of these two acetylations.</p><p>We would like to emphasise that the selectivity of the H3K64ac anti-serum for H3K64ac in our assays is – compared to H3K18ac and H3K27ac – higher than the ratio of their relative abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2E</xref>). Furthermore upon mutation of H3K64 to an R we detect a loss of H3 recognition by the H3K64ac antibody on all three H3 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) In addition, if the abundance of H3K64ac relative to H3K18ac or H3K27ac is very low, then the specificity of the antibodies (point 1 above) becomes even more critical. In this scenario, the authors should make the H3K64R mutation in the epitope tagged H3.1 and H3.3 histones that they use in later figures, express it in cells and show by western blot that their antibody no longer recognizes the tagged H3 from cells to prove specificity of the antibody. This is especially important because CBP is the apparent HAT for H3K64ac and the pattern of localization of the H3K64ac antibodies to promoters is similar to that of other H3 acetylation marks</italic>.</p><p>We originally used H3.2 as an antibody control because we detect lower levels of H3K64ac on this subtype and therefore we considered it as a very stringent antibody control. However, as suggested by the reviewers we have now performed the same test with the H3.1 and H3.3 variants expressed in vivo. As shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref>, mutations of H3K64 to R in H3.1 and H3.3 result (as shown previously for H3.2) in a loss of H3K64ac detection by our antibody.</p><p>To further validate the specificity of the H3K64ac antibody we have now subjected native nucleosomes to tryptic digestion followed by Western blotting. This mild digestion removes the histones tails and leaves the H3 core region (protected by the DNA) predominantly intact. As shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2G</xref>, this results, as expected, in a total loss of H3K9ac, H3K18ac and H3K27ac signals. However, the tailless H3 band is still recognised by the H3K64ac antibody with a comparable intensity to the intact and undigested H3, strongly arguing against cross reactivity towards acetylation sites in the H3 tail (and indeed any other acetylated sites within the H3 N-terminal tail).</p><p>Together these additional experiments provide strong experimental support for the specificity of the H3K64ac antibody we used.</p><p><italic>4)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>. The meta gene analysis in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref> <italic>shows a dramatic dip right over the TSS and a peak on either side for H3K64ac signal normalized by Input. It is well-known that there is histone displacement at the TSS to proximal regions to allow for the regulatory machinery to bind. Therefore, the meta gene results could be indicative of higher H3 concentration in the proximal regions of the TSS (and corresponding depletion over TSS) rather than a specific increase in H3K64ac. The authors should normalize the signal ChIP to H3 rather than input for this particular case</italic>.</p><p>The finding of a dip in enrichments over the TSS has been often reported before, e.g., it has been consistently found in meta profiles for most active histone marks as well as Pol II. As the reviewer points out, this dip corresponds to the so-called ‘nucleosome-free region’ (NFR). The possibility that the proximal enrichment of H3K64ac could be due to highly increased H3 concentrations, appears unlikely as to our knowledge this has not been reported for mouse stem cells. Instead, it has been repeatedly shown that histone density up and downstream of the TSS of active genes is rather uniform in ES cells (Teif et al. 2012, Kelly et al. 2012).</p><p>Nevertheless, we acknowledge that there is an ongoing discussion in the field about the normalisation of ChIP data to input versus normalisation to H3. To address the referee’s concerns we have now also plotted the H3 enrichments in a similar meta analysis as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1E</xref> H3 is only slightly enriched proximal to the NFR and therefore the strong enrichment of H3K64ac cannot be explained by higher H3 concentration. We have included this analysis and clarified the corresponding text in the revised manuscript (main text and corresponding methods and figure legends of supplementary information). We hope that this new analysis addresses now the referees’ concern.</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>. The experiments on H3K64ac being involved in histone eviction are problematic. First, the line is a poor fit to the data. The actual data points indicate that there is, at best, roughly a 50 mM difference in the NaCl concentration between the H3K64ac data and the other data</italic>.</p><p>A) To address the referees concern regarding the fit of the salt-induced nucleosome disassembly data, we have explored alternative modeling algorithms and re-analysed the data using a different sigmoid model that generates a 'better' fit across the three different datasets (R<sup>2</sup> values all above 0.99). This new analysis is now used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and the new line fits better to the K64ac data. It has resulted in some minor changes in the <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>0.5</italic></sub> values, but these are still consistent with our previous analysis/interpretation. The values are as follows (new model vs old model): unmodified – 697 ± 9 mM vs 690 ± 11 mM; H3K9ac – 691 ± 13 mM vs 682 ± 12 mM; H3K64ac – 622 ± 16 mM vs 605 ± 12 mM. We have now included this in a new model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.</p><p>B) With respect to the magnitude of the change between H3K64ac and unmodified/H3K9ac we strongly believe that the 60-70 mM difference is meaningful and significant, since it is consistent with previously published studies using similar methodologies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gansen et al. (2013)</xref> showed that simultaneous acetylation of all sites in H3 results in a decrease in nucleosome salt stability of ∼100-130 mM NaCl. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al. (2004)</xref> showed that a fundamental change in the histone content of the nucleosome, the incorporation of the histone H2A variant H2A.Z, increases salt stability up to ∼70 mM. It is well documented that H2A.Z significantly increases the stability/compaction of nucleosome arrays (Fan et al. 2002) and reduces transcription of chromatin templates in vitro (Zhou et al. 2007). Thus, the decrease in salt stability we observe for H3K64ac appears to be in a range consistent with real changes in nucleosome dynamics. This is also supported by our additional in vitro and in vivo data. Notably, not all core histone acetylations result in destabilised nucleosomes in vitro. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neumann et al. (2009)</xref> reported that H3K56ac nucleosomes show no significant difference in salt stability relative to unmodified nucleosomes. Thus, the actual site of acetylation within the nucleosome seems important for its destabilisation rather than acetylation per se. We have expanded this explanation in the discussion section of our revised manuscript.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, the results from the quoted studies should only be used as a relative guide and they should not be used to make absolute comparisons, as each study uses different fluorophore combinations, different dye-attachment sites, different instrumental setups, and different DNAs. Nevertheless, they consistently describe comparable changes in salt stability that can affect chromatin function.</p><p>C) To experimentally address the referees’ concern we have now performed additional stability measurements, using a more sensitive method, single-molecule FRET analysis. These new data are now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4</xref> and they confirm, at a single-molecule level, our original data that the presence of H3K64ac decreases nucleosome stability.</p><p>We hope that with these new data and the detailed explanations the reviewer will be now convinced that the differences that we report are consistent and meaningful.</p><p><italic>6)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6A</italic></xref> <italic>is incomplete. For each different histone (unmod, K64R, K64ac), data needs to be shown for +/- NAP1, +/- Gal4-VP16, +/- p300, and +/- AcCoA. It is not possible to interpret the data in the absence of the missing conditions. Also, does the supernatant contain nucleosomes as shown in the Figure? If so, do the nucleosomes have NAP1 bound to them as shown in the Figure? In this experiment, is it simply possible that NAP1 cannot recognize H3K64R</italic>?</p><p>We agree with the referee that the original version was difficult to interpret and we apologise for this. Now, as requested, we have extended our analysis of the in vitro histone eviction. We have:</p><p>A) Included a Nap1 – control. As shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>, the presence of the chaperone Nap1 is required to detect histones in the supernatant. In fact, Nap1 helps to transfer the evicted histones onto a supercoiled plasmid DNA template and prevents the re-assembly of evicted histones onto the linear chromatin templates.</p><p>B) As suggested we have also included a - AcCoA control. As shown previously eviction capability in vitro is driven by acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sharma &amp; Nyborg 2008</xref>). In the absence of AcCoA, p300 activity is impaired, and this leads to strong effects on histone eviction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, the pre-acetylated H3K64ac nucleosomes, due to their intrinsic higher instability are prone to easier eviction, which may occur to a low level even in the absence of AcCoA, supporting our model of destabilisation of nucleosomes by H3K64ac.</p><p>Since VP16 is required for the recruitment of p300 itself the absence of p300 and VP16 would simply mimic the absence of the essential co-factor AcCoA. Therefore, we believe that these conditions are already covered by the new -AcCoA (no acetylation) control and would not add any further information to the mechanistic effect of H3K64ac nucleosome eviction.</p><p>Altogether, the new revised figure reinforces our mechanistic model, whereby destabilisation of the chromatin template due to the presence of H3K64ac facilitates histone eviction. In agreement with this, the K64R mutation strongly impairs histone eviction in vitro. These data are now included in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2A</xref>. We believe that these new data firmly support our mechanistic model.</p><p>C) Following the reviewers’ comments, we realised that our schematic of the eviction assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> might have been misleading. Nap1 is known to bind both H2A-H2B dimers and H3-H4 tetramers in vitro (Andrews et al. 2008). However, we have no evidence for full nucleosome formation upon/during eviction and the conclusion from this experiment is solely that H3K64ac promotes eviction of histone H3. To avoid confusion we have adapted the model accordingly, and now the scheme shows Nap1 binding independently the H3-H4 tetramer and H2A-H2B dimers. These tetramers and dimers can then be sequestered by Nap1 onto the supercoiled plasmid DNA in the supernatant.</p><p>D) The reviewer raised an important question concerning the ability of Nap1 to bind equally to all H3 types used in the assay. To address the effect of the H3K64R mutation on Nap1 binding we performed direct in vitro interaction assays. As shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2B</xref>, Nap1 binds to the H3K64R mutant similarly to unmodified H3 or H3K64ac. This strongly suggests that neither the H3K64R mutation nor H3K64ac affects Nap1 binding.</p><p><italic>7) The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref> <italic>are interpreted as showing that a K to Q mimic of lysine 64 increases transcription. However, the increased transcription in the K64Q mutant is subtle (less than 2-fold) and is only seen at some genes and at some time points. The interpretation of the results needs to reflect the data more accurately</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the editor we reworded the corresponding sections in the results and discussion section to make it clear that we detect changes of expression at certain genes. To substantiate the original data we have now included additional time points during gene induction. These demonstrate an increase in transcription of <italic>c-fos</italic> and <italic>Egr1</italic> genes, and to a lesser extent of <italic>c-myc</italic> gene, across the complete gene induction time-course. Additionally, we included now an H3K64R mutant. We also show by Western Blot analysis that the levels of the exogenously expressed histones in this system are equal.</p><p>For us this experiment demonstrates a reproducible effect of a mutation of H3K64 on gene expression. We do not know how general the effect is, however we consider a greater than 2-fold effect due to a single histone mutation as significant. This 2-fold difference has been calculated relative to wt H3, which may still be acetylated at K64. We have now also included the transcriptional effects of the H3K64R mutant, which cannot be acetylated at K64. As expected the K64R mutant has a negative effect on transcription of the analysed genes and the fold difference in transcriptional levels between K64Q and K64R is, as expected, higher than the difference between K64Q and wt H3 (up to more than 3-fold). Furthermore, we reason that a two-fold difference in transcriptional levels is already known to be meaningful in a biological context. For example, in dosage compensation where it contributes to sex determination.</p><p>[Editors' note: further clarifications were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) Can the authors indicate the source/origin (yeast, human, etc.) of the Nap1</italic>?</p><p>We apologize for this omission.

The lines still do not seem to be a good fit to the data, especially the H3K9ac line</italic>.</p><p>For the original fits we had used the default weighting option in our fitting software (Origin 8.6), which gives more weight to data points with lower errors. This is the reason why the fits did not pass directly through some of the data points with larger errors bars. To address the reviewers’ concern we have removed all weighting and the lines now pass through the more variable data points. In line with this we also updated the C<sub>0.5</sub>values. Note that there is no change to the conclusions drawn from this experiment, i.e., the salt-dependent disruption profile of H3K64ac nucleosomes is significantly different from that of unmodified/H3K9ac nucleosomes. We hope that this addresses the concerns of the referee.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>. One additional complication in the interpretation of the data is that H2A-H2B begin to dissociate from chromatin at around 0.6 M NaCl</italic>.</p><p>The important point of our results is that H3K64 acetylation sensitises nucleosomes to salt. At present, we do not fully understand how this is manifested but, given the proximity of K64 to DNA, we believe it is likely to involve perturbations of the interactions between H3 and the DNA. Nevertheless, the reviewer is correct to indicate that H2A/H2B dimers dissociate from nucleosomes at around 0.6 M NaCl. We are happy to consider that this event may play some role in the H3K64ac effect that we observe. Consequently, we now suggest that there are at least three ways by which H3K64 acetylation could affect the reduced FRET signal observed in the salt dependent dissociation assay.</p><p>i) Dissociation of DNA from the surface of the histone octamer is a prerequisite for histone dimer loss. As a result, it is possible that the loss of histone-DNA contacts caused by H3K64 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5–figure supplement 5</xref>) act to facilitate loss of histone dimers and as a consequence the observed FRET signal.</p><p>ii) Following loss of histone dimers, H3K64 acetylation may favor dissociation of DNA from histones H3 and H4.</p><p>iii) H3K64 acetylation may affect water-mediated hydrogen bonds that directly influence association of histone dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5–figure supplement 5C</xref>). These modes of action are not mutually exclusive and all are consistent with the observed effects of H3K64 acetylation in chromatin assembly in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). They also have the potential to influence chromatin organization during cycles of assembly/disassembly at gene regulatory elements.</p><p>Additional discussion of this point has been added to the Discussion section of the revised manuscript as a new paragraph.</p></body></sub-article></article>
