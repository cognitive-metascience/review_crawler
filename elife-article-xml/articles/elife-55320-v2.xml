sequencing (scRNA-seq) of yeast cells do not match the throughput and relative simplicity of the state-of-the-art techniques that are available for mammalian cells. In this study, we report how 10x Genomics’ droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing technology can be modified to allow analysis of yeast cells. The protocol, which is based on in-droplet spheroplasting of the cells, yields an order-of-magnitude higher throughput in comparison to existing methods. After extensive validation of the method, we demonstrate its use by studying the dynamics of the response of isogenic yeast populations to a shift in carbon source, revealing the heterogeneity and underlying molecular processes during this shift. The method we describe opens new avenues for studies focusing on yeast cells, as well as other cells with a degradable cell wall.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-cell RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>lag phase</kwd><kwd>heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>tools &amp; methods</kwd><kwd>metabolic shift</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vermeersch</surname><given-names>Lieselotte</given-names></name><name><surname>Cerulus</surname><given-names>Bram</given-names></name><name><surname>Voordeckers</surname><given-names>Karin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004727</institution-id><institution>Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verstrepen</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Council CoG682009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verstrepen</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AB-InBev-Baillet Latour Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verstrepen</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>246 RGP0050/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verstrepen</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new high-throughput method for single-cell RNA-seq in yeast cells shows how stochastic expression of glucose-repressed genes contributes to cell-to-cell differences during adaptation to an environmental change.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microbes have traditionally been studied on a population level. For example, growth is often measured by the total increase in biomass, and gene expression is analyzed by isolating mRNA from thousands or millions of cells. Even though these methods yield a valuable view on the average behavior of a population, they fail to reveal how each individual microbe contributes to the whole. Therefore, methods to study heterogeneity within a microbial population have been gathering increased interest. Although measuring fluctuations in the total transcriptome of individual cells through scRNA-seq could prove to be of great value in these microbial studies, practical hurdles have so far limited its application in microbiology.</p><p>Most of the current methods to study heterogeneity in microbial populations have used a combination of automated microscopy, fluorescent reporter-fusions, specific mRNA species using in-situ hybridization and fluorometric assays. Together, the use of these techniques revealed that individual, genetically identical microbial cells can show different behaviors, including differences in growth speed, gene expression and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cerulus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerulus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helaine and Holden, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiviet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Munsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">New et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Papagiannakis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raser and O'Shea, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwabe and Bruggeman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takhaveev and Heinemann, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trcek et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Variation in gene expression is often at the base of different single-cell behaviors. Single-cell mRNA quantification methods were first introduced in the early nineties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brady et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eberwine et al., 1992</xref>). More evolved high-throughput methods, in particular scRNA-seq, are now common practice in mammalian cell studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kolodziejczyk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Potter, 2018</xref>). However, practical hurdles have restricted their use in microbiology. For example, the microbial cell wall makes implementing current methods more difficult and labor-intensive because of the need to lyse individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khan and Yadav, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the amount of mRNA in comparison to mammalian cells is much lower, with the total number of mRNA molecules in yeast cells reported to be between 20,000 and 60,000, compared to 50,000 to 300,000 mRNA molecules in a typical mammalian cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">von der Haar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marinov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pelechano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The few existing scRNA-seq studies have employed different methods, most of which being labor-intensive and costly. One important hurdle in many of the existing RNA-seq studies in microbes is the need to isolate single cells prior to further analysis. Traditionally, single cells are isolated one-by-one using manual or laser-based micromanipulation, or through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Furthermore, it is reported that the major bottleneck for detection capacity of scRNA-seq methods is located at the initial reverse transcription step where only a fraction of existing single mRNA molecules is captured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hwang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Islam et al., 2014</xref>). For example, in the first single-cell transcriptome study of eukaryotic microbial cells, five hyphae of <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> were analyzed, and transcripts were only detected for 4% to 7% of the genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Bekker et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, two single-cell gene expression studies on bacteria analyzed between four and six individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). A scRNA-seq study of malaria parasites from the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genus reported analysis of 500 individual parasites with transcripts detected for about one third of the total number of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reid et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, Saint and coworkers used manual micromanipulation to image and isolate ~2000 single <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> cells and analyzed expression of 18% of the coding genes in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saint et al., 2019</xref>). A more recent study that introduced a clever method for strand-specific detection of transcripts in single yeast cells studied 285 single <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> yeast cells grown in rich media, and detected on average 3339 transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nadal-Ribelles et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>More recently, microfluidics-based methods have been developed, and these methods generally yield higher throughput while reducing cost and workload. For example, Fluidigm’s C1 microfluidic protocol was adapted to study the heterogeneity of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> yeast cells in response to osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gasch et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, 163 cells were analyzed in stressed or unstressed conditions, detecting a population-wide median number of gene transcripts of 2213 in unstressed conditions. Currently, 10x Genomics is arguably the most common commercial microfluidics-based method for scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dixit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Here, single cells are trapped in emulsion droplets along with reverse-transcription reagents. Each droplet contains a uniquely labeled primer gel bead, allowing in-droplet barcoding and reverse-transcription of the RNA, before bulk-level sequencing. However, while the method has been optimized for mammalian cells, the protocol cannot be readily applied to yeast cells since the yeast cell wall prevents in-droplet cell lysis.</p><p>In this paper, we describe and validate an adaptation to the 10x Genomics protocol that allows using the technology for scRNA-seq in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We apply the method to study transcriptional heterogeneity in yeast populations that are shifted from glucose to maltose. Our previously published results demonstrated that such a shift leads to a strongly heterogeneous response in the cell population, where the time that individual cells require to adapt to the new carbon source (lag time) varies from five to more than 20 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cerulus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerulus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">New et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, a fraction of cells never resumes growth after the shift to maltose in the observed time window of 24 hr. This pronounced heterogeneity makes the shift from glucose to other carbon sources an excellent example to use scRNA-seq and study if the observed phenotypic heterogeneity is linked to transcriptional heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adapting the 10x genomics scRNA-seq technology for yeast cells</title><p>To investigate the observed heterogeneous phenotypic response in isogenic yeast populations when they transition from glucose to maltose on a transcriptional level, we aimed to adapt the 10x Genomics platform to measure single-cell mRNA concentrations in yeast cells. The 10x Genomics platform is a commercial droplet-based scRNA-seq technology originally developed for mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vickovic et al., 2016</xref>). Since the yeast cell wall impairs the current lysis step in the protocol, this technology cannot be readily applied to yeast cells. We hypothesized that adding a cell wall digestion enzyme into the reverse transcription master-mix might overcome the current problem and enable the required in-droplet lysis of the yeast cells.</p><p>To examine whether the above-mentioned approach could work, we tested whether zymolyase, a cell-wall digestion enzyme, is effective in lysing cells in a temperature regimen similar to that of the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ v2 protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Herein, cells are initially stored on ice, subsequently brought to room temperature for droplet generation (~6 min), and droplets are then incubated at 53°C (45 min) to accommodate cell lysis and reverse transcription. For this experiment, the cells were grown in glucose-rich medium (YPD) to exponential phase, and 100 μL of the culture was washed into an ice-cold zymolyase solution. The cells were kept on ice for 25 min, mimicking the time needed in the protocol for preparation of the reagents and microfluidic plate. The cells were then transferred to room temperature for 6 min, and finally to 53°C, mimicking the lysis and reverse transcription steps. Cell counts were monitored throughout the transition steps using an automated cell counter (Bio-Rad TC20). Cell count remained constant during the incubation on ice, and dropped only slightly during the 6 min ambient temperature incubation. After 20 min of incubation at 53°C, cell counts dropped 200-fold, and even below detection limit after 40 min, suggesting that cells were lysing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We confirmed that the heat shock alone will not result in cell lysis, and that zymolyase is necessary for lysis, by comparing the cell lysis efficacy of zymolyase solution to that of PBS during the transition from 0°C to 53°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Based on these observations, we concluded that the adapted protocol should allow lysing of yeast cells in the micro-droplets, with minimal premature out-of-droplet lysis, suggesting that this adaptation of the protocol may open the 10x Genomics platform to not only yeast cells, but also possibly other cell types that require cell wall lysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Adapting the 10x Genomics’ single-cell RNA-seq platform for yeast cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Zymolyase is required and effective for lysing yeast cells in a temperature treatment regimen similar to the 10x Genomics’ single cell 3’ RNA-seq protocol (see text for details).

Furthermore, a control sample (<italic>mix-glucose-maltose</italic>) consisting of a 50–50% mix of cells actively growing on maltose and cells actively growing on glucose (glucose-12h) was added.

As detailed in the methods section, all samples were processed on the 10x Genomics platform and the generated cDNA libraries were sequenced using the Illumina platform. The number of cells analyzed in the glucose-6h, glucose-12h, lag-1h, lag-3h and mix-glucose-maltose samples was 1695, 1096, 1172, 1469 and 686, respectively (see Materials and methods section for further details), and the per-cell median number of transcripts in each condition was 1261, 894, 528, 607 and 975, respectively. The Seurat package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) was used to filter out cells with excess mitochondrial reads, possible doublets, and to normalize the data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>scRNA-seq quantification reproduces bulk RNA-seq data</title><p>First, we compared data obtained through the single-cell protocol for cells that are exponentially growing on glucose (<italic>glucose-12h</italic>) to bulk RNA-seq data from cultures grown in a similar condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerulus et al., 2018</xref>). Each unique transcript copy in scRNA-seq data is represented by its unique molecular identifier (<italic>UMI</italic>), which is a 10 bp randomer oligo in the reverse transcription primer. UMI’s are widely used in scRNA-seq methods to eliminate quantification inaccuracies due to cDNA amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Islam et al., 2014</xref>). For the purpose of comparing single-cell to bulk data, we summed the UMI count for each gene across the population and log-transformed it after addition of a pseudo-count with a value of 0.1. Expression in bulk RNA-seq was quantified as fragments mapped per kilo-base of gene length and per million reads (<italic>fpkm</italic>). The fpkm values were log-transformed as well after addition of a pseudo count. After this transformation of the data, we observe that expression for 42 genes was detected with scRNA-seq but not by bulk RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), with the majority of these showing a low expression level in the scRNA-seq data. On the other hand, 280 genes were detected only in the bulk RNA-seq. Unlike the first group, expression of these genes reached intermediate to high levels in bulk RNA-seq, while not being detected in scRNA-seq. It is not clear why this set of genes was not detected, as the GC content of these genes is not statistically different from the detected genes (mean %40.6, standard deviation %3.6 vs. mean %40.3, standard deviation %3.5), and they are not enriched for any GO terms.

When cells are shifted from glucose to maltose, the cells enter growth arrest, the so-called lag phase, during which they adapt to the new carbon source before resuming growth. We previously reported that the duration of the lag phase differs greatly between isogenic cells in a well-mixed, homogeneous population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerulus et al., 2018</xref>). While some cells are able to resume growth after about 5 hr, others take more than 20 hr, and a fraction of cells even completely fails to resume growth at all. Cells can thus be divided into two main groups, one capable of resuming growth (albeit after different lag times), and another group with cells that fail to make the switch. Our previous results showed that respiratory proteins and maltose-catabolic proteins (<italic>MAL</italic> genes) are induced in the fraction of cells that resume growth in maltose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerulus et al., 2018</xref>). However, the molecular source of the heterogeneity remains unclear. For example, no correlation was found between either the replicative age of the cells, nor the level of specific catabolic proteins and the cells’ fate in lag phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerulus et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Population transcriptome structure during maltose-glucose-maltose shift</title><p>As the lag phase is a transition phase between two steady states of continuous growth on glucose and continuous growth on maltose, dynamics of this transition can be demonstrated using the UMAP projection of the sampled transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows this projection for the samples glucose-12h, lag-1h, and lag-3h, which are separated in the UMAP space. Similarly, the dynamics of the complete consecutive maltose-glucose-maltose shift is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>. As expected, cells growing on maltose (extracted from the mixed sample) are clearly separated from both cells growing on glucose as well as cells in the lag phase. The transcriptome of the cells from the glucose-6h and glucose-12h samples shows some overlap in the UMAP projection, whereas the transcriptome during the lag phase appears to be distinctly different from these continuous growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, in the lag-3h sample, the cells appear to be grouped into two sub-populations. Based on cell count measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we know that the cells have not yet resumed growth in this condition, hence such presence of population structure might correspond to two distinct groups of cells that eventually will or will not resume growth.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Progression of single-cell transcriptomes during the lag phase and validation of the identified differentially expressed genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Samples for scRNA-seq were collected separately at the end of glucose growth and during the lag phase after the glucose-maltose shift.

The four clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> represent (I) cells from lag-1h sample (cluster 1), (II) cells from glucose-12h sample (cluster 2), and, importantly, two distinct subgroups of cells in the lag-3h sample (clusters 3 and 4).</p><p>The genes showing differential expression between the two clusters in the lag-3h sample, that is clusters 3 and 4, were identified using the <italic>FindMarkers</italic> function of the Seurat package. A threshold of 0.05 for false discovery rate and a minimum of 0.25 log2-fold-change difference was used. This analysis identified 628 genes that are overexpressed in cluster four relative to cluster 3; and 374 genes that are overexpressed in cluster three relative to cluster 4 (List provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The corresponding GO terms were extracted from GOrilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eden et al., 2009</xref>) and are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. Cluster 3 is enriched for GO terms such as translation and peptide biosynthetic process. From the 374 genes in this cluster, 116 correspond to ribosomal proteins. It is known that glucose starvation leads to translation halt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashe et al., 2000</xref>), and that translation is downregulated during the lag phase in glucose-maltose shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerulus et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, such higher expression of ribosomal proteins does not necessarily indicate higher protein synthesis in cluster 3, as the cells might not have the energetic requirements for protein synthesis (see further). Instead, it is possible that the elevated expression of ribosomal genes reflects the inability of the cells to react properly to the sudden limitation in glucose availability and shut down protein synthesis. Strikingly, in addition to the ribosomal genes, the low-affinity glucose transporter gene <italic>HXT3</italic> is overexpressed in cluster 3.</p><p>Cluster 4 is enriched for GO terms such as oxidation-reduction process, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds, energy coupled proton transport down electrochemical gradient, and ATP synthesis coupled proton transport. Overexpression of several genes of the electron transport chain complexes agrees with previous observations that activation of respiration is a crucial early step in escaping the lag phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerulus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perez-Samper et al., 2018</xref>) and suggests that the sub-population of cells that shows activation of these genes may eventually escape the lag phase and resume growth on maltose. Beside these respiratory genes, several stress response genes such as <italic>SSA1</italic> (adjusted p-value&lt;10<sup>−50</sup>) and <italic>HSP12</italic> (adjusted p-value&lt;10<sup>−238</sup>), alongside high-affinity hexose transporters <italic>HXT2</italic> (p-value&lt;10<sup>−138</sup>) and <italic>HXT7</italic> (p-value&lt;10<sup>−240</sup>) are among the overexpressed genes in cluster 4 relative to cluster 3.</p><p>These two clusters comprise genes with opposite induction trends during lag phase. Based on this, we hypothesized that clusters 3 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> correspond to non-growing and growing cells in lag phase, respectively. Moreover, the cells in cluster four show the transcriptional response that would be expected of cells shortly after a switch from glucose to an alternative sugar, such as the induction of genes responsible for ATP production, suggesting that only cells that are able to generate ATP can eventually escape the lag phase (see also further). Pseudo-temporal ordering of the cells in the process of lag phase yields a similar conclusion with regard to the dynamics of gene induction in lag phase, as does analyzing the branch dependent expression of the genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The <italic>branched expression analysis modeling</italic> functionality of the Monocle package was used to find genes that are regulated in a branch-dependent manner. The two branches here correspond to the cells that will or will not resume growth in lag phase. Cluster eight in this figure shows activation of respiratory genes in one of the two branches, and interestingly clusters 2, 3, and 4, which almost exclusively contain ribosomal genes, show stronger deactivation in the branch that activates respiratory genes. This apparent decreasing level of ribosomal genes is not an artifact of normalization due to changes in total transcript levels, since the total UMI counts of these genes actually decreases during lag phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Single-cell protein measurements confirm scRNA-seq findings</title><p>To test whether the identified differentially expressed genes in the two sub-populations of the lag-3h sample (cluster 3 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), are indicative of whether or not cells will resume growth in lag phase, we analyzed the expression of a subset of these proteins by fusing the respective genes with a sequence encoding the fluorescent reporter yECitrine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Specifically, we analyzed a subset of proteins whose expression is upregulated in cluster four relative to cluster 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>): Qcr7, a subunit of complex III of the electron transport chain, Ssa1 and Hsp12, two stress response proteins, and two high-affinity hexose transporters (Hxt2 and Hxt7). In addition, we tested two low-affinity hexose transporters, Hxt1 and Hxt3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yin et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>HXT3</italic> is upregulated in cluster 3, while <italic>HXT1</italic> is not differentially expressed.</p><p>Single-cell time-lapse microscopy confirmed that <italic>QCR7</italic>, <italic>SSA1</italic> and <italic>HSP12</italic> indeed show differential expression during the lag phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In general, cells showing higher expression during the first hours of the lag phase further increase the expression of these genes and eventually escape the lag phase, whereas cells showing lower initial expression are mostly unable to resume growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As <italic>QCR7</italic> is linked to respiration, the increased activation of this gene confirms previous findings that activation of respiration is vital for efficient escape from the lag phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerulus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perez-Samper et al., 2018</xref>). The role of higher expression of <italic>HSP12</italic> and <italic>SSA1</italic> is less clear. However, both genes are known to be repressed by glucose, and their induction may simply reflect relief of glucose repression in cells that eventually escape the lag phase.

We retrieved the transcription factors regulating genes in cluster 1 from Yeastract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costanzo et al., 2014</xref>) using default settings. Interestingly, either the Msn2 or Msn4 transcription factors regulate 91 out of 151 members of this cluster. Both transcription factors are shown to play a key role in stochastic gene expression via stochastic nuclear localization, and play a role in survival during environmental shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hao and O'Shea, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raser and O'Shea, 2004</xref>). This suggests that the members of cluster 1 show a variable and stochastic expression pattern. Cells that express these genes might have an advantage in certain environmental challenges, possibly including a transition to another carbon source, as was the case in our experiment. These data agree with our previous results showing how activation of the TCA cycle and respiration is vital for an efficient transition from glucose to other carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerulus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perez-Samper et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>A group of genes stochastically co-expressed during glucose growth, are co-induced in cells resuming growth after a carbon source shift</title><p>We carried out a similar co-expression analysis for the samples lag-3h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and lag-1h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

However, these genes are not induced during lag phase; instead, their transcript count appears to be decreasing during the lag (right-most column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Such absence of ribosomal gene transcription agrees with the growth halt during lag phase. Considered together with the previously discussed cell cycle-dependent expression bursts of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), it appears that the correlation between expression levels of these genes reflects the cell-cycle stage at which the cells entered the lag phase.</p><p>A closer look at the clusters of co-expressed genes in 3h-lag phase sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) reveals that cluster 2 contains genes that are induced after the glucose-to-maltose shift. This might suggest that induction and co-expression of these genes occurs in the cells that resume growth in lag phase. Therefore, we compared these genes to the previously identified overexpressed genes in the cells that will resume growth in the lag-3h sample (cluster four in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This comparison reveals that 481 out of the 627 genes that are overexpressed in the subpopulation that will resume growth (cluster four in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), are among the 906 genes in cluster 2 of co-expressed genes in the lag-3h sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, 63 out of the 151 genes in cluster 1 of stochastically (co-)expressed genes in the glucose-12h sample (cluster one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) are also present among the 627 genes overexpressed in the cells that resume growth (cluster four in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These observations suggest that a group of genes that are repressed during glucose growth, but show stochastic leaky expression, are relieved from repression in a subpopulation of cells that resumes growth after the glucose-to-maltose shift. Furthermore, in line with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerulus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perez-Samper et al., 2018</xref>), these genes play a role in processes such as stress response or respiration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Genealogically related cells show more similar behavior</title><p>The previous observations suggest that cells growing in glucose show heterogeneous expression of certain genes, and that these differences may affect their ability to resume growth when the carbon source is switched. If this is the case, genealogically related cells, for example a daughter cell that recently budded off a mother cell, might show a similar lag duration, since such cells share a similar chromatin state or a similar concentration of a certain protein or other stochastically fluctuating factor. To test whether the fate of cells upon transfer to maltose is purely stochastic or not, we compared the lag times of genealogical lineages of cells in the population (i.e. different groups of cells that are linked to the same single mother cell) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B,C</xref>). Cells were grown in glucose for 8 hr, after which single cells were trapped in a CellAsic microfluidics chamber and were grown in glucose medium inside the chamber for 1 more hour before the medium was shifted to maltose. During the growth on glucose, the trapped single cells divide and form micro-colonies of two to four cells (i.e. one to two cell divisions). If the outcome of the shift is purely stochastic, the lag time of closely related cells within the same micro-colony should not be more similar to each other compared to the rest of the cells. However, we see that the difference in lag times between closely related cells is significantly smaller (Wilcoxon test p-value&lt;8.68*10<sup>−13</sup>) than the mean pair-wise difference across the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that genealogically related cells share factors that are stable for at least a few hours, and that the fate of the cell after transfer to maltose is affected by these factors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Lag phase is heterogeneous, yet not purely stochastic.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histogram of single-cell lag times.

When cells are shifted from glucose to maltose, glucose flux stops and cells can therefore not generate ATP, until they activate maltose import and/or use other ways of generating energy, for example through breakdown of storage carbohydrates. However, it seems plausible that at the moment of the shift, ATP levels could drop below a critical level, leaving the cells unable to adapt to the new conditions, especially if they are unable to restore ATP levels, for example by uptake of trace amounts of glucose and/or activation of the more efficient respiratory metabolism. We therefore measured the level of ATP in live single-cells during glucose-to-maltose shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We used a genomically integrated cassette of <italic>ATeam</italic>, a FRET-based sensor for ATP measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Papagiannakis et al., 2017</xref>). As hypothesized, we observed a sharp drop in ATP levels shortly after the shift to maltose, which coincides with the growth arrest. Most of the cells restore normal intracellular ATP levels within 6 hr after the shift to maltose. Remarkably, only cells that eventually resume growth manage to restore and maintain normal ATP levels during the lag phase, while in cells that fail to resume growth, the ATP level does not recover completely, or quickly drops again after a temporary increase.</p><p>Together, these results show that the quick halt in growth after the shift to maltose coincides with a sharp drop in ATP levels and only cells that can regenerate ATP in a sustainable manner are able to resume growth in maltose. Importantly, however, we did not observe differences in internal ATP content between the cells just prior to the shift. This suggests that, while the maintenance and restoration of the ATP content is linked to an efficient escape from the lag phase, it is likely not the primary driver of heterogeneity between cells. Instead, the stochastic differences in the expression of genes linked to glucose transport, stress resistance and/or respiration are likely the true drivers of the observed phenotypic differences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Given the diversity among individual cells within microbial populations, a high-throughput scRNA-seq method can help to better understand how microbial populations function, both in nature as well as in industrial settings. One of the most widely used methods for scRNA-seq is the 10x Genomics platform. Here, we show how adapting the 10x Genomics protocol to accommodate zymolyase treatment for in-droplet spheroplasting and lysis of cells makes it possible to measure mRNA levels in individual <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells. Our results demonstrate that this novel method corresponds well with previously published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gasch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jackson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nadal-Ribelles et al., 2019</xref>) in its ability to detect expression heterogeneity. Interestingly, our protocol is similar to another, recently published protocol that also uses the 10x Genomics platform for scRNA-seq in budding yeast, albeit with a separate zymolyase treatment step prior to the droplet generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jackson et al., 2020</xref>). Both methods seem to generate roughly similar output quality, albeit lower than previously reported methods (median number of detected genes per cell are 35–50% of the numbers obtained by Gasch et al. and Nadal-Ribelles et al.). The lower mRNA capture efficiency of these droplet-based methods compared to microwell-based methods and Fluidigm’s C1 is consistent with findings in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ziegenhain et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, the number of analyzed cells versus the mRNA capture efficiency in the different methods seems to be a trade-off. Microwell-based methods typically allow higher mRNA capture efficiencies and thus a better view on the transcriptome at the cost of a lower total number of cells, limiting the analysis of rare phenotypes (such as for example persister cells), and, in theory, an increased risk of undesirable batch effects. Moreover, the ability to increase sample size in droplet-based methods allows the library preparation cost to be greatly reduced to $0.3/cell compared to previously reported costs of $4.15/cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nadal-Ribelles et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, our protocol only obtained a sequencing saturation of 70–80% compared to 90% or more for the previously mentioned methods. For our purpose and biological research question, this yielded sufficient information to reveal physiological differences between cells. That said, with deeper sequencing, the mRNA capture efficiency could still be increased. Moreover, it should be noted that the newer chemistry (v3) of the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent kit has a higher mRNA yield compared to v2 chemistry which is used in our study. Based on the datasets available on the 10x Genomics website which are tested with both chemistries, v3 chemistry yields approximately twice as many UMI’s compared to v2 chemistry.</p><p>We used the modified 10x Genomics protocol to characterize the dynamics of a yeast population during a shift between carbon sources. The expression correlation analysis of the cells during continuous glucose growth revealed a set of co-expressed genes with low mean expression level that are heterogeneously expressed across the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> – cluster 1). This gene set includes genes known to be repressed during exponential growth in glucose, such as several stress response genes, a high-affinity hexose transporter (<italic>HXT7</italic>) and a key respiratory gene (<italic>CIT1</italic>). Functional analysis of these genes might lead to pinpointing the underlying mechanisms of extrinsic noise in expression of these genes. Similar patterns of heterogeneous expression of stress-responsive genes have been attributed to stochastic pulses of nuclear localization of Msn2/4 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petrenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stewart-Ornstein et al., 2013</xref>). We indeed see that 91 out of these 151 stochastically co-expressed genes are regulated by Msn2/4. Interestingly, a high proportion of the genes that show noisy leaky expression in glucose (63 out of 151) are among the genes that show quick induction after transfer from glucose to maltose in cells that will eventually resume growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> – cluster 4), suggesting that these stochastically expressed genes might play an important role during lag phase.</p><p>Our experiments demonstrate how some cells show stochastic variation in glucose repression, with some cells showing the typical pattern of repression of stress genes and genes involved in respiration, whereas others show somewhat higher transcription of these genes. It is tempting to speculate that these cells might therefore more easily survive in the face of sudden environmental challenges, such as a shift to a less favorable carbon source, since they can quickly induce the necessary genes for survival in the new environment. These new data further support our previous findings that showed how activation of the TCA cycle and respiration is vital for an efficient transition from glucose to other carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerulus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perez-Samper et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore , a recent study links specific cellular processes, including hexose transport and mitochondrial function to a bet-hedging strategy whereby some yeast cells in a population grown on glucose tend to prefer fermentation while others opt for respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagamery et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>More broadly, our results demonstrate how stochastic variation in gene expression can have important phenotypic consequences, similar to a few other examples where, for example, similar stochastic variation in gene expression determines the phenotypic consequences of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burga et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casanueva et al., 2012</xref>). As a next step, it would be interesting to further characterize the possible fitness costs and benefits of this stochastic variation in stable and fluctuating environments, and investigate to what extent this variation may in fact be a bet-hedging strategy.</p><p>The scRNA-seq method presented here is widely accessible to yeast researchers and is both less labor-intensive and less costly compared to the currently available methods. We used this method to demonstrate the dynamics of adaptation of a microbial population to a new environment. We confirmed that genes that show heterogeneous expression in the scRNA-seq data (<italic>QCR7</italic>, <italic>SSA1</italic> and <italic>HSP12</italic>), indeed show heterogeneous expression in the population, and that this is linked to the ability of cells to subsequently escape the lag phase and resume cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>BY4742</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9483801">9483801</ext-link></td><td/><td valign="top">S288c MATalpha; <italic>his3</italic>Δ1 <italic>leu2</italic>Δ0 <italic>lys2</italic>Δ0 <italic>ura3</italic>Δ0</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">KV1156</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20471265">20471265</ext-link></td><td/><td valign="top">BY4742 <italic>MAL13</italic>:: HygR-<italic>MAL63</italic>_c9</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AN62</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24453942">24453942</ext-link></td><td/><td valign="top">KV1156 <italic>SAL1</italic>+</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AN63</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24453942">24453942</ext-link></td><td/><td valign="top">AN62 MATa</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AJ78</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td/><td>AN63 TEFp-ATeam1.03-KanMX inserted in YRO2 intergenic locus</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BC73</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td/><td valign="top">AN63 <italic>HXT1</italic>-yECitrine</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BC74</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td/><td valign="top">AN63 <italic>HXT2</italic>-yECitrine</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BC75</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td/><td valign="top">AN63 <italic>HXT3</italic>-yECitrine</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BC79</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td/><td valign="top">AN63 <italic>HXT7</italic>-yECitrine</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MC1</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td/><td valign="top">AN63 <italic>HSP12</italic>-yECitrine</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MC8</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td/><td valign="top">AN63 <italic>SSA1</italic>-yECitrine</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MC23</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td/><td valign="top">AN63 <italic>QCR7</italic>-yECitrine</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pKT140</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_8732">Addgene_8732</ext-link></td><td/><td>KanMX-yECitrine plasmid</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pTEF:ATP</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_92179">Addgene_92179</ext-link></td><td/><td>TEF1p-ATeam1.03-KanMX4 plasmid</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth media used</title><p>The wild-type strain used in this study is AN63, which is derived from BY4742 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brachmann et al., 1998</xref>) by making it maltose-prototrophic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2010</xref>), reducing its high-petite frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dimitrov et al., 2009</xref>) and finally switching its mating type to MATa.

The cell cultures were subsequently thawed on ice and resuspended into ice-cold PBS to reach the desired cell count, according to the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3’ protocol. The same steps were followed as detailed in the protocol, with the exception of the reverse-transcription master-mix, where 1 μL of water was replaced with 1 μL of 100x zymolyase solution. The prepared libraries were sequenced on one run of Illumina NextSeq and two lanes of Illumina HiSeq 3000. The 10x Genomics’ Cell Ranger pipeline with <italic>mkfastq</italic> option was used to convert the BCL files generated by the Illumina sequencer into fastq files. Cell Ranger with <italic>count</italic> option was used to map and filter the reads and carry out UMI counting. For each sample, the two fastq files from the reads generated by NextSeq and HiSeq sequencers were introduced as arguments to the <italic>count</italic> command. The <italic>expected number of cells</italic> option for the count command was set to the expected value, according to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. 17.4 µL of cells were loaded. This volume and the cell counts were chosen based on a target of 1000 cells for the mix-glucose-maltose condition and 2000 cells for the rest of the samples, according to the manual of single-cell 3’ kit. The reference genome of S288c was modified to include MAL63, a functional MAL activator, which we introduced in the used strain. In the analyses where samples were aggregated, the <italic>aggr</italic> option of Cell Ranger was used without any aggregation normalization of total UMI’s per cell. We did not use normalization of total UMI’s since we know from previous experiments that the RNA content of the cells drops during lag phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerulus et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The thresholds for filtering out cells with excess mitochondrial reads and possible doublets were determined by inspecting the violin plots of distribution values, using <italic>VlnPlot</italic> function of the Seurat package. The threshold for the maximum total number of genes detected was set to 2000 for glucose-6h, glucose-12h and mix-glucose-maltose samples, and set to 1500 for lag-1h and lag-3h samples. The threshold for the maximum percentage of mitochondrial reads was set to 0.2 for glucose-6h, glucose-12h and mix-glucose-maltose samples, set to 0.5 for the lag-1h sample, and set to 1.5 for the lag-3h sample.</p><p>The sequencing saturations for glucose-6h, glucose-12h, lag1h, lag3h, and mix-glucose-maltose samples are respectively 71%, 75%, 85%, 89%, and 82%.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the VIB Nucleomics Core (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nucleomics.be/">http://www.nucleomics.be/</ext-link>) for sequencing of the cDNA libraries.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As an aside: The agreement was that &quot;10x Genomics&quot; was not necessary for the title. &quot;Single-cell RNA-seq reveals stochastic gene expression during lag phase in budding yeast&quot; would work as well.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes a study in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> addressing the response to a carbon source shift (glucose to maltose). The authors show that the 10x Genomics platform can be adapted for yeast, allowing the measurement of single-cell transcriptomes during this adaptation response. The technical advance of this manuscript is that this method would allow for a considerable scale-up (to 1500 cells) relative to previously 96 well plate methods and a reduction in cost for library preparation per cell (from $4.15 to $1.00, or even $0.30 if scaled up to 5,000 cells), which will open up new areas of research for yeast biologists. Application of this method to a carbon source shift provides support for a model in which growth resumption is correlated with a specific mRNA signature characteristic of a subpopulation of cells early during the response. The paper provides novel insights into an interesting aspect of yeast biology (lag phase) by combining multiple approaches (e.g. microfluids, microscopy) and primarily by developing a single cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As it is written, the paper is a mixture of a method and a research story. Given the novelty of the scRNA sequencing technique and that the manuscript type is &quot;Tools and resources&quot;, the authors should revise the manuscript such that the work is presented from the method angle and that the carbon source shift experiment is an example application of the utility of the novel method. For example:</p><p>1a) Seems strange that the method is presented only in the third paragraph of the Results section.</p><p>1b) The actual need to scale up beyond the 100 cell level for most yeast studies is unclear and unjustified in the manuscript.

Given the novelty of the scRNA sequencing technique and that the manuscript type is &quot;Tools and resources&quot;, the authors should revise the manuscript such that the work is presented from the method angle and that the carbon source shift experiment is an example application of the utility of the novel method. For example:</p><p>1a) Seems strange that the method is presented only in the third paragraph of the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed; We have extensively rewritten and re-arranged the manuscript so that we approach it from the method angle, using the carbon source shift experiment more as an example.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1b) The actual need to scale up beyond the 100 cell level for most yeast studies is unclear and unjustified in the manuscript.

Using methods with higher capture efficiency generally comes at the cost of low number of analyzed cells. Moreover, we only achieved a sequencing saturation of 70-80%, so deeper sequencing could also still increase the capture efficiency; and the newly introduced chemistry for the 10X platform probably also helps.</p><p>We have added a brief discussion about these points in the Discussion section (first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is a very recent paper developing a similar scRNA- seq: Jackson et al., 2020, that analysed a much larger number of sc (38K).

The major difference between the two methods comes down to spheroplasting before loading the cells into the 10X device vs. immediate cell lysis in the droplets. We believe that our protocol with in-droplet cell lysis further simplifies the protocol. This recent paper indeed analyzed a much larger number of cells, but the number of single-cells analyzed can be decided upon by the user (calculations via the Cell Suspension Volume Calculator Table in the manual of the 10X system), depending on, among other things, sequencing cost and number of cells needed for biologically relevant conclusions. It is worth noting that the median number of detected genes is quite comparable between the two methods, and this would likely also depend on the specific conditions of the experiment, which determines how many genes are expressed. Furthermore, the much larger number of single-cells mentioned is actually the sum over 11 different conditions, accounting to around 3500 cells per sample, which is only about 1.5-2 times more than what we aimed for in our experiment.</p><p>We have included a short discussion on the comparison between the two methods in the manuscript (Discussion, first paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
