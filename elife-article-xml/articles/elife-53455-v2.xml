(Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> -&gt; Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> -&gt; Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>) facilitates endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of misfolded glycoproteins (gpERAD). Our gene knockout experiments in human HCT116 cells have revealed that EDEM2 is required for the first step. However, it was previously shown that purified EDEM2 exhibited no α1,2-mannosidase activity toward Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> in vitro. Here, we found that EDEM2 was stably disulfide-bonded to TXNDC11, an endoplasmic reticulum protein containing five thioredoxin (Trx)-like domains. C558 present outside of the mannosidase homology domain of EDEM2 was linked to C692 in Trx5, which solely contains the CXXC motif in TXNDC11. This covalent bonding was essential for mannose trimming and subsequent gpERAD in HCT116 cells. Furthermore, EDEM2-TXNDC11 complex purified from transfected HCT116 cells converted Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> to Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>(isomerB) in vitro. Our results establish the role of EDEM2 as an initiator of gpERAD, and represent the first clear demonstration of in vitro mannosidase activity of EDEM family proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>protein degradation</kwd><kwd>protein misfolding</kwd><kwd>glycoprotein</kwd><kwd>mannose trimming</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18K06216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ninagawa</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H06414</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yagi</surname><given-names>Hirokazu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19K06658</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ishikawa</surname><given-names>Tokiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18K06110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okada</surname><given-names>Tetsuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H01432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mori</surname><given-names>Kazutoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H06419</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mori</surname><given-names>Kazutoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>EDEM2 containing mannosidase homology domain functions as an initiator of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of misfolded glycoproteins by conversion of Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> to Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, only when complexed with TXNDC11 containing thioredoxin-like domains.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Failure in protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) detrimentally affects the maturation of secretory and transmembrane proteins, which comprise one-third of total proteins synthesized in mammalian cells. As misfolded proteins are not only unable to fulfill the functions assigned them by genetic code but may also exert proteotoxicity by making inappropriate interactions with other functional proteins, protein misfolding constitutes a fundamental threat to all living cells. Proteins misfolded in the lumen of the ER are recognized, delivered to and translocated through the multi-protein complex termed the retrotranslocon in the ER membrane, ubiquitinated, and degraded by the proteasome in the cytosol, a series of events collectively termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD), and specifically termed ERAD-L (L for lumen). Mammalian ERAD-L deals with the degradation of both non-glycoproteins (non-gpERAD) and glycoproteins (gpERAD), in which the carbohydrate unit Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is covalently attached to the asparagine residue present in the triplet code (Asn-X-Ser/Thr; X: any amino acid except Pro) for N-glycosylation. ERAD-L is further categorized into ERAD-Ls (for soluble proteins) and ERAD-Lm (for membrane proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brodsky, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Xie and Ng, 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of mutation of various cysteine residues in EDEM2 on gpERAD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> is schematically shown.

We have conducted genetic (knockout) analyses of four α1,2-mannosidase candidate genes able to trim mannose residues in the ER, namely ER mannosidase I (ERmanI), EDEM1, EDEM2 and EDEM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>), using both conventional homologous recombination in chicken DT40 cells and transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated genome editing in human HCT116 diploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Roschke et al., 2002</xref>). Results clearly showed that EDEM2 is required for conversion of Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> (M9 hereafter) to Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> (M8B hereafter; note that only the outermost mannose of the B branch is removed); and that EDEM3 and EDEM1 are required for conversion of M8B to Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> (M7A hereafter; note that only the A branch has the outermost mannose), Man<sub>6</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> and Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>. These oligosaccharides are then recognized by specific lectin molecules such as OS9 and XTP3B for delivery to the retrotranslocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">van der Goot et al., 2018</xref>), because the α1,6-mannose linkage becomes exposed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). ERmanI appears to trim the outermost mannose of the B branch randomly regardless of the number of mannose residues rather than specifically convert M9 to M8B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, given previous findings that His-tagged EDEM2 purified or HA-tagged EDEM2 immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK293 cells exhibited little or no mannosidase activity toward pyridylamine (PA)-tagged M9 or PA-tagged M8 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Mast et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Shenkman et al., 2018</xref>), EDEM2’s α1,2-mannosidase activity remains to be demonstrated in vitro. Interestingly, Htm1p, a yeast homolog of mammalian EDEM1/2/3, is physically and stably associated with Pdi1p (protein disulfide isomerase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Clerc et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sakoh-Nakatogawa et al., 2009</xref>). By forming an intermolecular disulfide bond with Cys579 or Cys644 of Htm1p (shown in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), Pdi1p facilitates intramolecular disulfide bond formation between Cys65 and Cys445 of Htm1p (shown in blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which is critical for Htm1p to function in gpERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sakoh-Nakatogawa et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, Htm1p-Pdi1p complex purified from insect cells, in which glutathione S-transferase-Htm1p fusion protein and His-tagged Pdi1p are simultaneously expressed, converted approximately 10% of M8 to M7 in vitro, only when M8 is attached to unfolded, reduced and alkylated polypeptides; in contrast, Htm1p-Pdi1p complex was nearly inactive against free M8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Gauss et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, by analogy, EDEM2 may require a PDI-like partner protein to exhibit its mannosidase activity.</p><p>Recently, comprehensive genetic analyses were conducted in human haploid cells by way of conventional gene-trap mutagenesis or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout to identify genes involved in ERAD of a glycoprotein termed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Timms et al., 2016</xref>). Both approaches identified EDEM2 and TXNDC11, a type II transmembrane protein containing five thioredoxin (Trx)-like domains (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). TXNDC11 was shown to be N-glycosylated, localized in the ER and required for gpERAD of various substrates, including CD3δ, TCRα and NHK (null Hong Kong variant of α1-proteinase inhibitor) in addition to MHC class I, but not for NHK-QQQ, a non-glycosylated version of NHK. TXNDC11 in the gpERAD assay was inactivated by the double mutation of Cys692 and Cys695 in the CxxC motif of the Trx5 domain, but not by the mutation of Cys137 in the CxxS motif of the Trx1 domain. The Trx5 domain expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> cells exhibited reductase activity in vitro. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometric analysis revealed that TXNDC11 bound to PDI, EDEM2, GANAB, EDEM3, GLU2B and TXNDC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Timms et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Disulfide bond formation between EDEM2 and TXNDC11.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell lysates were prepared from WT and EDEM2-KO cells, subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions, and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-EDEM2 (<bold>a</bold>), anti-PDI (<bold>b</bold>) and anti-TXNDC11 (<bold>c</bold>) antibodies. § denotes high molecular weight forms of EDEM2 and TXNDC11.

We mutated each cysteine residue of EDEM2 to alanine and examined the resulting effect on degradation of the ERAD-Ls substrate mCD3-δ-ΔTM-HA containing three N-glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernasconi et al., 2010</xref>). mCD3-δ-ΔTM-HA migrated more slowly in EDEM2-KO cells than in WT cells due to the absence of the first mannose trimming activity (M9 -&gt; M8B) in EDEM2-KO cells; as expected, this migration difference was lost after treatment with endoglycosidase H (EndoH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Introduction of 3x Flag-tagged WT EDEM2 into EDEM2-KO cells restored the mannose trimming activity, but introduction of three of the eight cysteine mutants (C65A, C408A and C558A) did not do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), similarly to the catalytically inactive E117Q mutant of EDEM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>). Cycloheximide chase experiments showed that mCD3-δ-ΔTM-HA was rapidly degraded in WT cells but not in EDEM2-KO cells. Introduction of WT EDEM2 but not the three cysteine mutants into EDEM2-KO cells restored this degradation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>We noticed that EDEM2 was detected as both monomer and high molecular weight forms (a doublet band) when analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Aa</xref>).

To determine which cysteine residue of EDEM2 is involved in the presumed covalent association with TXNDC11, immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag antibody was carried out in EDEM2-KO cells into which 3x Flag-tagged WT EDEM2 or one of the three cysteine mutants had been transfected. Results showed that endogenous TXNDC11 was co-immunoprecipitated with WT, C65A and C408A but not with C558A EDEM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, Reducing). In contrast, endogenous PDI was co-immunoprecipitated with all four EDEM2, whereas endogenous ERp72 was not co-immunoprecipitated with any of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, Reducing). When analyzed under non-reducing conditions, high molecular weight forms of TXNDC11 disappeared in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing C558A EDEM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, Non-reducing).

We found that EDEM2 was stably disulfide-bonded to TXNDC11 through C558 of EDEM2 and C692 of TXNDC11. This stable linkage is essential for EDEM2 to convert M9 to M8B in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Accordingly, mannose trimming activity was lost and degradation of the ERAD-Ls substrate mCD3-δ-ΔTM-HA was delayed in EDEM2-KO cells expressing the C558A mutant of EDEM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and in TXNDC11-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and TXNDC11-KO cells expressing the C692S mutant of TXNDC11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Immunoblotting showed that a majority of TXNDC11 is disulfide-bonded to EDEM2 in WT cells, which alters conformation of EDEM2 to perhaps a better structure for the expression of mannosidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Among the three cysteine residues (C65, C408 and C558) of EDEM2 required for mannose trimming activity and degradation of mCD3-δ-ΔTM-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), C65A and C408A are present in the mannosidase homology domain and likely to be disulfide-bonded intramolecularly, similarly to C65 and C445 in yeast Htm1p, as the disulfide bonding between C65 and C445 is required for the mannosidase activity of Htm1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sakoh-Nakatogawa et al., 2009</xref>). Because EDEM2 associates with PDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), disulfide bonding between C65 and C408 is likely to be catalyzed by PDI.</p><p>C65 and C408 of EDEM2 are conserved as C83 and C442 of EDEM3. Interestingly, it was recently shown that these cysteine residues in EDEM3 are disulfide-bonded to the CXXC motif in ERp46 containing three Trx domains to form a high molecular weight complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Yu et al., 2018</xref>); ERp46 is an oxidoreductase and an efficient disulfide bond introducer in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kojima et al., 2014</xref>). This covalent bonding is perhaps transient prior to the formation of disulfide bonding between C83 and C442 of EDEM3, which is required for its mannosidase activity, because either C83S mutation or C442S mutation eliminates such high molecular weight complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, although coexpression of EDEM3 and ERp46 appeared to enhance EDEM3 activity in gpERAD assay, it has not yet been shown that ERp46 is required for the mannosidase activity of EDEM3 in vivo and in vitro.</p><p>In marked contrast, EDEM2 is stably disulfide-bonded to TXNDC11 through C558 outside of the mannosidase homology domain, and only one cysteine residue of the CXXC motif (C692) of TXNDC11 is used for such covalent bonding.

These researchers appeared to transfect HEK293 cells with HA-tagged EDEM2 cDNA (described as EDEM2-HA) and full-length TXNDC11 cDNA tagged with Flag at the N-terminus (described as Flag-TXNDC11). Accordingly, translation was initiated from the methionine located immediately upstream of the Flag tag, resulting in detection of TXNDC11 as a single band, namely as a transmembrane protein, similar to the M58A mutant protein. Therefore, they might not have been able to obtain sufficient EDEM2-TXNDC11 complex in supernatant after lysis. In contrast, we transfected HCT116 cells with TXNDC11(M1A) cDNA tagged with Flag at the C-terminus, which can produce a soluble protein, and TAP-EDEM2 cDNA, and were able to extract sufficient EDEM2-TXNDC11 complex after lysis for subsequent purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our results represent the first clear demonstration of in vitro mannosidase activity of EDEM family proteins toward free oligosaccharides, an effect which is much clearer than in the case of yeast Htm1p.</p><p>In conclusion, the notion that EDEM2 catalyzes the first mannose trimming step and thereby initiates gpERAD is now firmly supported by our genetic and biochemical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>or resources</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifier</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">colorectal carcinoma</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">HCT116</td><td valign="top">Parental HCT116 cell line <break/>have been authenticated and <break/>all cell lines have been tested <break/>negative for mycoplasma. <break/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">p3xFlag-CMV-14</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pcDNA3.1-MycHis</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-TXNDC11 <break/>(Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat#: ab188329</td><td valign="top">WB (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-EDEM2 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Novusbio</td><td valign="top">Cat#: NBP2-37921</td><td valign="top">WB (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-HA (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Recenttec</td><td valign="top">Cat#: R4-TP1411100</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-calnexin (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Enzo Life Sciences</td><td valign="top">Cat#: ADI-SPA-865</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-PDI (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Enzo Life Sciences</td><td valign="top">Cat#: ADI-SPA-890</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-ERp72 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Enzo Life Sciences</td><td valign="top">Cat#: ADI-SPA-720</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-calreticulin (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Enzo Life Sciences</td><td valign="top">Cat#: ADI-SPA-600</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Flag (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat#: F3165</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000) IP (2.5 μl)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-β-actin (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Wako</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 017–24573</td><td valign="top">WB (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-human ATF6α (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Haze et al., 1999</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis was conducted using Student's t-test, with probability expressed as *p&lt;0.05 and **p&lt;0.01 for all figures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Construction of plasmids</title><p>Recombinant DNA techniques were performed according to standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sambrook et al., 1989</xref>) and the integrity of all constructed plasmids was confirmed by extensive sequencing analyses.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>As a crucial part of quality control in the ER it has been believed that Man9 to Man8B conversion on N-glycans is carried out by the action of &quot;ER α-mannosidase&quot; i.e. Man1B1. The authors, on the other hand, previously showed, using various gene-KO cell lines, that it is actually most likely EDEM2 that is responsible. There are, however, conflicting reports and especially the evidence for the in vitro activity of EDEM2 has so far been lacking.</p><p>In this study, the authors convincingly showed that (1) EDEM2 form a complex with TXNDC11 through C558 of EDEM2 and C692 of TXNDC11; (2) the interaction is important for the α-mannosidase activity of EDEM2, and (3) the purified EDEM2-TXNDC11 complex can exert Man9-to-Man8B conversion activity in vitro.</p><p>While the interaction of EDEM2 and TXNDC11 had been demonstrated, its biological significance was unclear. Overall, this study makes a big step forward in our understanding of the molecular mechanism of glycoprotein ERAD. The experiments are carefully designed, analyses are thorough, and the conclusion is convincing.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;EDEM2 Stably Disulfide-bonded to TXNDC11 Catalyzes the First Mannose Trimming Step in Mammalian Glycoprotein ERAD&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Tadashi Suzuki (Reviewer #2); Daniel N Hebert (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The experiments are carefully designed, analyses are thorough, and the conclusion is convincing. All issues raised are considered minor and can be addressed by revisions to the text.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>Please see the minor points below to be addressed in the revision.

I sort of expected that there may be a shift on mobility, just like the one expressing in EDEM2 KO cell s (ex. Figure 2A (c)).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>It is an overstatement to say that &quot;results clearly showed that Man9GlcNAc2 (M9 hereafter) is converted to Man8GlcNAc2[…] by EDEM2&quot; in the Introduction as the previous study in Ninagawa et al., 2014 (Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure 2A and Supplementary 3F) that the statement is referring to did not appear to allow separation of the various Man8 glycoforms (A, B and C). While quants are included for the different glycoforms, the HPLC chromatogram does not appear to support adequate separation of the glycoforms. Please explain. A similar statement is also found in the Discussion section. This overstatement also undercuts the importance of the present in vitro demonstration and the adequate separation of Man8A, B and C PA-tagged glycoforms now demonstrated in the current Figure 7D.</p><p>Figure 3 should be a supplementary figure.</p><p>Figure 4D requires quantification to support the statement in the second paragraph of the subsection “TXNDC11 knockout eliminates high molecular weight forms of EDEM2 required for gpERAD”.</p><p>The explanation that slight changes to culture conditions altered the glycoforms accumulated in the EDEM2-KO cells previously observed (Ningawa et al., 2014) compared to the present study seems unlikely. Was the same carbohydrate analysis approach used to identify the glycoforms accumulated in both studies?</p><p>Interestingly, TXNDC11 appears to have two start methionines. M1A forces the use of the downstream Met (M58) as a translational start and produces a product found to be 50% in the pellet and 50% in the supernatant after alkaline extraction. This is concluded to mean the protein is soluble (subsection “TXNDC11 knockout eliminates high molecular weight forms of EDEM2 required for gpERAD”, last paragraph). Why is it not that 50% is soluble and 50% is luminal as previously found for EDEM1 (Tamura et al., 2011)? Only a membrane protein control is shown (calnexin) for the alkaline extraction. A soluble protein control should also be shown.</p><p>The analogous yeast study described (Gauss et al., 2011) found that Htm1p did not act as a mannosidase without its associated oxidoreductase Pdi1p. It should also be pointed out that this very weak demonstration of mannosidase activity required the glycan to be attached to a protein (no mannosidase on free N-glycans); whereas, in the current study the mannosidase activity of EDEM2 is more robust and demonstrated using PA-tagged glycans (Note: PA needs to be defined in the subsection “in vitro mannosidase assay”).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53455.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>Please see the minor points below to be addressed in the revision.

Each peak fraction was collected and analyzed by co-chromatography with standard PA-high mannose type oligosaccharides, just like the experiment shown in Figure 7D, allowing us to quantify each glycoform.</p><p>The statements were changed to “is required for”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 should be a supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4D requires quantification to support the statement in the second paragraph of the subsection “TXNDC11 knockout eliminates high molecular weight forms of EDEM2 required for gpERAD”.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done so (Figure 3D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The explanation that slight changes to culture conditions altered the glycoforms accumulated in the EDEM2-KO cells previously observed (Ninagawa et al., 2014) compared to the present study seems unlikely. Was the same carbohydrate analysis approach used to identify the glycoforms accumulated in both studies?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it was. We have described that “accumulation of Glc<sub>1</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> (GM9) was probably due to a subtle change in culture conditions, because GM9 was not accumulated in EDEM2-KO human HCT116 cells in our previous study (Ninagawa et al., 2014). Alternatively, it may be due to enhanced cellular re-glucosylation activity caused by blockage of mannose trimming from M9 to M8 (Molinari, 2007), because both GM9 and M9 were accumulated in EDEM2-KO chicken DT40 cells in our previous study (Ninagawa et al., 2014)”. See Supplementary Figure 2 from Ninagawa et al., 2014.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interestingly, TXNDC11 appears to have two start methionines. M1A forces the use of the downstream Met (M58) as a translational start and produces a product found to be 50% in the pellet and 50% in the supernatant after alkaline extraction. This is concluded to mean the protein is soluble (subsection “TXNDC11 knockout eliminates high molecular weight forms of EDEM2 required for gpERAD”, last paragraph). Why is it not that 50% is soluble and 50% is luminal as previously found for EDEM1 (Tamura et al., 2011)? Only a membrane protein control is shown (calnexin) for the alkaline extraction. A soluble protein control should also be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response to the comment 4 of the reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The analogous yeast study described (Gauss et al., 2011) found that Htm1p did not act as a mannosidase without its associated oxidoreductase Pdi1p. It should also be pointed out that this very weak demonstration of mannosidase activity required the glycan to be attached to a protein (no mannosidase on free N-glycans); whereas, in the current study the mannosidase activity of EDEM2 is more robust and demonstrated using PA-tagged glycans (Note: PA needs to be defined in the subsection “in vitro mannosidase assay”).</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed to “Importantly, Htm1p-Pdi1p complex purified from insect cells, in which glutathione S-transferase-Htm1p fusion protein and His-tagged Pdi1p are simultaneously expressed, converted approximately 10% of M8 to M7 in vitro when M8 is attached to unfolded, reduced and alkylated polypeptides; in contrast, Htm1p-Pdi1p complex was nearly inactive against free M8 (Gauss et al., 2011).”.</p><p>We have added “Our results represent the first clear demonstration of in vitro mannosidase activity of EDEM family proteins toward free oligosaccharides, an effect which is much clearer than in the case of yeast Htm1p.”</p><p>PA is defined as pyridylamine in the Introduction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
