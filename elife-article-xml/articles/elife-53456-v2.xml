crucial for axonal transport, but their roles in dendritic transport and postsynaptic function are not well-defined. Gene duplication and subsequent diversification give rise to three homologous kinesin I proteins (KIF5A, KIF5B and KIF5C) in vertebrates, but it is not clear whether and how they exhibit functional specificity. Here we show that knockdown of KIF5A or KIF5B differentially affects excitatory synapses and dendritic transport in hippocampal neurons. The functional specificities of the two kinesins are determined by their diverse carboxyl-termini, where arginine methylation occurs in KIF5B and regulates its function. KIF5B conditional knockout mice exhibit deficits in dendritic spine morphogenesis, synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Our findings provide insights into how expansion of the kinesin I family during evolution leads to diversification and specialization of motor proteins in regulating postsynaptic function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Transporting molecules within a cell becomes a daunting task when the cell is a neuron, with fibers called axons and dendrites that can stretch as long as a meter. Neurons use many different molecules to send messages across the body and store memories in the brain. If the right molecules cannot be delivered along the length of nerve cells, connections to neighboring neurons may decay, which may impair learning and memory.</p><p>Motor proteins are responsible for transporting molecules within cells. Kinesins are a type of motor protein that typically transports materials from the body of a neuron to the cell’s periphery, including the dendrites, which is where a neuron receives messages from other nerve cells. Each cell has up to 45 different kinesin motors, but it is not known whether each one performs a distinct task or if they have overlapping roles.</p><p>Now, Zhao, Fok et al. have studied two similar kinesins, called KIF5A and KIF5B, in rodent neurons to determine their roles. First, it was shown that both proteins were found at dendritic spines, which are small outgrowths on dendrites where contact with other cells occurs. Next, KIF5A and KIF5B were depleted, one at a time, from neurons extracted from a brain region called the hippocampus. Removing KIF5B interfered with the formation of dendritic spines, but removing KIF5A did not have an effect. Dendritic spines are essential for learning and memory, so several behavioral tests were conducted on mice that had been genetically modified to express less KIF5B in the forebrain. These tests revealed that the mice performed poorly in tasks that tested their memory recall.</p><p>This work opens a new area of research studying the specific roles of different kinesin motor proteins in nerve cells. This could have important implications because certain kinesin motor proteins such as KIF5A are known to be defective in some inherited neurodegenerative diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group

maturation and remodeling are crucial for brain functions including learning and memory. The postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses are located on the dendritic spines, which undergo dynamic structural changes that are essential for experience-driven wiring of the neuronal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trachtenberg et al., 2002</xref>). More than 1000 proteins with diverse structures and functions have been identified in the postsynaptic density (PSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayés et al., 2011</xref>), and a tight regulation of their abundance and localization is essential for proper synapse development and plasticity. Many of the postsynaptic proteins are locally translated in dendrites, which allows spatial and temporal regulation of molecular composition of individual synapses in response to local extracellular stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Holt and Schuman, 2013</xref>). To achieve protein synthesis in dendrites, mRNAs synthesized in the soma need to be assembled in ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and transported over long distances by molecular motors along microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doyle and Kiebler, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Kinesin and dynein superfamilies of proteins are microtubule-dependent molecular motors that mediate long-distance transport of materials in neuron. The kinesin superfamily is very diverse and contains 45 members in mammal. It is sub-divided into 14 different families based on structural similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirokawa et al., 2010</xref>). The kinesin I family (encoded by the <italic>Kif5</italic> genes) contains the founding kinesin protein kinesin heavy chain (KHC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brady, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vale et al., 1985</xref>). While only one single KIF5 is present in invertebrates such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Aplysia</italic>, gene duplication events give rise to three homologous KIF5 genes (<italic>Kif5a</italic>, <italic>Kif5b</italic> and <italic>Kif5c</italic>) in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miki et al., 2001</xref>). Unlike KIF5B which is ubiquitously expressed, KIF5A and KIF5C are mostly expressed in neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kanai et al., 2000</xref>). Functional redundancy has been demonstrated among the three KIF5s, as exogenous expression of KIF5A or KIF5C can rescue the impaired mitochondrial transport in cells lacking KIF5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kanai et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, specific function of individual KIF5 has been reported in zebrafish, in which axonal transport of mitochondria depends only on KIF5A but not the other two KIF5s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, only KIF5A dysfunction leads to seizure and the neuromuscular disorder Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fink, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nakajima et al., 2012</xref>). It is therefore plausible that the expansion of the <italic>Kif5</italic> gene family during evolution enables functional specificity of individual KIF5 in the vertebrate brain, although the molecular basis of the specificity has not been identified. The three KIF5s contain motor, stalk, and tail domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman and Vale, 1999</xref>), and they all bind to kinesin light chain (KLC) which mediates interaction with some of the cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kamal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morfini et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the overall structural similarity, the carboxyl-termini (starting from around amino acid 934 until the last amino acid) of the three KIF5s are very different, which may confer the individual KIF5 distinctive functions in neurons.</p><p>Previous studies have mostly focused on KIF5 function in axonal transport because the motor domain of KIF5 preferentially moves out of dendrites into axons, and KIF5 function is negatively regulated by the dendritic protein MAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gumy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang and Banker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kapitein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tas et al., 2017</xref>). However, all three KIF5s are co-purified with RNPs, and dominant-negative KIF5 disrupts the dendritic localization of RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kanai et al., 2004</xref>). Additional dendritic cargoes for KIF5, including the AMPA receptor/GRIP1 complex and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, have also been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heisler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nakajima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Setou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Twelvetrees et al., 2010</xref>). KIF5s therefore likely participate in both axonal and dendritic transport. Despite previous studies on its importance on AMPA receptor trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim and Lisman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Setou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoerndli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heisler et al., 2014</xref>), the role of KIF5 on dendritic spine morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity has not been comprehensively examined. In this study, we aim to investigate whether the three KIF5s have specific roles in the development and function of excitatory synapses on the postsynaptic neuron, and what might underlie the functional specificity.</p><p>Here we report that KIF5B but not KIF5A is specifically involved in the development of excitatory synapses of postsynaptic neurons and dendritic transport of the RNA-binding protein fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). The diverse carboxyl-termini of KIF5A and KIF5B determine their functional specificity, and we further identified arginine methylation of KIF5B as a novel post-translational modification (PTM) in regulating cargo binding. Because of the embryonic lethality of KIF5B knockout mice that precludes their use to study the synaptic and cognitive functions of adult brain in vivo, we generate mice with KIF5B conditional knockout in CaMKIIα-expressing neurons. The KIF5B conditional knockout mice exhibit altered dendritic spine structural plasticity in vivo, as well as deficits in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Our study strongly suggests that homologous motor proteins of the kinesin I family have non-redundant functions in regulating the development and function of excitatory synapses that is crucial for learning and memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression and subcellular localization of KIF5s in hippocampus</title><p>To compare the synaptic functions of different KIF5s, we mainly focus on neurons from the hippocampus, a brain region that is important for learning and memory and where the development of excitatory synapses is well-studied. We first determined the expression of different KIF5s in the hippocampus along development. Although KIF5C was previous reported to be expressed exclusively in medulla and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kanai et al., 2000</xref>), <italic>Kif5c</italic> mRNA is detected in the developing hippocampus in Allen Brain Atlas. Expression data for <italic>Kif5a</italic> and <italic>Kif5b</italic> transcripts in the developing brain is not available, but transcripts encoding the three KIF5s are detected in the adult mouse hippocampus in the atlas. Previous study has reported that <italic>Kif5</italic> mRNAs expression is unchanged in cultured hippocampal neurons along maturation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Silverman et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, we found that all three KIF5 proteins showed similar developmental expression profiles in the hippocampus, with the expression more prominent at early postnatal stages and significantly reduced at later postnatal and adult stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, we examined the distribution of KIF5 protein in the brain by fractionation. All three KIF5s were detected in the synaptic plasma membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which is consistent with the proteomic study reporting the presence of three KIF5s in the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayés et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Different roles of KIF5s on dendritic spine morphogenesis and synaptic function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot showing the developmental expression of different Kinesin I motors in the mouse hippocampus.

Here we attempt to address the role of individual KIF5 by specifically depleting each KIF5 homolog in neurons using RNA-interference. Three short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were created that specifically targeted KIF5A, KIF5B, and KIF5C. The knockdown efficiency and specificity of each shRNA in neuron were confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To examine the effect on excitatory synaptic transmission, whole-cell patch recording was performed in hippocampal neurons transfected with shRNAs targeting different KIF5s together with GFP construct. We found that knockdown of individual KIF5 differentially affected excitatory synaptic transmission. Compared to control shRNA, knockdown of KIF5B resulted in the most profound and significant reduction in the frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic current (mEPSC), while knockdown of KIF5C did not affect mEPSC frequency or amplitude. Notably, introduction of KIF5A-shRNA did not change the mEPSC frequency but instead significantly increased the mEPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Since the shRNA and GFP constructs were introduced to the neurons using calcium phosphate precipitation which has very low transfection efficiency, the reduction of mEPSC frequency in the GFP-positive neuron was likely due to cell-autonomous decrease in synapse number on the postsynaptic neuron instead of change in presynaptic release. To test this hypothesis, the density of different types of dendritic spines was examined. Although knockdown of either KIF5B or KIF5C caused a significant reduction in the density of mushroom spines, only the introduction of KIF5B-shRNA increased the density of filopodia. On the other hand, knockdown of KIF5A did not cause any change in the density of mushroom spines or filopodia when compared to control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The differential effect of KIF5A and KIF5B knockdown on spine morphogenesis and synaptic transmission is not attributed to differences in knockdown efficiency, as either shRNA reduced the target KIF5 expression by similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, knockdown of KIF5B in hippocampal neurons leads to more profound changes in mEPSC and dendritic spine morphogenesis than knockdown of KIF5C, while knockdown of KIF5A has no effect on dendritic spines.</p><p>To confirm that KIF5A and KIF5B indeed differentially regulate dendritic spine morphogenesis and to exclude potential off-target effect of the KIF5B-shRNA, rescue experiments using different KIF5s were performed. We focus on mushroom spines instead of the other three spine types in subsequent experiments because mushroom spines are regarded as mature spines that are more stable and possess the excitatory PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourne and Harris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry and Nedivi, 2017</xref>). Moreover, among the different spine types only mushroom spines were reduced after KIF5B knockdown, and the fewer mushroom spines correlated well with the decrease in mEPSC frequency. As expected, co-expression of KIF5B reversed the loss of mushroom spines induced by the KIF5B-shRNA. However, co-expression of KIF5A with the KIF5B-shRNA failed to rescue the loss of mushroom spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, co-expression of KIF5C fully reversed the mushroom spine defects induced by the KIF5B-shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that KIF5B and KIF5C share similar function on excitatory synapse development. Both endogenous and exogenously expressed KIF5A and KIF5B were present in dendrites and dendritic spines, and the percentage of dendritic spines containing endogenous KIF5A was even higher than that of KIF5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Consistent with previous study on the trafficking of RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mitsumori et al., 2017</xref>), most FMRP granules were either stationary or exhibiting oscillatory movement, while a small proportion showing unidirectional or bidirectional movement. Compared to control shRNA, knockdown of KIF5B significantly reduced the density of FMRP granules on dendrites. Interestingly, KIF5B shRNA only significantly decreased the density of stationary but not motile granules. In contrast, knockdown of KIF5A caused a general increase in the density of motile granules while decreasing the stationary granules, resulting in no net change in the density of total granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). There was no effect on the motility of the unidirectional and bidirectional granules after knocking down either KIF5A or KIF5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further characterize the effect on FMRP function in dendrite, the localization of two FMRP-cargoes, CaMKIIα and Grin2b mRNAs, was examined using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) upon knockdown of KIF5A or KIF5B, and the distribution of mRNA puncta along individual dendrites was analyzed. Consistent with the reduced density of GFP-FMRP granules, knockdown of KIF5B also significantly reduced the density of both CaMKIIα and Grin2b mRNA puncta on dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of KIF5A did not affect CaMKIIα and Grin2b mRNA density on dendrite.

To address whether arginine methylation is required for the synaptic function of KIF5B, we first compared the activity of wild-type and methylation-deficient mutant in the formation of mushroom spines using the KIF5B-shRNA rescue experiments. Co-expression of wild-type KIF5B reversed the loss of mushroom spines induced by the knockdown of KIF5B, while the methylation-deficient KIF5B failed to rescue the mushroom spine loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Moreover, co-expression of wild-type but not the methylation-deficient KIF5B with the KIF5B-shRNA significantly increased the mEPSC frequency, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that arginine methylation at the carboxyl-terminus is essential for KIF5B function on dendritic spine development and synaptic transmission, and suggesting a mechanism through regulating cargo-binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Generation of KIF5B conditional knockout mice</title><p>Since KIF5B homozygous knockout is embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tanaka et al., 1998</xref>), we generated a KIF5B conditional knockout (<italic>Kif5b</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice using the Cre/loxP gene-targeting strategy to study the function of KIF5B in vivo.

Imaging sessions were performed on Day 0, 2, and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>). We found that both heterozygous and homozygous mice showed a significant increase in dendritic spine elimination compared to wild-type mice over 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). However, when we examined the spine plasticity in the next time window from Day 2 to Day 7 over 5 days, both heterozygous and homozygous mice showed an increase in dendritic spine formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Overall, both heterozygous and homozygous KIF5B conditional knockout mice showed an increase of dendritic spine turnover rate when compared to wild-type, but only that in homozygous was statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Although we did not observe significant difference in the survival rate of newly formed spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), we found that the increase in spine formation during the second time window was caused by the significant increase in re-formation of spines in close proximity to eliminated spines from first time window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). These data suggest that KIF5B knockout in excitatory pyramidal neurons alters normal dendritic spine plasticity with an increase of synaptic instability in the neural circuitry.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>KIF5B conditional knockout mice exhibit deficits in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory</title><p>Based on the role of KIF5B on dendritic spine density and plasticity, we next investigated the impact of KIF5B conditional knockout on animal behavior. A series of behavioral tests were performed, including open field test, elevated plus maze, marble burying test, 3-chamber social interaction test, novel object recognition test, auditory-cued fear conditioning, and Barnes maze. We found that there was no significant difference in open field test, elevated plus maze, and marble burying test in heterozygous and homozygous mice when compared to wild-type, indicating that conditional knockout of KIF5B did not lead to hyperactivity, anxiety-like or repetitive behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the other hand, homozygous mice exhibited memory deficits in a variety of learning-related behaviors. In 3-chamber social interaction test, homozygous mice showed a significant reduction of social memory index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), but no significant difference in total interaction time from wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). These data showed that KIF5B homozygous conditional knockout leads to deficits in social memory. In novel object recognition test, mice were presented with a novel object 14–16 hr after the mouse was exposed to the familiar objects for testing short-term object recognition memory. Homozygous mice showed a significantly reduced preference to the novel object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), suggesting a deficit in short-term memory recall. Next, we used auditory-cued fear conditioning to test fear associative memory. The freezing response of KIF5B conditional knockout mice was similar to wild-type in the acquisition phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C</xref>), but homozygous mice showed a significant decrease of freezing response to the conditioned stimulus (CS, auditory cue) during the recall test 48 hr after fear acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Since there was no significant difference in the trend of fear acquisition, this data indicates that homozygous mice show deficit in fear memory recall. The absence of significant deficits in heterozygous mice in these memory tests suggests the dose-dependent role of KIF5B in memory formation and retrieval. We next investigated the effect of KIF5B conditional knockout in spatial memory without using heterozygous conditional knockout mice. In Barnes maze test, mice were trained to locate the escape chamber among the 20 holes in the maze during the acquisition phase based on contextual cues. Wild-type mice showed a learning progress during the acquisition phase as indicated by a decreasing trend of primary errors they made during training, but such learning progress was not observed in homozygous mice. Homozygous mice also tended to stay in the wrong target hole instead of exploring the environment which in turn showing fewer primary errors when compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Nonetheless, homozygous mice showed a significantly higher primary latency to locate the escape hole when compared to wild-type during the recall test five days after the training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>KIF5B conditional knockout mice show deficits in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram shows the set-up of three-chamber social interaction test and the quantification of social memory index in the right panel. n = 10 for WT. n = 11 for Hetero and Homo.

While LTP could be induced in both control and homozygous hippocampal slices, the LTP decayed faster at the homozygous SC–CA1 synapses, and the field EPSP amplitude during the last 10 min recording was significantly reduced at the homozygous SC–CA1 synapses when compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). There was no significant difference in input/output relationship between wild-type and homozygous mice, indicating the baseline synaptic response was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). To test whether presynaptic function was altered, the pair-pulse ratios were measured with several different inter-pulse durations. We found no significant difference in pair-pulse ratio between wild-type and homozygous mice, indicating similar presynaptic responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that conditional knockout of <italic>Kif5b</italic> causes memory recall deficits in social memory, object recognition memory, fear associative memory, and spatial memory, showing the important role of KIF5B in memory formation and retrieval. These memory deficits are associated with impaired long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Moreover, the synaptic and memory deficits in the KIF5B conditional knockout mice cannot be compensated by the presence of the other two homologous KIF5s.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Many studies have examined the functional significance of individual kinesin through exogenous expression of dominant-negative construct, which usually contains the tail domain of the kinesin of interest without the motor domain and hence does not move along microtubule. This approach is useful to demonstrate the effect of competitive binding between the dominant negative protein and endogenous motors for the cargoes. Using an alternative approach to delineate the function of individual KIF by RNAi or gene knockout, we demonstrate the important roles of KIF5B in regulating dendritic spine development and maintenance both in dissociated neurons in vitro and in the animal. Through the generation of conditional knockout mice in which the <italic>Kif5b</italic> gene is ablated only after birth in order to avoid lethality, we are able to demonstrate the physiological significance of KIF5B in regulating excitatory synaptic plasticity as well as learning and memory. Our findings provide compelling evidences that the function of KIF5B in neuron cannot be compensated by the other two neuron-specific KIF5s.</p><p>Since only one KIF5 is expressed in invertebrates, it appears that the neuronal-specific KIF5A and KIF5C evolve specifically for higher brain function in vertebrates. We found that knock down of either KIF5B or KIF5C, but not KIF5A, reduced mushroom spines. On the other hand, co-expression of KIF5C but not KIF5A can rescue the loss of mushroom spines caused by KIF5B-shRNA. These finding indicates that KIF5B and KIF5C share functional similarity in dendritic spine morphogenesis and their roles cannot be replaced by the functionally distinct KIF5A. However, in the KIF5B conditional knockout mice in which KIF5C expression remains unaffected, reduction in both spine density and mEPSC is observed in hippocampal neurons. Therefore, the impaired synaptic function due to KIF5B deficiency cannot be compensated by KIF5C in the postnatal brain. One possible explanation is that KIF5B is the more prominently expressed kinesin compared to KIF5C in the adult hippocampus as shown by quantitative immunoblot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kanai et al., 2000</xref>). The presence of KIF5C in the conditional knockout mice may not be sufficient to compensate for the shortage of motor proteins after ~50% reduction of KIF5B expression.</p><p>The carboxyl termini of the three KIF5s share little amino acid sequence similarity. The carboxyl terminus may not bind to cargo directly since GST-KIF5B constructs without this region (a.a. 936–963) still pull down various cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Setou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Our present findings also suggest that the carboxyl-terminus is not directly involved in FMRP binding because removing it (amino acid residues 939–1027) from KIF5A increases, rather than decreases, the pull-down of FMRP. Furthermore, although replacement of the KIF5A carboxyl-terminus by the KIF5B counterpart increases the binding to FMRP and G3BP1, given that the input of KIF5B is much less than the chimeric KIF5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), it is likely that equal amount of KIF5B would pull down much more FMRP and G3BP1. This again points to the involvement of KIF5 sequence besides the carboxyl-terminus in cargo-binding. Nonetheless, in the rescue experiments with chimeric KIF5A, swapping the carboxyl-terminus with KIF5B is sufficient to transform KIF5A into a kinesin motor that enhances spine maturation, therefore unraveling a new function of the carboxyl-terminus in determining functional specficity of KIF5s. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the longer carboxyl-terminus of KIF5A binds directly to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated protein for the development of inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nakajima et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings together raise the interesting possibility that there is a division of labor among the two KIF5s in regulating excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and the evolution of their diverse carboxyl-termini confer them functional specificities.</p><p>Many axonal cargoes, such as syntabulin, SNAP25 and amyloid precursor protein (APP) have been identified for KIF5s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hirokawa and Tanaka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kamal et al., 2000</xref>). KIF5 motor domain also predominately recognizes axonal rather than dendritic microtubules, which highlight its functional significance in axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kapitein et al., 2010</xref>). However, KIF5 is also implicated in the transport of cargoes such as GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Twelvetrees et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nakajima et al., 2012</xref>), AMPA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heisler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Setou et al., 2002</xref>) and RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kanai et al., 2004</xref>), which are believed to be mainly carried to the dendrites of mature neurons. We found that KIF5B is localized not only in the axons, but is also present in the dendrites and dendritic spines of dissociated hippocampal neurons, supporting the role of dendritic KIF5B in the development of excitatory postsynaptic sites. Although it was originally thought that microtubule is not present in dendritic spines, emerging study has revealed the invasion of microtubule and kinesin to the spine heads from dendritic shaft, which are crucial for dendritic spine plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jaworski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McVicker et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings suggest that KIF5B might represent one of the kinesin motors that deliver synaptic proteins to the dendritic spines.</p><p>Dendritic spines exist as heterogeneous morphologies, which are usually classified into short stubby spines with no apparent spine neck, thin spines with elongated necks and small heads, mushroom-shaped spines with large bulbous heads, and filopodia which are long and thin and do not possess a PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ziv and Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourne and Harris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lai and Ip, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry and Nedivi, 2017</xref>). Stubby and filopodia are regarded as immature dendritic protrusions because they are relatively scarce in the mature brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harris et al., 1992</xref>). The distinct morphologies are critical to determine the properties and functions of dendritic spines. These include signal compartmentalization, calcium dynamics, capacity of local translation, and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McKinney, 2010</xref>). Mushroom spines possess larger PSD which are correlated with greater synaptic strength and stability for information storage; while the dynamic thin spines are transient, but they may become persistent in response to a learning paradigm and contribute to the remodeling of neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourne and Harris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry and Nedivi, 2017</xref>). It is interesting that knockdown of KIF5B specifically decreases mushroom spines in cultured hippocampal neurons while increasing the abundance of the other three types of spines. Emerging studies have demonstrated that different spine types can be regulated differentially and independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sanders et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spiga et al., 2014</xref>). At the molecular level, we have also identified the postsynaptic scaffolding protein STRN4, which is encoded by a dendritic mRNA and its expression depends on NMDA receptor activity, is involved specifically in the maintenance of mushroom spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that a subset of proteins and/or mRNAs may depend on KIF5B for the delivery to mushroom spines that confer their selective maintenance.</p><p>Since KIF5s can pull down RNPs from the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kanai et al., 2004</xref>), one possible mechanism by which KIF5B promotes the maintenance of mushroom spines is through the dendritic transport of mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. We have found that knockdown of KIF5B reduced the dendritic localization of FMRP and two associated RNA transcripts as compared to knockdown of KIF5A, indicating their differential functions in dendritic transport of mRNAs. This may explain the altered spine morphology after knockdown of KIF5B, since the depletion of FMRP in mouse brain also resulted in an increase of dendritic filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Comery et al., 1997</xref>). The local translation of CaMKIIα and Grin2b mRNAs is critical to synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kuklin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 2007</xref>), which may contribute to the disrupted LTP in mouse hippocampus upon KIF5B depletion. FMRP and associated mRNA transport involves interaction with KLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dictenberg et al., 2008</xref>). Since both KIF5A and KIF5B contain the conserved KLC binding domain, there could be additional mechanism that underlies the specific role of KIF5B in FMRP transport, which may involve the preferential interaction between FMRP and the KIF5B tail domain as revealed by our pull-down assay. It is also intriguing that KIF5B-shRNA only leads to fewer stationary granules on dendrites without affecting the motile oscillatory, unidirectional and bidirectional granules. Since other kinesins besides KIF5 can also bind to FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charalambous et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davidovic et al., 2007</xref>), we speculate that different pools of FMRP granules are carried by different KIFs, with KIF5B mainly responsible for the less motile granules while other KIFs transport the more motile pools of FMRP. It was recently reported that different KIFs transport cargoes with different velocities and MAP2 inhibits KIF5B activity in dendrites by interacting with the coiled-coil region and blocking microtubule binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gumy et al., 2017</xref>). This study therefore also suggests that KIF5B-mediated transport in dendrites is ineffective as compared to other kinesins. Alternatively, since microtubule and dynein are required for mRNA anchoring in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delanoue and Davis, 2005</xref>), it is possible that besides a conventional transport function, KIF5s may help anchoring the dendritically localized FMRP and mRNAs near synapses for local translation in response to extracellular stimuli such as BDNF or synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schratt, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The function of kinesin is regulated by post-translational modification. Previous studies on the Kinesin-2 motor protein KIF17 revealed a novel mechanism of cargo release through calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII)-mediated phosphorylation, which disrupts the interaction with the adaptor protein LIN10 and unloads the NMDA receptor subunit 2B (GluN2B) containing vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guillaud et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, the association between synaptotagmin-containing vesicles and the motor adaptor UNC76 of KIF5 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is strengthened by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Toda et al., 2008</xref>). In the present study, we have characterized the methylation of two RGG motifs within the carboxyl-terminus of KIF5B involving Arg-941 and Arg-956. Invertebrates such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> have shorter carboxyl-terminus of KIF5 that lacks the RGG motif, while <italic>Drosophila</italic> has one RGG motif containing Arg-956, same as the mammalian KIF5C. The two RGG motifs in KIF5B are conserved across many vertebrates, indicating the importance of arginine methylation. Here we show that the KIF5B methylation is essential for the formation of mushroom spines and it modulates the interaction of KIF5B with FMRP, therefore unraveling a previously unidentified PTM in regulating kinesin function. There are extensive cross-talks between arginine methylation and other PTMs, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basso and Pennuto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Future studies are needed to investigate how arginine methylation of KIF5B may interact with other forms of PTM in regulating cargo-binding of the motor protein.</p><p>Does KIF5B play any specific role in learning and memory? To answer this question, we generated the KIF5B conditional knockout mouse line in CaMKIIα-expressing neurons. Since the expression of CaMKIIα is developmentally regulated and is restricted to the forebrain with high levels in the pyramidal neurons of the neocortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dragatsis and Zeitlin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsien et al., 1996</xref>), we can specifically knockout KIF5B postnatally without affecting early neurodevelopment. Here we demonstrated that specific knockout of <italic>Kif5b</italic> in CaMKIIα-expressing neurons leads to deficits in memory recall in social memory, novel object recognition, auditory-cued fear conditioning, and spatial memory tests, with no significant deficit during initial memory acquisition phase. Furthermore, the KIF5B conditional knockout mice show deficits in the maintenance of LTP in CA1 hippocampal neurons and the loss of dendritic spines. Although there is no significant decrease of dendritic spine density in the frontal association cortex of conditional knockout mice, the rates of dendritic spine formation and elimination are significantly higher at different time points in two-photon in vivo imaging, suggesting the increase of dendritic spine instability in this region. Increase in dendritic spine instability has been commonly found in various disease models, such as Fragile X syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nagaoka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pan et al., 2010</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fénelon et al., 2013</xref>), spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hatanaka et al., 2015</xref>) and Huntington disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murmu et al., 2013</xref>). It has been found that a small fraction of the population of transient spines grows after experience or behavioral training over days can be stabilized over the animal's lifetime, contributing to long-lasting circuit remodeling associated with new experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). The enhanced dendritic spine instability in KIF5B conditional knockout mice could contribute to brain dysfunction and deficits in learning and memory. Since the frontal cortex maturation happens at later developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caballero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gogtay et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zuo et al., 2005</xref>), the lack of dendritic spine density difference in the frontal association cortex between wild-type and KIF5B conditional knockout mice could be due to the delay of frontal cortex maturation and pruning in the conditional knockout mutant. Nonetheless, the impairments in memory recall, LTP maintenance, and dendritic spine deficits in KIF5B conditional knockout demonstrate the crucial role of KIF5B in learning and memory that cannot be compensated by KIF5A and KIF5C in vivo. The process of memory storage is not a random event. The synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis proposes that the synapses activated during LTP induction become ‘tagged’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rogerson et al., 2014</xref>). These tagged synapses become a target for subsequent plasticity-related product (PRP) trafficking. The capture of these PRPs by specific synapses is essential for their structural modification, as well as the maintenance of LTP and long-term memory formation. The deficits that we observed in KIF5B conditional knockout mice could be stemmed from the impairment of PRP trafficking specifically delivered by KIF5B in dendrites in response to activity-dependent plasticity.</p><p>Taken together, our findings have revealed the significance of KIF5B in regulating excitatory synapse development and function of neuron both in vitro and in vivo, and support the notion that the three homologous KIF5s have non-redundant functions in the brain. It is plausible that homologous members of the other kinesin families also exhibit functional specificity in the brain, an interesting research area which warrants further study in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

The sequence of control shRNA is 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGCTACCTCCATTTAGTGT</named-content>-3’. Full-length mouse KIF5A and KIF5C constructs were obtained from Quan Hao (The University of Hong Kong), and the coding sequence was amplified and subcloned into pcDNA3 backbone. Full-length mouse KIF5B was amplified by PCR using the plasmid pcDNA3-FLAG-KIF5B as template, which contains the insert of full-length mouse KIF5B coding region. Methylation-deficient R941H, R956H and R941/956H constructs were created by site-directed mutagenesis and the PCR products were digested by DpnI (NEB) at 37°C water bath for 3 hr before transformation into <italic>E. coli</italic> competent cells. The nucleotide sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing. For GFP-FMRP construct, the human FMRP coding sequence was amplified from the plasmid pFRT-TODestFLAGHAhFMRPiso1 that was from Thomas Tuschl (Addgene #48690) and cloned into the pEGFP-C1 backbone using SacI and EcoRI. KIF5A-GFP and KIF5B-GFP were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified mouse KIF5A and KIF5B coding sequences into the pEGFP-N1 plasmid using KpnI and BamHI.

For animal behavioral tests and in vivo imaging experiments, results from at least two independent experiments were pooled together for analysis. Mice were group housed in The Laboratory Animal Unit, The University of Hong Kong, accredited by Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.

For cultured hippocampal neurons, which were recorded at DIV 16–17, the pipettes with a resistance of 3–5 MΩ were filled with the internal solution consisting of 115 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM NaATP, 0.4 mM NaGTP, 0.5 mM EGTA, and pH was adjusted to 7.2–7.4 by CsOH. The neurons were perfused with the external solution of the following composition: 110 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM Glucose, and pH was adjusted to 7.2–7.4 by NaOH. For miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) recording, tetrodotoxin (1 µM) and bicuculline (20 µM) were added into the external solution to block action potentials and the inhibitory current from GABA receptor, respectively. The signals were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz using the Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices). The holding potential is at −70 mV, and the recording lasts for 5 to 10 min. The data were analyzed by the commercial software MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft).</p><p>For recording mEPSCs in dorsal hippocampal CA1 brain slices, postnatal day (P) 45 ± 3 wild-type and KIF5B conditional knockout mice were perfused by ice-cold dissection buffer (92 mM NMDG, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO4, 30 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES, 5 mM Na-ascorbate, 3 mM Na-pyruvate, 2 mM thiourea, 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>pH = 7.1–7.3) after euthanized. The brains were taken out immediately and submerged in ice-cold dissection buffer. Coronal brain slices containing CA1 were sectioned in 250 µm by vibratome. Slices were recovered in warm artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) at 32°C for 15 min, followed by room temperature incubation. The recordings were performed in ACSF at room temperature. The ACSF consisted of the following (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.23 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO4 and 10 glucose. All solutions were oxygenated by 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Internal solution consisted of the following (in mM) 131 Cs-methanesulfonate, 20 CsCl, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 2 EGTA, 2 NaATP and 0.3 NaGTP, pH7.3, osmolarity 290 mOsm. The glass micropipette was filled with internal solution (resistance 4–6 MΩ) and connected to the electrode for recording. The mEPSCs were recorded with the presence of 1 µM tetrodotoxin, 10 µM bicuculline and 1 µM strychnine.</p><p>For recording LTP, hippocampal slices from the wild-type and the KIF5B conditional knockout mice (3 months old) were prepared. A planar multi-electrode recording setup (MED64 system, Alpha Med Sciences Co., Ltd, Japan) was employed to record the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP), and to study LTP. Briefly, hippocampal slices were placed on special probes that were fabricated with 8 × 8 electrode arrays and pre-coated with polyethylenimine (PEI, Sigma). The P210A probes (Alpha Med Sciences) with an inter-electrode distance of 100 μm were routinely used. Correct placement of the electrodes at the CA3–CA1 region was done manually, monitored by a microscope (MIC-D, Olympus Ltd., Japan). To increase the efficiency of the experiments and to minimize the variation in the results arising from differences in incubation times, a maximum of 4 slices were studied simultaneously. Each slice was superfused by oxygenated ACSF. fEPSPs were recorded from the dendritic layer of CA1 neurons by choosing an electrode in the Schaffer collateral pathway as the stimulating electrode. Based on the stimulus–response curve, we chose a stimulation intensity that evoked the fEPSP with a magnitude of 30–40% of the maximum response. After allowing a stable baseline of 30 min, an induction protocol consisting of 1 train of 100 Hz stimulus that lasted for 1 s was applied, and the field potential response for 1 hr after the tetanus was recorded. The magnitude of the LTP was quantified as % change in the average amplitude of the fEPSP taken from 50 to 60 min interval after induction. To assess basal synaptic transmission, the input-output relationship was generated by delivering 10–100-μA electrical stimuli, and the amplitude of the peak fEPSPs was measured. To characterize the paired-pulse ratio, twin stimuli that were separated by a variable time interval (50, 100, 150, 200 or 400 ms) were delivered to the CA3-CA1 pathway ten times each, and the average ratio of the amplitude of the second evoked fEPSPs over the first one was determined. All the electrophysiology experiments were performed and analyzed blinded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Primary cell culture and transfection</title><p>Primary hippocampal neurons and cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 18–19 embryos of Sprague Dawley rats according to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). Hippocampal neurons were cultured on 18 mm coverslips or 35 mm MatTek dishes (with 14 mm central glass, MatTek corp) dishes coated with poly-D-lysine (1 mg/ml, Sigma P0899) at high density (1.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per coverslip for dendritic spine analysis; 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> per cover glass on MatTek dish for live cell imaging of GFP-FMRP) or low density (0.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per coverslip for FISH and immunofluorescence staining) in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27% and 0.5% L-glutamate. Hippocampal neurons were transfected with different plasmids using calcium phosphate precipitation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lai et al., 2008</xref>). Cortical neurons were transfected by electroporation using the Neon transfection system (ThermoFisher Scientific), in which a total of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells in suspension were electroporated in each reaction with the parameter of 1500V pulse voltage and 20 ms pulse width. After electroporation, cells were plated on 35 mm dishes and cultured for 5 days before Western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Live cell imaging and image analysis</title><p>Images were taken using Perkin Elmer UltraView Vox Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope 60x oil-immersion objective (NA 1.40) at a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels, one frame per second for 100 s. Images were exported using Volocity software and processed using FIJI software. Kymographs of selected dendrites were generated in FIJI software using the ‘KymoResliceWide’ plugin. The kymographs were randomized and reviewed blindly, and images with low signal-to-noise ratio were excluded due to the difficulty in quantification. The movement of individual granules in selected kymographs was then traced manually by drawing polygonal lines as overlays on the image and the traces were reviewed by an experimenter blind to the conditions. Minimum and maximum values of the kymographs were constantly adjusted during manual tracing due to uneven intensity on different segments of the dendrite but were limited to a range that was considered appropriate for that batch of images. The traces were then exported with information of the x and y coordinates of each point on the polygonal lines. To classify the type of movement exhibited by each granule, the net displacement (ND) and lateral maximal displacement (LMD) were measured. ND is defined as the difference in x coordinates of the first point and the last point of the trace. Lateral maximal displacement (LMD) is defined as the absolute value of maximal difference in x coordinates of all the points on the trace (the difference between the most proximal point and the most distal point). Granules with ND ≧2 μm are defined as unidirectional, within which the granules with ND &gt;0 are defined as anterograde (from soma towards distal dendrite) and granules with ND &lt;0 are defined as retrograde (from distal dendrite to soma). For granules with ND &lt;2 μm, granules with LMD &lt;1 μm are defined as stationary; granules with 1 μm≦LMD &lt;2 μm are defined as oscillatory; while granules with LMD ≧ 2 μm are defined as bidirectional. The motility of each granule in unidirectional or bidirectional movements was further quantified in terms of travel distance, maximal run length and maximal velocity. Travel distance is defined as the total length of the granule trajectory within 100 s. The maximal run length is defined as the largest x-axis distance of a period of movement with constant velocity. The maximal velocity is defined as the maximum of all velocity values of a granule, which is calculated by dividing the x-axis distance of each segment of the trajectory by the y-axis distance (the time covered by this segment).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fractionation of synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) and Western blot analysis</title><p>SPM fraction was prepared using sucrose gradient method as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bermejo et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, mouse brains (~P20) were homogenized in 0.32M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution. The homogenate was either centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 min (min) yielding the supernatant (Homo) for western blot analysis, or subjected to fractionation. The homogenate was centrifuged at 900 x g for 10 min (min) to remove nuclear fraction and the crude synaptosomal fraction (P2) was enriched from the supernatant using two times of centrifugation at 10000 x g for 15 min. The P2 pellet was later subjected to hypo-osmotic shock and centrifugation at 25,000 x g for 20 min to yield the Synaptosomal Membrane Fraction (P3). The obtained pellet was then resuspended and loaded to a 0.8M/1.0M/1.2M HEPES-buffered sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 150,000 x g for 2 hr, separating fractions in different layers. The SPM fraction was collected at the 1.0M/1.2M interface, further centrifuged at 160,000 x g for 30 min, and resuspended in 50 mM HEPES/2 mM EDTA solution.

The images from the same experiment were captured using identical acquisition settings, except for GFP or tdTomato (RFP) staining which served to visualize dendritic arbors and spines. Images from 2 to 3 coverslips were acquired for each experimental condition, and results from three independent experiments were pooled together for analysis. Sample size was decided based on experiments in previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>For dendritic spine quantification in dissociated hippocampal neurons, images of the whole neuron were captured by confocal microscope and assigned a random number, and dendrites with length more than 50 μm were selected by another blinded experimenter for quantification. Dendritic spines were classified based on our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). The length (L), head width (H) and neck width (N) of each individual spine were measured manually using the MetaMorph software. Mushroom spines were defined as those having H/N ≧1.5; stubby spines were defined as those having H/N ≦ 1 and L/N ≦1; thin spines had the ratio of 1≦ H/N &lt; 1.5 and 1.5 ≦ L/N ≦3. Filopodia were defined as those with the ratio of H/N &lt; 1.2 and L/N &gt; 3.

The samples were then sectioned to 50 μm per slice using vibratome. Brain sections were blocked with 1.5% normal goat serum (NGS) in PBST (0.3% Triton X-100) and incubated with a 1:1000 diluted primary antibody against KIF5B at 4°C overnight. Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was used to probe the anti-KIF5B signals.

Barnes maze (BM), novel object recognition (NOR) and rotarod training were done in separate sets of animals.</p><p>Open field test. Mice were placed in the center of a square open field chamber (40 × 40 × 40 cm) surrounded by walls. Tracing was performed using ANY-maze software. The time of the mouse spent in the center area was measured over the course of 15 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shin Yim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Elevated plus maze. Mice were placed in the center of a plus-shaped chamber that stands 38 cm above ground. Mice were then allowed to explore freely for 5 min. The duration of the mouse spent in either arm was recorded and tracked using ANY-maze software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walf and Frye, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Marble burying test. Mice were placed into testing arenas (arena size: 42.5 cm ×27.6 cm × 15.3 cm, bedding depth: 5 cm) each containing 20 glass marbles (laid out in four rows of five marbles equidistant from one another). At the end of the 30 min exploration period, mice were carefully removed from the testing cages and the number of marbles buried was recorded. The marble burying score was arbitrarily defined as the following: four for completely buried marbles, three for marbles covered &gt;50% with bedding, two for marbles covered 50% with bedding, one for marbles covered &lt;50% with bedding, or 0 for anything less. The final marble burying score for each mouse was the sum of the scores of the 20 marbles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shin Yim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Novel object recognition. Mice were placed into a training chamber (25 cm x 25 cm x 40 cm) containing two identical objects. Mice were allowed to freely explore in the chamber for 10 min. In the recall session, mice were put back to the same chamber while one of the two identical objects were replaced with a novel object with different color and slightly different shape 14–16 hr after the training session. The movement of the mice was tracked with ANY-maze software for its interaction with both the familiar and novel objects. Discrimination index = interaction time with novel object/total interaction time with both objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leger et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Three-chamber social interaction. Two empty object-containment cages (shape of a cup with evenly spaced metallic bars) were each placed into the left and right chamber of a 3-chamber arena (20 cm ×42 cm × 26 cm). In the adaptation period, a mouse was shut within the center chamber for 5 min. In stage 1, a stranger mouse of same sex, similar age and size as the test mouse was put into the left cage. The test mouse in the center was released then to freely explore all of the three chambers for a 10 min period. After stage 1, the test mouse was shut within the center again when the experimenter put another stranger mouse to the right cage. At stage 2, the test mouse was allowed to explore all the three chambers again for 10 min. Approach behaviour within 2 cm with targets was defined as interaction time. Sessions were video-recorded. Approach behaviour and total distance travelled were analyzed using ANY-maze tracking system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shin Yim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Sociability index = (percentage time of interaction with stranger) - (percentage time of interaction with empty cage)/percentage of interaction time with both objects.</p><p>Social memory index = (percentage time of interaction with novel stranger) - (percentage time of interaction with familiar)/percentage of interaction time with both strangers.</p><p>Auditory-cued fear conditioning. FreezeFrame system (Coulbourn Instruments) was used to train and test mice. For training, the chamber was equipped with stainless-steel shocking grids, which were connecting to a precision feedback current-regulated shocker. Each chamber was contained in a sound-attenuating enclosure. Animal behaviour was recorded using low-light video cameras. Actimetrics FreezeFrame software (version 2.2; Coulbourn Instruments) was used to control the stimulus presentation by a preset program. All equipment was thoroughly cleaned with water followed by ethanol between sessions to avoid residue of scents from mouse feces and urine. Mice were habituated for 1 min on a shocking grid (cage set-up A: shocking floor grids, ethanol scent). Fear conditioning was conducted with three pairings of a 30 s, 4000 Hz, 80 dB auditory cue (CS) co-terminating with a 2 s, 0.5-mA scrambled footshock (US). The inter-trial interval was 20 s. One minute after conditioning, mice were returned to their home cages. For the recall test, mice were placed in a different context (cage set-up B: test floor grids, 1% lemon scent detergent) for an initial 2 min (pre-tone) period and this was followed by tone presentation for 2 min (CS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lai et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Rotarod. An EZRod system (Omnitech Electronics, Inc) was used as a motor training model. Mice were placed on the motorized rod (30 mm in diameter) in the chamber. The rotation speed gradually increased from 0 to 100 r.p.m. over the course of 3 min. Rotarod training was performed for 20 trials, each trial lasts until the subjects dropped and the system would automatically complete that trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deacon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Barnes maze. Mice were placed on a white circular table (92 cm in diameter, 1 m tall), which had a total of 20 holes (5 cm in diameter) separated evenly along the edge of the table. During the test, strong light with an intensity of 1500 lux and repetitive noise from metronome of 80 dB were given to serve as aversive stimuli to induce escape behaviour. On acquisition day, mice were first guided manually to the escape hole for adaptation purpose. Then, mice received 5 trials of training, with each separated from one another by 15 min. Each trial would last for 3 min. If mice were not able to find the target escape hole by the end of the each trial, mice will be guided to the target escape hole as a part of training. A 3 min recall session was carried out 5 days after acquisition day. Mice were subjected to the same maze except the escape hole was also blocked. The number of errors and latency to reach the original escape hole were measured manually to confirm the result generated by ANY-maze. Heat maps were obtained by ANY-maze.

Briefly, one-month-old mice expressing YFP were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (i.p., 20 mg/ml, 3 mg/ml respectively in saline, 6 μl/g body weight). Thinned skull windows were made with high-speed microdrills in head-fixed mice. Skull thickness was reduced to about 20 μm. A two-photon microscope tuned to 920 nm (25x water immersion lens, N.A. 1.05) was used to acquire images. For re-imaging of the same region, thinned regions were identified based on the maps of the brain vasculature. Microsurgical blades were used to re-thin the region of interest until a clear image could be obtained. The area of the imaging region is 216 μm × 216 μm. The center of imaging region is located at the frontal association cortex (+2.8 mm bregma, +1.0 mm midline). All data analysis was performed blind to treatment conditions. For imaging of dendritic spines, dendritic branches were randomly sampled within a 216 µm × 216 µm area imaged at 0–100 µm distance below the pia surface. The same dendritic segments were identified from three-dimensional image stacks taken at different time points with high image quality (ratio of signal to background noise &gt;4:1). The number and location of dendritic protrusions (protrusion lengths were more than one-third of the dendritic shaft diameter) were identified. Filopodia were identified as long, thin structures (generally larger than twice the average spine length, ratio of head diameter to neck diameter &lt;1.2:1 and ratio of length to neck diameter &gt;3:1). The remaining protrusions were classified as spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lai et al., 2012</xref>). The percentage of spine formation and elimination represented the number of spines formed or eliminated between the first and second view divided by the total number of spines counted at the first view in each individual mouse. For dendrite image display, fluorescent structures near and out of the focal plane of the dendrites of interest were removed manually from image stacks using Adobe Photoshop. The modified image stacks were then projected to generate two-dimensional images and adjusted for contrast and brightness.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are represented as mean + SEM/SD in quantitative analysis.

mediate axonal transports, but whether and how they regulate dendritic transport and postsynaptic functions remains unclear. The authors report novel and differential roles of KIF5A and KIF5B, belonging to the kinesin I family, in the regulation of excitatory synapses and dendritic transports. These differential functions are mediated by the distinct C-terminal regions of KIF5A and KIF5B and mono-methylation of an arginine residue in KIF5B. Conditional deletion of KIF5B in excitatory neurons in mice leads to impairments in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. These results suggest that members of the kinesin I family have non-redundant functions, and similar diversification and specification of functions within the motor proteins of the same family could also be observed in other motor protein families.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

The manuscript has an impressive amount of data, many of the results are well controlled, and some of the data provide mechanistic details such arginine methylation. The in vivo data further support that KIF5B is important for the maintenance of spine density and dynamicity, and social and cognitive behaviors. However, it is unclear how KIF5B or KIF5B-associated FMRP contributes to the maintenance of normal spine density/dynamics. In addition, although the authors suggest that arginine methylation critically regulates KIF5B binding to FMRP, whether the KIF5B-FMRP interaction is indeed a key pathway that regulates spine maintenance/dynamics is unclear. The in vivo behavior and LTP data are quite novel, but how LTP is suppressed by KIF5B deletion is unclear.</p><p>1) Many of the data for dendritic spine density are not supported.

The authors also showed that methylation of KIF5B mediate dendritic transport of FMRP granules and dendritic spine formation. In general, the claims made by the authors are not fully supported by the data, which is lacking in the validated experiments, data analysis and clear statistical summary. This manuscript requires more elaboration of data analysis, content, experiments and discussion.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The authors need clearly describe the differential effects of KIF5A, KIF5B and KIF5C on dendritic spine morphogenesis. According to the author's results, knockdown of KIF5C also significantly affected the mushroom and thin spines (Figure 1D), indicating a potential role in synaptic transmission, similar to the KIF5B's function. It is difficult to get a clear impression on the importance of KIF5B in dendritic morphogenesis and synaptic transmission. The authors need to reorganize the manuscript to significantly strength the findings.</p><p>2) Many dendritic specific mRNAs such as CamKIIɑ have been suggested as the cargo associated with FMRP granule. Analysis of the dendritic mRNA transport and localization in KIF5B knockdown or knockout neurons would provide more evidences for supporting the role of KIF5B in this process and therefore significantly strength the author's claims.</p><p>3) FLAG-KIF5 pull-down assay (Figures 4 and 5) are absolutely suspected. Two-step FLAG beads immunoprecipitation could not provide the evidence for supporting the association of FMRP or G3BP1 with different segment of KIF5A, KIF5B and KIF5C. It would be more appropriate to use GST-fused KIF5 purification and GST pull-down assay to support the author's points.</p><p>4) It has been well established that KIF17 is essential for dendritic localization of NR2B during learning and memory. What are the effects of KIF5B knockdown or knockout on the expression of KIF17 and its cargos in dendrites? Experiments and discussion should be included to address this issue.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have made an elegant conditional mouse model revealing the importance of KIF5B for memory formation. They also show some interesting protein-protein interaction studies detailing differences between KIF5A and KIF5B tails. I agree with the authors that the isoform diversity of microtubule motors in neurons is understudied and important for the understanding of neuronal function, and this work is potentially highly significant in demonstrating some aspects of this and I support its publication. However, there is a tendency to mis-cite or exclude previous work in other model systems, which I don't believe is necessary and in fact weakens the main claims of their paper by doing so.</p><p>My main concerns are outlined below – I note that I can't offer much interpretation on whether the behavioral experiments reach standards set in the field.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>Though there are discrepancies in the literature about whether the KLC binding region of the KHC is labelled as 'stalk' or 'tail', there is a general consensus that everything predicted to be coiled coil is termed stalk and this includes residues up to residue 758 at the least and often incorporates up to residue 810; the C-terminus of KIF5 is not typically termed &quot;cargo binding&quot; until after the region that binds to KLC. The second stalk coil of kinesin has been termed 'stalk' since at least Friedman and Vale, 1999, if not before. It is imperative that the authors adjust Figure 3A, Figure 4A and Figure 5A to reflect this and adjust their nomenclature throughout the manuscript to reflect this (For example the Abstract: &quot;conserved cargo-binding domains&quot; directly contradicts: &quot;by their diverse carboxyl-terminal tails&quot;).</p><p>Introduction: &quot;However, the three KIF5s have long been considered to be functionally redundant&quot; – the cargo binding domains are not homologous, and this statement is a misrepresentation of other work in the field. Although there are studies that show some functional redundancy in some contexts (including this paper), there are others that show specificity e.g. Campbell et al., 2014. Please adjust this statement.</p><p>Discussion paragraph two: An assertion that KIF5s carboxy tails do not bind directly to cargo. This is exactly the opposite of what the papers cited show (direct binding to GRIP1 and HAP1 respectively). I also point the authors towards several other papers that show direct binding to the crago binding tail of kinesin: Xu et al., 2010; Chen and Sheng, 2013 (JCB); Randall et al., 2013 (FEBS letters); Cho et al., 2009 (EMBO reports); there are yet others. Therefore, it is imperative that the authors alter their assertion that this is a new function of the KIF5 tail.</p><p>It is unclear how reproducible the shRNA knock-down in Figure 1 really is. There are no errors bars in the supplement and no clear indication of how many times the quantification of knockdown was performed. I understand that transfection efficiency can be very low in these experiments however if this is highly variable then it has large implications for interpreting the rest of the paper. Neurons expressing GFP should be expressing the shRNA, and as the authors have isoform specific endogenous antibodies, I request quantification of knock down by quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy.</p><p>Through the cellular work in the paper, there seems to be a confusion around what should constitute a biological replicate and a technical replicate. This is most obvious in Figures 1D, 2A, 2B, 3C, 4B – measurements from multiple dendrites of one neuron are each an 'n' in the statistics reported. My criteria is typically 3 independent experiments (rather than 2 as indicated here), with the same trend obvious in all three experiments. It is context dependent on whether individual neurons in this style of experiment are considered as biological 'n' or technical replicate, and I am happy to agree that individual cells in in vitro single cell experiments (as these are) are biological replicates. However, I don't believe that different dendrites from the same neuron can be considered as additional 'n' in these experiments. The 'n' should be the number of neurons assessed, not the number of dendrites. I would appreciate the statistics to be recalculated to reflect this.</p><p>Figure 3B is very unconvincing. Were biological replicates carried out? In the blot that is shown the FMRP bands are clearly different weights. Figure 5E on the other hand is much more convincing so I strongly suggest repeating this experiment and replacing the blot. Also, the images have been aggressively cropped – I would appreciate larger view of the blot, even if just in the supplement.</p><p>Again, Figure 3C is very unconvincing. The biggest change is a tendency towards more movement with motor knock down. However, most problematic is that the kymographs don't display any of the movement highlighted underneath, which gives me major questions about what was being quantified in the first place. It appears that far more than 30% of the signal is stationary and it is difficult to make out any movement at all. The ratio numbers that appear in the text (subsection “Differential functions of KIF5A and KIF5B in dendritic transport of FMRP”) don't match the data at all and I don't understand how they were arrived at. At the very least there needs to be some work on how the kymographs are displayed. The authors’ conclusions are the opposite to mine: the changes are broadly similar, particularly looking at the lower panel of 3C.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53456.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

As pointed out by the reviewer, our present study has not elucidated how KIF5B precisely affects dendritic spine density and spine dynamics. This is because a single kinesin motor can transport diverse cargoes, including RNA-binding proteins, ion channels and scaffolding proteins. In this study we use FMRP as a dendritic cargo to demonstrate the differential binding to KIF5A and KIF5B and the consequences of their knockdown on its dendritic transport. Despite previous studies showing an important function of FMRP on dendritic spine morphogenesis, we do not think the effect of KIF5B deficiency is attributed solely to the defective transport of FMRP. Likewise, the impaired synaptic plasticity and memory of the KIF5B conditional knockout mice is likely a summative consequence of transport deficits of multiple cargoes. This notion is consistent with other studies that investigate learning and synaptic plasticity of mice deficient in a specific kinesin, in which there is no demonstration that manipulating a specific cargo of the particular kinesin can reverse the synaptic or behavioural deficits (for example, Yin et al., 2011 Neuron; Kondo et al., 2012 Neuron; Muhia et al., 2016 Cell Rep.; Gromova et al., 2018 Cell Rep.). However, without delineating the precise molecular underpinnings of how KIF5B deficiency leads to synaptic and cognitive impairment, we believe the current study is still important as it has employed multiple approaches to comprehensively demonstrate a previously unidentified specific role of KIF5B in dendritic spine morphogenesis, synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. Furthermore, we have strengthened our manuscript by performing multiple new electrophysiological experiments to characterize the altered synaptic functions of KIF5B deficient neurons according to the reviewer’s suggestions (please see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Many of the data for dendritic spine density are not supported.

Accordingly, we have performed whole-cell patch recording on the CA1 neurons of acute hippocampal slices of wild-type and KIF5B conditional knockout mice. In addition to the reduction of dendritic spines, we found that the KIF5B conditional knockout neurons exhibit decrease in mEPSC frequency and amplitude as compared to the wild-type control (new Figure 7D of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 8 tries to associate learning-related behavioral tests with the reduced hippocampal LTP.

Both properties are not significantly different across the two genotypes, indicating similar presynaptic and basal synaptic responses between the wild-type and KIF5B conditional knockout neurons. The new data has been added in the new Figure 8F-G of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The authors need clearly describe the differential effects of KIF5A, KIF5B and KIF5C on dendritic spine morphogenesis.

The authors need to reorganize the manuscript to significantly strength the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank for the reviewer’s suggestion. Although KIF5C also has a potential role in spine morphogenesis as indicated by the significant reduction in density of mushroom and thin spines after shRNA-mediated knockdown, only KIF5B-shRNA changes the percentage of different spine types by increasing the density of filopodia, thin and stubby spines. Moreover, knockdown of KIF5B resulted in significant reduction in the frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic current (mEPSC), while knockdown of KIF5C caused modest reduction in mEPSC frequency and the difference was not statistically significant from control shRNA. Therefore, knockdown of KIF5B results in more profound changes in spine morphogenesis and synaptic transmission than KIF5C knockdown. The rescue experiments show that expression of KIF5C can reverse the loss of mushroom spines induced by KIF5B-shRNA, indicating that KIF5C functions like KIF5B in promoting dendritic spine development. However, in the conditional knockout mice in which KIF5B expression is reduced but KIF5C expression remains unaffected, reduction in both spine density and mEPSC is observed in the hippocampal neurons. Therefore, the deficiency of KIF5B on synaptic function cannot be compensated by KIF5C in the brain. One possible explanation is that KIF5B is the more prominently expressed kinesin compared to KIF5C in the adult hippocampus as shown by quantitative immunoblot (Kanai et al., 2000). The presence of KIF5C may not be sufficient to compensate for the shortage of motor proteins after about 50% reduction of KIF5B expression in the conditional knockout mice. We have extended the description of the differential effects of KIF5A, KIF5B and KIF5C depletion on spine morphogenesis and mEPSC in the Results section and added the discussion on the roles of KIF5C in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Many dendritic specific mRNAs such as CamKIIɑ have been suggested as the cargo associated with FMRP granule.

Accordingly we have performed fluorescence in situhybridization to examine the expression of two FMRP targets, namely CaMKIIα and Grin2b mRNAs, in dissociated hippocampal neurons after introducing shRNA targeting either KIF5A or KIF5B. Consistent with the findings of FMRP live-imaging, knockdown of KIF5B but not KIF5A significantly reduced the number of CaMKIIα and Grin2b mRNA puncta on the dendrites (new Figure 3E of the revised manuscript), thereby supporting the role of KIF5B in the dendritic targeting of FMRP and its mRNA cargoes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) FLAG-KIF5 pull-down assay (Figures 4 and 5) are absolutely suspected.

It would be more appropriate to use GST-fused KIF5 purification and GST pull-down assay to support the author's points.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have replaced with FLAG pull-down data by that of new GST pull-down experiments to show the differential binding of different KIF5s to various cargoes (new Figure 3B of the revised manuscript). We have kept the data on FLAG pull-down experiments in Figure 5E, because in this experiment we aim to compare the binding between wild-type and methylation-deficient mutant of KIF5B to FMRP and G3BP1. Since bacteria lack arginine methylation (Gary and Clarke, 1998 Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol.), we use HEK-293T cells to express the KIF5 constructs in order to examine the effect of arginine methylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It has been well established that KIF17 is essential for dendritic localization of NR2B during learning and memory. What are the effects of KIF5B knockdown or knockout on the expression of KIF17 and its cargos in dendrites? Experiments and discussion should be included to address this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Accordingly, we have performed Western blot to compare the expression of KIF17 in the brains of wild-type and KIF5B conditional knockout mice. As shown in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 2, the expression of KIF17 in KIF5B conditional knockout brain is not significantly different from wild-type, indicating that the KIF5B conditional knockout does not affect KIF17 expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors have made an elegant conditional mouse model revealing the importance of KIF5B for memory formation. They also show some interesting protein-protein interaction studies detailing differences between KIF5A and KIF5B tails. I agree with the authors that the isoform diversity of microtubule motors in neurons is understudied and important for the understanding of neuronal function, and this work is potentially highly significant in demonstrating some aspects of this and I support its publication. However, there is a tendency to mis-cite or exclude previous work in other model systems, which I don't believe is necessary and in fact weakens the main claims of their paper by doing so.</p><p>My main concerns are outlined below – I note that I can't offer much interpretation on whether the behavioral experiments reach standards set in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank for the reviewer’s comments that our work is potentially highly significant. We sincerely apologize for the mis-citation of previous work, which is not intentional but mainly because we have not defined the different domains and the “carboxyl-terminus” clearly. We have taken the reviewer’s suggestion to extensively revise the text in order to clarify the definition of different domains and cited the relevant references where appropriate (please see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Points:</p><p>Though there are discrepancies in the literature about whether the KLC binding region of the KHC is labelled as 'stalk' or 'tail', there is a general consensus that everything predicted to be coiled coil is termed stalk and this includes residues up to residue 758 at the least and often incorporates up to residue 810; the C-terminus of KIF5 is not typically termed &quot;cargo binding&quot; until after the region that binds to KLC. The second stalk coil of kinesin has been termed 'stalk' since at least Friedman and Vale, 1999, if not before. It is imperative that the authors adjust Figure 3A, Figure 4A and Figure 5A to reflect this and adjust their nomenclature throughout the manuscript to reflect this (For example the Abstract: &quot;conserved cargo-binding domains&quot; directly contradicts: &quot;by their diverse carboxyl-terminal tails&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer’s suggestions. In Figure 3A of the original manuscript, the schematic diagram denoting various KIF5 domains was made according to the study by Setou et al., 2002. In that study, the “cargo-binding domain” of KIF5A is defined as residue 807-934 based on the binding to GRIP1, and this region is very conserved among KIF5A, 5B and 5C (more than 80% amino acid identity). In contrast, the “diverse carboxyl-terminal tail” in our manuscript specifically refers to the region beyond residue 934 until the last amino acid. This “tail” region, which determines the functional specificity revealed by our study, is highly diverse among the three KIF5s. Therefore in our original manuscript the “conserved cargo-binding domain” and “diverse carboxyl-tail” refer to different and non-overlapping regions, and they together constitute the “tail domain” defined by Friedman and Vale, 1999. We apologize for the poor definition of different regions in the original manuscript that caused the confusion. In line with the reviewer’s recommendation, we now adopt the definition of the different domains based on Friedman and Vale, 1999, and revise the schematic diagram (new Figure 3A) to correct the positions of the stalk domain (until residue 801 of KIF5A, which includes the second coiled-coil) and the tail domain, as well as adding the KLC-binding domain (a.a. 771-801 for KIF5A). To avoid confusion, we have now used the term “carboxyl-terminus” throughout the revised manuscript to define the diverse regions of the three KIF5s (a.a. 934-1027 for KIF5A; a.a. 936-963 for KIF5B; and a.a. 937-956 for KIF5C; new Figure 3A, 4A, 5A) and to distinguish them from the “tail domain” defined by Friedman and Vale.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction: &quot;However, the three KIF5s have long been considered to be functionally redundant&quot; – the cargo binding domains are not homologous, and this statement is a misrepresentation of other work in the field. Although there are studies that show some functional redundancy in some contexts (including this paper), there are others that show specificity e.g. Campbell et al., 2014. Please adjust this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified the statement to “Functional redundancy has been demonstrated among the three KIF5s, as exogenous expression of KIF5A or KIF5C can rescue the impaired mitochondrial transport in cells lacking KIF5B (Kanai et al., 2000). […] Furthermore, only KIF5A dysfunction leads to seizure and the neuromuscular disorder Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (Fink, 2013; Nakajima et al., 2012).”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion paragraph two: An assertion that KIF5s carboxy tails do not bind directly to cargo. This is exactly the opposite of what the papers cited show (direct binding to GRIP1 and HAP1 respectively). I also point the authors towards several other papers that show direct binding to the crago binding tail of kinesin: Xu et al., 2010; Chen and Sheng, 2013 (JCB); Randall et al., 2013 (FEBS letters); Cho et al., 2009 (EMBO reports); there are yet others. Therefore, it is imperative that the authors alter their assertion that this is a new function of the KIF5 tail.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize again for the confusion here. As pointed out in the earlier response, the “carboxyl tail” in our original manuscript specifically refers to residues 936 to 963 of KIF5B, which represents the carboxyl-terminal portion of a larger “tail” defined by Friedman and Vale, 1999. We now re-name it as “carboxyl-terminus” in the revised manuscript, and we think that this region (KIF5B936-963) does not bind directly to cargo because GST-KIF5B constructs lacking this region still pull down multiple cargoes (e.g. Setou et al., 2002 Nature; Cho et al., 2007 Traffic; Xu et al., 2010 J. Neurosci.; Barry et al., 2014 Dev. Cell; Lin et al., 2019 iScience). Our present study also suggests that this carboxyl-terminus is not for cargo binding because removing it (a.a. 940-1027) from KIF5A increases, rather than decreases, the pull-down of FMRP (Figure 4A). However, substituting this carboxyl terminus of KIF5A by that of KIF5B is sufficient to transform KIF5A into a kinesin motor that enhances mushroom spine morphogenesis (Figure 4B). We therefore define the carboxyl-terminus (KIF5B936-963) as a crucial determinant for functional specificity, which to our knowledge has not been reported and represents a new function for this region. We have included this discussion on the functional significance of the carboxyl-terminus in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear how reproducible the shRNA knock-down in Figure 1 really is. There are no errors bars in the supplement and no clear indication of how many times the quantification of knockdown was performed. I understand that transfection efficiency can be very low in these experiments however if this is highly variable then it has large implications for interpreting the rest of the paper. Neurons expressing GFP should be expressing the shRNA, and as the authors have isoform specific endogenous antibodies, I request quantification of knock down by quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank for the reviewer’s suggestion. We have now performed three independent experiments to knockdown down individual KIF5 in cortical neurons by nucleofection, and the quantification was statistically analyzed to show the knockdown efficiency and specificity (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). In addition, we have confirmed the knockdown efficiency of KIF5B-shRNA by immunofluorescence staining after introduction into hippocampal neurons by immunofluorescence microscopy (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).</p><p><italic>Through the cellular work in the paper, there seems to be a confusion around what should constitute a biological replicate and a technical replicate. This is most obvious in Figures 1D, 2A, 2B, 3C, 4B – measurements from multiple dendrites of one neuron are each an 'n' in the statistics reported. My criteria is typically 3 independent experiments (rather than 2 as indicated here), with the same trend obvious in all three experiments. It is context dependent on whether individual neurons in this style of experiment are considered as biological 'n' or technical replicate, and I am happy to agree that individual cells in</italic> in vitro <italic>single cell experiments (as these are) are biological replicates. However, I don't believe that different dendrites from the same neuron can be considered as additional 'n' in these experiments. The 'n' should be the number of neurons assessed, not the number of dendrites. I would appreciate the statistics to be recalculated to reflect this.</italic></p><p>We thank and agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that biological replicates should be defined as individual neurons. Accordingly, we have performed additional experiments such that all the relevant analyses of dendritic spines and FMRP or RNA granules in primary neurons are quantification from three independent experiments, and the “n” is the number of neurons instead of number of dendrites. The quantification method is now clarified in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript. The recalculated sample sizes and statistical analyses are also included in the figure legend of the new Figure 1D, 2A, 2B, 3D, 3E and 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3B is very unconvincing. Were biological replicates carried out? In the blot that is shown the FMRP bands are clearly different weights. Figure 5E on the other hand is much more convincing so I strongly suggest repeating this experiment and replacing the blot. Also the images have been aggressively cropped – I would appreciate larger view of the blot, even if just in the supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the response to reviewer #2 (major point 3), we have repeated the pull-down experiments by performing new GST-pull down experiments to show the differential binding of different KIF5s to the cargoes, and the size of the FMRP bands pulled down by different KIF5s are consistent. As a result, the original Figure 3B has now been replaced (new Figure 3B in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again, Figure 3C is very unconvincing. The biggest change is a tendency towards more movement with motor knock down. However, most problematic is that the kymographs don't display any of the movement highlighted underneath, which gives me major questions about what was being quantified in the first place. It appears that far more than 30% of the signal is stationary and it is difficult to make out any movement at all. The ratio numbers that appear in the text (subsection “Differential functions of KIF5A and KIF5B in dendritic transport of FMRP”) don't match the data at all and I don't understand how they were arrived at. At the very least there needs to be some work on how the kymographs are displayed. The authors’ conclusions are the opposite to mine: the changes are broadly similar, particularly looking at the lower panel of 3C.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank for the reviewer’s comments. Our observation that most of the FMRP granules are stationary or oscillatory with little movement is consistent with previous studies on the movement of RNA granules by Kosik’s laboratory (Knowles et al., 1996 J. Neurosci.; Rook et al., 2000 J. Neurosci.) and RNA-binding proteins (Mitsumori et al., 2017). Those relatively immotile FMRP granules mask the minority of granules that undergo greater movement. We have now replaced the representative images with those that show clearer movement of granules and indicate the different types of granules with lines of different colours. We have explicitly defined the movement of the five different types of granules and added the detailed definition in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript. We have also performed additional experiments and re-analyzed the data. The new live-imaging data (new Figure 3C-D) indicates that the number of FMRP granules in the dendrites is significantly reduced after knockdown of KIF5B but not KIF5A. The new data also shows that KIF5B knockdown specifically reduces the number of stationary granules. Since other kinesins besides KIF5 can also bind to FMRP (Charalambous et al., 2013; Davidovic et al., 2007), we speculate that the different pools of FMRP granules are carried by different KIFs, with KIF5B mainly responsible for the less motile granules and while other KIFs transport the more motile pools of FMRP. The immobility of RNA granules on dendrites might be important for their local translation (Doyle and Kiebler, 2011 EMBO J), and it is possible that besides a conventional transport function, KIF5B may help to anchor the dendritically localized FMRP and mRNAs near synapses for local translation in response to extracellular stimulus. The preferential effect on stationary granules after KIF5B knockdown has been discussed in the revised manuscript. To further support the role of KIF5B in dendritic transport of FMRP, we have performed new in situ hybridization experiments to demonstrate the reduced FMRP mRNA cargoes (CaMKIIα and Grin2b) in dendrites after knockdown of KIF5B but not KIF5A (new Figure 3E).</p></body></sub-article></article>
