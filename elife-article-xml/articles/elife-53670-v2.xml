Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) differ in the lengths and sequences of disordered linkers connecting the kinase domains to the oligomeric hubs of the holoenzyme. CaMKII activity depends on the balance between activating and inhibitory autophosphorylation (on Thr 286 and Thr 305/306, respectively, in the human α isoform). Variation in the linkers could alter transphosphorylation rates within a holoenzyme and the balance of autophosphorylation outcomes. We show, using mammalian cell expression and a single-molecule assay, that the balance of autophosphorylation is flipped between CaMKII variants with longer and shorter linkers. For the principal isoforms in the brain, CaMKII-α, with a ~30 residue linker, readily acquires activating autophosphorylation, while CaMKII-β, with a ~200 residue linker, is biased towards inhibitory autophosphorylation. Our results show how the responsiveness of CaMKII holoenzymes to calcium signals can be tuned by varying the relative levels of isoforms with long and short linkers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-molecule microscopy</kwd><kwd>CaMKII isoforms</kwd><kwd>autophosphorylation</kwd><kwd>flexible linker</kwd><kwd>phosphatase resistance</kwd><kwd>kinase activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99 GM 126145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhattacharyya</surname><given-names>Moitrayee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuriyan</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Differences in the flexible linkers connecting the kinase domain to an oligomeric hub modulate CaMKII activity by changing the balance between activating and inhibitory autophosphorylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A characteristic feature of signaling by protein kinases is that the kinases are themselves regulated by phosphorylation. For most kinases, this involves the phosphorylation of one or more residues in the activation loop, a regulatory element located at the active site of the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huse and Kuriyan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nolen et al., 2004</xref>). An exception is provided by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), an enzyme that has crucial roles in animal-cell signaling, particularly in the brain and in cardiac tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayer and Schulman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharyya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Griffith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hudmon and Schulman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kennedy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lisman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stratton et al., 2013</xref>). CaMKII has no phosphorylation sites within its activation loop. Instead, the activity of CaMKII is modulated by autophosphorylation on two sites, Thr 286 and Thr 305/306 (residue numbering corresponds to the sequence of human CaMKII-α), both located in a regulatory segment that immediately follows the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,d</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structural organization and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent activation of CaMKII.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) CaMKII is organized as a holoenzyme with kinase domains connected to a central dodecameric/tetradecameric hub by a regulatory segment and a flexible linker, referred to as the kinase-hub linker.

We refer to Thr 286 phosphorylation as activating phosphorylation, since it prolongs the active state. In contrast, phosphorylation on Thr 305/306 is inhibitory, because it blocks the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colbran, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanson and Schulman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hashimoto et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lou and Schulman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patton et al., 1990</xref>).

The four isoforms of human CaMKII, denoted α, β, γ, and δ, and their ~ 40 splice variants, differ principally in the lengths and sequences of the kinase-hub linkers. The kinase and the hub domains of these isoforms share about 90% and 80% sequence identity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tombes et al., 2003</xref>). The kinase-hub linkers are highly conserved for a given CaMKII isoform, indicating that there are important isoform-specific roles for these linkers, but what these are is not understood. CaMKII-α and CaMKII-δ have linkers spanning 31 residues each, while CaMKII-β and CaMKII-γ have longer linkers (218 and 110 residues, respectively, in their principal variants). The sequences of the CaMKII kinase-hub linkers are consistent with their being intrinsically disordered, leading to dynamic variability in the disposition of the kinase domains with respect to the central hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Myers et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our current understanding of the autoregulation of CaMKII is based on studies that have focused primarily on CaMKII-α, and it has been assumed that the other three isoforms function similarly. The regulatory segment of CaMKII blocks the kinase active site in the basal state, and this inhibition is released by the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM) to the regulatory segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM facilitates the <italic>trans-</italic>autophosphorylation of Thr 286 within the regulatory segment of one CaMKII subunit by the activated kinase domain of another subunit in the same holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rich and Schulman, 1998</xref>). How the balance of phosphorylation between the activating and inhibitory sites is controlled in the different isoforms of CaMKII is poorly understood.</p><p>We developed a single-molecule assay to measure the phosphorylation status of CaMKII expressed in mammalian cells. In this assay, CaMKII is fused to an N-terminal fluorescent protein (a monomeric variant of enhanced GFP, mEGFP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cormack et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zacharias et al., 2002</xref>) and to a biotin tag, enabling the capture and visualization, by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, of individual CaMKII holoenzymes on a glass slide coated with streptavidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Since CaMKII is captured directly from the cell lysate, this procedure avoids difficulties in expressing and purifying various isoforms of CaMKII, particularly those with longer linkers. In addition, the use of a flow cell allows CaMKII holoenzymes to be activated under different reaction conditions after immobilization on glass. Site-specific antibodies that recognize phosphorylated Thr 286 (pThr 286) or phosphorylated Thr 305/Thr 306 (pThr 305/306) can be used to probe the extent of phosphorylation on activating and inhibitory sites on individual holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mammalian expression-based single-molecule Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) assay.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic diagram showing the experimental setup. Biotinylated mEGFP-CaMKII overexpressed in HEK 293T cells was pulled down directly from diluted cell lysate, allowing visualization at a single-molecule resolution. The immobilization onto glass substrates functionalized with streptavidin relies on the interaction between biotinylated CaMKII and streptavidin.

This is consistent with expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baucum et al., 2015</xref>). Unexpectedly, CaMKII-β, with a longer ~200 residue linker, undergoes robust inhibitory autophosphorylation on Thr 305/306, with less activating phosphorylation on Thr 286. We also monitored autophosphorylation for an artificial construct of CaMKII that is identical to CaMKII-α, except that the kinase-hub linker is replaced by a 218-residue linker from CaMKII-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The autophosphorylation pattern for this construct resembles that of CaMKII-β, showing that the difference in activating and inhibitory autophosphorylation between the two isoforms is due entirely to differences in the kinase-hub linkers.</p><p>When CaMKII is inactivated after activation, by removing Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ATP, we found that the dephosphorylation by phosphatases of activating phosphorylation at Thr 286 is much slower than dephosphorylation of inhibitory phosphorylation at Thr 305/306, which is fast. The protection of activating phosphorylation and the rapid reversal of inhibitory phosphorylation by phosphatases allows CaMKII to act as an integrator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses in cells. CaMKII-α and CaMKII-β can assemble to form mixed holoenzymes, with the balance between activating and inhibitory autophosphorylation determined by the ratio of the two isoforms. Thus, the calcium responsiveness of CaMKII holoenzymes can be tuned by varying the relative levels of the two isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A single-molecule assay for measuring CaMKII autophosphorylation</title><p>We designed a single-molecule assay to measure autophosphorylation of CaMKII, relying on immediate capture of the holoenzyme after lysis of mammalian cells overexpressing CaMKII (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This procedure is based on a general single-molecule immunofluorescence assay reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jain et al., 2011</xref>). Our assay enables the rapid isolation of CaMKII for single-molecule analysis while minimizing heterogeneity that can result from proteolysis or aggregation during conventional purification. In this assay, GFP-CaMKII holoenzymes, whether or not phosphorylated, are detected with 488 nm laser excitation (green channel). The phosphorylation levels on Thr 286 and Thr 305/306 are monitored using phosphospecific antibodies labeled with Alexa-594 or Alexa-647, detected with 561 nm (red channel) or 640 nm laser excitation (purple channel), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>); see Materials and methods. Representative three-color TIRF images from these experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>.</p><p>We quantify the extent of phosphorylation in two ways. First, we measure the fraction of CaMKII holoenzymes that show detectable phosphorylation at Thr 286, regardless of the extent of phosphorylation, by monitoring the co-localization of green and red spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). To quantify the extent of activating phosphorylation per holoenzyme, we compile intensity distributions for pThr 286 (red channel), taking into account both holoenzymes that are phosphorylated and those that show no detectable phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, see Materials and methods for the details of normalization). The integrated intensity of the pThr 286 signal, normalized by the total number of holoenzymes detected (i.e., the number of green spots), reflects the mean level of phosphorylation per holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Phosphorylation at Thr 305/306 is quantified similarly, using the appropriate antibody.</p><p>We used this assay to measure autophosphorylation levels for CaMKII upon activation. Human CaMKII-α overexpressed in HEK 293T cells and captured from cell lysate is in an inactive state, with no detectable phosphorylation at Thr 286 or Thr 305/306 (data not shown). We activated CaMKII-α by flowing Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ATP over the glass coverslip to which the captured holoenzymes are tethered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Increasing the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM from 20 nM to 5 μM, while maintaining a constant saturating concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (100 μM), resulted in the detection of increasing levels of phosphorylation at Thr 286 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref>). The EC<sub>50</sub> value for CaMKII-α activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM derived from these measurements is in the range of 50–100 nM.

We first activated CaMKII-α on glass, as before, and then washed away the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. This was followed by the addition of ATP to the flow cell. ATP treatment of pre-activated CaMKII led to robust phosphorylation of CaMKII-α on Thr 305/306, at levels comparable to that for CaMKII-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1 (a-c)</xref>).</p><p>We found that the differences in autophosphorylation between the α and β isoforms are due entirely to the differences in the kinase-hub linkers. We created an artificial CaMKII construct in which the kinase-hub linker in CaMKII-α is replaced by that from CaMKII-β (we refer to this construct as CaMKII-β*, because the most distinctive difference between the two isoforms is the nature of the kinase-hub linker, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The autophosphorylation pattern for CaMKII-β* is essentially the same as for CaMKII-β. Each CaMKII-β* holoenzyme exhibits about 5-fold greater phosphorylation of Thr 305/306 than is the case for CaMKII-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>-right), with about 95% of the CaMKII-β* holoenzymes showing detectable phosphorylation at pThr 305/306.

The sequences flanking the phosphosites being probed by the antibodies are the same in CaMKII-β* and CaMKII-α, whereas there are a few small differences in sequence between CaMKII-β and CaMKII-α in these regions. Thus, when comparing CaMKII-β* to CaMKII-α, observed differences in autophosphorylation are not due to differences in the affinities of the antibodies for their cognate sites.</p><p>We also tested two other isoforms, CaMKII-γ (110-residue kinase-hub linker) and CaMKII-δ (31-residue kinase-hub linker). We created surrogates for the two isoforms using CaMKII-α, denoted as CaMKII-γ* and CaMKII-δ*. As for CaMKII-β*, the kinase-hub linker in CaMKII-α is replaced with those from the γ and δ isoforms, respectively, in these surrogates. The results for CaMKII-γ*, with the long linker, resemble those for CaMKII-β/CaMKII-β* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Likewise, the results for CaMKII-δ*, with the short linker, resemble those for CaMKII-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The sequences of the linkers in the four CaMKII isoforms are very different, and so these results suggest that linker length alone is an important determinant of phosphorylation outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>This conclusion was further reinforced by studying a naturally occurring splice-variant of CaMKII-β (CaMKII-β’E) that has a 55-residue linker, created by deletion of 155 residues. We also designed a construct where this truncated linker from CaMKII-β’E replaced the linker in CaMKII-α (CaMKII-β’E*). For both these constructs, we see a decrease in inhibitory phosphorylation and a small increase in activating phosphorylation when compared to CaMKII-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a–b</xref>). As an additional control, we designed a construct of CaMKII-β in which the kinase-hub linker was replaced by that of CaMKII-α (CaMKII-α*). The autophosphorylation outcome for CaMKII-α* is similar to that for CaMKII-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c</xref>).</p><p>CaMKII-α and CaMKII-β can assemble into mixed holoenzymes containing both isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brocke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thiagarajan et al., 2002</xref>).

Samples were pulled down from this reaction mixture at defined time points, and the phosphorylation at Thr 286 and Thr 305/306 was measured using the single-molecule assay.

Subsequent treatment with 25 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ATP does not result in a marked increase in the extent of Thr 286 phosphorylation per holoenzyme. In contrast, ~40% of CaMKII-β* holoenzymes show detectable phosphorylation at Thr 305/306 after treatment with sub-saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, compared to ~2% before (data not shown). Thus, in contrast to CaMKII-α holoenzymes, CaMKII-β holoenzymes tend to become inactivated when subjected to subthreshold levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, rather than undergoing priming for further activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>CaMKII is unusual among protein kinases because it is assembled into a large holoenzyme with twelve to fourteen subunits. Analysis of the phosphorylation status of the enzyme using bulk assays, such as Western blots, has been challenging due to difficulties in purifying the holoenzymes, particularly for isoforms with longer kinase-hub linkers. In addition, bulk measurements do not provide a window into the extent of phosphorylation per holoenzyme. To overcome these limitations, we designed a single-molecule TIRF microscopy assay that relies on the capture from mammalian cell lysates of CaMKII holoenzymes tagged with fluorescent proteins. Immobilization of the captured holoenzymes in a flow-cell apparatus allows activation and dephosphorylation of CaMKII to be carried out readily, followed by measurement of the phosphorylation status using fluorescently labeled site-specific antibodies. Using this assay, we discovered that CaMKII-α and CaMKII-β, the two major isoforms in the brain, differ in the balance of activating and inhibitory phosphorylation. CaMKII-α, with a shorter linker, readily acquires activating phosphorylation, while CaMKII-β, with a longer linker, is biased towards inhibitory phosphorylation. We also tested the effects on autophosphorylation of the kinase-hub linkers from CaMKII-γ (110 residues) and CaMKII-δ (31 residues). The shorter CaMKII-δ linker behaves like that of CaMKII-α in terms of autophosphorylation outcome. The outcome for the longer CaMKII-γ linker is closer to that seen with the CaMKII-β linker.</p><p>The difference in autophosphorylation balance between CaMKII-α and CaMKII-β can be explained by the fact that Thr 286 can only be autophosphorylated in trans, between two kinase domains, since this residue is located too far from the active site of the subunit of which it is a part. Phosphorylation of Thr 286 is known to occur predominantly through <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation within a holoenzyme, rather than phosphorylation between different holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rich and Schulman, 1998</xref>). In contrast, inhibitory phosphorylation on Thr 305/306 can occur either in cis or in trans. We expect that the longer linker length in CaMKII-β results in a reduction in the rate of <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation of Thr 286, while the rate of <italic>cis</italic>-autophosphorylation of Thr 305/306 is the same for CaMKII-α and CaMKII-β. As the kinase-hub linker length increases, the rate of activating <italic>trans</italic>-phosphorylation decreases, which switches the balance towards inhibitory phosphorylation in CaMKII-β. The switch is expected to be sharpened by the fact that inhibitory autophosphorylation blocks Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding, thereby preventing activating phosphorylation.</p><p>There is a parallel between the architecture of CaMKII and A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which are connected to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) by long flexible linkers. It has been suggested that the length and flexibility of the AKAP linker determines the spatial range over which PKA can phosphorylate its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Since CaMKII holoenzymes are anchored within the post-synaptic density, the differences in the lengths of the kinase-hub linkers in different isoforms may likewise control the spatial extent of substrate phosphorylation enabled by the activation of a particular CaMKII holoenzyme. Our work has now revealed a key difference between CaMKII and AKAP:PKA complexes, which is that the kinase-hub linker length in CaMKII can control the activation status of the holoenzyme, not just the spatial range of the kinase.</p><p>Our experiments show that activating phosphorylation on Thr 286 is resistant to dephosphorylation, whereas inhibitory phosphorylation on Thr 305/306 is reversed rapidly. This suggests that the phosphate group on Thr 286 is somehow protected from phosphatases. The protection afforded to pThr 286 is released by the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, suggesting that the calmodulin-binding element of CaMKII adopts a conformation that protects pThr 286 in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. The presence of such a conformational change may explain the apparent discrepancy between our results and studies reporting that pThr 286 undergoes very rapid dephosphorylation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). The conclusion that pThr 286 is rapidly dephosphorylated relied on the utilization of a FRET-based sensor, Camui (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takao et al., 2005</xref>), which reports on conformational changes undergone by CaMKII, and does not report on phosphorylation directly. It will be interesting to see whether the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM from CaMKII after activation results in a compaction of CaMKII that might explain both the protection of pThr 286 that we observe and the rapid relaxation back to a compact state that is reported by the Camui sensor.</p><p>The observed resistance of pThr 286 to rapid dephosphorylation by phosphatases can enable CaMKII activity to persist for some time after the decay of Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses. In addition, CaMKII subunits that are phosphorylated on Thr 286 have higher affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, which can facilitate the rebinding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM during subsequent pulses of calcium. Due to the cooperativity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding to CaMKII, such a priming mechanism enables CaMKII holoenzymes that have retained some activating phosphorylation to rapidly reacquire higher levels of phosphorylation, even in the presence of subthreshold concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. This may enable the history of synaptic activity, including the frequency and the gaps between periods of activity, to be encoded in CaMKII.</p><p>There are differences in the expression levels of CaMKII-α and CaMKII-β in neurons and these levels can be regulated by synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thiagarajan et al., 2002</xref>). Differences in these levels can result in differences in cellular targeting and stimulus frequency responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Koninck and Schulman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen et al., 1998</xref>). We now show that expression level differences between isoforms can also result in changing the balance of activating and inhibitory autophosphorylation. The lower inhibitory autophosphorylation of CaMKII-α relative to that in CaMKII-β can have a number of consequences. Autophosphorylation of the inhibitory site reduces binding of CaMKII-α to the postsynaptic density (PSD) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Strack et al., 1997</xref>). By contrast, abrogation of such autophosphorylation greatly reduces dissociation of the kinase from PSD in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen and Meyer, 1999</xref>) and increases PSD binding in transgenic animals, thereby altering synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elgersma et al., 2002</xref>). The rapid inhibitory phosphorylation of CaMKII-β, on the other hand, limits binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, which is required for dissociation of the kinase from F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen and Meyer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), an important step in structural remodeling of the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Our results show that by varying the relative expression levels of α and β-isoforms, the cell can generate CaMKII heterooligomers with variable response to activating signals, thereby fine-tuning the response of CaMKII to Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike trains in the brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>human</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CaMKII-α</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Uniprot_ID: Q9UQM7</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>human</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CaMKII-β</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Uniprot_ID: Q13554</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>human</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CaMKII-β’E</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Uniprot_ID: Q13554-3</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>human</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CaMKII-γ</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Uniprot_ID: Q13555</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>human</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CaMKII-δ</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Uniprot_ID: Q13557</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pET21a-BirA</td><td valign="top">Addgene</td><td valign="top">plasmid # 20857</td><td valign="top">for biotinylation of the AVI tag in HEK 293T cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">EYFP-CaM</td><td valign="top">Addgene</td><td valign="top">plasmid # 47603</td><td valign="top">coexpressed for in cell activation of CaMKII</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pEGFP-C1 (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">Clontech, Mountain View, CA</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">vector backbone for inserting the CaMKII genes</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pSNAP<sub>f</sub> (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">New England Biolabs, MA</td><td valign="top">N9183S</td><td valign="top">vector backbone</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>human</italic>)</td><td>HEK 293T</td><td>UC Berkeley cell culture facility</td><td/><td>authenticated using STR profiling and tested negative for mycoplasma</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CaMKII (phospho T286);

The immobilized, activated and unactivated CaMKII holoenzyme was incubated with a mixture of these two phosphospecific primary antibodies (in a 1:1 ratio using a 1:500 dilution in 5% (w/v) BSA) for 45 min. Subsequently, excess primary antibodies were washed out with 3 mL DPBS. This was followed by a 30 min incubation with a 1:1 mix of Alexa-labeled secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution in 5% BSA), that are complementary to the primary antibodies used. Anti-mouse secondary antibody labeled with Alexa-594 (Cell Signaling Technology) was used for pThr 286-specific primary antibody; anti-rabbit secondary antibody labeled with Alexa-647 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) was used for the pThr 305/306-specific primary antibody. After incubation with the secondary antibody, the flow chambers were washed again using 3 mL of DPBS and the samples were imaged using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Validation of the primary antibodies</title><p>The two primary antibodies for pThr 286 and pThr 305/306 do not cross-react with each other’s target sites, as shown by mutations in their respective epitopes (T<sup>286</sup> is mutated to A<sup>286</sup> and the epitope for the Thr 305/306 primary antibody is changed from T<sup>305</sup>T<sup>306</sup>MLATRNFS to A<sup>305</sup>V<sup>306</sup>I) in CaMKII-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These primary antibodies also do not show any reactivity with the unactivated forms of CaMKII-α or CaMKII-β, as pulled down from the cell lysate and before any treatment with activation buffer (data not shown). Additionally, the primary antibody incubation time was optimized so that the phosphosites were nearly saturated by their respective antibodies and we chose the incubation time to be 45 min in all our assays (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Phosphatase assay when the kinase is active</title><p>To test how the presence of phosphatase affects the phosphorylation status of CaMKII when the kinase is active, increasing amounts of λ-phosphatase (200–800 units, New England Biolabs) and 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> was added to samples of glass-immobilized CaMKII, in the presence of activation buffer containing 5 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. 1 unit of λ-phosphatase is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 nmol of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 1 min at 30°C (New England Biolabs). After 45 min of incubation, the flow chambers were washed with 2 mL DPBS to remove the λ-phosphatase and the activation buffer. The phosphorylation of Thr 286 and Thr 305/306 was then examined using the immunofluorescence assay described above. No further reduction in phosphorylation was observed upon adding more than 400 units of λ-phosphatase and this is considered as a saturating amount of phosphatase.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Phosphatase assay when the kinase activity is switched off</title><p>To test the sensitivity of the two autophosphorylation sites to phosphatases in the absence of kinase activity, activated CaMKII was treated with two different phosphatases, λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and PP1α (EMD Millipore, Burlington, MA). A phosphatase buffer that contains 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> and 400–800 units of λ-phosphatase or 800 units of PP1α was added to the flow chambers displaying activated CaMKII, after the activation buffer had been washed out. 1 unit of PP1α is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 nmol phosphate per minute from the phosphorylated substrate DiFMUP (6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate) (EMD Millipore). The dephosphorylation reactions were carried out for defined periods of time (3, 15, or 30 min), following which the phosphatase buffer was washed away with 2 mL DPBS and the autophosphorylation states were examined using the immunofluorescence assay described above.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Phosphatase assay in solution</title><p>The HEK 293T cell lysate was diluted by 1:100–200. CaMKII was activated in this diluted lysate (in solution) by adding an activation buffer containing 5 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and 5 mM Tris-buffered TCEP (Sigma-Aldrich). After activation for 45 min, 100 μM staurosporine (Abcam, ab120056) was added to this reaction mix to inhibit the kinase activity. After inhibiting CaMKII for 10 min, saturating amounts of λ-phosphatase (400 units) was added to the solution. Samples were pulled down after 3 or 15 min of incubation and the phosphorylation status on Thr 286 and Thr 305/306 was measured. We verified that 100 μM staurosporine was efficient in switching off kinase activity by activating CaMKII-α/β* in the presence of the inhibitor. This treatment completely abolished any autophosphorylation of Thr 286 or Thr 305/306 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Thr 286-phosphorylation recovery assay for CaMKII priming</title><p>Activated samples of glass-immobilized CaMKII were treated with saturating amounts of λ-phosphatase and 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> for 3–5 min, followed by washing away of the phosphatase buffer with 2 mL of DPBS. This sample was then incubated with an activation buffer (see details above) containing subthreshold concentrations of 25 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM for 30 min. The activation buffer was aspirated out with 2 mL DPBS and the phosphorylation status at the activating and inhibitory sites were measured.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy</title><p>Single-particle total internal reflection fluorescence images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-inverted microscope equipped with a Nikon 100 × 1.49 numerical aperture oil-immersion TIRF objective, a TIRF illuminator, a Perfect Focus system, and a motorized stage. Images were recorded using an Andor iXon electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera. The sample was illuminated using the LU-N4 laser unit (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with solid state lasers for the 488 nm, 561 nm and 640 nm channels. Lasers were controlled using a built-in acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF). The 405/488/561/638 nm Quad TIRF filter set (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, Vermont) was used along with supplementary emission filters of 525/50 m, 600/50 m, 700/75 m for 488 nm, 561 nm, 640 nm channel, respectively. 3-color image acquisition was performed by computer-controlled change of illumination and filter sets at 42 different positions from an initial reference frame, so as to capture multiple non-overlapping images. Image acquisition was done using the Nikon NIS-Elements software. mEGFP-CaMKII, Alexa-594-labeled anti-Thr 286 antibody, and Alexa-647-labeled anti-Thr 305/306 antibody were imaged by illuminating 488 nm laser set to 5.2 mW, 561 nm laser set to 6.9 mW, and 640 nm laser set to 7.8 mW, respectively. The laser power was measured with the field aperture fully opened. Images were acquired using an exposure time of 80 milliseconds for 488 nm and 561 nm, and an exposure time of 100 milliseconds for 640 nm. The only exception was for acquiring mCherry single-molecule images, where an exposure of 200 milliseconds was used. Epifluorescence images were also acquired using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-inverted microscope with a Nikon 20x objective and an Andor iXon electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera. A mercury arc lamp (Lumencor Tech., Beaverton, OR) was used for epifluorescence illumination at 488 and 561 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>Analyses of single-molecule TIRF data</title><p>Individual single particles in all three channels were detected and localized using the single particle tracking plugin TrackMate in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). The particles were localized with the Difference of Gaussian (DoG) detector with an initial diameter set to six pixels, typically leading to the detection of 25000–50000 particles per sample. The detection threshold value in TrackMate is set to 12 or 15 depending on the wavelength at which the image is acquired. The particles outside the center area of 350 × 350 pixel<sup>2</sup> were excluded due to heterogeneous TIRF illumination. No further filtering processes was applied in TrackMate.</p><p>Intensity distribution and fraction of holoenzymes showing any detectable phosphorylation were analyzed using custom in-house software written in MATLAB (these programs are provided as a source code file). For analyzing the fraction of holoenzymes that show any detectable phosphorylation at a given phosphosite, the XY-coordinates for each particle were extracted from the TrackMate data. For each mEGFP-CaMKII, distances to all the antibody particles were computed, and colocalization was identified if the inter-particle distance was below two pixels. The fraction of CaMKII holoenzymes (i.e., mEGFP-CaMKII with 488-channel intensity greater than 2500 arbitrary units) with detectable phosphorylation was computed as a ratio of the number of CaMKII colocalized with antibody to the total number of CaMKII holoenzymes. In a typical case, false-positive colocalization due to coincidentally neighbored particles was less than 0.5%, as determined from analyzing multiple, unrelated sets of images with comparable particle density. The intensity values acquired from TrackMate statistics data for the pThr 286 and pThr 305/306 antibody-channels were used to calculate an intensity histogram, for the colocalized (i.e., corresponding to holoenzymes that show detectable phosphorylation) and the non-colocalized spots (i.e., corresponding to holoenzymes that do not show any detectable phosphorylation with intensity values in the phosphospecific antibody channel being zero). This results in scaling of the area under the histogram for the antibody intensity by a factor that takes into account the fraction of holoenzymes that show no detectable phosphorylation. A bin width of 500 was used for computing the histogram. After calculating the distribution, we plotted the intensity histogram for only the colocalized spots and an intensity cutoff of about 15000 arbitrary units.</p><p>For analysis of samples where mEGFP-CaMKII-α and mCherry-CaMKII-β* were co-transfected (i.e., α:β* ratio equals 3:1 and 1:1), we first identified the heterooligomeric holoenzyme population (~80% of the total holoenzymes, data not shown) and then calculated what fraction of these heterooligomers showed detectable inhibitory phosphorylation. An intensity histogram was also plotted for the pThr 305/306 signal for these holoenzymes, as described above.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Kuriyan lab, especially Laura Nocka for helpful discussions and Miles Tuncel for help with cloning and experimental setup. pET21a-BirA was a gift from Alice Ting (Addgene plasmid # 20857).

and CaMKII-β</title><boxed-text><p>A simple kinetic model is built to explain the observed differences in the balance between activating and inhibitory autophosphorylation. The model is based on a CaMKII dimer, which avoids the extremely large number of intermediate states that need to be considered for a CaMKII dodecamer. Phosphorylation at the inhibitory site (Thr 305/306) can occur both in cis and in trans, whereas Thr 286 can only be phosphorylated in trans.</p><p>We wrote a series of chemical reactions that can lead to autophosphorylation at Thr 286 and Thr 305/306. A representative set of values for the forward and reverse rate constants are shown below. The reaction kinetics corresponding to these equations were simulated using Berkeley Madonna, a general-purpose differential equation solver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.berkeleymadonna.com/">http://www.berkeleymadonna.com/</ext-link>). We monitored the accumulation of all species that are phosphorylated at either Thr 286 or Thr 305/306 under different rates of <italic>trans</italic>-phosphorylation, keeping the rates of <italic>cis</italic>-phosphorylation constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>).</p><p>The on and off rates for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM are set to 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> sec<sup>−1</sup> (denoted onrate) and 10 sec<sup>−1</sup> (denoted offrate) respectively, corresponding to a dissociation constant of 10<sup>−4</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> prior to CaM trapping. We mimicked the effect of CaM trapping by ignoring the dissociation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM from species that are phosphorylated at Thr 286. We ignore the effects of phosphatases in this simulation, and set the rate of dephosphorylation to be negligible (10<sup>−9</sup> sec<sup>−1</sup>, denoted reverserate). The initial concentrations of CaM and CaMKII are set to 10<sup>−4</sup> M and 10<sup>−9</sup> M, respectively. The equations considered are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>, where K denotes the kinase (CaMKII) and C denotes CaM.

The rate of <italic>cis</italic>-phosphorylation of Thr 305/306 (denoted ratecis306) is set to 0.1 sec<sup>−1</sup>. Under these conditions, the simulation shows a dominant accumulation of species that are phosphorylated on Thr 286 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Next, to mimic the effect of increasing the kinase-hub linker length, the rate of <italic>trans</italic>-phosphorylation was reduced by 10-fold for both Thr 286 and Thr 305/306 (i.e., 0.1 sec<sup>−1</sup> and 0.01 sec<sup>−1</sup>, respectively), while keeping the rate of <italic>cis</italic>-phosphorylation unaltered.

They highlight a role for the length of the linker between the catalytic domain and the hub of CaMKII in determining the extent to which an activating versus an inhibitory autophosphorylation occurs in response to calcium, and explains why the kinetics of activation and inactivation of the CaMKII-α and CaMKII-β isoforms are different. Overall, this paper provides a significant advance in our understanding of the regulation of this key protein kinase.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Flexible linkers in CaMKII control the balance between activating and inhibitory autophosphorylation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tony Hunter as the Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John D Scott (Reviewer #1); Stefan Knapp (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the three reviewers. Based on these discussions, we are pleased to inform you that we will offer you the opportunity of submitting a revised version of your paper to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The new insights you have obtained through your biochemical, single molecule studies of the mechanisms of activation and inactivation of CaMKII in response to elevated calcium, in which the length of the linker between the central hub and the catalytic domain dictates whether autophosphorylation is primarily at the T286 activating site or at the T305/306 inhibitory sites, provide a significant advance in our understanding of the regulation of this key enzyme. Your studies have led to the formulation of an intricate model for the activation and inactivation of CaMKII's that may prove challenging for some readers to fully appreciate, but the in vitro data are of sufficient interesting for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, and they may stimulate more research focusing on the role of the CaMKII-β isoform in more relevant cell types.</p><p>The main experimental issue to be addressed is as follows. While the reviewers agree that the most interesting outcome of your analysis is the influence of the length of the catalytic domain-hub linker on the nature of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-activated autophosphorylation events, they indicate that some further experiments with additional linker lengths would strengthen your conclusions. Currently, you only tested the natural ~30 and ~200 residues. However, it would be of mechanistic interest to know whether the 30 residue linker (in CaMKII-α) is the optimal length for Thr286 trans-autophosphorylation, or whether the optimal length is significantly shorter or longer than this. Likewise, what is the minimal linker length for inhibitory autophosphorylation? Testing additional, intermediate linker lengths would enable you to address this – perhaps natural CaMKII isoform linkers of different lengths exist that could be tested. Also, for completeness sake, it would be ideal if you tested the reciprocal CaMKII-α/β chimera, i.e., CaMKII-α*, in which the CaMKII-α linker is swapped into CaMKII-β.</p><p>Another concern is that the model still represents a rather artificial system of ectopically expressed fusion proteins. In particular, the λ phosphatase used here is known to have very broad specificity, suggesting that more relevant and selective Ser/Thr phosphatases that are known to interact and regulate CaMKII, such as PP1 and PP2A, may produce different dephosphorylation kinetics. λ phosphatase is a rather small, highly active protein of ~24 kDa, whereas the eukaryotic cell PPI and PP2A phosphatase holoenzyme complexes are significantly larger, and it is certainly possible that the kinetics of CaMKII dephosphorylation by these enzymes might be significantly slower, perhaps because of steric access issues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>As stated by Bhattancharyya et al. CaMKII is unusual among protein kinases because it is assembled into a large holoenzyme with twelve to fourteen subunits. Analysis of the phosphorylation status of the enzyme using bulk assays, such as Western blots, has been challenging due to difficulties in purifying the holoenzymes, particularly for isoforms with longer kinase-hub linkers. To circumvent this problem the authors designed an elegant designed a single-molecule TIRF microscopy assay that relies on the capture from mammalian cell lysates of CaMKII holoenzymes tagged with fluorescent proteins. Using this approach they conclude that CaMKII-a and CaMKII-b, the two major isoforms in the brain, differ in the balance of activating and inhibitory phosphorylation. This can be explained in part by the differences in the length of a flexible linker that differs between the CaMKII-a and CaMKII-b isoforms.</p><p>Overall, this is a well written and detailed study. The rigorous biochemical approach of the Kuriyan lab is balanced with the power of single molecule fluorescence approaches that have been pioneered by the Grove lab. This has led to the formulation of an intricate model for the activation and inactivation of CaMKII's that may prove challenging for some readers to fully appreciate. I only have a few minor comments.</p><p>1) I wonder if there is merit in incorporating Figure S3 into the body of the text. I recognize that this is already a vast study of nine full figures, but the data on dephosphorylation in a cellular context is a nice addition to the study.</p><p>2) Figure 5 is necessary but quite complicated. I wonder if there is any way to simplify this section.</p><p>3) Experiments with small molecule inhibitors such as staurosporine are appropriate, but I wonder if there would be benefit from including work with more established CaMKII antagonists such as KN62.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Bhattacharyya et al. studied the autophosphorylation kinetics of the two main Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) isozymes expressed in brain: CaMKII-α and CaMKII-β. To do this, the authors developed a single-molecule assay to measure the phosphorylation status of CaMKII using expression constructs of CaMKII isoforms expressed with a N-terminal fluorescent proteins (mEGFP) fused to a biotin tag for easy capturer on coated glass plates and subsequent visualization, by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Phosphorylation states were detected by phosphorylation site specific antibodies recognizing the activating phosphorylation site Thr286 as well as the two inhibitory sites Thr305/306.</p><p>CaMKII constitute a family of enzymes that play a key role in learning and memory by mediating signalling after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Kinases of this family form dodecameric or tetradecameric holoenzymes that may contain also contain heteroligomeric assemblies of different isoforms that share high sequence homology. The oligomeric state facilitates auto-phosphorylation within the same oligomer allowing for rapid amplification of transient Ca signals. The authors make the intriguing discovery that the linker region between the oligomerization domain and the kinase domain which is much longer in the β isoform modulates autophosphorylation behaviour: CaMKII-α which has a 31-residue linker quickly autophosphorylated on the activating site (Thr286) with relatively little inhibitory phosphorylation on Thr305/306. In contrast, CaMKII-β, which has a longer ~200-residue linker preferentially autophosphorylated at the inhibitory sites Thr305/306 with less activating phosphorylation on the activating site Thr286. A mutant of CaMKII-α that contains the β linker confirmed that the difference in autophosphorylation is indeed a result of the linker region and not due to differences in the catalytic or oligomerization domains. Thus, CaMKII activity in cell can potentially regulated by different ration of α and β isoforms, generating heterooligomers with variable response to activating Ca/calmodulin signals. In addition, de-phosphorylation was studied using non-specific l-phosphatase showing again linker dependent differences.</p><p>The reported activation and inactivation data of this key enzyme system are certainly interesting. Experimental data are sound and have been interpreted with care. My only concern is, that the model still represents a very artificial system of ectopically expressed fusion proteins. In particular, the phosphatase used is known to have very broad specificity suggesting that more relevant and selective Ser/Thr phosphatases that are known to interact and regulate CaMKII such as PP1 and PP2a, may produce different dephosphorylation kinetics. However, I think that the in vitro data are however sufficiently interesting for publication in eLife when limitations are more clearly highlighted and they may stimulate more research focussing on the role of the β isoform in more relevant cell types.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>a) The notion that α and β ratios regulate activity could be supported by (available) expression data in different cell types. Such data would at least demonstrate that the proposed regulatory mechanism is indeed observed.</p><p>b) The heading &quot;The balance between inhibitory and activating autophosphorylation is maintained upon activation of CaMKII in cells&quot; is misleading. The experiments are carried out in lysates using ectopically expressed protein in HEK293T cells. Similarly, the heading &quot;Slower dephosphorylation at the activating site primes CaMKII for activation by incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses&quot; suggests that signalling events have been studied downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses – this is not the case as only dephosphorylation kinetics by l-phosphatase has been experimentally assessed. The authors should also discuss that CaMKII activation in neurons is extremely transient (approximately 1 min duration). This is probably not within the time resolution of the current experimental setup.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This biophysical study explores the differences in the autophosphorylation behavior of CaMKII-α and CaMKII-β. These two isoforms differ mainly in the length of the flexible linker between the N-terminal kinase domain and the C-terminal hub domain: ~30 residues for CaMKII-α and ~200 residues for -β. The three autophosphorylation sites examined were Thr286 and Thr305/306, just C-terminal to the kinase domain. It had been shown previously that Thr286 is autophosphorylated in trans (but within the oligomeric CaMKII structure) and activates CaMKII kinase activity, and that Thr305/306 can be autophosphorylated in cis or in trans and is inhibitory. Using single-molecule TIRF microscopy, the authors' main finding is that autophosphorylation of Thr286 is dependent on the length of the kinase-hub linker, with a shorter linker (as in CaMKII-α) facilitating Thr286 autophosphorylation (in trans). They also explored the susceptibility of these phosphorylation sites to phosphatase activity.</p><p>Although these results will be of interest to those in the CaMKII field, it is debatable whether the study, in its current form, is of high enough significance to merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Given the authors' main finding that the kinase-hub linker length plays a crucial role in the activating/inhibitory phosphorylation ratio, one would think that they would have explored this feature more exhaustively, for example, by testing intermediate linker lengths (only two tested – the natural ~30 and ~200 residues). Is 30 residues (in CaMKII-α) the optimal length for Thr286 trans-autophosphorylation, or is the optimal length shorter or longer? Also, for completeness sake, the authors should test the reciprocal CaMKII-α/β chimera, i.e., CaMKII-α*, in which the CaMKII-α linker is swapped into CaMKII-β.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53670.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main experimental issue to be addressed is as follows.

Using five new constructs, we have now studied the effect of kinase-hub linkers of different length on autophosphorylation outcomes in CaMKII. These results are now discussed in the manuscript (subsection CaMKII-β, with a long kinase-hub linker, acquires inhibitory autophosphorylation more readily than CaMKII-α) and included as new supplementary figures (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3(A-C)). We believe that the inclusion of these results has strengthened our conclusions. A brief summary of these experimental results is presented below.</p><p>1) We have now replaced the linker in CaMKII-αwith that from two other CaMKII isoforms (γwith a 110-residue linker and δwith a 31-residue linker), producing surrogate constructs, CaMKII-γ* and CaMKII-δ*. The autophosphorylation outcomes for shorter-linker CaMKII-δ* is similar to that seen for CaMKII-α, in terms of both the activating and inhibitory phosphorylation (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). The longer-linker CaMKII-γ* exhibits autophosphorylation status that is closer to CaMKII-β/β*, with an increased bias towards inhibitory phosphorylation (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). These results suggest that the longer-linker variants have an increased tendency to autophosphorylate on the inhibitory site, whereas short-linker variants are biased towards activating phosphorylation. The sequences of the linkers in the four CaMKII isoforms are very different, and so these results support the idea that the linker length is an important determinant of phosphorylation outcome.</p><p>2) This conclusion was further reinforced by studying a naturally occurring splice-variant of CaMKII-β(CaMKII-β’E) that has a 55-residue linker, instead of the more common ~200 residue linker. We also designed a construct where this truncated linker from CaMKII-β’E replaced the linker in CaMKII-α(CaMKII-β’E*). For both these constructs, we see a large reduction in inhibitory phosphorylation and a small increase in activating phosphorylation when compared to normal CaMKII-β(Figure 3—figure supplement 3A-B).</p><p>3) As an additional control, we designed a construct of CaMKII-βin which the kinase-hub linker was replaced by that of CaMKII-α(CaMKII-α*). The autophosphorylation outcomes for CaMKII-α* is similar to that for CaMKII-α (Figure 3—figure supplement 3C).</p><p>4) We also made a construct where the entire linker in CaMKII-α is deleted (CaMKII-α-nolinker). We observe that the activating phosphorylation is reduced in this construct when compared to CaMKII-α, while the degree of pThr 305/306 remains unchanged. The deletion of the entire linker may have some steric effects that may influence the autophosphorylation outcomes, and the behavior of this construct requires more study. We have chosen not to include data for the no-linker construct in this manuscript.</p><p>We agree that it would be interesting to do a more extensive study of the effects of linker length on phosphorylation outcomes, but note that this will require much more extensive experimentation than is feasible in a short time.

In the concluding remarks, we have now clarified that the expression levels of CaMKII-αand CaMKII-βin neurons is dynamic and is altered by synaptic activity (Thiagarajan et al., 2002). High neuronal activity increases the α/βratio and <italic>vice versa</italic>, resulting in functional differences between these isoforms.
