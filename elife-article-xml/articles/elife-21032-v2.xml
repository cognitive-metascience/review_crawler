Tie2 signaling mediates endothelial cell (EC) survival and vascular maturation and its activating mutations are linked to venous malformations. Here we show that vein formation are disrupted in mouse skin and mesentery when Tie2 signals are diminished by targeted deletion of <italic>Tek</italic> either ubiquitously or specifically in embryonic ECs. Postnatal Tie2 attenuation resulted in the degeneration of newly formed veins followed by the formation of haemangioma-like vascular tufts in retina and venous tortuosity. Mechanistically, Tie2 insufficiency compromised venous EC identity, as indicated by a significant decrease of COUP-TFII protein level, a key regulator in venogenesis. Consistently, angiopoietin-1 stimulation increased COUP-TFII in cultured ECs, while Tie2 knockdown or blockade of Tie2 downstream PI3K/Akt pathway reduced COUP-TFII which could be reverted by the proteasome inhibition. Together, our results imply that Tie2 is essential for venous specification and maintenance via Akt mediated stabilization of COUP-TFII.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21032.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21032.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Tie2</kwd><kwd>COUP-TFII</kwd><kwd>vein specification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91539101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31271530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31071263</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012CB947600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The priority of Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analyses with genetically engineered mouse models in combination with biochemical approaches reveal a crucial role of the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 mediated signals in venogenesis via an Akt mediated regulation of COUP-TFII protein stabilization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanisms underlying arteriovenous specification have been under intensive investigation during the past years, and this has led to the identification of several signaling pathways involved in the coordination of this process. The VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 pathway mediates activation of RAF1 and ERK1/2 kinases to induce the expression of genes required for arterial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lanahan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2013</xref>), including Delta-like 4 (Dll4) that activates NOTCH signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lawson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duarte et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wythe et al., 2013</xref>). Wnt/β-catenin, SOX17 and FOXC1/2 were also reported to participate in arterial development via activation of the NOTCH pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Seo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Corada et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2013</xref>). In contrast, knowledge on venogenesis is still limited. COUP-TFII, a transcription factor expressed in venous but not arterial endothelial cells (ECs), has been shown to regulate venous identity via the inhibition of NOTCH mediated signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">You et al., 2005</xref>). Vice versa, NOTCH activation has been shown to down-regulate COUP-TFII expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Swift et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, Akt activation was shown to inhibit Raf1-ERK1/2 signaling in ECs to favor venous specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ren et al., 2010</xref>). To date, however, the specific factors upstream of the Akt pathway that define venous EC identity remain unclear.</p><p>Tie2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates angiopoietin signaling for EC survival, vascular remodeling and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augustin et al., 2009</xref>). Tie2 deficiency led to embryonic lethality resulting from the defective vascular remodeling and heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dumont et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sato et al., 1995</xref>), and combined deletion of Tie2 ligands Ang1 and Ang2 in mice was also shown to disrupt Schlemm’s canal formation leading to ocular hypertension and glaucoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Thomson et al., 2014</xref>). Patients with venous malformations were shown to have Tie2 missense point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vikkula et al., 1996</xref>), leading to ligand-independent Tie2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Limaye et al., 2009</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism of Tie2 function in the blood vessels has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we show that Tie2 deficiency or insufficiency induced by gene targeting leads to defective vein formation and maintenance during embryogenesis and postnatal development. Findings from this study suggest that Tie2 is essential for the specification of venous EC identity via the Akt mediated regulation of COUP-TFII protein stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Disruption of vein development after Tie2 deletion during embryogenesis</title><p>To characterize Tie2 function in vascular development, a conditional knockout mouse model targeting the <italic>Tek</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shen et al., 2014a</xref>) was employed in this study.

Tie2 deletion efficiency was examined by immunostaining with skin and also by real-time RT-PCR with lung of <italic>Tek</italic> mutant mice (Tek<sup>−/iECKO</sup>: 0.33 ± 0.07, n = 3; Tek<sup>+/iECKO</sup>: 1.0 ± 0.26, n = 3; Tek<sup>−/iUCKO</sup>: 0.25 ± 0.02, n = 4; Tek<sup>+/iUCKO</sup>: 1.0 ± 0.11, n = 4). Analysis of veins in skin at E15.5 showed that venogenesis was disrupted in both types of mutant embryos, in which <italic>Tek</italic> deletion was induced by intraperitoneal injections of tamoxifen into pregnant mice at E10.5–12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Lack of bleeding or edema with the later targeting suggests a stage-dependent function of Tie2 during the establishment of vascular integrity. Interestingly, veins were detected in mesentery, but unlike in littermate controls, they did not align properly with the arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Furthermore, lymphatic vessels originate mainly from veins during embryonic development in mammals. It is therefore interesting to find out whether lymphatic development is altered in Tie2 knockout mice when the vein formation is defective. We found that lymphatic vessels were present in the skin of Tek<sup>−/iECKO</sup> mutant mice, but became dilated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This may be secondary to tissue edema resulting from the impairment of blood vasculature. However, it is also possible that Tie2 may have a role at earlier stages of lymphatic development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Retardation of retinal vascularization after Tie2 attenuation</title><p>To study the role of Tie2 in postnatal vascular formation, the <italic>Tek<sup>Flox/−</sup>/Ubc-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic> neonatal mice were treated with tamoxifen via intragastric injection during postnatal days (P1–4) and analyzed at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Interestingly, Tie2 is also downregulated in the sprouting tip endothelial cells as observed in retinal angiogenesis in this study and also by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augustin et al., 2009</xref>). It has been recently reported that vein-derived endothelial tip cells contribute to the emerging arteries during mouse retinal vascularization and also in zebrafish fin regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that the downregulation of Tie2 may be required for the initial establishment of an arterial EC identity. Consistently, we have demonstrated in this study that Tie2 absence or insufficiency by gene targeting disrupts venogenesis during embryogenesis and postnatal development. At the molecular level, we have found that Tie2 participates in the determination of venous EC identity, which may act via Akt-mediated regulation of COUP-TFII protein stability. This implies that Tie2/Akt signaling counterbalances VEGFR2/MAPK pathway in arteriovenous specification during the vascular development. The findings are consistent with previous literature on the role of Akt in venous development, and with the recent report that cardiomyocyte derived Ang1 is required for the subepicardial coronary vein formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zimmermann and Moelling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lamont and Childs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arita et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>As Tie2 is expressed by endothelial cells and non-endothelial cells such as hematopoietic cells, we employed three Cre deletors in this study to analyze the role of Tie2 in blood vascular development, including a EC-specific Cre line <italic>Cdh5-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic>, a hematopoietic Cre line <italic>Vav-iCre</italic> and a ubiquitous Cre line <italic>Ubc-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic>. Blood vessels developed normally in mice with <italic>Tek</italic> deletion in blood cells, while disruption of vein development was observed in Tek<sup>−/iUCKO</sup> as well as in Tek<sup>−/iECKO</sup> mutant mice. This suggests that the disruption of cutaneous vein development during embryogenesis is likely to be a cell-autonomous effect resulting from the deletion of Tie2 in endothelial cells. In postnatal studies, we found that there was a dramatic increase of blood vessel growth after the ubiquitous Tie2 attenuation, which led to the formation of haemangioma-like vascular tufts along the retinal veins in the <italic>Tek</italic> mutant mice. Although a significant decrease of retinal vascularization was observed in Tek<sup>−/iECKO</sup> mice, we did not observe the vascular tuft formation in the retina of these mutants. This may result from the lower Tie2 deletion efficiency in Tek<sup>−/iECKO</sup> mice when compared with that of Tek<sup>−/iUCKO</sup> mice. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that Tie2 deletion in other non-endothelial cells may contribute to the vascular abnormalities in retinas of Tek<sup>−/iUCKO</sup> mutant mice. As retinal neovascularization is one of the frequent causes of vision loss in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gariano and Gardner, 2005</xref>), these data suggests that reduction of Tie2 mediated signals in ECs and / or other Tie2 expressing cells may be implicated in the vascular pathologies.</p><p>COUP-TFII is expressed by several cell types including endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). In the vascular system, COUP-TFII has been shown to regulate venous EC identity as well as lymphatic EC specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">You et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Srinivasan et al., 2010</xref>). At the transcription level, COUP-TFII is regulated by several factors / pathways including NOTCH and SOX7/18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Swift et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we have found that COUP-TFII protein but not its mRNA level is significantly reduced in genetically engineered mouse model targeting <italic>Tek</italic>. Based on the evidence obtained from the biochemical analysis with cultured endothelial cells, we propose that Akt is a strong candidate mediating Tie2 signals in this process. As Akt acts downstream of many signaling pathways and that it is also activated in many cell types, it remains to be investigated how Akt regulates COUP-TFII protein stability in venous ECs. Also, further in vivo mechanistic studies are required for validating and fully elucidating Akt and others factors / pathways downstream of Tie2 in venous specification. In addition, we have also found that the requirement of Tie2 for vein development differs between the skin and mesentery. When Tie2 levels were reduced by gene targeting, veins were mostly undetectable in the skin, but displayed only abnormal arterial-venous alignment in the mesentery. It is possible that the cutaneous veins are more sensitive to the loss of Tie2 mediated signals, or that venogenesis occurs earlier in the mesentery than in the skin. The abnormal arteriovenous alignment resembled that of the APJ deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kidoya et al., 2015</xref>), and a significant reduction of APJ in the <italic>Tek</italic> mutants suggests that APJ acts downstream of Tie2 in the regulation of venous patterning.</p><p>Interestingly, we have also found that both the total and phosphorylated Dok-2 decreased significantly after Tie2 attenuation in this study. As Dok family members have been shown to negatively regulate ERK1/2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Honma et al., 2006</xref>), the decrease of Dok-2 may lead to the increase of retinal angiogenesis as detected in mice with Tie2 reduction by gene targeting. Consistently, enhancement of Tie2 signaling via the inhibition of VE-PTP has been shown to stabilize blood vessels and suppress retinal angiogenesis in mouse models of ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shen et al., 2014b</xref>). Furthermore, in experiments using HEK 293 T or endothelial cells overexpressing Dok2, it was found that Dok2, via directly interacting with Tie2, mediated Tie2 pathway in endothelial cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Saharinen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Master et al., 2001</xref>). Decreased Dok-2 activation in <italic>Tek</italic> mutants may also account for the suppression of horizontal and vertical blood vessel growth during retinal vascular network formation. So far, in vivo evidence about the role of Dok2 in blood vascular development is still missing. Further studies employing animal models targeting <italic>Dok2</italic> are important to analyze its biological functions in the vascular system.</p><p>In summary, we show that Tie2 is required for the specification and maintenance of venous EC identity. Related to the findings of this study, activating mutations of Tie2 have been linked to venous malformations in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vikkula et al., 1996</xref>). It is still poorly understood about the difference between the pathways downstream of activating Tie2 mutants and the wildtype Tie2. Activation of wildtype Tie2 by its ligand Ang1 or VE-PTP inhibition, at least for a short period, has been shown to stabilize blood vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shen et al., 2014b</xref>), while activating Tie2 mutations lead to venous malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vikkula et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Limaye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boscolo et al., 2015</xref>). Mechanisms underlying the discrepancy require further investigation. As alteration of Tie2 mediated signals may be implicated in a variety of vascular pathologies associated with the venous system, further investigation along these lines may help to develop novel Tie2-targeted therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal models</title><p>Conditional mice with <italic>Tek</italic> gene targeted flox sites (<italic>Tek<sup>Flox</sup></italic>) for gene deletion were generated by the National Resource Center for Mutant Mice, Nanjing University, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shen et al., 2014a</xref>).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Angiopoietin receptor Tie2 is required for vein specification and maintenance via regulating COUP-TFII&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hellmut Augustin (Reviewer #2); Lena Claesson-Welsh (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All the reviewers agree that the paper contains interesting and rather novel observations. However they feel that the paper needs additional experiments to make the results stronger and to get a more mechanistic view of the effect of Tie2 in venous differentiation. Both reviewers 2 and 3 list major points to be considered and specific experiments to add to improve the manuscript. Since these revisions require considerable additional work, we are not able to consider a revised manuscript.</p><p>We encourage the authors to complete the recommended revision of their work and consider resubmitting to <italic>eLife</italic> in the future.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The paper by Man Chu et al. describes the effect of inactivation of Tie-2 expression on artero-venous differentiation in the mouse embryo, pups and cultured endothelial cells.</p><p>As previously reported, Tie 2 null embryos die early during gestation for vascular and heart developmental problems. Here the authors show that Tie-2 deficient embryos and pups present a defective venous organization when Tie-2 expression is missing. In some organs and tissues, veins are absent along the arteries. In the retina there is a reduced horizontal growth of the vasculature and the presence of malformations along the length of the veins. In the skin, veins look tortuous. Arterial and venous markers are partially modified. In HUVEC silenced for Tie2 or lung and liver tissues Coup-TFII is reduced.</p><p>Mechanistically, data suggest that Tie-2 may act through phosphorylation of Akt that in turn would increase COUP-TFII and venous differentiation.</p><p>Although the paper contains some interesting observations it is essentially descriptive. The major weakness is the lack of a detailed mechanistic analysis of how Tie-2 acts in inducing venous differentiation. Data on the role of Akt are suggestive but a marked reduction of COUP-TFII is detectable only in HUVEC KD for Tie-2 and is much less apparent in the tissues. Other published studies showed an increase in cultured cells of Akt and STAT 1 upon infection with Tie-2 gain of function mutant. In addition, inherited gain of function mutations of Tie-2 induce a strong venous endothelial cell proliferation and formation of large hemangiomas inhibited by Rapamycin (for instance Boscolo et al. J Clin invest). To my view the authors should extend their studies on the mechanism of action of Tie-2 also adding novel observations as compared to previously published literature.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors of the manuscript, &quot;Angiopoietin receptor Tie2 is required for vein specification and maintenance via regulating COUP-TFII&quot; have used global and endothelial cell-specific conditional Tie2 knockout mouse models to demonstrate the critical role of Tie2 during vein development. The study is novel and addresses a fundamental question regarding the pathways (Tie2, Akt/PI3K and COUP-TFII) involved in forming venous endothelial identity and function. Although there is already a lot of circumstantial evidence in the published literature on vein-specific functions of Ang/Tie signaling, the manuscript makes an important point in showing this conclusively using definite genetic models. The study will be of interest for the broad readership of the journal. In further advancing their work, the authors should consider the following:</p><p>1) The major limitation in the study is the use of a ubiquitously expressed Cre deletor line (<italic>UBC-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic>) to knockout Tie2. Even though the authors have also used an endothelial specific Cre line (<italic>Cad5-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic>) to demonstrate the phenotypes in embryos and early postnatal retina, all the mechanistic studies are only performed using the <italic>UBC-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic> line. This is a major concern especially because <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> seems to show better Tie2 deletion as well as stronger phenotypes compared to <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iECKO</sup></italic> line. Is this solely due to different recombination efficacies of the different drivers or would this difference raise the question whether endothelial cell autonomous effects may not be the only cause of defective vein development in Tie2-deficient mice? Why did the authors opt to study different time points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>?</p><p>2) The immunofluorescence images show essentially black boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A, B, D, E</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref> suggesting 100% deletion efficacy. Do the authors claim to have achieved 100% deletion of Tie2 in these experiments or why are these images not showing the expected mosaic staining pattern resulting from partial recombination? A quantitative analysis of the efficacy of Tie2 deletion in the different experiments should/needs to be included. Alternatively, qRT-PCR to show Tie2 expression should be done with retina and embryo tissues from <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> (tissues and isolated endothelial cells). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the WB shows about 30-50% Tie2 in the <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iECKO</sup></italic> mice which is clearly not corresponding to the extremely weak or absent Tie2 staining shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>.</p><p>3) The retina vasculature analysis at P11, P15 and P21 in <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> mice showing vascular tuft formation is interesting. The same analysis should be included using the <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iECKO</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>4) Although hemangioma-like vascular tufts were observed in <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> mice at P21, the adult retina did not show any such malformations, whereas ear skin showed tortuous veins in adult mice. These data have been discussed rather insufficiently. The authors should comparatively analyze COUP-TFII transcript levels and other downstream players such as pAkt and pDok-2 in these two vascular beds in order to dissect the mechanisms, which help the retinal veins to &quot;recover&quot; but not the cutaneous veins. Likewise, partial recombination will lead to a mosaic vasculature of WT and KO cells. If such mosaic mice are traced over time, there is a good chance that the KO cells will be competed out by WT cells. As such, it is critical, particularly in the longer term experiments to carefully trace the percentage of cells with Tie2 deletion at the later time points of analysis.</p><p>5) The authors claim that Tie2 is required for the maintenance of venous EC identity. This is suggested by the observed phenotypes (albeit only moderately convincing). A systematic gene expression analysis of adult retina similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> (performed using P7 retina and lung) is missing. It is important to know whether the expression of venous markers is restored over time and also whether Tie2 expression is recovered in the adult mice as a result of incomplete Cre recombination efficiency and compensatory proliferation of Tie2-expressing EC (see above).</p><p>6) The authors are encouraged to reconsider their discussion. They conclude at the end of the discussion that the findings put a cautionary note on long term Tie2 targeting therapies, e.g., during tumor angiogenesis. This may not be the most important point of the study. In fact, nobody tries to target Tie2. Ang2 neutralizing strategies primarily work cooperatively with VEGF pathway targeting drugs based on their vascular normalization Tie2 gain-of-function effect. The same holds true for VE-PTP inhibitors or the recently published ABTAA antibody. What this reviewer finds much more exciting is the role of Tie2 on venogenesis. Venogenesis has mostly been considered as the default pathway with transcriptional programs driving lymphatic and arterial differentiation. The identification of Tie2 signaling as upstream regulator of COUP-TFII is a major finding that should likely be discussed in more detail. The fact that Tie2 KO leads in part to the acquisition of an arterial phenotype is noteworthy and suggests something of an arteriovenous identity balance mechanism. Likewise, angiogenesis is an arterializing process. As such, the physiological downregulation of Tie2 in the angiogenic tip cell vasculature should/could likely be discussed in the context of the findings of this manuscript. Obviously, it is at the discretion of the authors to prioritize the discussion, but it is felt that the authors may in the present version of the manuscript not have discussed the most obvious and most exciting implications of their work.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The study by Chu et al. characterizes the effect of Tie2 gene inactivation either using a ubiquitous or endothelial promoter to drive Cre expression during different stages of embryonic and postnatal stages. Interestingly, Tie2 deficiency leads to loss in vein formation or in stage-dependent maintenance of veins in different organs. The analyses are thorough and neatly presented. The study is ambitious, novel and of general interest.</p><p>1) The study shows that loss of Tie2 is accompanied by vascular abnormalities and a deficiency in vein formation. It is not entirely clear from the images that veins are missing entirely or if they are malformed. Please complement images with aSMA stainings (which should outline the arterial tree).</p><p>2) The author have previously described the iUCKO-/- mice in their paper in ATVB Jun;34(6):1221-30. Here, they have examined lymphatic vessel formation in the skin and show that deletion of Tie2 in neonate mice did not affect lymphatic vessel growth and maturation (Figure 8). I'm surprised that the lack of veins, as shown in the current study, has had no consequence for lymphatic vessel formation. The authors need to clarify and confirm that lymphatics are unaffected although veins are lacking.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the authors examine embryos at E15.5 and in panel E, at E17.5. However, the embryos shown in the E panel seem considerably younger than the ones in the D panel? Magnification bars are missing for the embryos</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors show no difference in transcript levels of COUP-TFII when comparing retina and lung tissues from WT and iUCKO-/- mice. When analyzing protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) in lung tissue from mutant mice vs WT, the differences are now significant. Does loss of Tie2 lead to increased turnover of COUP-TFII? As COUP-TFII is a critical regulator of vein and lymphatic development, it is important to learn more about how it's regulated by Tie2. This has a bearing also on the (lack of?) effect of Tie2 deletion on lymphatic development.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Angiopoietin receptor Tie2 is required for vein specification and maintenance via regulating COUP-TFII&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>While the reviewers feel that your work is potentially very important, they were disappointed that you chose to argue points rather than making the necessary revisions elaborated in the original set of reviews. You will see from their comments, that none of the reviewers felt you adequately addressed their original concerns. Normally, <italic>eLife</italic> only allows for a single round of reviews. Given the importance of your work and the fact that all three reviewers have urged me to give you another opportunity to revise the paper, we are willing to give you a second chance to make the original required major revisions. I would like to stress that the reviewers are your advocates and trying to help you improve the paper. The reviewers’ comments from the second round of review are listed below, but I urge you to make the revisions requested in both the first and second round of review.</p><p>This will be your final opportunity to provide acceptable additional experimental evidence as required by the reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Overall my feeling is that the authors could have a very nice story but they do not want to make an effort to make it more complete. Data on the mechanism of action remain the same, as poor as before.</p><p>I do not think that they can conclude that since COUP-TFII is reduced when Akt activation is inhibited (in HUVEC) Akt activation is the mechanism of action of Tie-2 in maintaining a venous identity. Although there is a partial inhibition of Akt (24% reduction) in Tie-2 deficient mice other pathways are likely implicated.</p><p>pDok- 2, for instance, seems more dramatically affected. It is sad that they do not want to make a relatively small effort to improve their paper.</p><p>The same applies to the relevant points raised such as the use of a model of ubiquitous inactivation of Tie-2 versus endothelial specific inactivation, or the lack of studies on the possible alterations of the lymphatics in absence of a correct venous development.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Man Chu and coworkers is resubmitted after revision. That global deletion of Tie2 casus venous defects is convincingly demonstrated. I have the following comments:</p><p>1) A major concern with this study is the weak phenotype of the endothelial deletion compared to the ubiquitous deletion. The strong effects in the global deletion could be primary as well as secondary.</p><p>2) The question on how lack of veins affect lymphatics remains unanswered. The authors published in ATVB in 2014, that lymphatic vessel development is unaffected in neonate pups with the same global Tie2 deletion as described here. It is unexpected that the lack of veins would not affect lymphatic development.</p><p>3) Mechanistic in vivo data remain scarce.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This reviewer is rather disappointed on how the authors have addressed the specific critique to the original submission of the manuscript. The idea of the peer review process is to initiate an iterative process aimed at improving the eventually published manuscript. As such, this reviewer had constructively raised a number of issues that he felt would help to improve the manuscript. Generally speaking, the authors have not accepted this invitation, but essentially argued away all of the reviewer's critique and suggestions. They thereby missed the opportunity to improve their manuscript (at least in response to the comments and suggestions made by this reviewer). For example, they did not even opt to replace the black IF images for the supposed Tie2 ECKO analyses. In the rebuttal, they argue at length about different recombination efficacies using the two different driver lines. Clearly, incomplete recombination and the resulting competition of WT and KO cells in long term experiments is key to the interpretation of conditional KO data. If the authors' recombination analyses are correct, then this reviewer would insist that the corresponding IF images should show mosaic Tie2 expression and not black images.</p><p>Despite this disappointment about the revised manuscript, this reviewer considers the manuscript of high quality and in principle deserving of publication. As such, if the authors are either not able or not willing to adequately address this reviewer's concern and suggestions, the manuscript should be published as is.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21032.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>[…] Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The paper by Man Chu et al. describes the effect of inactivation of Tie-2 expression on artero-venous differentiation in the mouse embryo, pups and cultured endothelial cells.</italic> </p><p><italic>As previously reported, Tie 2 null embryos die early during gestation for vascular and heart developmental problems.

Specifically, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, there is a significant reduction of COUP-TFII protein in tissues after the induced deletion of <italic>Tie2</italic>, and this is confirmed by the siRNA mediated knockdown of <italic>Tie2</italic> in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). On the other hand, the COUP-TFII level was increased by COMP-Ang1 stimulation to activate the Tie2/Akt pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). Consistently, a significant reduction of COUP-TFII is achieved by the inhibition of PI3K/Akt using LY294002 or MK2206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G-J</xref>). The decrease of COUP-TFII by the Akt inhibitor MK2206 could be reverted by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and L</xref>). These findings indicate that Tie2 is important in venogenesis via Akt mediated stabilization of COUP-TFII.</p><p>The decrease of Akt activation after Tie2 deletion as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> is consistent with the observation that there is an increase of Akt activation in cultured endothelial cells transduced with retroviral vectors overexpressing an activating Tie2 mutant (Tie2-L914F, Boscolo et al., J Clin invest. 2015; 125: 3491-3504). However, activation of Tie2 by its ligand Ang1 or VE-PTP inhibition, at least for a short period, has been shown to stabilize blood vasculature (Shen et al., J Clin Invest. 2014; 124: 4564-4576), while activating Tie2 mutations lead to venous malformations (Vikkula et al., 1996; 87: 1181-1190; Limaye et al., 2009; 41:118-124; Boscolo et al., J Clin invest. 2015; 125: 3491-3504).

Postnatally, the milder vascular effect observed in retina of <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iECKO</sup></italic> mice may be mainly due to the lower deletion efficiency of <italic>Tie2</italic>. The remaining Tie2 mRNA level is approximately 10-20% in <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>- table supplement 1) and it is about 40% in <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iECKO</sup></italic> mutants compared with the respective control mice (<italic>Tie2<sup>-/iECKO</sup></italic>: 0.40 ± 0.10, n=4; <italic>Tie2<sup>+/iECKO</sup></italic>: 1.0 ± 0.21, n=4; also included in the text).</p><p>The analysis of skin vasculature with <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> mice at the same stage (E15.5, as <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iECKO</sup></italic> mice shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>. To study the stage-dependent roles of Tie2 in vascular development, the Tie2 deletion was induced two days later (from E12.5-14.5) in <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> mice as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. Interestingly, although the defective vein development exists in <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> mice, there is no bleeding and edema observed at E17.5.</p><p><italic>2) The immunofluorescence images show essentially black boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A, B, D, E</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref> suggesting 100% deletion efficacy. Do the authors claim to have achieved 100% deletion of Tie2 in these experiments or why are these images not showing the expected mosaic staining pattern resulting from partial recombination? A quantitative analysis of the efficacy of Tie2 deletion in the different experiments should/needs to be included. Alternatively, qRT-PCR to show Tie2 expression should be done with retina and embryo tissues from Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup> (tissues and isolated endothelial cells). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the WB shows about 30-50% Tie2 in the Tie2<sup>-/iECKO</sup> mice which is clearly not corresponding to the extremely weak or absent Tie2 staining shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>.</italic> </p><p>The deletion efficiency of Tie2 was also examined by western blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR, in addition to the immunostaining. The remaining levels of Tie2 transcripts in lung and retina of <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> mice were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>-table supplement 1. Analysis of Tie2 mRNA in lung of <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iECKO</sup></italic> mice is now added as discussed above.</p><p><italic>3) The retina vasculature analysis at P11, P15 and P21 in Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup> mice showing vascular tuft formation is interesting. The same analysis should be included using the Tie2<sup>-/iECKO</sup> mice.</italic> </p><p>We did not observe the vascular tufts in retina of <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iECKO</sup></italic> mice at P21, and this may be due to the lower efficiency of Tie2 gene deletion as discussed above. According to the recent work in the lab of Dr. Gou Young Koh (also the co-author of this paper), similar vascular defects were observed in retinas of <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iECKO</sup></italic> mice when a higher efficiency of Tie2 deletion was achieved using a different VE-<italic>Cadherin-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic> mouse line.</p><p><italic>4) Although hemangioma-like vascular tufts were observed in Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup> mice at P21, the adult retina did not show any such malformations, whereas ear skin showed tortuous veins in adult mice. These data have been discussed rather insufficiently. The authors should comparatively analyze COUP-TFII transcript levels and other downstream players such as pAkt and pDok-2 in these two vascular beds in order to dissect the mechanisms, which help the retinal veins to &quot;recover&quot; but not the cutaneous veins. Likewise, partial recombination will lead to a mosaic vasculature of WT and KO cells. If such mosaic mice are traced over time, there is a good chance that the KO cells will be competed out by WT cells. As such, it is critical, particularly in the longer term experiments to carefully trace the percentage of cells with Tie2 deletion at the later time points of analysis.</italic> </p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, we have now added new data from the analysis of retinal vasculature in <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> and control mice at the adult stage (2.5 month-old). Similar defects with venous tortuosity was also observed in the retina of <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> mice. Consistently, there was little vascular growth to the second layer and no blood vessel growth into the third layer of retina in <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> mice. Furthermore, Tie2 transcript level remained low in <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> mice as analysed by the immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and real-time RT-PCR (<italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic>: 0.26 ± 0.14, n=5; Control: 1.0 ± 0.28, n=5). The data is now included in the text.</p><p><italic>5) The authors claim that Tie2 is required for the maintenance of venous EC identity. This is suggested by the observed phenotypes (albeit only moderately convincing). A systematic gene expression analysis of adult retina similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> (performed using P7 retina and lung) is missing. It is important to know whether the expression of venous markers is restored over time and also whether Tie2 expression is recovered in the adult mice as a result of incomplete Cre recombination efficiency and compensatory proliferation of Tie2-expressing EC (see above).</italic> </p><p>As discussed above, Tie2 transcript level remained low in <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> mice at the adult stage, and retina was abnormally vascularized as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. By real-time RT-PCR, we found that both venous and arterial genes are decreased in <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> mice compared with that of controls (EphB4, <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic>: 0.52 ± 0.29, n=5; Control: 1.0 ± 0.18, n=5; APJ, <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic>: 0.22 ± 0.22, n=5; Control: 1.0 ± 0.25, n=5; Ephrin B2, <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic>: 0.71 ± 0.32, n=5; Control: 1.0 ± 0.23, n=5; Dll4, <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic>: 0.70 ± 0.36, n=5; Control: 1.0 ± 0.21, n=5). This may be due to the fact that endothelial cell numbers are different between Tie2 knockout and littermate control mice due to the disruption of EC survival pathway.</p><p><italic>6) The authors are encouraged to reconsider their discussion. They conclude at the end of the discussion that the findings put a cautionary note on long term Tie2 targeting therapies, e.g., during tumor angiogenesis. This may not be the most important point of the study. In fact, nobody tries to target Tie2. Ang2 neutralizing strategies primarily work cooperatively with VEGF pathway targeting drugs based on their vascular normalization Tie2 gain-of-function effect. The same holds true for VE-PTP inhibitors or the recently published ABTAA antibody. What this reviewer finds much more exciting is the role of Tie2 on venogenesis. Venogenesis has mostly been considered as the default pathway with transcriptional programs driving lymphatic and arterial differentiation. The identification of Tie2 signaling as upstream regulator of COUP-TFII is a major finding that should likely be discussed in more detail. The fact that Tie2 KO leads in part to the acquisition of an arterial phenotype is noteworthy and suggests something of an arteriovenous identity balance mechanism. Likewise, angiogenesis is an arterializing process. As such, the physiological downregulation of Tie2 in the angiogenic tip cell vasculature should/could likely be discussed in the context of the findings of this manuscript. Obviously, it is at the discretion of the authors to prioritize the discussion, but it is felt that the authors may in the present version of the manuscript not have discussed the most obvious and most exciting implications of their work.</italic> </p><p>The cautionary note in the Discussion is deleted. A new sentence has been added to the first paragraph of Discussion- “This implies that Tie2/Akt signaling may counterbalance VEGFR2/MAPK pathway in arteriovenous specification during the vascular development.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>The study by Chu et al. characterizes the effect of Tie2 gene inactivation either using a ubiquitous or endothelial promoter to drive Cre expression during different stages of embryonic and postnatal stages. Interestingly, Tie2 deficiency leads to loss in vein formation or in stage-dependent maintenance of veins in different organs. The analyses are thorough and neatly presented. The study is ambitious, novel and of general interest.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The study shows that loss of Tie2 is accompanied by vascular abnormalities and a deficiency in vein formation. It is not entirely clear from the images that veins are missing entirely or if they are malformed. Please complement images with aSMA stainings (which should outline the arterial tree).</italic> </p><p>In embryos, skin veins were completely missing when the induced deletion of Tie2 gene started from E10.5. The absence of veins in the skin were confirmed by co-staining of PECAM-1 and Dll4 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The author have previously described the iUCKO-/- mice in their paper in ATVB Jun;34(6):1221-30. Here, they have examined lymphatic vessel formation in the skin and show that deletion of Tie2 in neonate mice did not affect lymphatic vessel growth and maturation (Figure 8). I'm surprised that the lack of veins, as shown in the current study, has had no consequence for lymphatic vessel formation. The authors need to clarify and confirm that lymphatics are unaffected although veins are lacking.</italic> </p><p>We have performed the analysis of lymphatic development with <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> and control mice during embryogenesis, and the data was not included in the paper. We found that there was abnormality about the lymphatic network in the skin analyzed at E17.5 (e.g. lymphatic vessel dilation). However, this could be secondary to the tissue edema resulting from the defective vein development. The detailed mechanism underlying the lymphatic defects in <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> mice during embryogenesis is still to be investigated.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the authors examine embryos at E15.5 and in panel E, at E17.5. However, the embryos shown in the E panel seem considerably younger than the ones in the D panel? Magnification bars are missing for the embryos</italic> </p><p>The images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref> were taken using different magnification. Scale bars have now been included in the figure.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors show no difference in transcript levels of COUP-TFII when comparing retina and lung tissues from WT and iUCKO-/- mice. When analyzing protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) in lung tissue from mutant mice vs WT, the differences are now significant. Does loss of Tie2 lead to increased turnover of COUP-TFII? As COUP-TFII is a critical regulator of vein and lymphatic development, it is important to learn more about how it's regulated by Tie2. This has a bearing also on the (lack of?) effect of Tie2 deletion on lymphatic development.</italic> </p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>, COMP-Ang1 stimulation could increase COUP-TFII level in cultured ECs, which is consistent with the observation that induced Tie2 deletion or siRNA mediated knockdown of Tie2 led to the decrease of COUP-TFII protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-D</xref>). Furthermore, the decrease of COUP-TFII by PI3K/Akt inhibition could be reverted by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. The findings indicate that Tie2 mediated Akt activation is important for the stabilization of COUP-TFII protein.</p><p>As discussed above, lymphatic abnormalities were observed in <italic>Tie2<sup>-/iUCKO</sup></italic> mice. However, as Tie2 is lowly expressed by lymphatic endothelium, it remains to be investigated whether it is a primary or secondary defects resulting from Tie2 insufficiency.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>[..] While the reviewers feel that your work is potentially very important, they were disappointed that you chose to argue points rather than making the necessary revisions elaborated in the original set of reviews. You will see from their comments, that none of the reviewers felt you adequately addressed their original concerns. Normally, eLife only allows for a single round of reviews. Given the importance of your work and the fact that all three reviewers have urged me to give you another opportunity to revise the paper, we are willing to give you a second chance to make the original required major revisions. I would like to stress that the reviewers are your advocates and trying to help you improve the paper. The reviewers’ comments from the second round of review are listed below, but I urge you to make the revisions requested in both the first and second round of review.</italic> </p><p><italic>This will be your final opportunity to provide acceptable additional experimental evidence as required by the reviewers.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Overall my feeling is that the authors could have a very nice story but they do not want to make an effort to make it more complete. Data on the mechanism of action remain the same, as poor as before.</italic> </p><p><italic>I do not think that they can conclude that since COUPTFII is reduced when Akt activation is inhibited (in HUVEC) Akt activation is the mechanism of action of Tie-2 in maintaining a venous identity. Although there is a partial inhibition of Akt (24% reduction) in Tie-2 deficient mice other pathways are likely implicated.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that other downstream pathways, in addition to Akt mediated signaling, may also be involved in the venous abnormality when Tie2 mediated signaling was absent or insufficient. Considering that Akt is downstream of many signaling pathways and that it is also activated in many cell types, it is significant that we observed the decrease of pAkt in the total lung lysates after Tie2 deletion (Tek<sup>-/iUCKO</sup> mice with gene targeting efficiency approximately 87% in lung as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; tamoxifen administration from P1-4 and tissues collected for analysis at P7). The finding was supported by the biochemical analysis with in vitro cultured endothelial cells. Firstly, consistent with the results from Tie2 knockdown by siRNA, the COUP-TFII level was increased by COMP-Ang1 stimulation to activate the Tie2/Akt pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). Secondly, a significant reduction of COUP-TFII was achieved by the inhibition of Akt using MK2206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I, J</xref>), which validated the results from PI3K inhibition by LY294002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G, H</xref>). The decrease of COUP-TFII by the Akt inhibition could be reverted by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and L</xref>). The findings suggest that Tie2 regulates COUP-TFII protein stability, which may act via Akt mediated signaling. We have revised the text in the Results section by including these data. We have also revised the Discussion section to reflect the reviewer’s excellent view, pointing out that in addition to Akt, other factors / pathways may also participate in mediating Tie2 signals in venous specification.</p><p> <italic>pDok- 2, for instance, seems more dramatically affected. It is sad that they do not want to make a relatively small effort to improve their paper.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer to point this out. Indeed both total Dok2 and phospho-Dok2 level were significantly reduced in mice with the induced deletion of Tie2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K,L</xref>). So far, there is little information available about the role of Dok2 in blood vascular development. In experiments using HEK 293T or endothelial cells overexpressing Dok2, it was found that Dok2, via directly interacting with Tie2, mediated Tie2 pathway in endothelial cell migration (ref. 29, 30). We examined the endogenous level of Dok-2 in HUVECs by western blot analysis and RT-PCR and found that Dok-2 was lowly expressed in cultured endothelial cells. We acknowledge the reviewer’s comment and have revised the Discussion by pointing out that further studies are important to analyze Dok-2 by employing genetically engineered mouse models targeting <italic>Dok2</italic>.</p><p><italic>The same considering the relevant points you raised such as the use of a model of ubiquitous inactivation of Tie-2 versus endothelial specific inactivation, or the lack of studies on the possible alterations of the lymphatics in absence of a correct venous development.</italic> </p><p>For the embryo studies, both ubiquitous and EC specific deletion of <italic>Tie2</italic> were employed. Disruption of vein development was observed in Tek<sup>-/iECKO</sup> (<italic>Tek<sup>Flox/-</sup>/Cdh5-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>)</italic> as shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, which was similar to that of Tek<sup>-/iUCKO</sup> <italic>(Tek<sup>Flox/-</sup>/Ubc-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In postnatal studies, although a significant decrease of retinal vascularization was also observed in Tek<sup>-/iECKO</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, F</xref>), we did not observe the vascular tuft formation in the retina of Tek<sup>-/iECKO</sup> mice (data not shown). This may result from the lower Tie2 deletion efficiency in Tek<sup>-/iECKO</sup> mice than that of Tek<sup>-/iUCKO</sup> mice (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-D</xref>).

That global deletion of Tie2 casus venous defects is convincingly demonstrated. I have the following comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) A major concern with this study is the weak phenotype of the endothelial deletion compared to the ubiquitous deletion. The strong effects in the global deletion could be primary as well as secondary.</italic> </p><p>We also thank the reviewer to point this out. As discussed above, based on the embryo studies, the disruption of vein development is likely to be a cell-autonomous effect resulting from the deletion of Tie2 in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, as discussed above, we cannot exclude the possibility that Tie2 deletion in non-endothelial cells may contribute to the vascular phenotype in Tek<sup>-/iUCKO</sup> mutant mice, especially at postnatal stages. This requires further investigation. We have revised the Discussion section to point this out.</p><p><italic>2) The question on how lack of veins affect lymphatics remains unanswered. The authors published in ATVB in 2014, that lymphatic vessel development is unaffected in neonate pups with the same global Tie2 deletion as described here. It is unexpected that the lack of veins would not affect lymphatic development.</italic> </p><p>This is an important question and we apologize for missing your point in the previous revision. In mammals, lymphatic vessels originate mainly from veins during embryonic development. It is therefore interesting to find out whether lymphatic development is altered in Tie2 knockout mice when the vein formation is disrupted. We have now performed new experiments to examine the lymphatic vessels in Tek<sup>-/iECKO</sup> (<italic>Tek<sup>Flox/-</sup>/Cdh5-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>)</italic> mice during embryogenesis. Lymphatic vessels were detected in Tek<sup>-/iECKO</sup> mice but became dilated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This may be secondary to tissue edema resulting from the impairment of blood vasculature. However, it is also possible that Tie2 may have a role at earlier stages of lymphatic development. We have revised the text in the Results section.</p><p><italic>3) Mechanistic in vivo data remain scarce.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that further in vivo mechanistic studies are required for validating and fully elucidating Tie2 downstream mediators in the regulation of venous formation and maintenance.

We have revised the Discussion section to reflect the reviewer’s valid point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This reviewer is rather disappointed on how the authors have addressed the specific critique to the original submission of the manuscript. The idea of the peer review process is to initiate an iterative process aimed at improving the eventually published manuscript. As such, this reviewer had constructively raised a number of issues that he felt would help to improve the manuscript. Generally speaking, the authors have not accepted this invitation, but essentially argued away all of the reviewer's critique and suggestions. They thereby missed the opportunity to improve their manuscript (at least in response to the comments and suggestions made by this reviewer). For example, they did not even opt to replace the black IF images for the supposed Tie2 ECKO analyses. In the rebuttal, they argue at length about different recombination efficacies using the two different driver lines. Clearly, incomplete recombination and the resulting competition of WT and KO cells in long term experiments is key to the interpretation of conditional KO data. If the authors' recombination analyses are correct, then this reviewer would insist that the corresponding IF images should show mosaic Tie2 expression and not black images.</italic> </p><p>We now have replaced the IF images for Tek<sup>-/iECKO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition, to further visualize the remaining Tie2 in Tek<sup>-/iECKO</sup> mice, we have performed new experiments with the mTmG allele bred into the Tie2 mutant mice. The partial Tie2 deletion was indicated by the mosaic GFP expression in the compound genetic mouse model (Tek<sup>-/iECKO</sup>;mTmG; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). We have also revised the text in the Results section.</p><p><italic>Despite this disappointment about the revised manuscript, this reviewer considers the manuscript of high quality and in principle deserving of publication.
