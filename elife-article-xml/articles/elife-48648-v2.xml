and function of the prefrontal cortex. We have hypothesized that interneuronopathy contributes significantly to the pathoetiology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Activity-dependent tangential migration of GABAergic cortical neurons is driven by depolarizing responses to ambient GABA present in the cortical enclave. We found that ethanol exposure potentiates the depolarizing action of GABA in GABAergic cortical interneurons of the embryonic mouse brain. Pharmacological antagonism of the cotransporter NKCC1 mitigated ethanol-induced potentiation of GABA depolarization and prevented aberrant patterns of tangential migration induced by ethanol in vitro. In a model of FASD, maternal bumetanide treatment prevented interneuronopathy in the prefrontal cortex of ethanol exposed offspring, including deficits in behavioral flexibility. These findings position interneuronopathy as a mechanism of FASD symptomatology, and posit NKCC1 as a pharmacological target for the management of FASD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>GABAergic interneurons</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>alcohol</kwd><kwd>FASD</kwd><kwd>chloride homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHS NIH R01 AA023410</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yeh</surname><given-names>Hermes H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHS NIH R21 AA024036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yeh</surname><given-names>Hermes H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHS NIH R01 AA027754</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yeh</surname><given-names>Hermes H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHS NIH F31 AA027694-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Stephanie M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Prenatal ethanol exposure results in aberrant tangential migration by altering NKCC1-mediated chloride homeostasis that can be mitigated by bumetanide.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Binge-type exposure of the embryonic mouse brain to a moderate level of ethanol leads to interneuronopathy, hallmarked by aberrant tangential migration of corticopetal GABAergic interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skorput et al., 2015</xref>). Interneuronopathies are widely implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catterall, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato and Dobyns, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katsarou et al., 2017</xref>), including Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skorput et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skorput and Yeh, 2016</xref>). Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for the years 2015–2017 show self-reported rates of current drinking, and binge drinking (<underline>&gt;</underline>4 drinks) within the past 30 days to be 11.5% and 3.9%, respectively, among pregnant woman aged 18–44 years. Pregnant binge drinkers averaged 4.5 binge episodes in the past 30 days with an average binge intensity of 6.0 drinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denny et al., 2019</xref>). As a result of such binge drinking episodes, FASD remains a major public health concern in the United States, and a recent assessment of first-graders in 4 US communities conservatively estimated the prevalence rates of FASD to range from 1.1% to 5.0% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">May et al., 2018</xref>). The global prevalence rate of FASD is estimated at 7.7 per 1000 children, and is as high as 111.1 per 1000 children among some populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lange et al., 2017</xref>). Despite this prevalence, our understanding of the embryonic pathoetiology of FASD is incomplete, hampering development of targeted medication and broadly applicable treatment strategies.</p><p>The more efficacious current treatments for FASD rely primarily on postnatal behavioral therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nash et al., 2017</xref>), or pharmaceutics aimed to treat the symptoms, rather than the etiology, of this neurodevelopmental disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peadon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rowles and Findling, 2010</xref>). Indeed, there is a societal need to uncover the cellular and subcellular underpinnings by which ethanol adversely affects neurodevelopmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ismail et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kodituwakku, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pruett et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we report on pharmacologic mitigation of ethanol-induced interneuronopathy and associated executive function deficits in a preclinical model of FASD.</p><p>GABAergic neuroblasts arising in the MGE are fated to become parvalbumin (PV<sup>+</sup>) or somatostatin expressing inhibitory interneurons in the cortex. Approximately 50% of this MGE-derived population will mature to become PV<sup>+</sup> fast-spiking basket cells which are electrically coupled across the deep layers of the neocortex and pace oscillatory gamma rhythms, which are required for higher cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batista-Brito and Fishell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the corticopetal tangential migration and maturation of MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons is critical to the establishment of inhibitory/excitatory balance in intracortical circuits, and proper cortical functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batista-Brito and Fishell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catterall, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Building on our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuzon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuzon et al., 2006</xref>), we hypothesized that ethanol’s positive allosteric modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) expressed on migrating neuroblasts is the mechanism by which in utero ethanol exposure causes enduring interneuronopathy in models of FASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skorput et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skorput and Yeh, 2016</xref>). In these immature neurons, GABA<sub>A</sub>R activation results in membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Ari, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Owens and Kriegstein, 2002</xref>). This paradoxical depolarizing action has been postulated to drive the corticopetal tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons during corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Ari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuzon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang and Kriegstein, 2009</xref>). To test the influence of GABAergic depolarization on ethanol-induced interneuronopathy, we sought to normalize ethanol’s potentiation of GABAergic depolarization by reducing the driving force of GABA-induced membrane depolarization via a decrease in the intracellular concentration of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R permeable anion Cl<sup>-</sup> ([Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>i</sub>).</p><p>To this end, we targeted the chloride importing Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>−2Cl<sup>-</sup> isoform one cotransporter (NKCC1) because it is expressed at high levels in the embryonic brain when its activity predominates over that of the chloride exporting K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter (KCC2). This differential activity results in a net higher [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>i</sub> compared to [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. As such, the reversal potential for chloride, and that of GABA-activated responses (E<sub>GABA</sub>), is set at a membrane potential that is depolarized relative to the resting membrane potential. Thus, GABA<sub>A</sub>R activation causes chloride extrusion and membrane depolarization in these migrating neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Ari, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Owens and Kriegstein, 2002</xref>). The loop diuretic bumetanide is an NKCC1 antagonist that shifts the E<sub>GABA</sub> of embryonic neuroblasts to a more negative membrane potential when administered maternally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang and Kriegstein, 2011</xref>). Given these considerations, we tested the hypothesis that in utero treatment with bumetanide during the period of prenatal ethanol exposure will mitigate manifestation of prenatal ethanol-induced aberrant tangential migration, and prevent deficits in behavioral flexibility.</p><p>The timing of gestational exposure to ethanol is a key determinant of the diagnostic outcome of FASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">May et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pruett et al., 2013</xref>). Corticogenesis occurs in earnest during the mid-first trimester when the developing brain is highly vulnerable to insult by ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayoola et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clancy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">May et al., 2014</xref>). We established a mouse model that simulates an early gestational, mid-first trimester human equivalent, exposure to binge-type maternal ethanol consumption from embryonic day (E) 13.5 - E16.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clancy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skorput et al., 2015</xref>). Using this model, we demonstrated enhanced entry of MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons into the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a persistent increase in the number of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons in the young adult PFC, and impairment in the PFC-dependent behavioral flexibility of offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skorput et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we used this mouse model to assess whether the NKCC1 cotransporter is a tractable pharmacological target for normalizing in utero ethanol exposure-induced escalation of tangential migration to the prefrontal cortex. We report here that ethanol induces a shift in E<sub>GABA</sub> toward a more depolarized potential, accounting at least in part for ethanol’s potentiation of GABA-induced depolarizing responses in embryonic MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons. In the short term, antagonizing NKCC1 with bumetanide mitigated ethanol-induced aberrant tangential migration. In the long term, bumetanide treatment in vivo prevented prenatal ethanol exposure-induced interneuronopathy in the prefrontal cortex, and the associated deficits in PFC-dependent behavioral flexibility. Our findings support the feasibility of a pharmacological strategy to target NKCC1 for the management of FASD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ethanol induces a depolarizing shift in the GABA reversal potential of embryonic MGE-derived GABAergic cortical interneurons that is normalized by the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide</title><p>Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup> embryonic MGE-derived GABAergic cortical interneurons were identified by tdTomato fluorescence and targeted for perforated patch clamp recording in acute (200 μm) telencephalic slices obtained from E14.5–16.5 Nkx2.1Cre/Ai14 mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Since GABA-induced membrane depolarization is prevalent in many types of immature neurons early in brain development and has been postulated to promote the tangential migration of GABAergic cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Ari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuzon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang and Kriegstein, 2009</xref>), we asked whether exogenously applied GABA depolarized embryonic Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup> cortical interneurons. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, the representative sets of digitized raw traces display current responses to 500 ms pressure applications of 50 μM GABA monitored at varying holding potentials before (black traces) and during ethanol exposure (red traces). The polarity and peak amplitude of each GABA response were plotted as a function of the corresponding holding potential, and the intercept of the current-voltage plot along the abscissa was used to estimate E<sub>GABA</sub>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> shows linear regression of the group mean data. The control mean E<sub>GABA</sub> (dotted black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) was −23.18 ± 1.45 mV, which was significantly more depolarized than the mean resting membrane potential, estimated in whole-cell mode (dotted blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; −41.9 ± 2.3 mV; unpaired t-test, p&lt;0.01). Importantly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> illustrates that ethanol exposure shifted E<sub>GABA</sub> rightward relative to that assessed during the control epoch (dotted red line) and subsequent washout of ethanol with aCSF shifted E<sub>GABA</sub> back to the control level (dotted gray line). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> illustrates the mean change in E<sub>GABA</sub> for each litter before and during ethanol exposure, indicating that the mean E<sub>GABA</sub> of control cells was shifted to significantly more depolarized membrane potentials with exposure to 6.5 mM ethanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>; −16.52 ± 0.93 mV; p = 0.0077) and shifted back to the control level following washout of ethanol with aCSF (gray dots; −21.57 ± 2.51 mV; p = 0.81; effect size ω<sup>2</sup> = 0.17).

These results offer insights into the developmental pathophysiology of FASD, and posit therapeutic avenues for novel treatments.</p><p>As shown by our electrophysiological studies, ethanol-induced depolarizing shifts in E<sub>GABA</sub> of similar magnitude without and with bumetanide pretreatment, suggesting that the depolarizing shift of E<sub>GABA</sub> induced by ethanol occurs independent of NKCC1 function. Further, since NKCC1 antagonism alone significantly shifted E<sub>GABA</sub> to more hyperpolarized values, it is likely that bumetanide does not directly inhibit the ethanol-induced depolarizing shift in E<sub>GABA</sub>, but rather normalizes it via a mechanism separate from NKCC1. Future studies examining the mechanism underlying the ethanol-induced shift in E<sub>GABA</sub> will be informative. It is plausible that ethanol shifts E<sub>GABA</sub> by enhancing the function of Cl<sup>-</sup> importers other than NKCC1, such as the sodium-independent anion exchange protein AE3. AE3 is expressed in the brain by E11 and augments the electrochemical gradient of chloride and bicarbonate in neurons, both of which are permeable through the GABA<sub>A</sub>R (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hübner and Holthoff, 2013</xref>). Importantly, this is likely an age-dependent phenomenon since GABA is depolarizing only during early development.</p><p>In this study, the normalization of [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, and thus the chloride driving force, had the predicted effect of attenuating GABA induced depolarizing currents in migrating cortical interneurons. Previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuzon et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuzon et al. (2008)</xref> investigating the cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to GABA’s influence on tangential migration argue strongly for GABA<sub>A</sub>R-activated membrane depolarization influencing both prototypical migration of GABAergic interneurons and their abnormal migration induced by ethanol exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuzon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuzon et al., 2006</xref>). The importance of GABA<sub>A</sub>R signaling in tangential migration is consistent with work by others describing the dependence of interneuron migration on depolarization induced calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behar et al., 1996</xref>). Future investigations will need to address whether the binge paradigm used here alters extrinsic GABA influences, such as ambient GABA levels, and whether ethanol-induced potentiation of depolarizing GABA responses triggers activation of voltage-gated calcium channels and/or intracellular signaling cascades to induce aberrant migration of GABAergic interneurons.</p><p>The concept of a GABA-induced depolarization is not without controversy, as a number of studies suggest that this may be due to artifacts associated with in vitro experimental preparations that result in cellular injury and/or altered energy metabolism. Nonetheless, many other studies support the notion that GABA is depolarizing during development, and this controversy has been extensively reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zilberter, 2016</xref>). Overall, the results of our gramicidin perforated patch clamp experiments show that GABA exerts a depolarizing response in migrating MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons at embryonic ages, and that ethanol potentiates this response.</p><p>The ability of bumetanide to prevent aberrant tangential migration following in utero binge-type exposure to ethanol at the height of interneuron migration sheds light on the mechanistic basis of ethanol’s enhancement of tangential migration. Maternal injection with a similar dose of bumetanide has been shown to shift the reversal potential of GABA mediated currents in neonatal cortical neurons, suggesting that maternally administered bumetanide reaches the embryonic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang and Kriegstein, 2011</xref>). With the doses of bumetanide used here, we did not see a reduction in tangential migration below levels seen in control animals, suggesting the existence of a therapeutic window in which bumetanide treatment can inhibit the aberrant migration induced by ethanol exposure in utero while not significantly effecting endogenous migration. Despite not impacting tangential migration in vitro, bumetanide at 20 µM did significantly shift the E<sub>GABA</sub> of migrating interneurons to more hyperpolarized values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). This discrepancy may be due to the limited magnitude of the shift in E<sub>GABA</sub>, and/or a difference in the acute vs persistent effects of bumetanide on E<sub>GABA</sub> in MGE-derived GABAergic cortical interneurons. Further mechanistic investigations are warranted regarding the interactions of ethanol and bumetanide in augmenting E<sub>GABA</sub> in both acute, and chronic settings across a range of concentrations.</p><p>Our experiments testing the long-term outcome of bumetanide treatment during binge-type ethanol exposure at the height of interneuron migration offer insights into the role of interneuronopathy in the pathophysiology of FASD, and the potential for bumetanide as a preventative treatment. The prevention of in utero ethanol exposure-induced changes in interneuron migration and final positioning remain correlative with the observed normalization of behavioral flexibility. However, this work strongly implicates interneuronopathy in the etiology and symptomatology of FASD. Parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneurons in the mPFC pace gamma rhythms required for higher cognitive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). These rhythms are disrupted by either subnormal or supernormal parvalbumin interneuron function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlén et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, cognitive behavioral deficits resulting from I/E imbalance within intracortical circuits can become manifest regardless of the directionality of this skewing, for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferguson and Gao (2018a)</xref>. To this end, it has been demonstrated that increased excitability among mPFC PV neurons results in increased perseverative behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferguson and Gao, 2018b</xref>), consistent with the increased perseverative behavior reported here in mice with increased numbers of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the mPFC following prenatal ethanol exposure. It is unlikely that aberrant tangential migration is the only effect of ethanol that contributes to the imbalance of synaptic inhibition and excitation in FASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kroener et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skorput et al., 2015</xref>). However, bumetanide’s ability to prevent this migratory defect in vivo suggests that such treatment may prevent ethanol-induced teratogenic effects on other cell populations that occur via potentiation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R activation. GABAergic interneuron migration appears to be sensitive to concentrations of ethanol that do not induce the widespread neuronal loss most commonly seen in the setting of high level exposure at a developmental time equivalent to late human gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farber et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, interneuronopathy may be an underlying etiology in a significantly larger population of FASD patients than is neurodegeneration. Dams treated with bumetanide and/or ethanol for the limited duration modeled here did not exhibit significant deviation of body weight or physical condition compared to controls. However, the influence of maternal bumetanide effects on the endpoints measured here in offspring warrant future investigation. A potential caveat of this work is that the behavioral studies lacked the DMSO alone and bumetanide alone treatment groups. These groups were included in subsequent experiments that quantified interneuronopathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), and the results confirmed that DMSO or bumetanide, by themselves, have no effect on the ethanol-induced enhancement of interneuronal migration. The concentration of DMSO injected i.p. was 0.075%; the final concentration in vivo would have been expected to have been significantly lower. Future experiments investigating the therapeutic window of maternal bumetanide treatment would be enhanced by including these control groups. We have demonstrated a reduction in the perseverative behavior of mice exposed to ethanol in utero. However, other FASD cognitive phenotypes remain to be examined. In this light, future investigations should also assess other FASD-related behaviors and the cellular underpinnings in the associated cortical regions.</p><p>Preliminary studies report changes in fMRI activation and improvement in executive functioning with behavioral therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nash et al., 2017</xref>). However, no treatments are currently available to ameliorate the developmental etiology of prenatal alcohol exposure. The work presented here offers antagonism of NKCC1 as a mechanism by which the short-term effects of binge-type ethanol exposure are mitigated, leading to prevention of a previously demonstrated ethanol-induced cognitive deficit. Indeed, developmental bumetanide exposure has been proposed for the treatment of neonatal epilepsy, and possible adverse effects have been reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Ari, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Ari and Tyzio, 2011</xref>). Our work shows that bumetanide has a biological effect on ethanol-enhanced tangential migration when administered maternally via both intraperitoneal and oral routes. While the co-administration of ethanol and bumetanide employed here served to assess mechanistic questions regarding GABAergic interneuron migration and the implications of interneuronopathy in FASD, the more likely clinical scenario would be administration of bumetanide after ethanol exposure (e.g. a patient learns she is 6 weeks pregnant, and reports binge drinking within that period of time). Therefore, the next step for this work is clearly to assess bumetanide’s ability to prevent or mitigate the long-term deleterious effects of in utero ethanol exposure when administered at times after ethanol exposure.</p><p>While it is likely that some enhancement of tangential migration has occurred initially, it is possible that bumetanide treatment will slow migration of subsequent interneurons to the cortex. Alternatively, it may be that bumetanide treatment later in development, when cortical neurons have already reached their final location, may allow changes in synaptic integration to prevent consolidation of what would otherwise be an imbalanced circuit. Physiological maturation of PV<sup>+</sup> cortical interneurons closes the critical period of synaptic plasticity during corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Versendaal and Levelt, 2016</xref>). This maturation is driven by depolarizing GABAergic activity, and thus, is sensitive to the activity level of NKCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deidda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Versendaal and Levelt, 2016</xref>). Indeed, work in the visual cortex demonstrates the ability for bumetanide treatment to exert lasting effects on intracortical circuit formation by extending the critical period of synaptic plasticity via a delay in the physiological maturation of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deidda et al., 2015</xref>). NKCC1 antagonist treatment may therefore be beneficial for mitigating interneuronopathy directly via a delay of MGE-derived interneurons, and/or indirectly by mitigating the deleterious effects of interneuronopathy on consolidation of intracortical circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Nkx2.1-Cre</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>JAX: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/00861">00861</ext-link> <break/>MGI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/reference/J:131144">J:131144</ext-link></td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17990269">17990269</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Ai14</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>JAX: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/007914">007914</ext-link> <break/>MGI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/reference/J:155793">J:155793</ext-link></td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20023653">20023653</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-parvalbumin <break/>(mouse polyclonal)</td><td>Millipore Sigma</td><td>Cat#: MAB 1572</td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>GABA</td><td>Millipore Sigma</td><td>Cat#: A2129</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Bumetanide</td><td>Millipore Sigma</td><td>Cat#: B-3023</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ</td><td>NIH</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Adobe Photoshop</td><td>Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Graphpad Prism</td><td>Graphpad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com/">http://www.graphpad.com/</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>G*Power 3.1</td><td>Heinrich Heine <break/>University Düsseldorf</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013726">SCR_013726</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> and approved by the Dartmouth Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Slice cultures were placed in a humidified incubator (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) for 1 hr, after which the following culture media were prepared and used to replenish sister slice cultures every 6 hr over the next 24 hr: (1) 50 mM EtOH; (2) 20 μM bumetanide; (3) 50 mM EtOH + 20 μM bumetanide; (4) vehicle (DMSO, 7.5 × 10<sup>−4</sup>%). The concentration of ethanol (50 mM) was relatively high but well within the conventional range of concentrations (up to 100 mM) employed in studies involving ethanol exposure in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larsen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zou et al., 1993</xref>).

Pregnant dams were individually housed and assigned to one of two groups: ethanol-fed, or control-fed. Mice were maintained under normal 12/12 hr light/dark cycle on a liquid diet (Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) supplemented with ethanol (5% w/w; ethanol-fed group) or an isocaloric control diet containing maltose (control-fed group); water was available ad libitum. The liquid food was replenished daily between 3:00 and 5:00 PM, when the amount consumed was measured and the dams weighed. Mice were maintained on their respective diets from E13.5 until E16.5, after which they were returned to standard chow. Dam blood alcohol level (BAL; 80 ± 21 mg/dl) was assessed using an Analox Instruments GM7 series analyzer (Lunenburg, MA), with blood collected via the tail vein at 11:30 PM on E15.5. Dams subjected to our regimen of binge-type gestational ethanol consumption carried their offspring to full term, litter size was unaffected (7.50 ± 0.62 for Control pups; 7.67 ± 0.76 for EtOH-exposed pups; unpaired t-test p&gt;0.05), and offspring in all control and experimental cohorts developed normally to young adulthood for behavioral testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skorput et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Bumetanide solution for intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection was prepared fresh from powder at the start of each binge epoch by adding bumetanide to normal saline at 0.015 mg/ml or by dissolving bumetanide in DMSO at 20 mg/ml stock concentration that was diluted to 0.015 mg/ml in normal saline for daily i.p. injections. Bumetanide was injected into binge ethanol-consuming dams at 10 ml/kg, yielding a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day over the 3-day binge period. Normal saline or bumetanide i.p. injections did not alter the amount of liquid food consumed (one-way ANOVA; p = 0.62) or the BAL (one-way ANOVA; p = 0.99) of dams fed with ethanol. Bumetanide delivery via liquid food was accomplished by dissolving the bumetanide sodium salt in the water used to make 5% ethanol-containing liquid food at; 1.3, 13, 130, 320 mg of bumetanide salt per kg of food.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Imaging and analysis of immunofluorescence and Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup> MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons in the prefrontal cortex</title><p>Time-pregnant dams were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation on E16.5. The embryos were quickly removed, their brains dissected, immerse-fixed overnight at 4°C in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/0.1M PBS. Cryosections (30 μm) were cut with a sliding microtome, mounted on glass slides, DAPI counterstained and cover slipped with FluorSave Reagent (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The embryonic prefrontal cortex (PFC) was delineated as part of the dorsomedial telencephalon based on DAPI counterstaining of the same sections used for counting and analyzing cells. For each embryonic brain, 10 consecutive sections of the embryonic PFC beginning at equivalent rostral-caudal levels were analyzed for counts of Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><p>Young adult mice were perfused trans-cardially with cold PBS and then with 4% PFA/0.1 M PBS. Brains were removed and immerse fixed in 4% PFA/0.1M PBS overnight at 4°C. Following cryoprotection in 30% sucrose, 30 μm coronal sections were made on a sliding microtome, and collected into PBS. Young adult tissue sections were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in PBS containing 10% NGS and 0.05% Triton X-100. Then incubated overnight at 4° C with mouse anti-parvalbumin primary antibody (Millipore) at a dilution of 1:1000 in PBS containing 1% NGS and 0.01% Triton X-100. Following 3X washing in PBS, sections were incubated overnight with a 1:1000 dilution of Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) in PBS containing 1% NGS and 0.01% Triton X-100. Negative control with primary antibody omitted was routinely processed in parallel. For each young adult brain, sections were defined as containing the PFC beginning with the rostral most section in which all five layers of the PFC were visible, and extending caudally to the decussation of the corpus callosum. Within this operationally defined region of the PFC, images were captured from ten consecutive sections per animal beginning at equivalent rostral-caudal levels. Parvalbumin-immunopositive cells were manually counted per subdivision and per layer by trained experimenters blinded to the treatment conditions using Image J software.</p><p>Fluorescent images were captured digitally using a CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu city, Japan) fitted onto a spinning disk confocal microscope (BX61WI; Olympus, Melville, NY) and controlled by IPLab 4.0 software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Images were stitched using Fiji image J (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preibisch et al., 2009</xref>) to yield a full view of the region of interest. For in vivo experiments, counting of PV<sup>+</sup> or Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup> MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons in the embryonic or young adult PFC was automated using Fiji’s auto segmentation algorithm (RenyiEntropy) within the manually defined region of interest. For in vitro experiments, histological sections of organotypic slice cultures were imaged at 4X and the images were montaged to allow visualization of the cortex from the corticostriate junction to the dorsal apex. One hundred micron consecutive bins spanning the thickness of the cortex were organized along the ventral to dorsal extent of the cortex, with the starting point of the first bin aligned at the corticostriate juncture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuzon et al., 2006</xref>). The Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup> MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons within these bins were quantified by trained experimenters blinded to the experimental condition using Fiji’s cell counting tool.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Modified Barnes maze</title><p>Young adult mice (P58-70) were tested behaviorally using a modified Barnes maze as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koopmans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skorput et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, the maze consisted of twelve equally-spaced holes around a circular wall (d = 95 cm), with spatial cues (large red letters) placed between the holes along the interior surface of the circular wall. Each mouse was randomly assigned an escape hole within a quadrant. All other holes were plugged. Mice were trained to find the escape hole with four 4 min trials per day for 4 consecutive days. Each trial ended when the mouse entered the escape hole. The mouse was then returned to its home cage (escape reinforcement). Following the training phase, the mice were rested for 2 days, and then tested for their ability to recall the position of the escape hole on the next 2 days, with four 4 min trials per day (testing phase). After 2 days of testing, the location of the escape hole was switched to the hole directly opposite its initial position (reversal phase). Mice were then tested for their ability to find the reversed escape hole with four 4 min trials per day over the subsequent 2 days.</p><p>At the beginning of each trial, the mouse was placed in the center of the maze and covered with a start box; time began when the box was removed. Latency to enter escape hole, time per quadrant; Home (H), Clockwise (CW), Opposite (Opp.), Counter Clockwise (CCW) (clock directions are relative to escape quadrant), and distance per quadrant measurements were made via video tracking software running an overhead camera hung at a set distance from the surface of the maze. During a trial, errors made (nose pokes in non-escape hole) and their locations, were recorded manually by observers on opposite sides of the arena.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>All young adult histological data were acquired from the defined subregions and layers within the PFC. All groups consisted of data acquired from ten 30 μm tissue sections per animal (n = 1: 1 animal = 10 sections) from a minimum three individual animals of multiple litters. For electrophysiological data, n refers to the number of litters used in order to minimize litter effects, and the total number of cells recorded for each experiment is noted in results. As the variability (standard deviation) of histological and behavioral end points was larger between individual offspring than that between data averaged per litter, we reported the mean data per individual offspring ± standard error. Reporting the more variable unit of determination is more representative of the true biological variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brien et al., 2006</xref>). All groups consisted of data acquired from a minimum three individual offspring from multiple litters. Power calculations were performed using the G*Power 3.1 software depending on whether the data were analyzed using t-test or ANOVA. Variance and expected differences were estimated by using group means and standard deviations from preliminary data or past experience in similar studies and reviews of related use in the literature. Group means were compared by unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA with appropriate post-hoc test as indicated, and reported in figure legends, and reported as mean (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>) ± standard error in the results section. Reported exact p values are multiplicity adjusted for ANOVA testing of multiple comparisons. The effect sizes reported (Cohen’s d for t-tests and ω<sup>2</sup> for ANOVAs) were calculated using the Graphpad Prism software and formulas from Lakens (2013). We note that previously published counts of prenatal and postnatal cortical interneurons and behavioral data obtained from control, and prenatal binge ethanol-exposed young adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skorput et al., 2015</xref>) were included for comparison with the bumetanide-treated cohort in the present study. This was justified as, in practice, the experiments involving all three cohorts were conducted in parallel, and reporting of the bumetanide data required the subsequent mechanistic studies reported

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joseph Gleeson as the Reviewing Editor and Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: C Fernando Valenzuela (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study of Skorput et al. investigated the effect of pharmacological antagonism of NKCC1 (with bumetanide) on ethanol-induced alterations of tangential interneuronal migration in the prefrontal cortex. This manuscript represents an extension of prior work from the same laboratory and other laboratories that showed that prenatal ethanol exposure increases migration of interneurons from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) likely through increased ambient GABA concentration and enhanced embryonic GABAergic signaling (Cuzon et al., 2008). In addition the Yeh laboratory has shown in prior work that gestational ethanol exposure caused (1) an enduring increase in the number of Parvalbumin+ interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex, (2) increased spontaneous and evoked GABA-ergic synaptic transmission on layer V pyramidal neurons and (3) altered reversal behavior in a Barnes maze test (Skorput et al., 2015).</p><p>In this study, Skorput et al. confirm that EtOH potentiates the depolarizing actions of GABA on migrating (Nkx2.1+) interneurons in the mouse model of E13.5-16.5 binge-type ethanol exposure. The authors then show that bumetanide, an inhibitor of the NKCC1 chloride transporter, could counteract the effects ethanol's potentiation of GABAergic depolarization. Bumetanide was able block ethanol's enhancement of interneuron migration from the MGE both in slice preparation and in vivo. In addition bumetanide protected gestational ethanol – exposed embryos from a behavioral deficit in reversal behavior in the Barnes maze test. From this the authors argue that bumetanide may be potential therapeutic approach to ameliorating FASD. The significance of this study is twofold.</p><p>1) This study demonstrates that enhancement of depolarizing action of GABA is necessary for fetal ethanol-induced aberrant migration and the excess of interneurons in PFC, because abrogating the enhanced depolarizing action of GABA prevents the aberrant migration and the excess of interneurons in PFC by the ethanol exposure.</p><p>2) This study posits NKCC1 as a pharmacological target for the management of FASD.</p><p>While two of the reviewers were positive, one reviewer commented since many of the findings have been reported earlier, the significance of the work rests largely on the bumetanide reversal of the ethanol effect. While potentially interesting, the potential neuroprotective effects of bumetanide are documented in only one behavioral test and in one type of neurons in one area of cortex. Whether bumetanide is broadly protective for fetal alcohol exposure is unknown and thus the finding seems somewhat narrow for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- For the studies with organotypic slice cultures, a substantially higher ethanol concentration was used (50 mM vs. 6.5 mM for the acute slice studies vs. 80 mg/dl (17 mM) for the in vivo studies) and the reason for doing this was not provided. Ethanol is known to exert dose-dependent effects that could be non-linear (inverted U shaped). Have the investigators tested if 50 mM affects E<sub>GABA</sub> and GABA<sub>A</sub> responses in the same direction as lower ethanol concentrations?</p><p>- In Figures 4-6, it is critical to measure the effect of bumetanide on blood ethanol concentrations in the dams. Bumetanide is a loop diuretic that could affect liquid diet or water consumption in the dams. The effects of bumetanide should be confirmed with a different approach (manipulation of NKCC1 expression?). In addition, the definition of the unit of determination for these studies was arbitrarily changed to an animal. Justification for doing this should be provided.</p><p>- Several important controls are missing in Figures 4 and 6. DMSO alone, bumetanide alone, etc. Please include these controls or explain why they were not performed.</p><p>- Discrepancy of the bumetanide effects on the control between the reversal potential E<sub>GABA</sub> (Figure 1E, rightmost) and interneuron migration (Figure 3B, rightmost). This reviewer agrees with the authors' view, but is wondering if the authors have data on the GABA response amplitude (peak current amplitude) comparing aCSF and aCSF + bumetanide conditions, in the Figure 2 experiments.</p><p>- Relationship between the increased number of interneurons in PFC and the impaired behavioral flexibility requires clarification. In their previous paper (Skorput et al., 2015), the authors referred to the work by Cho et al. (2015, Neuron, 85:1332-1343). But the latter mouse showed reduced number of interneurons in the prefrontal cortex. To prove that the interneuronopathy of this type (increase in the number of interneurons) is the etiology of impaired behavioral flexibility, an additional experiment that increases the number of interneurons in the PFC by other means than ethanol, or previous reports on mutant mice with similar increase in the number of interneurons, should be considered, either discussed or performed. If not presented then greater caution should be exercised with regard to the proposed mechanism.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48648.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- For the studies with organotypic slice cultures, a substantially higher ethanol concentration was used (50 mM vs. 6.5 mM for the acute slice studies vs. 80 mg/dl (17 mM) for the in vivo studies) and the reason for doing this was not provided.

Have the investigators tested if 50 mM affects E<sub>GABA</sub> and GABA<sub>A</sub> responses in the same direction as lower ethanol concentrations?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer appropriately points out (1) that we neglected to address whether or not 50 mM ethanol affects E<sub>GABA</sub> and GABA<sub>A</sub> responses in the same direction as the lower ethanol concentrations because (2) ethanol can exert inverted U-shaped concentration-dependent effects (our lab was one among several that noted this observation in the 1990s).</p><p>We now include supplementary figures summarizing data derived from new experiments and indicating that 50 mM ethanol indeed shifts E<sub>GABA</sub> in the same direction (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) and potentiates GABA-activated current responses (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) as do the lower concentrations of ethanol. Indeed, our earlier studies on ethanol-GABA interaction standardly used 50 mM because it was the concentration of ethanol that we found to be consistently most effective in potentiating GABA responses (peak of the inverted U-shaped concentration/response curve). Also for this reason, we chose to use 50 mM in our initial studies with the organotypic embryonic slices in order to see an effect. However, although many other studies have used ethanol concentrations up to 100 mM (e.g., Zou et al., 1993; Kumada et al., 2006), we realized that 50 mM is a high and non-physiological concentration of ethanol. Therefore, in subsequent studies, we lowered the ethanol concentration to 17 mM or 6.5 mM, which are equivalent to the blood alcohol concentrations that we obtain in our binge-type or chronic maternal ethanol consumption mouse models, respectively (and yielded the same results). We have added a comment to this effect in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Organotypic embryonic slice cultures”, second paragraph) and revised the Results section accordingly (subsection “Ethanol induces a depolarizing shift in the GABA reversal potential of embryonic MGE-derived GABAergic cortical interneurons that is normalized by the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide”, end of first paragraph; subsection “Bumetanide attenuates ethanol-induced potentiation of depolarizing GABA responses in embryonic MGE-derived GABAergic cortical interneurons”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figures 4-6, it is critical to measure the effect of bumetanide on blood ethanol concentrations in the dams.

We looked into obtaining the constitutive NKCC1 knockout mouse line from the Jackson Laboratories (stock No: 34262-JAX), but 30% of the homozygotic knockout mice die by the time of weaning. In addition, they are 80% smaller than wildtype as adults, have difficulty maintaining their balance, are deaf and, thus, are not suitable for investigating the role of NKCC1 in tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons. We also attempted to acquire an NKCC1-floxed mouse line from Germany but found the material transfer conditions unacceptable and shipping logistics prohibitive. Therefore, in the current work, we resorted to using the pharmacological inhibitor of NKCC1, bumetanide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the definition of the unit of determination for these studies was arbitrarily changed to an animal. Justification for doing this should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. This is now highlighted and justified in the “Statistics” subsection of the Materials and methods. In our analyses, we used the unit of determination that offered the largest degree of biological variability. For the histological and behavioral studies, the variability (standard deviation) among individual offspring was larger than that between data averaged per litter (consistent with previous studies modeling FASD and noting this difference in variability e.g., Brien et al., 2006). Therefore, we used individual offspring as the unit of determination as it is a better reflection of the true biological variability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Several important controls are missing in Figures 4 and 6. DMSO alone, bumetanide alone, etc. Please include these controls or explain why they were not performed.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 4: In the experiment illustrated in Figure 4, we felt justified not to include DMSO alone administered i.p. as one of the control cohorts because bumetanide administration via a different route that did not use DMSO as solvent (i.e., bumetanide salt in food) produced similar results. In addition, bumetanide in normal saline delivered i.p. controlled for the i.p. route of administration and, as presented in Figure 3 (in vitro) and Figure 5 (in vivo), bumetanide alone did not alter interneuron number. These observations, in toto, led us to bypass DMSO and Bumetanide alone as control cohorts in Figure 4 in order to minimize the use of experimental animals while effectively testing the hypothesis that bumetanide inhibits ethanol-induced enhancement of MGE derived interneurons in vivo. A statement has been added to the Results section to highlight this caveat (subsection “Maternal bumetanide treatment prevents ethanol-induced escalation of tangential migration in vivo”, last paragraph).</p><p>Figure 6: The behavioral experiments were performed in parallel with the studies reported in Skorput et al. (2015). We acknowledge that the DMSO and bumetanide only cohorts were not included in our behavioral testing. However, we did control for DMSO and bumetanide alone in subsequent experiments that quantified interneuronopathy (Figures 3 and 5). A statement has been added to the sixth paragraph of the Discussion to highlight this caveat, as well as to address the scope of the behavioral findings, the latter raised as a concern by one reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Discrepancy of the bumetanide effects on the control between the reversal potential E<sub>GABA</sub> (Figure 1E, rightmost) and interneuron migration (Figure 3B, rightmost).

To prove that the interneuronopathy of this type (increase in the number of interneurons) is the etiology of impaired behavioral flexibility, an additional experiment that increases the number of interneurons in the PFC by other means than ethanol, or previous reports on mutant mice with similar increase in the number of interneurons, should be considered, either discussed or performed. If not presented then greater caution should be exercised with regard to the proposed mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out – it was our oversight not having discussed this important issue. Our view is that cognitive behavioral deficits resulting from I/E imbalance within intracortical circuits manifest regardless of the directionality of the skewing. In addition to the study cited in Skorput et al. (2015) and referenced by the reviewer (Cho et al., 2015), study of mouse cognition has shown that pharmacologic activation of the GABAergic system in the prefrontal cortex with the GABA<sub>A</sub>R agonist muscimol reduces behavioral flexibility (Rich and Shapiro, 2007). In addition, Ferguson and Gao (2018b) demonstrated that enhanced inhibitory tone in the mPFC induced by a pharmacogenetic increase in the excitability of PV neurons resulted in increased perseverative behaviors. These findings and others were recently reviewed by Ferguson and Gao (2018a) in which they also conclude that “Modulation of PV activity has also been useful in demonstrating one of the more obvious principles of E/I balance, that too much inhibition can also impair PFC circuit function”.We have added a statement in sixth paragraph of the Discussion section to address this important point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
