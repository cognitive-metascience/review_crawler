(SCD) is characterized by corneal opacification owing to overaccumulation of cholesterol. SCD is caused by mutations in UBIAD1, which utilizes geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) to synthesize vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Using cultured cells, we previously showed that sterols trigger binding of UBIAD1 to the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR), thereby inhibiting its endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) (Schumacher et al. 2015). GGpp triggers release of UBIAD1 from HMGCR, allowing maximal ERAD and ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1. SCD-associated UBIAD1 resists GGpp-induced release and is sequestered in ER to inhibit ERAD. We now report knockin mice expressing SCD-associated UBIAD1 accumulate HMGCR in several tissues resulting from ER sequestration of mutant UBIAD1 and inhibition of HMGCR ERAD. Corneas from aged knockin mice exhibit signs of opacification and sterol overaccumulation. These results establish the physiological significance of UBIAD1 in cholesterol homeostasis and indicate inhibition of HMGCR ERAD contributes to SCD pathogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ER-associated degradation</kwd><kwd>vitamin K</kwd><kwd>geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>isoprenoid</kwd><kwd>Schnyder corneal dystrophy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL-20948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeBose-Boyd</surname><given-names>Russell A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM-112409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeBose-Boyd</surname><given-names>Russell A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>UBIAD1 mediates a unique geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate-sensing mechanism that when disrupted, inhibits degradation of HMG CoA reductase and triggers overproduction of corneal cholesterol that characterizes the eye disease Schnyder Corneal Dystrophy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mutations in the gene encoding UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein-1 (UBIAD1) cause Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD), a rare autosomal dominant eye disease characterized by opacification of the cornea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klintworth, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weiss, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Orr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weiss et al., 2007</xref>). Although apparent early in life, corneal opacification associated with SCD progresses slowly with age and ultimately leads to reduced visual acuity. The severity of visual impairment is underscored by the frequency in which corneal transplant surgery is utilized for treatment of SCD, which rises from 50% in SCD patientsÂ &gt;Â 50 years of age to more than 70% for those 70 years and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weiss, 2007</xref>). Biochemical analyses of corneas from SCD patients revealed a marked accumulation of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCarthy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaynor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamada et al., 1998</xref>), suggesting that dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of SCD. Systemic hypercholesterolemia has been reported to be associated with some, but not all cases of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thiel et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brownstein et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crispin, 2002</xref>).</p><p>UBIAD1 belongs to the UbiA superfamily of integral membrane prenyltransferases that catalyze transfer of isoprenyl groups to aromatic acceptors, generating a wide variety of molecules ranging from ubiquinones, chlorophylls, and hemes to vitamin E and vitamin K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li, 2016</xref>). UBIAD1 mediates transfer of the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl moiety from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) to menadione (vitamin K<sub>3</sub>) released from plant-derived phylloquinone (vitamin K<sub>1</sub>), generating the vitamin K<sub>2</sub> subtype menaquinone-4 (MK-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakagawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirota et al., 2013</xref>). To date, 25 missense mutations that alter 21 amino acids in the UBIAD1 protein have been identified in SCD families. Structural analyses of archaeal UbiA prenyltransferases revealed that residues corresponding to SCD-associated mutations in human UBIAD1 cluster around the active site of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng and Li, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, all SCD-associated variants of UBIAD1 are defective in mediating synthesis of MK-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hirota et al., 2015</xref>; Jun, D.-J. and DeBose-Boyd, R.A., unpublished observations) and for some variants, this defect likely results from reduced affinity for GGpp.</p><p>The first link between UBIAD1 and cholesterol metabolism was provided by the discovery of its association with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nickerson et al., 2013</xref>). HMGCR catalyzes reduction of HMG CoA to mevalonate, a reaction that constitutes the rate-limiting step in synthesis of cholesterol and the essential nonsterol isoprenoids GGpp and farnesyl pyrophosphate (Fpp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldstein and Brown, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Casey, 2016</xref>). Fpp and GGpp can become transferred to many cellular proteins and are utilized in synthesis of other nonsterol isoprenoids including ubiquinone, heme, dolichol, and MK-4. HMGCR is subjected to tight feedback control through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms mediated by sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brown and Goldstein, 1980</xref>). Sterols mediate the transcriptional effects by inhibiting proteolytic activation of membrane-bound transcription factors called sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). SREBPs enhance transcription of genes encoding HMGCR and other cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes as well as the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor that removes cholesterol-rich LDL from circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horton et al., 2003</xref>). Post-transcriptional regulation of HMGCR is mediated by sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids, which combine to accelerate the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of HMGCR through a reaction that involves the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakanishi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ravid et al., 2000</xref>). Together, these feedback regulatory mechanisms coordinate metabolism of mevalonate to assure cells maintain constant production of nonsterol isoprenoids but avoid overaccumulation of cholesterol and other sterols.</p><p>Our group discovered that accumulation of sterols in ER membranes triggers binding of HMGCR to ER membrane proteins called Insigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sever et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sever et al., 2003b</xref>). Subsequent ubiquitination of HMGCR by Insig-associated ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>) mark the enzyme for extraction across ER membranes and release into the cytosol for proteasome-mediated ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elsabrouty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morris et al., 2014</xref>). GGpp augments ERAD of ubiquitinated HMGCR by enhancing its membrane extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elsabrouty et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, we discovered that sterols also cause a subset of HMGCR molecules to bind to UBIAD1 (32). This binding protects HMGCR from accelerated ERAD, permitting continued synthesis of nonsterol isoprenoids even when cellular sterols are abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>). GGpp triggers release of UBIAD1 from HMGCR, which allows for maximal ERAD of HMGCR and ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1 (34). Eliminating expression of UBIAD1 relieves the GGpp requirement for HMGCR ERAD, indicating the reaction is inhibited by UBIAD1. Further characterization revealed that despite its steady-state Golgi localization in GGpp-replete cells, UBIAD1 continuously cycles between the ER and Golgi. Upon sensing depletion of GGpp in membranes of the ER, UBIAD1 becomes trapped in the organelle and inhibits ERAD of HMGCR to stimulate synthesis of mevalonate for replenishment of GGpp. The physiologic relevance of UBIAD1-mediated sensing of GGpp is highlighted by the observation that the reaction appears to be disrupted in SCD. SCD-associated UBIAD1 resists GGpp-induced release from HMGCR and becomes sequestered in the ER of GGpp-replete cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schumacher et al., 2016</xref>). The ensuing inhibition of HMGCR ERAD, which occurs in a dominant-negative fashion, leads to a marked increase in synthesis and intracellular accumulation of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The current studies were designed to confirm the role of UBIAD1 in regulation of HMGCR ERAD and cholesterol metabolism in living animals. For this purpose, we generated mice that harbor a knockin mutation that changes asparagine-100 (N100)Â inÂ UBIAD1 to a serine residue (N100S) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The N100S mutation in mouse UBIAD1 corresponds to the SCD-associated UBIAD1 (N102S) mutation in the human enzyme. We show here that knockin mice homozygous for the N100S mutation (designated as <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice) accumulate HMGCR protein in several tissues, despite a reduction in the amount of <italic>Hmgcr</italic> mRNA owing to sterol accumulation and reduced activation of SREBPs. The accumulation of HMGCR protein resulted from sequestration of UBIAD1 (N100S) in the ER and inhibition of HMGCR ERAD at a post-ubiquitination step of the reaction. Aged <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice exhibited signs of opacification of the cornea, which was accompanied by hallmarks of sterol overaccumulation in the tissue. These findings not only indicate that UBIAD1 modulates ERAD of HMGCR in mice through similar mechanisms previously established in cultured cells, but they also establish <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice as a model for human SCD.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44396.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Accumulation of HMGCR protein in livers of <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice with mixed C57BL/6 Ã 129 genetic background.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Amino acid sequence and predicted topology of mouse UBIAD1 protein.

This conclusion was drawn from the analysis of <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice harboring a knockin mutation (N100S) that corresponds to the SCD-associated N102S mutation in human UBIAD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with our studies of human UBIAD1 (N102S) in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>), mouse UBIAD1 (N100S) inhibited ERAD of HMGCR <italic>in vivo</italic> as indicated by accumulation of the protein in livers and other tissues of <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These increases in HMGCR protein occurred despite reduced levels of its mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), which was attributable to reduced proteolytic activation of SREBP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>) resulting from accumulation of hepatic cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Corneas from 8 to 12 week-old <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice failed to exhibit opacification of the cornea (data not shown), despite the marked accumulation of HMGCR protein in the eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Conversely, corneal opacification was observed in aged <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice (50 weeks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) that was accompanied by a buildup of HMGCR protein in the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This opacification occurred in the absence of an increase in total cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). However, <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> corneas displayed other hallmarks of sterol overaccumulation including an increase in levels of free cholesterol and sterol intermediates of cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>), reduced levels of mRNAs for HMGCR and other cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes, and enhanced expression of mRNAs encoding ABCG5, ABCG8, and ABCA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Based on these observations, we conclude that UBIAD1 (N100S)-mediated inhibition of HMGCR ERAD enhances flux through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, thereby initiating sterol accumulation and development of corneal opacification. Our current findings suggest the slow progression of corneal opacification in <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice results from reduced activation of SREBP-2, which leads to reduced expression of genes encoding cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes. Studies are now underway to monitor progression of corneal opacification in <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> miceÂ &gt;Â 50 weeks of age. We anticipate that as the disorder progresses, free cholesterol will continue to accumulate, initiating formation and accumulation of cholesterol esters, which will further exacerbate opacification of the cornea. Additionally, <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice will be challenged with high cholesterol/Western diets to determine whether dietary cholesterol contributes to progression of corneal opacification in SCD.</p><p>A preliminary analysis of UBIAD1 (N100S) knockin mice has been recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dong et al., 2018</xref>). However, this study lacks the molecular characterization of HMGCR and documentation of age-dependent corneal opacification in the knockin animals. Instead, the authors report evidence for mitochondrial damage and accumulation of mitochondrial-localized glycerophosphoglycerols in knockin corneas. The authors conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to the abnormal deposition of cholesterol in corneas of SCD patients, constrasting our conclusion the response results from inhibition of HMGCR ERAD. The possibility exists that this mitochondrial dysfunction is secondary to cholesterol accumulation and/or impairment of MK-4 synthesis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) in <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice. Further investigation is required to resolve this discrepancy.</p><p>Examination of <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic>-derived MEFs cultured under isoprenoid-replete conditions yielded results remarkably similar to those obtained with whole mouse tissues â marked accumulation of HMGCR protein, overproduction of cholesterol, reduced levels of <italic>Hmgcr</italic> mRNA, and reduced activation of SREBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). HMGCR was also refractory to accelerated ERAD stimulated by the oxysterol 25-HC in <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> MEFs and <italic>Hmgcr<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> MEFs, which were derived from mice expressing ubiquitination-resistant HMGCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hwang et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, 25-HC continued to stimulate ubiquitination of HMGCR in <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> MEFs, but not in those derived from <italic>Hmgcr<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition to providing direct evidence that SCD-associated UBIAD1 inhibits ERAD of HMGCR, these results indicate that the inhibition results from a block in a post-ubiquitination step of the reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our previous characterization of <italic>Hmgcr<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice indicated that dietary cholesterol reduces levels of HMGCR protein primarily by inhibiting activation of SREBP-2 (35); similar results were obtained in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, levels of HMGCR protein persisted in livers of <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice fed cholesterol, even though the feeding regimen continued to block proteolytic activation of SREBP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref>) and reduce levels of mRNAs for HMGCR and other SREBP-2 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Previous studies found that HMGCR is subjected to sterol-independent ubiquitination and ERAD in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doolman et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, we speculate that in livers of <italic>Hmgcr<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice, ubiquitination-resistant HMGCR continues to become degraded through this sterol-independent ERAD pathway. However, both sterol-independent and sterol-dependent pathways for HMGCR ERAD are blocked in <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice, owing to the ability of UBIAD1 (N100S) to inhibit post-ubiquitination steps of the reaction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As a result of this inhibition, levels of HMGCR protein persist in livers of cholesterol-fed <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>Okano and co-workers previously attempted to generate mice lacking <italic>Ubiad1</italic>; however, <italic>Ubiad1</italic>-deficient embryos failed to survive past embryonic day 7.5 (40). <italic>Ubiad1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryonic stem cells failed to synthesize MK-4, suggesting the compound plays a pivotal role in development. Taking this and the observation that human UBIAD1 (N102S) is defective in MK-4 synthetic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hirota et al., 2015</xref>), we were somewhat surprised that <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice were born at normal Mendelian ratios and appear grossly normal. Throughout our studies, we noticed that UBIAD1 (N100S) protein accumulated in all tissues of <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Similar results have been observed for SCD-associated variants of human UBIAD1 in transfected cells; stabilization of SCD-associated UBIAD1 has been attributed to ER sequestration and protection from autophagic degradation from the Golgi (Jun, D.-J. and DeBose-Boyd, R.A., unpublished observations). The level of MK-4 was significantly reduced, but not absent, in various tissues of <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We speculate that despite reduced enzymatic activity, accumulated UBIAD1 (N100S) produces sufficient amounts of MK-4 to support development and survival of <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice. Accumulation of SCD-associated UBIAD1 in the ER has important implications for the pathology of the disease. SCD is an autosomal dominant disorder and our previous studies revealed that SCD-associated variants of UBIAD1 inhibit HMGCR ERAD in a dominant-negative fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schumacher et al., 2016</xref>). Enhanced stability of SCD-associated UBIAD1 owing to its ER sequestration helps to explain how cholesterol accumulation occurs in corneas of SCD patients harboring heterozygous UBIAD1 mutations.</p><p>The significance of the HMGCR regulatory system is evidenced by the widespread use of statins to lower plasma LDL-cholesterol and reduce the incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stossel, 2008</xref>). However, statins block synthesis of sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids that mediate feedback regulation of HMGCR, causing the enzymeâs accumulation in livers of humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kita et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">ReihnÃ©r et al., 1990</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This accumulation partially overcomes inhibitory effects of statins, which allows for continued synthesis of cholesterol that limits cholesterol-lowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schonewille et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldberg et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engelking et al., 2006</xref>). We showed previously that the statin-induced increase in HMGCR was blunted 5-fold in <italic>Hmgcr<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> versus WT mice, suggesting inhibition of ERAD significantly contributes to the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hwang et al., 2016</xref>). Our current findings argue that statin-induced accumulation of HMGCR results in part, from depletion of GGpp from ER membranes. This was indicated by accumulation and ER sequestration of UBIAD1 in livers of lovastatin-treated mice, which coincided with accumulation of HMGCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>). UBIAD1 (N100S), which resists GGpp-induced release from HMGCR, accumulated and remained sequestered in the ER, regardless of whether <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice were treated in the absence or presence of lovastatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>). The resultant inhibition of HMGCR ERAD led to accumulation of the protein and overproduction of sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids in various tissues of <italic>Ubiad1<sup>Ki/Ki</sup></italic> mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, GGpp-regulated, ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1 regulates HMGCR ERAD to coordinate synthesis of sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids in mice through similar mechanisms previously described in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>). The current results indicate that modulating ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1 may have therapeutic value. For example, agents that mimic GGpp in stimulating ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1 should relieve inhibition of ERAD and prevent accumulation of HMGCR that limits the effectiveness of statins in lowering plasma levels of LDL-cholesterol. Agents that restore Golgi localization of SCD-associated UBIAD1 or block its interaction with HMGCR may prevent or retard cholesterol accumulation and corneal opacification associated with SCD. The establishment of a mouse model for SCD described here will prove instrumental in the identification and characterization of such molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

In a tissue culture hood under aseptic conditions, the uterine horns were placed into a Petri dish and each embryo was separated from its placenta and embryonic sac. The head of embryo was removed and saved for genotyping. The remainder of the embryo was washed with PBS and minced. The minced tissues were incubated in the presence of 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA and DNase I for 30 min at 37Â°C with intermittent agitation. The reaction was stopped by adding MEF media containing DMEM 4.5 g/L glucose, 10% FCS, and 1% Penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 U/ml). Cells were pelleted at 300 X <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and plated onto 0.2% gelatin coated dishes; these cells were designated passage 0 and frozen.

The homogenates were then passed through a 22-gauge needle 10â15 times and subjected to centrifugation at 1000 X g for 5 min at 4Â°C. The 1000 X g pellet was resuspended in 500 Âµl of buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 2.5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA) supplemented with the protease inhibitor cocktail, rotated for 30 min at 4Â°C, and centrifuged at 100,000 X g for 30 min at 4Â°C. The supernatant from this spin was precipitated with 1.5 ml cold acetone at â20Â°C for at least 30 min; the precipitated material was collected by centrifugation, resuspended in SDS-lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% (w/v) SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM EGTA), and designated the nuclear extract fraction. The post-nuclear supernatant from the original spin was used to prepare the membrane fraction by centrifugation at 100,000 X g for 30 min at 4Â°C. Each membrane fraction was resuspended in 100 Âµl SDS-lysis buffer.</p><p>Protein concentration of nuclear extract and membrane fractions were measured using the BCA Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific).

Approximately 100 mg of tissue was homogenized using a BeadRuptor (Omni International, Kennesaw, GA). Samples were placed in a mixture of 1 mL 1:1 MeOH:IPA containing 2 ng each of d5-GGOH and d8-MK-4 using 2 mL beadruptor tubes. The slurry was transferred to glass 16 Ã 100 mm glass tubes with PTFE-lined screw-caps. The resulting tissue slurry was sonicated for 5 min. A 5 mL aliquot of acetone was added, and samples were vortexed for three minutes followed by incubation at room temperature for 5 min. The vortex and incubation steps were repeated twice for a total of three cycles. Samples were then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min at 4Â°C. Supernatant was removed to a new 16 Ã 100 mm tube. The pellet was washed with 1 mL of acetone, centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min at 4Â°C, and the resultant supernatant was pooled with the first extract. The sample was dried under nitrogen at a temperature of approximately 35Â°C. The dried extract was dissolved in 5 mL hexane, after which 2 mL of water was added and the sample was placed in a freezer at â20Â°C until the lower layer was frozen. The hexane layer was removed from the frozen aqueous phase using a Pasteur pipette. When the aqueous phase thawed, 2 mL hexane was added, and the process was repeated with the two hexane extracts being pooled. The sample was dried under nitrogen atÂ ~35Â°C. The dried extract was dissolved in 400 ÂµL hexane, transferred to a 2 mL autosampler vial with low-volume insert and dried again.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Randy Y Hampton (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The referees all agreed that the quality of the data is high and that the generation and initial characterization of a mouse model for SCD warrants publication as a Research Advance linked to your prior paper. They further judged that the study provides important in vivo support for prior mechanistic models on the link between UBIAD1, HMG CoA reductase, and cholesterol homeostasis established from cell culture. One referee raised a number of potential additional mechanistic links that might be important to explore. During our discussion, we decided that these extensions of the project are beyond the scope of the current paper. Although we have appended the full referee comments for your interest, we expect you to address only the minor suggestions for improvement provided below. anticipate that addressing these comments will probably only need clarifications to the text, perhaps some re-organisation of figure panels, and possibly answering queries on unclear points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This Research Advance contribution from the Debose-Boyd lab follows up an earlier study from this group analysing the function of UBIAD1 as it relates to HMGCR regulation. The earlier study reported that UBIAD1 stimulates HMGCR degradation in a ppGG-dependent manner, and that dominant human SCD disease mutants in UBIAD1 interfere with full HMGCR degradation under cholesterol-replete conditions. The hypothesis from the earlier work was that the disease mutants may work by causing elevated HMGCR, resulting in elevated cholesterol which eventually accumulates in the eye to cause corneal opacities. The current study examines this idea in mice by generating a knock-in of one such SCD disease mutant (N100S). Analysis of the mouse reveals clear evidence of dysregulated HMGCR including its elevated steady state levels, various compensatory sequelae, and elevated levels of sterol-related molecules. Importantly, the mouse appears to also show age-dependent opacities in the eye. Analysis of MEFs from the mutant mice verified altered cholesterol-mediated HMGCR degradation. Considered together with their earlier work, the study makes a strong case that the cholesterol-containing deposits observed in SCD result from altered HMGCR regulation caused by its excessively strong interaction with mutant UBIAD1. It is important because it provides a nice mouse model for SCD, and more speculatively, provides additional in vivo insights into the intricacies of cholesterol homeostasis. The paper is generally well organized and written.</p><p>1) As I am sure the authors are aware, another group recently published a preliminary analysis of a N100S UBIAD1 knock-in mouse (PMID 29977031). This earlier study lacks the molecular analysis of HMGCR, age-dependent phenotypes, and mechanistic interpretations of the current work. Nevertheless, it is important that the authors provide a careful discussion of these earlier findings and how they relate to the current study.</p><p>2) In Figure 1B, it would be useful to show some indicator of equal loading (perhaps the stained blot showing total protein or a blot for an unrelated protein). In the graph, it would be useful to have error bars on the protein levels if available. I realise the next figure provides a more thorough analysis with suitable controls, but a reader is immediately faced with a rather sparse and somewhat incomplete observation right at the outset. Perhaps one option is to simply omit Figure 1 and start with Figure 2 since this is better characterized anyway.</p><p>3) Figure 1B would be easier to follow in the text and legend if the three sub-panels were labelled as panels B, C, and D. This would make it easier to call out the individual experiments. The same applies to other figure panels where more than one type of experiment is shown together (e.g., the top and bottom parts of Figure 2A. In general, it is easier for the reader if each panel displays a single experiment.</p><p>4) The increase in UBIAD1 in Ki livers (and other tissues) is based on increased levels in the membrane fraction. Is it possible that the total levels are the same, and the difference is due to efficiency of recovery of certain subcellular membranes? Figure 6 shows that mutant UBIAD1 is preferentially in the ER whereas wild type UBIAD1 is preferentially in the Golgi. So if the ER is more effectively recovered than Golgi in the membrane fraction, then one might get the impression that total UBIAD1 is increased. Can a blot also be done on total lysate to clarify this issue? Total lysate is shown in Figure 6C, but it is unclear if the two blots are directly comparable to infer anything about total UBIAD1 levels.</p><p>5) I think it is more useful for a reader to directly state the absolute level of increase in HMGCR rather than the value after normalization to mRNA levels. The absolute level of protein is what is important for its enzymatic activity, which is the key parameter for the disease (i.e., the amount of cholesterol that accumulates) that forms the focus of this paper. The normalized values inform more about the relative rates of synthesis/degradation, which is also interesting but less central to the phenotype. Thus, one could simply report total values in the figures and Results section, then in the discussion state how the levels are increased despite much lower mRNA levels, suggesting that either synthesis rate is higher and/or degradation rate is lower.</p><p>6) Results section â It states that the Lovastatin effect on HMGCR is blunted in Ki mice liver relative to wild type, but the result in Figure 6A shows that accumulation of HMGCR is enhanced in Ki mice liver. Perhaps the sentence is worded incorrectly?</p><p>7) Results section â It says Lovastatin led to a slight elevation of HMGCR in Ki mice; However, it was not easy for me to judge from the blot if the increase was any more or less than in wild type mice. Perhaps it is useful to quantify the result and be more precise in the wording with something like &quot;led to XX-fold elevation above the already high levels of HMGCR in Ki miceâ¦&quot; to emphasize that the levels at baseline are already very high.</p><p>8) It is worth stating how frequently (if at all) corneal inclusions are observed in wild type and heterozygous mice of similar age. This is important to make sure that the inclusions are not simply a consequence of old age.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript follows up on earlier work from the deBose-Boyd laboratory on the regulation of HMG-CoA-reductase (HMGCR) by UBIAD1, a protein mutated in Schnyder Corneal Dystrophy (SCD) patients. Here a SCD-associated UBIAD1 mutation (N100S) knock-in mouse (Ubiad1ki/ki) is described. It is convincingly shown that Ubiad1ki/ki mouse recapitulates several aspects of SCD pathology, including corneal opacification in aged mice. Analysis of tissues and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) derived from the knock-in mouse largely confirm UBIAD1 effects on HMGCR levels described earlier in cell lines and further characterize its consequences on SREBP transcription program. The Ubiad1ki/ki mouse model appears a useful tool and may prime further research into SCD disease mechanism and treatment. However, I am not convinced that at this stage this work provides a significant advance on the HMGCR regulation by UBIAD1 or on SCD pathophysiology. This study touches on several questions but leaves them mostly unanswered. For example:</p><p>1) In Ubiad1ki/ki mice, both HMGCR and UBIAD1 protein levels are increased, however no mechanistic insight is provided to explain these observations, particularly the increase in UBIAD1 protein levels by the N100S mutation.</p><p>2) Previous work indicate that UBIAD1 inhibits HMGCR degradation by acting in a post ubiquitination state. This study does not clarify the mechanism by which UBIAD1 prevents HMGCR degradation and how this is impacted by the N100S mutation. Does this mutant bind tighter to HMGCR or the effects are simply a result of its higher protein levels? It is assumed that its lower capacity to bind to GGPP is responsible for tighter binding to HMGCR but this is not tested.</p><p>3) In Ubiad1ki/ki mice, HMGCR levels are disturbed in all tissues analyzed. However, it is unclear why the disease manifest specifically in the eye. Is HMGCR more susceptible to UBIAD1 mediated control in the eye while other mechanisms dominate in the remaining organs? Or does the overall impact of UBIAD1 in cholesterol homeostasis insufficient to lead to other complications such as atherosclerosis?</p><p>4) Why have the authors chosen to backcross their C57BL/6 x 129 Ubiad1ki/ki mice to C57BL/6 pure genetic backgrounds? This may be not be trivial for non-experts.</p><p>5) The quality of the SREBP-2 blots are poor throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Figure 2A: Poor quality SREBP-2 blots.</p><p>Figure 5A; Lane 5 and 6 seem to be reversed regarding the SREBP-2 protein levels both in membrane fraction and nuclear extract. While the authors provided some explanation for this in the main text, it would be more convincing if the authors could comment on this more clearly or repeat the western blot.</p><p>Figure 5C; Poor quality of SREBP-2 blot and the SREBP-2 blotting for membrane fraction is missing.</p><p>6) Overexposed HMGCR blots</p><p>Figure 4C; While it is expected that HMGCR protein level are lower in WT and specifically increased in Ubiad1ki/ki mouse tissues (and MEF), due to overexpression, it is difficult to assess if this is the case in the HMGCR blot in Figure 4C.</p><p>Figure 6A; The authors claim that lovastatin caused HMGCR accumulation in Ubiad1ki/ki mouse liver. However, this is difficult to assess when the HMGCR blot is overexposed and no quantification of protein levels is provided.</p><p>7) In Figure 7D, the author showed there is no significant increase of total cholesterol in the range of 300-400ng sterol/ug DNA and similar total cholesterol measurement in Figure 7E (for measurement of intermediates of cholesterol synthesis) presented in the range of 100-200ng sterol/ug DNA.</p><p>8) Textual changes</p><p>Last paragraph, last line should refer to Figure 7E, not 7D.</p><p>The legend of Figure 4C and 4D is confusing. Figure references do not seem to be correct. Also, the use of MG132 is mentioned, but nowhere in the figures it is annotated. Please amend.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript &quot;Schnyder corneal dystrophy-associated UBIAD1 Inhibits ER-associated degradation of HMG CoA reductase in mice&quot; is a beautiful addition to the regulated ERAD and sterol physiology literature, with the thoroughness and quality that I have come to expect from Dr. Debose-Boyd and his intrepid group. It is very pleasing to see such a thoughtful and well-rendered test of a disease model; this work most certainly should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The only thing I am not totally clear on is the experiment in Figure 5C. In that experiment, the highly stabilized KâR form of HMGCR (shoot, my whole career I have called it HMGRâ¦) is used as an excellent pre-stabilized control. But if UBIAD only works by allowing enhanced degradation of HMGCR, why are the effects of UBIAD mutant on wild-type HMGCR, which presumably still undergo some degradation, more pronounced than the degradation behavior of the cis highly stabilized mutant?</p><p>If this were one of those more evil journals that care not about a PIs resources, or the time of their hard working underlings, I would suggest an experiment with the double mutant, to see if there are regulatory effects that transcend control of degradation. Fortunately, the <italic>eLife</italic> ethos (which I enthusiastically endorse after spending 50,000 dollars for an extraneous, confirmatory biochemical test of an air-tight genetic study (true story)) encourages reviewers to find merit in the extant work and resist requesting more experiments. So, maybe an explanation or even a mention of this feature of the Figure 5C results would be useful.</p><p>Another question that might be interesting to explore in this brief study is the connection (or lack thereto) between this opaquitopathy (I just made that up; not bad!)-meaning opacity-causing disease- and the recent work on cataracts that appear to be relieved by lanosterol, since HMGCR would be expected to promote synthesis of more of this alleviating agent in the disease modeled herein. Different mechanism? Different pathology? No relation? Just an interesting thing to reference in the discussion maybe. Or maybe not.</p><p>Otherwise, full speed ahead. Fantastic work!</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44396.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] The paper is generally well organized and written.</p><p>1) As I am sure the authors are aware, another group recently published a preliminary analysis of a N100S UBIAD1 knock-in mouse (PMID 29977031).

We now report the absolute level of HMGCR protein under the immunoblot as suggested by this reviewer (point 5).

It should be noted; however, that the immunoblots show a decrease in nuclear SREBP-2 in UBIAD1 (N100S) knockin mice fed chow or cholesterol-containing diets, which correlates with reduction in mRNAs encoding its target genes. In Figure 5C, we only immunoblotted for nuclear SREBP-2 as a control for cholesterol feeding.
