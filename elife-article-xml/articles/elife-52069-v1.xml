holds great promise for cell replacement therapy to treat spinal cord injury (SCI). Direct conversion allows generation of target cells from somatic cells, however, current protocols are not practicable for therapeutic purposes since converted cells are post-mitotic that are not scalable. Therefore, therapeutic effects of directly converted neurons have not been elucidated yet. Here, we show that human fibroblasts can be converted into induced motor neurons (iMNs) by sequentially inducing <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> and <italic>LHX3</italic>. Our strategy enables scalable production of pure iMNs because of the transient acquisition of proliferative iMN-intermediate cell stage which is distinct from neural progenitors. iMNs exhibited hallmarks of spinal motor neurons including transcriptional profiles, electrophysiological property, synaptic activity, and neuromuscular junction formation. Remarkably, transplantation of iMNs showed therapeutic effects, promoting locomotor functional recovery in rodent SCI model. Together, our advanced strategy will provide tools to acquire sufficient human iMNs that may represent a promising cell source for personalized cell therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>direct conversion</kwd><kwd>induced motor neurons</kwd><kwd>spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>cell replacement therapy</kwd><kwd>self-renewal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Korea Ministry of SMEs and Startups</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S2566811</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jeong Beom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017R1C1B3005476</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jae-Ick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AC17/00012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerovska</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name><name><surname>Araúzo-Bravo</surname><given-names>Marcos J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union Eracosysmed/H2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>643271</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerovska</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name><name><surname>Araúzo-Bravo</surname><given-names>Marcos J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain MINECO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2016-77987-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerovska</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name><name><surname>Araúzo-Bravo</surname><given-names>Marcos J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sequential introduction of transcription factors enables large-scale generation of induced motor neurons (iMNs) from human somatic cells, and transplantation of iMNs exhibit therapeutic effects in spinal cord injury model.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes devastating neurological impairments and disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). SCI leads to the loss of sensory/motor functions and malfunctions in other organs such as bladder, kidneys and bowel, provoking an enormous impact on physical, psychological and social behavior of SCI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradbury and McMahon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vismara et al., 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, there is no fully restorative treatment for SCI yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silva et al., 2014</xref>). Medications or surgical decompression are the only options for SCI treatment, however, these approaches are controversial due to the severe side effects and limited clinical efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cristante et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vismara et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Thus, cell replacement therapy has been proposed as a promising therapeutic intervention to reconstitute the damaged nervous system and improve functional recovery after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldman, 2005</xref>). A number of studies have shown that transplantation of neural cells derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is effective in functional and histological restoration in SCI animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakamura and Okano, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsuji et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vismara et al., 2017</xref>). Despite these encouraging advances, ethical issue of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and tumorigenic potential of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have impeded their translations into clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ronaghi et al., 2010</xref>). To overcome these limitations, direct conversion of somatic cells into other cell types has been achieved while bypassing pluripotent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). However, application of previous protocols hindered therapeutic translations due to the heterogeneity and low yields, and involvement of multiple transcription factors which may increase the genetic mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kang et al., 2015</xref>). Most importantly, directly converted cells are fully differentiated post-mitotic cells which limit the acquisition of cell source in large-scale for therapeutic purpose. Hence, there is a critical need to develop a new method that enables the large-scale production of highly pure and functional target cells with consistent quality. In terms of treating SCI, it must be capable of generating motor neuron (MN) subtypes that are relevant to disease rather than producing general neurons.</p><p>In this study, we succeeded in generating induced motor neurons (iMNs) by using a minimal number of transcription factors, <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> and <italic>LHX3. POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> is known to play an important role in regulating pluripotent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi and Jin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), and downstream target genes involved in developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi and Jin, 2010</xref>). Previously, overexpression of <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> allowed the generation of blood progenitor cells from fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Szabo et al., 2010</xref>) by regulating hematopoietic gene, <italic>HOXB4</italic>, which is one of the <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyer et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, a number of studies showed that <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> can induce various cell fate reprogramming such as neural stem cells into iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2009b</xref>), and fibroblasts into neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchell et al., 2014b</xref>) as well as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), defining <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> as a versatile reprogramming factor that confers the plasticity in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitchell et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchell et al., 2014b</xref>). Also, it has been reported that <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> binds to homeodomain transcription factor <italic>ISL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jung et al., 2010</xref>) which is required for specification of spinal cord MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liang et al., 2011</xref>). So, we hypothesized that activation of <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> might have potential to generate MNs from somatic cells through regulating <italic>ISL1</italic> expression. Here, we introduced the key cell fate regulator <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> and subsequently overexpressed additional MN specification factor <italic>LHX3</italic> to induce fibroblasts toward motor neuronal fate. Importantly, we found that iMNs exhibited typical characteristics of MNs on molecular level, electrophysiological activity, synaptic functionality, in vivo engraftment capacity and therapeutic effects. In conclusion, our strategy enables large-scale production of pure iMNs and facilitates the feasibility of iMNs for SCI treatment. Access to high-yield cultures of human MNs will facilitate an in-depth study of MN subtype-specific properties, disease modeling, and development of cell-based drug screening assays for MN disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of induced motor neurons (iMNs) from human fibroblasts by sequential induction of two transcription factors</title><p>To generate induced motor neurons (iMNs) from human adult fibroblasts (HF1), we established an advanced direct conversion strategy by inducing <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> and <italic>LHX3</italic> sequentially at different time points as described in the experimental scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To rule out the possibility that resulting iMNs are derived from contaminating neural cells in parental fibroblasts, we confirmed that none of the fibroblasts express neural lineage markers by immunostaining with specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Firstly, we transduced fibroblasts with <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> regarding its critical role in cell fate decision during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamada et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic>-induced plasticity has been shown to activate the lineage genes in response to lineage supporting culture condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitchell et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchell et al., 2014b</xref>). We cultured <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic>-infected cells in our defined neural induction medium. The morphological changes were observed as early as day 3, and spindle-shaped cells then formed compact colonies by day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), whereas mock-infected fibroblasts did not change under the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). From 0.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> seeded fibroblasts, we could observe 7 ~ 12 colonies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We picked colonies individually and plated them in separate wells for clonal culture. The neural progenitor-like cells grew out gradually from attached colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We found that the number of cells increased over time in neural induction medium. These cells were passaged and maintained as a monolayer cell line which we named iMN-intermediate cells (iMNICs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We could establish six iMNIC clones from HF1; HF1-iMNIC2, HF1-iMNIC5, HF1-iMNIC6, HF1-iMNIC7, HF1-iMNIC11 and HF1-iMNIC12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In order to determine whether the fibroblasts acquired motor neuronal identity after <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic>-mediated neural induction, we analyzed the relative mRNA level of MN specification genes <italic>ISL1</italic>, <italic>HB9</italic>, <italic>NKX6.1</italic> and <italic>LHX3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis-Dusenbery et al., 2014</xref>) in <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic>-infected cells at day 7, day 14 and three iMNIC clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Consistently, immunocytochemistry also showed that iMNICs robustly express ISL1, whereas other MN markers (HB9, NKX6.1 and LHX3) or neuronal markers (TUJ1 and MAP2) were not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). For further MN induction and characterization of general features of MNs, we selected HF1-iMNIC2 which expressed <italic>ISL1</italic> gene most highly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of induced motor neurons (iMNs) from human fibroblasts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The experimental scheme for the generation of iMNs by sequential transduction of two transcription factors.

Also, we employed sphere culture to optimize the culture condition for MN induction. When we plated iMNICs on non-coated dishes for sphere culture, the cells formed clusters and became free-floating iMN spheres in MN induction medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The iMN spheres were subsequently transferred onto PDL/Laminin-coated dishes for neuronal maturation, then MN-like cells outgrew from the spheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We could observe robust axon projections and dendritic arborizations, suggesting the neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G’</xref>). Remarkably, the converted neurons exclusively expressed TUJ1 and HB9 only after <italic>LHX3</italic> induction, but no HB9+ cells were observed in other transcription factor infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). More than 96% of iMNs co-expressed TUJ1 and HB9 in sphere culture, while the efficiency was considerably lower in adherent culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>).

Considering previous report, we evaluated cellular identity of iMNICs whether the cells are similar to neural progenitors. Immunocytochemistry analysis showed that none of iMNICs expressed early neuroectoderm markers (SOX1 and PAX6), neural progenitor markers (SOX2 and NCAM) or MN progenitor marker (OLIG2), and these markers were never detected during the entire neural induction process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). To determine whether this cell conversion occurred through pluripotent state or neural progenitor state, we evaluated the activation of endogenous expression of pluripotent genes (<italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> and <italic>NANOG)</italic> and neural progenitor marker (<italic>SOX2)</italic> after <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). We found that none of these markers were detected in <italic>POU5F1(OCT)</italic>-induced cells, iMNICs and iMNs as confirmed by qRT-PCR. This result implies that fibroblasts transit neither pluripotent state nor neural progenitor state. Although iMNICs were distinct population from neural progenitors, these cells were highly proliferative cells and capable of being maintained for more than 13 passages. We examined the self‐renewal capacity of iMNICs. We evaluated iMNICs at early passage (P2) and late passage (P13). Cellular morphology was very similar at both early and late passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>). The cells sustained the proliferation rate presenting the mean doubling times (mDT) of 28.4 hr at P2 and 29.4 hr at P13, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D</xref>). In addition, we confirmed that &gt;97% of iMNICs expressed proliferative cell marker KI67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5E and F</xref>). To verify the continuous capacity of iMNICs to convert into iMNs over multiple passages, we conducted iMN induction using iMNICs at P2 and P13. iMNICs were successfully converted into mature iMNs at both early and late passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5G</xref>). Furthermore, to determine whether generation of iMNICs by initial induction of <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> prior to <italic>LHX3</italic> induction is necessary, we compared the cellular identity of iMNICs emerged after induction of <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> alone and co-induction of <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> and <italic>LHX3</italic>. When we infected fibroblasts with <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> and <italic>LHX3</italic> simultaneously, the majority of infected cells died and iMNIC colonies were not stably maintained for multiple passages after picking (up to 5 passages) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>).

These data indicate that the sequential induction of two transcription factors is essential for generating self-renewing iMNICs more efficiently.

Previously, we succeeded in generating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) from somatic cells by <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). In line with this, we hypothesized that combination of <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> and defined supplements may convert cell fate toward motor neurons (MNs) which is developmentally derived from the same origin with OPCs, pMN progenitors of the ventral spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ravanelli and Appel, 2015</xref>). <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> could efficiently generate TUJ1-positive neuronal cells under MN induction conditions, however, most of the cells could not reach to HB9 positive mature MNs. Nonetheless, we found that endogenous expression of <italic>ISL1</italic>, an important transcription factor for MN specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liang et al., 2011</xref>), was activated in fibroblasts after <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> induction under our defined culture condition. Based on this observation, we assumed that an additional transcription factor is required for complete iMN conversion. By screening the MN specification factors, we found that inclusion of <italic>LHX3</italic> significantly increased the reprogramming efficiency of HB9 positive iMNs. This result is consistent with the previous report that the <italic>LIM</italic> complex composed of ISL1 and LHX3 specify spinal MNs by inducing MN gene <italic>HB9</italic> in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first time showing that <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> can initiate cellular reprogramming toward MN lineage by activating <italic>ISL1</italic>. This is correlated with previous reports that <italic>LIM</italic> homeodomain transcription factor <italic>ISL1</italic> has been detected as POU5F1(OCT4) targets in human pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jung et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>This result has an important implication on how we minimized the transcription factors for generating iMNs. Previously, iMNs were generated by either eight transcription factors (<italic>ASCL1, BRN2, MYT1L, LHX3, HB9, ISL1, NGN2,</italic> and <italic>NEUROD1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Son et al., 2011</xref>) or four transcription factors (<italic>NGN2, SOX11, ISL1,</italic> and <italic>LHX3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). In ; contrast to previous methods, we identified the minimal two transcription factors, <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> and <italic>LHX3,</italic> for generating iMNs, so that our iMNs would be safer than multiple transcription factors-derived iMNs for therapeutic applications in terms of lower chance of viral integrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2009b</xref>). Moreover, previous studies have not verified the in vivo functionality or therapeutic potential of human iMNs.</p><p>In addition, RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that our iMNs exhibited transcriptional profiles of motor neuronal identity similar with wtMNs. Importantly, iMNICs and iMNs expressed spinal cord specific <italic>HOX5-9</italic> gene clusters, whereas NPC genes were not detected in these cells. The ability to generate autologous iMNs with motor neuronal identity can facilitate disease modeling and cell-based therapy for MN diseases or spinal cord disorders. A critical prerequisite for achieving these goals is obtaining the pure population of subtype-specific neurons in high number. However, previous methods have not been feasible since directly converted neurons are terminally differentiated cells that are not scalable. This limitation could be overcome by generating expandable neural progenitors; however, neural progenitors could produce a mixture of heterogeneous neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lujan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ring et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thier et al., 2012</xref>). Herein, sequential introduction of two transcription factors enabled the large production of pure iMNs. We could obtain self-renewing cell line iMNICs after <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> induction by clonal reprogramming method as we have demonstrated previously in generating OPCs from fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). iMNICs were proliferative, expandable and retained conversion capacity to mature iMNs for long-term culture (&gt;13 passages); however, they were distinct from neural progenitors. Therefore, our method is ‘direct conversion’ rather than indirect conversion or redifferentiation through pluripotent state or neural progenitor state.</p><p>Previously, Mitchell et al. generated iNPC from <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic>-induced fibroblasts by culturing the cells in reprogramming media (RM) for 8 days before inducing in classical NPC media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitchell et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchell et al., 2014b</xref>). They reported that RM step is essential to induce SOX2+ NPCs after <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic> induction. In contrast, SOX2 was not activated in <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic>-infected cells and failed to generate iNPCs when cultured directly in NPC media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitchell et al., 2014a</xref>). Consistent with previous report by Mitchell et al., our iMNICs which were generated without RM step did not express neural progenitor marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitchell et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchell et al., 2014b</xref>). This finding indicates that extracellular environment and timing for appropriate stimuli are critical for cell identification of <italic>POU5F1(OCT4)</italic>-induced cells.</p><p>Several studies have reported that transplantation of MNs or MN precursors differentiated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) showed functional benefits to injured spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rossi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wyatt et al., 2011</xref>). However, translation of these cells to the clinic is limited due to the challenges including differentiation efficiency, scalability, purity, and especially tumorigenecity from undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nori et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, transplantation of MN precursors remain poorly defined because of stem cell heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trawczynski et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we could obtain pure iMNs in large number and found that hindlimb functional recovery depends on maturity and purity of iMNs. When we transplanted selected HB9+ mature iMNs, BBB score was higher compared to transplanting iMN spheres. We also observed that our iMNs exhibited integration properties when transplanted into injured spinal cord. Transplanted HB9+ iMNs still expressed neuronal markers and interacted with host neural cells such as oligodendrocytes in vivo. We could observe ensheathment by myelinating host oligodendrocytes surrounding our iMNs. Notably, transplantation of iMNs contributed histological and functional recovery in SCI model without tumor formation, and this is the first report demonstrating the therapeutic effects of human iMNs in vivo.</p><p>In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study shows that our functional iMNs can be employed to cell-based therapy as an autologous cell source. iMNs possessed spinal cord motor neuronal identity and exhibit hallmarks of spinal MNs such as neuromuscular junction formation capacity and electrophysiological properties in vitro. Importantly, transplantation of iMNs improved locomotor function in rodent SCI model without tumor formation. Although further investigation on mechanism responsible for cell fate conversion may be needed, our strategy is a safer and simpler methodology that may provide new insights to develop personalized stem cell therapy and drug screening for MN diseases or spinal cord disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Whole-cell patch clamp recording was performed by using Multiclamp 700B (Molecular Devices) and recording signals were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz (PCI-6221, National Instruments). Recording data were monitored, acquired by WinWCP (Strathclyde Electrophysiology Software) and further analyzed offline by Clampfit 10.0 (Molecular Devices) and Prism 7.0 (GraphPad). To evaluate passive membrane properties of iMNs, hyperpolarizing step current (50 pA increment, 1000 ms duration) was injected in current clamp mode.

The two-step protocol induces cells to pass through a state were cells keep dividing in principle allowing to generate large quantities of cells for clinical studies.

A key advancements of this work is that cells pass through a proliferative intermediate (iMNICs), that is distinct from iNPCs as it doesn't express standard progenitor markers, where cells can be expanded before proceeding to terminal iMN differentiation. They show functional improvement in vivo using a rat spinal cord injury model. Our consensus opinion is that your work is of interest, well written and goes beyond previously published studies that reported the generation of induced motor neurons through direct cell fate conversions. Authors claim that iMNICs represent a novel state that hasn't been reported before. While we find the subject of the study interesting, relevant and in principle of sufficient merit for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, we jointly opine that authors should demonstrate more clearly the robustness of their reprogramming methods and further characterise the interesting iMNIC state.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are two major concerns that we feel are essential to be addressed in a revised version.</p><p>1) Authors should characterise iMNICs using genome wide expression analysis (i.e. RNA-seq) to compare these cells to NPCs/NSCs, starting fibroblasts and iMN – ideally in reference to in vivo MNs.

To address the request, we now have performed RNA-sequencing to evaluate global gene expression profiles of iMNICs and iMNs with other types of cells including: (1) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) defined from our previous study (Kim et al., 2009); (2) motor neurons (MN) derived from pluripotent stem cells (Amoroso et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2015); (3) fetal spinal cord tissue (Kumamaru et al., 2018); (4) fibroblasts as the control of parental cells before induction. Since we do not have access to obtain human spinal cord tissue or wild-type motor neurons, we downloaded RNA-seq datasets from GEO accessions GSE41795, GSE69175 (wild-type motor neurons) GSE83107 (fetal spinal cord tissue). iMNICs and iMNs clustered closely with wild-type MNs but separated from parental fibroblasts and NPCs (Figure 5A-D). Notably, gene expression patterns of iMNICs and iMNs are very similar with wild-type MN especially in MN genes and HOX genes which are essential for determination of MN columnar identity within spinal cord (Figure 5E). HOX genes are reported to be expressed at brachial and cervical levels (<italic>HOX4-8</italic>), thoracic level (<italic>HOX8</italic> and <italic>HOX9</italic>) and lumbar region (<italic>HOX10</italic> and <italic>HOX11</italic>) (Philippidou and Dasen, 2013). iMNICs and iMNs expressed cervical-to-lumbar HOX genes, suggesting our cells acquired cervical-to-lumbar spinal cord identity. In contrast, iMNICs and iMNs did not express NPC marker genes (SOX2, PAX6, OLIG2, SOX1, <italic>ASCL1</italic>, <italic>FABP7</italic>, and <italic>EMX2</italic>), and fibroblasts genes (COL1A1, COL5A1, <italic>SNAI1</italic>, and <italic>SNAI2</italic>) were down-regulated in iMNICs and iMNs (Figure 5F). Additionally, we conducted qPCR analysis to re-confirm the expression of HOX genes in iMNICs and iMNs. The mRNA level of HOX genes (<italic>HOXC4</italic>, <italic>HOXC5</italic>, <italic>HOXC6</italic>, <italic>HOXA7</italic>, <italic>HOXC8</italic>, <italic>HOXA9</italic>, and <italic>HOXC9</italic>) gradually increased during neural induction and highly expressed in iMNICs and iMNs compared to parental fibroblasts (Figure 5G). These results confirm that our iMNICs and iMN possess spinal cord identity, but not NPC. The data are now added as a new Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1, and modified our manuscript in light of these results adding new subsection “Spinal cord identity of iMNICs and iMNs” in the Results section. We also contextualized this in result and Discussion section in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Authors should clarify how many fibroblast lines were used in the study to successfully make iMNs.

We now added a new table in Supplementary file 3 showing detailed information of two human fibroblasts lines, HF1 and HF2.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comments and suggestions and thank for prompting us to evaluate the robustness of our method. All presented data regarding generation of iMNICs and iMNs in our original manuscript were based on a single fibroblast line, HF1. To further strengthen the reproducibility and robustness of our protocol, we applied same method to additional fibroblast line, HF2. Generation of iMNs was successfully confirmed in HF2 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We could obtain proliferating iMNIC clones from HF2 as well and we could induce mature iMNs. This data is added in a Figure 4—figure supplement 1. We now recapitulated our experiments in Supplementary file 3, showing the number of established iMNIC clones and conversion efficiency of each fibroblast lines into iMNICs, assessed by counting the number of colonies emerged from seeded cells (Supplementary file 3). We also added a new table showing characteristics of established iMNIC clones (Supplementary file 4). All established iMNIC clones possessed proliferation capacity until more than passage 10 (P10~) and expressed <italic>ISL1</italic> gene. We could obtain HB9+iMNs from all established clones. We have performed gene expression profiling analysis by RNA-seq in two iMNIC clones, HF1-iMNIC6 and HF2-iMNIC6, which are generated from each of two fibroblast lines, HF1 and HF2, respectively (Figure 5). We indicated which clones were used for RNA-SEQ experiment in Supplementary file 4.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>We appreciate that you have addressed the two main concerns identified by the reviewers during the initial evaluation of the study.
