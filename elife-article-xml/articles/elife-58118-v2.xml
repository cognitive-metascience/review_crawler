is associated with increase in ROS and expansion of tRNA-isodecoders. tRNA expansion leads to misselection resulting in a critical error of L-Ala mischarged onto tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>, which is proofread by Animalia-specific-tRNA Deacylase (ATD) in vitro. Here we show that in addition to ATD, threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) can clear the error in cellular scenario. This two-tier functional redundancy for translation quality control breaks down during oxidative stress, wherein ThrRS is rendered inactive. Therefore, ATD knockout cells display pronounced sensitivity through increased mistranslation of threonine codons leading to cell death. Strikingly, we identify the emergence of ATD along with the error inducing tRNA species starting from Choanoflagellates thus uncovering an important genomic innovation required for multicellularity that occurred in unicellular ancestors of animals. The study further provides a plausible regulatory mechanism wherein the cellular fate of tRNAs can be switched from protein biosynthesis to non-canonical functions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The first animals evolved around 750 million years ago from single-celled ancestors that were most similar to modern-day organisms called the Choanoflagellates. As animals evolved they developed more complex body plans consisting of multiple cells organized into larger structures known as tissues and organs. Over time cells also evolved increased levels of molecules called reactive oxygen species, which are involved in many essential cell processes but are toxic at high levels.</p><p>Animal cells also contain more types of molecules known as transfer ribonucleic acids, or tRNAs for short, than Choanoflagellate cells and other single-celled organisms. These molecules deliver building blocks known as amino acids to the machinery that produces new proteins. To ensure the proteins are made correctly, it is important that tRNAs deliver specific amino acids to the protein-building machinery in the right order.</p><p>Each type of tRNA usually only pairs with a specific type of amino acid, but sometimes the enzymes involved in this process can make mistakes. Therefore, cells contain proofreading enzymes that help remove incorrect amino acids on tRNAs. One such enzyme – called ATD – is only found in animals. Experiments in test tubes reported that ATD removes an amino acid called alanine from tRNAs that are supposed to carry threonine, but its precise role in living cells remained unclear.</p><p>To address this question, Kuncha et al. studied proofreading enzymes in human kidney cells. The experiments showed that, in addition to ATD, a second enzyme known as ThrRS was also able to correct alanine substitutions for threonines on tRNAs. However, reactive oxygen species inactivated the proofreading ability of ThrRS, suggesting ATD plays an essential role in correcting errors in cells containing high levels of reactive oxygen species.</p><p>These findings suggest that as organisms evolved multiple cells and the levels of tRNA and oxidative stress increased, this led to the appearance of a new proofreading enzyme. Further studies found that ATD originated around 900 million years ago, before Choanoflagellates and animals diverged, indicating these enzymes might have helped to shape the evolution of animals.</p><p>The next step following on from this work will be to understand the role of ATD in the cells of organs that are known to have particularly high levels of reactive oxygen species, such as testis and ovaries.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tRNA Isodecoder</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>proofreading</kwd><kwd>multicellularity</kwd><kwd>Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DST-INSPIRE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuncha</surname><given-names>Santosh Kumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>J.

Such an expansion of tRNA genes led to the appearance of tRNA isodecoders that is tRNAs <sup><italic>with</italic></sup> identical anticodon but with sequence variation(s) elsewhere. This sequence diversification has aided the functional expansion of the tRNA molecules from mere adapters in protein translation to versatile molecules involved in many non-canonical functions. Recent studies have shown the indispensable physiological roles of tRNA and tRNA-derived fragments in diverse functions, such as intergenerational inheritance, RNAi, gene regulation, apoptosis inhibition, ribosome biogenesis, stress granules and also in pathologies such as carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gebetsberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goodarzi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ivanov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saikia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schorn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). The tRNA is abundantly saturated with identity elements which are essential for processing, structure, and also performing the canonical functions in translation. However, the emergence of tRNA isodecoders has led to the degeneracy of idiosyncratic features of a few tRNAs, which are essential for the canonical translation function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saint-Léger et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the advent of multicellularity has led to the production and use of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as signaling molecules, unlike bacteria and yeast that only respond to oxidative stress. It has been suggested that ROS adds the required diversity to the gamut of signaling events involved in cell differentiation and proliferation essential for multicellular systems such HIF pathway and signaling cascade by NRF-2, NFКB, Oct4, p53, etc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bigarella et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloomfield and Pears, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Covarrubias et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lalucque and Silar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peuget et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shadel and Horvath, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sies, 2017</xref>).</p><p>tRNA synthetases are essential enzymes responsible for maintaining fidelity during protein biosynthesis by selecting both the correct amino acid and tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ibba and Soll, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ramakrishnan, 2002</xref>). Alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) is unique among this class of enzymes in using the universally conserved G3•U70 wobble base pair in the acceptor stem as an identity element for recognition and charging of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hou and Schimmel, 1988</xref>). Due to the phenomenon of a subtle recognition slippage, the archaeal and eukaryotic AlaRSs have a relaxed specificity for tRNA and can charge alanine on G4•U69 containing (non-cognate) tRNAs also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, we have shown that G4•U69 is predominant in kingdom Animalia, and specifically in tRNAs coding for Thr (18% in humans and sometimes as high as 43%, in <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>), thereby generating L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>(G4•U69) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuncha et al., 2018a</xref>). Such a tRNA misselection error can result in Thr-to-Ala mistranslation. However, the absence of Thr-to-Ala mutations at the proteome level indicated the presence of a dedicated proofreading factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). We further showed that L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>(G4•U69) is robustly edited by Animalia-specific tRNA deacylase (ATD) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuncha et al., 2018a</xref>).</p><p>ATD is a paralog of a ‘Chiral Proofreading’ enzyme D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD), which is one of the key chiral checkpoints during protein synthesis and present across Bacteria and Eukarya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuncha et al., 2019</xref>). Earlier studies using ligand-bound crystal structures, in combination with biochemical assays, have shown that DTD operates <italic>via</italic> L-chiral rejection mechanism and as a result also avoids mistranslation of L-Ala to achiral glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuncha et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pawar et al., 2017</xref>). The L-chiral rejection by DTD is attributed to an active site invariant cross-subunit <italic>Gly-cisPro</italic> motif that acts as a chiral-selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Routh et al., 2016</xref>). The Gly-Pro (GP) motif conformation has switched from <italic>Gly-cisPro</italic> in DTD to <italic>Gly-transPro</italic> in ATD. In Animalia, the appearance of tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>(G4•U69) is invariably correlated with the presence of ATD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuncha et al., 2018a</xref>). Thus, ATD is the first and the only known proofreader of tRNA misselection errors. However, the physiological significance and its role in translation quality control are not known. Given the emerging evidence of stress-induced regulation of mistranslation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Netzer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Steiner et al., 2019</xref>), the role of ATD in higher organisms is of immense interest. Here, we show that not only ATD but threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) is also involved in correcting the tRNA-induced misselection error by AlaRS. As oxidative stress inhibits the proofreading activity of ThrRS, the protective activity of ATD is indispensable for avoiding mistranslation of Thr codons that is deleterious. Strikingly, the origin of ATD and the G4•U69 containing tRNAs are rooted in Choanoflagellates suggesting its importance for the origin of metazoans at the convergence of multicellularity-induced oxidative stress and tRNA isodecoder expansion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Absence of mistranslation in ATD knockout cells and its ubiquitous expression</title><p>Based on the earlier biochemical observations, ATD is expected to avoid Thr-to-Ala mistranslation, which would affect protein homeostasis and also cell survival. Hence to understand the physiological role and relevance of ATD, we generated a CRISPR-Cas9-based ATD knockout of HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Surprisingly, the ATD null cells did not show any noticeable phenotypic effect which was puzzling, given that ATD is the only known editor of L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>(G4•U69). To further analyze the cells at the molecular levels, Hsp70 was chosen as the marker for proteome stress. Hsp70 is a chaperone which is upregulated in response to protein misfolding and hence used as a marker to study proteostasis stress, and is also implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hartl, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mosser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rampelt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sala et al., 2017</xref>). The ATD null cells also showed no significant difference in molecular proteome stress marker Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Lack of proteome errors is further confirmed by the identification of reporter protein peptides (explained later) using mass spectrometry experiments wherein no missubstitutions of alanine for threonine were observed. The above unexplainable results prompted us to check whether ATD is indeed expressed in vivo. The expression of ATD was initially checked in different cell lines (CHO, Neuro2A, SKOV3, HEK293T, HeLa, NIH/3T3, and mouse embryonic stem cells E14Tg2a), followed by different tissue samples of the mouse. We could see that ATD is ubiquitously expressed in all the cell lines and tissues of mouse tested thus underscoring its physiological importance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Despite the ubiquitous presence of ATD, the absence of any noticeable phenotypic and molecular changes in the ATD knockout cell lines prompted us to search for the presence of any other proofreading factor responsible for clearing L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> in addition to ATD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Unperturbed proteome homeostasis in <italic>Atd</italic> gene knockout cells and ubiquitous expression of ATD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot showing expression of ATD in wild type and ATD knockout cells of HEK293T.

ProX is specific to tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> and its homolog (Ybak) is known to achieve substrate specificity by forming a binary complex with ProRS, which imparts tRNA specificity for editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An and Musier-Forsyth, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">An and Musier-Forsyth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the only known and possible player with a high affinity for tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> is ThrRS. ThrRS has an N-terminal editing domain, which is known to deacylate L-Ser erroneously charged on tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dock-Bregeon et al., 2004</xref>).

These results identified a two-tier functional redundancy in the cell for clearing L-Ala mistakenly attached to tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> suggesting that ThrRS can correct the tRNA misselection error and hence compensate for the absence of ATD in the knockout cells that do not show any mistranslation of Thr-codons.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cross-synthetase error correction by ThrRS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Deacylation of L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>(G4•U69) by MmThrRS and MmATD, the graph clearly shows that both the enzymes are active on the substrate. (<bold>B</bold>) Deacylation of L-Thr-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> by MmThrRS, and as expected MmThrRS has no activity on the cognate substrate.

In line with the MmThrRS activity, DrThrRS and HsThrRS also deacylated L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> robustly, indicating that the activity is conserved across higher eukaryotes. Therefore, in Animalia there exists a functional redundancy in clearing L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> in the form of ATD and ThrRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). It was tempting to check whether the L-Ala activity of ThrRS is conserved across different domains of life or has it been acquired over the course of evolution only in Animalia? It is worth noting here that it is only in Animalia that the error inducing tRNA species is present and hence the problem of L-Ala mischarging on tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>. To test this, we checked the deacylation activity of ThrRS from Bacteria. We were surprised to see that bacterial ThrRS from <italic>E. coli</italic> (EcThrRS) was active on L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>, even though neither Bacteria (bacterial AlaRS is discriminatory and charges only tRNAs containing G3•U70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sun et al., 2016</xref>]) nor lower eukaryotes (which lack tRNAs containing G4•U69) possess the problem of tRNA misselection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Therefore, it is perplexing as to why the L-Ala editing activity of ThrRS is universally conserved. In any case, these biochemical results clearly suggest that the editing site of ThrRS can accommodate and deacylate L-Ala mischarged on tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>, despite lacking the critical interactions emanating from the side chain hydroxyl group of serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Thus, in Animalia, ThrRS maintains the fidelity of decoding Thr codons by performing the dual function of clearing both amino acid (L-Ser-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>) and tRNA misselection (L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>) errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ThrRS is sensitive to oxidative stress.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Deacylation of L-Ala/Ser/Thr-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> by ThrRS from different organisms in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

It raises an important question as to whether this functional redundancy is important for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis during any kind of physiological or stress conditions. Recent thiome studies using HeLa cell lysates show that ThrRS is oxidized at physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leonard et al., 2009</xref>) and the site of oxidation was found to be an active site invariant cysteine (C182) of ThrRS editing domain, which plays a crucial role in catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Oxidation of C182 abolishes the L-Ser-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> editing activity of <italic>E. coli</italic> ThrRS has been noted earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ling and Söll, 2010</xref>). We could establish that oxidizing conditions (using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) do not affect the aminoacylation activity but results in a complete loss of L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> and L-Ser-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> editing activity of MmThrRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, the synthetase activity of MmThrRS is not affected even in the presence of 10-fold excess (50 mM) of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. To establish the universality of oxidation-induced inactivation of ThrRS editing activity, we tested EcThrRS, DrThrRS, MmThrRS, and HsThrRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Irrespective of the organism (from bacteria to mammals), in the presence of oxidizing conditions the editing domain of ThrRS is inactive on L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>, however, this did not affect the aminoacylation activity of the enzyme. These deacylation experiments clearly show that the editing site cysteine is prone to oxidation and this feature is conserved across Bacteria and Eukarya.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ATD is inert towards oxidative stress</title><p>Since ThrRS is inactive in the presence of ROS, the obvious question is whether ATD is active in the presence of oxidizing conditions?

The inertness of ATD towards oxidative stress was further validated by performing L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> deacylation assays using ATDs from different organisms such as <italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic> (HvATD) from the invertebrate Animalia, <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (DrATD) from class Pisces, <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> (GgATD) which belongs to Aves and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (HsATD) which is a mammal.

We could further show that this is a direct effect of ATD by rescuing the cells from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced toxicity by expressing FLAG-tagged ATD from a plasmid copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). To further confirm that the rescue is due to the enzymatic activity of ATD, we used an enzymatically inactive G115F mutant of ATD. This mutant was generated based on our earlier studies on DTD’s ligand-bound structures wherein an analogous mutation A112F (PfDTD, PDB id: 4NBI) sterically excludes the binding of adenine (A76) of the incoming substrate (aa-tRNA) and hence renders it inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 2013</xref>).

To pinpoint the exact cause of proteome stress, we overexpressed a reporter protein (GFP using pEGFP vector) with and without oxidative stress, followed by GFP pull-down and subjected to peptide identification using mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The MS/MS data was examined for amino acid substitutions using a GFP-mutant database. We could read increased mistranslation of Thr-to-Ser in a few peptides of samples purified from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This quickly rules out the possibility of ATD proofreading L-Ser-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>, which is in accordance with the low activity of ATD and its likely inability to resample from elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). However, no toxicity is observed in these cells since the mutation of Thr-to-Ser is a milder substitution and therefore tolerable. In the case of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated ATD knockout cells, the level of Thr-to-Ser mistranslation is similar to that of wild type and further validates our biochemical data that ATD cannot proofread L-Ser-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> in vivo. Unlike Thr-to-Ser substitutions, the levels of Thr-to-Ala mistranslation was significantly higher in cells devoid of ATD and treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>). As expected, except for Ser and Ala, Thr codons were not mistranslated to other amino acids such as smaller Gly, and bigger Leu, Tyr, and Phe. Since Thr-to-Ala is a drastic change of size, shape, and polarity, it destabilizes the structural integrity of the proteome producing the observed toxicity to the cell. These findings unambiguously provide direct evidence that ATD and ThrRS can proofread L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr </sup>in vivo and the former plays a critical role during oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Choanoflagellates represent the pre-metazoan ancestry of ATD</title><p>ATD is present in kingdom Animalia and so is tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> possessing G4•U69. Since ATD is a paralog and evolved from a pre-existing DTD, we were curious to find out the first event of emergence or an intermediate of this transition. By extensive bioinformatics search, we have identified that ATD is present in <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta -</italic>a Choanoflagellate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), but not in other unicellular eukaryotes (like yeast, Plasmodium, Ichthyosporeans, and Filastereans). Choanoflagellates are the colonial unicellular cousins of multicellular animals, and recent studies have shown that these organisms possess genes that are unique to kingdom Animalia and essential for multicellularity i.e., cell cycle regulation (p53), adhesion molecules (cadherin’s), hypoxia signaling pathway (prolyl hydroxylase), immune system, sexual reproduction, meiotic division, etc. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fairclough et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">King et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sogabe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Woznica et al., 2017</xref>). A thorough phylogenetic analysis of all the available ATD sequences has shown that the emergence of ATD is rooted in Choanoflagellates, which possesses ATD in addition to having a canonical DTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Intriguingly, Choanoflagellate ATD has mixed characteristics of both ATD and DTD. The two signature sequence motifs characteristic of all bacterial and eukaryotic DTD are SQFTL and NXGPXT, while PQATL and TNGPY/FTH typify ATD. Choanoflagellate ATD is unusual in having one motif each from ATD and DTD i.e., PQATL and NDGPFT respectively, thus capturing an intermediate in the transition and emergence of a paralog of DTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Using the available transcriptome and genomics data of different Choanoflagellates, we could identify ATD in a few more Choanoflagellates (<italic>S. macrocollata, S. dolichothecata, S. helianthica, Codosiga hollandica, Mylnosiga fluctuans, and Choanoeca flexa</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Richter et al., 2018</xref>) and all represent the transition state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Based on the aforementioned mixed features, Choanoflagellate represents a unique case of an intermediate in the metamorphosis of DTD to ATD from the amino acid sequence perspective. We further wanted to check whether this ancestor of Animalia ATD would perform a similar proofreading function. Indeed, biochemical assays showed that <italic>S. rosetta</italic> ATD (SrATD) was active on L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> thereby proving it to be a functional ATD and not DTD, which is a ‘Chiral Proofreader’ that does not act on L-aminoacyl-tRNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Interestingly, SrATD was not only active on L-Ala mischarged on non-cognate tRNA but also could discriminate the correctly charged substrates (L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) by 10-fold. The discrimination potential between cognate and non-cognate will be further enhanced in the presence of Elongation factor which binds L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> strongly compared to that of L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuncha et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LaRiviere et al., 2001</xref>).

containing G4•U69 also emerged in the unicellular ancestors of animals tRNA misselection by AlaRS is due to the appearance of tRNA isodecoders containing G4•U69 which is in turn linked to the expansion of tRNA genes. The number of unique tRNA genes is highly correlated to the complexity of the organisms (number of cell types) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The presence of G4•U69 in tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> can be traced from Cnidaria (<italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic>) to the recently evolved mammals (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) as is the case for ATD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, Choanoflagellates (<italic>S. rosetta</italic>) represent a stage of transition with 89 unique tRNAs, of which G4•U69 is seen in tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> and tRNA<sup>His</sup>, but not in tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Since in eukaryotes, tRNA<sup>His</sup> undergoes a post-transcriptional modification of adding guanine at the −1 position, which acts as a major determinant for histidyl-tRNA synthetase and a negative determinant for rest of the synthetases, and therefore would make it inert towards AlaRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giegé et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jackman and Phizicky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tian et al., 2015</xref>). However, the presence of G4•U69 in tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> possibly necessitates that Choanoflagellates have a proofreading factor that can edit L-Ala erroneously charged on tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>(G4•U69). We could show that tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>(G4•U69) could be charged by AlaRS albeit at much lower levels of 4% to 7% than observed for tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>(G4•U69) at 30% to 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). Due to the low levels of aminoacylation of Choanoflagellate tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>(G4•U69), we could not perform the deacylation assays using L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>. In any case, even such low levels of tRNA misselection would be precarious and Choanoflagellate ATD, which is in transition, is expected to act on these substrates and this aspect requires further probing. Therefore, the presence of ATD strictly alongside tRNA isodecoders containing G4•U69 even in Choanoflagellates, but not in fungi or other protists, underscores that ATD’s emergence is strongly linked with the appearance of tRNA isodecoders containing G4•U69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>ROS is an inevitable cellular metabolite of increased metabolism in animals, produced by mitohormesis, NOX enzymes and also β-oxidation of lipids in peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balaban et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lambeth, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohanty and McBride, 2013</xref>).

Since oxidative stress is an important component of multicellular systems, the innovation of ATD in Choanoflagellates seems to be essential to avoid the deleterious effects of tRNA misselection on the cellular proteome.

Therefore, the emergence of this metazoan specific proofreader, ATD, in Choanoflagellates is strictly linked to the appearance of tRNA isodecoders containing G4•U69 and underscoring a strong coevolution of these two, thus implicating their role in the emergence of multicellularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The confluence of tRNA isodecoder expansion and oxidative stress necessitates the recruitment of ATD in kingdom Animalia.</title><p>(1) Genome expansion leads to the appearance of (2,3) tRNA isodecoders which are used in different canonical and non-canonical functions, of which tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>(G4•U69) is (4) mischarged by AlaRS, to give the tRNA misselection product L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>(G4•U69). (5) in vitro these misselection products are cleared by ThrRS and ATD. 6) In multicellular animals, ROS acts as an important cellular metabolite performing various physiological functions by triggering the appropriate signaling pathway. 7) ROS generated internally in cells oxidizes the active site cysteine of ThrRS editing domain thereby affecting its proofreading activity on L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>. 8) To avoid mistranslation ATD is recruited in Animals and Choanoflagellates as it is inert towards ROS and robustly proofreads L-Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> to avoid (9) Thr-to-Ala mistranslation at the proteome level followed by cell death. 10) The tRNA isodecoders that are deacylated by ATD can either go for fresh aminoacylation or can be rerouted for other non-canonical functions.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58118-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the versatile roles of tRNA and tRNA-derived fragments in multiple cellular functions such as regulation, sperm fertility, intergeneration inheritance, and integrated stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doowon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fricker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gebetsberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nätt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schwenzer et al., 2019</xref>). The appearance of tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> isodecoders with G4•U69 in Animalia, and its conservation at the cost of tRNA misselection suggests a strong physiological role. The presence of 3’ tRNA-derived fragments (tRF id: 3020a and 3020b) of the tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>(G4•U69) in the tRF database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.bioch.virginia.edu/trfdb/">http://genome.bioch.virginia.edu/trfdb/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>) indicates the possible role of these isodecoders in non-canonical functions. One of the unknown puzzles in RNA biology is how these tRNAs are effectively routed for non-canonical functions. Post-transcriptional modifications of tRNA are implicated in regulating the tRNA folding and also fragments generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Durdevic and Schaefer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lyons et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pan, 2018</xref>). However, tRNAs once aminoacylated are channeled to the ribosome by elongation factor. Therefore, the presence of deacylators like ATD and ThrRS can strip the non-cognate amino acid from these tRNAs and thus provides one of the plausible ways of diverting a part of the tRNA pool away from translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It appears that the emergence of ATD as a translational quality control factor in Choanoflagellates has been utilized to selectively regulate the free tRNA pool for other non-canonical functions in Animalia, which remains to be explored.</p><p>Similar to genetic variations allowing to adapt/provide an advantage in stress conditions, the generation of variations at the proteome levels are known to be advantageous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mohler and Ibba, 2017</xref>). In lower systems such as <italic>Mycoplasma</italic>, mistranslation has been shown to be advantageous, wherein the presence of editing defective aaRSs (LeuRS, ThrRS, PheRS) allows the organism to gain phenotypic plasticity by generating proteome diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mohler and Ibba, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pezo et al., 2004</xref>). The current work involves the use of acute oxidative stress (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and further prompts to look at the behavior of ATD knockout cells in the presence of chronic oxidative stress such as activators of NADPH oxidase. ROS-induced inactivation of the editing activity of ThrRS can be used as a conserved mechanism for generating subtle variations in the cellular proteome. At the same time, the spatiotemporal regulation of ATD in combination with oxidative stress can generate a huge repertoire of proteome diversity that can be beneficial under certain cellular scenarios. ATD's expression levels are very likely modulated by the level of oxidative stress as seen in the case of reproductive tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), which also suggests a mode of regulation via a feedback mechanism. It is worth noting here that the appearance of multicellular animals ~ 750 million years ago is also marked by a significant increase in the global atmospheric oxygen levels which moved from &lt;10% to nearly 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kump, 2008</xref>). Overall, the confluence of tRNA expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and oxidative stress, both external and internal, necessitates the emergence of ATD to maintain cellular proteostasis in Animalia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

This group previously showed that AlaRS can misacylate tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> for tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> isoacceptors containing a (G4-U69) pair in the acceptor stem, and that the enzyme ATD can deacylate Ala from such Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> molecules. They hypothesized that ATD could serve a proofreading role in the cell. In this report, they show that ThrRS is also capable of deacylating Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>, apparently the first known case of one synthetase correcting the error made by another; and this activity is widespread among Animalia. They go on to show that this editing activity of ThrRS is inactivated in vitro by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, whereas ATD's comparable activity is insensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, leading to the prediction that ATD should be critical for preventing Thr to Ala substitutions in proteins in cells undergoing oxidative stress. They test this by knocking out ATD with CRISPR and finding that this confers reduced cell viability on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, which could be complemented by WT but not catalytically inactive ATD expression. They also observe increased Hsp70 expression in the ATD<sup>-/-</sup> cells on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, consistent with increased proteotoxic stress. Supporting this interpretation, they find increased aggregation of a specialized GFP reporter that serves as a reporter for mistranslation; and by mass-spec detected GFP peptides with Thr to Ala changes isolated from ATD<sup>-/-</sup> mutant cells but not from WT cells. Finally, they present bioinformatics results indicating the appearance of ATD in the Choanoflagellates in parallel with the appearance of tRNAs containing the G-U pair in the acceptor stem that is expected to confer their misacylation with Ala by AlaRS and engender a requirement for ATD editing function. These evolutionary data support a role for ATD in editing Ala misacylation events.</p><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1) Provide a modified Discussion that addresses (a) the fact that the effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on cells is not prolonged and so your results might apply only to acute oxidative stress; and also the relationship of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress to the activation of NADPH oxidase; and (b) the rationale for use of Hsp70 induction as a marker for induction of the UPF in oxidative stress, noting the known ties between Hsp70 expression and impairment of the 26S proteosome, and with protein misfolding, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases.

It is also interesting that the appearance of ATD in evolution of Animalia appears to be coincident with that of G4-U69 tRNAs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the present manuscript, the authors follow up on a previous report from their group (Kuncha et al., 2018.) in which they identified the Animalia-specific tRNA deacylase (ATD). They showed that ATD has enzymatic activity toward mis-aminoacylated Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> substrates. Interestingly, the accumulation of this mis-aminoacylated tRNA species does not arise from errors in mis-activation of non-cognate substrates, but rather through mis-selection of the tRNA. Alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) utilizes a G3-U70 base pair in the acceptor stem of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> for proper recognition. Previous efforts from this group and others have highlighted that in higher eukaryotes, many of the tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> genes encode a G4-U69 base pair that can be mis-selected by eukaryotic AlaRS. While much of the previous work on ATD focused on the biophysical and biochemical interactions with its substrates, in this report, the authors sought to identify the role of ATD in vivo.</p><p>To characterize the function of ATD in vivo, the authors first generated an ATD knockout strain of HEK293T cells. The authors report that the ATD knockout alone caused no discernable phenotype and elicited no induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) as determined by Western blotting of Hsp70. To ensure this was not due to an artifact in the specific cell type that was selected, the authors show that ATD is expressed across a wide array of tissue types in mice and expressed in various cell lines, which would presumably suggest that it likely is playing an important role in the cell.</p><p>As the ATD knockout line displayed no obvious cellular defects, the authors believed that another redundant proofreading factor may also act on Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> substrates. One of the most interesting findings from this report was that threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) has proofreading activity on Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>. It has been known for ~20 years that ThrRS utilizes post-transfer proofreading activity to correct mis-aminoacylated Ser-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>, but the determination that ThrRS also has trans proofreading activity for a different aminoacyl-tRNA substrate was quite unexpected. This result suggests that both ThrRS and ATD can both act on mis-selected Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>.</p><p>It was previously shown that <italic>E. coli</italic> ThrRS is susceptible to oxidation at Cys182. This conserved cysteine is responsible for coordinating the 3' end of the tRNA in the ThrRS proofreading domain, and upon oxidation, loses its deacylase activity for Ser-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>. The authors then wanted to determine if ThrRS oxidation also perturbed Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> deacylation. In fact, oxidative stress does cause an inactivation of ThrRS proofreading on the mis-alanylated tRNA species. This observation suggested that a primary role of ATD may be to deacylate this aminoacyl-tRNA during cellular oxidation.</p><p>The ATD knockout strains were revisited and treated with hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative stress. Unlike the observations in Figure 1, upon oxidation, ATD is required to maintain cell viability and prevent the induction of the UPR. This model suggests that upon oxidation, ThrRS proofreading becomes inactivated thus making ATD the singular factor to deacylate Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>. To determine if the loss of ATD activity cause protein mistranslation and aggregation, the authors used both a GFP-based reporter and mass spectrometry to show that translational errors were occurring and disrupting proteostasis. An interesting secondary result from these experiments was that the authors could show that the predicted ablation of eukaryotic ThrRS proofreading during oxidative stress led to quantifiable changes in Thr to Ser protein mistranslation in eukaryotic cells. This observation correlates with previous studies in bacteria and will be an important result for those interested in studying mistranslation globally.</p><p>Having determined a role for ATD in higher eukaryotes, the authors sought to identify the ancestor for the evolutionary acquisition of ATD. As a model, the authors used the Choanoflagellate <italic>Salpingoecarosetta</italic>. <italic>S. rosetta</italic> is a unicellular organism but encodes for cell cycle and other factors reminiscent of higher eukaryotic physiology. <italic>S. rosetta</italic> ATD had deacylase activity on both Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> and Ala-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> tRNAs suggesting this protein is more promiscuous for its substrates. This organism does not encode a G4-U69 containing tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> gene but does however have a tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> gene which does share this identity element. While not nearly as robust as the previous data, the authors provide some evidence that <italic>S. rosetta</italic> ATD may be important for preventing infrequent Ala-tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> mis-aminoacylation events.</p><p>The aforementioned report is well written and provides new insight into the role of freestanding proofreading factors in higher eukaryotes. The authors utilized a combination of cellular and biochemical approaches to tell a convincing narrative which should allow for future investigation. Aside from a few comments listed below, I would recommend this manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The Western blots in Figure 1C/D and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 are somewhat difficult to interpret. While I agree that they do show the presence of ATD in all of the tissue/cell types, the loading controls are inconsistent. I am less concerned with the technical reproducibility of the sample loading across the different lanes, but more interested in the striking differences in ATD levels across those samples, especially if they were normalized to GAPDH. In those different tissue types, do you believe that GAPDH has varied expression, or do you think the differences in ATD correlate to a more important tissue-specific role of this factor? Furthermore, In Figure 1—figure supplement 2, the figure legend states that protein was normalized by &quot;ATD based normalization&quot; but it is not clear what that means as ATD levels in that blot also vary widely. This technical approach should be reworded for clarity. As a minor comment, the figure legend says that β-actin was used as a loading control, but the figure is labeled as GAPDH.</p><p>2) Do the authors have any predicted regulatory mechanism for the elevated ATD levels shown in Figure 5C? Elaboration of this data would be an interesting discussion topic.</p><p>3) In Figure 3—figure supplement 4, it is interesting that at position 162, there is variability at that residue with some organisms encoding phenylalanine and others with tyrosine. I am curious if you observed any differences in activity with organisms encoding one or the other amino acid? I am imagining a scenario in which encoding Phe could allow for potential modulation of activity during oxidative stress if that position is accessible and can be modified to tyrosine. Alternatively, oxidized Phe (i.e. tyrosine) may be a more active variant and could have become fixed in those species. It is difficult to interpret any differences in Figure 3—figure supplement 3, but I was wondering if you had observed any other differences between those enzymes? It may speak to an interesting co-regulation of elevated ATD activity during oxidation while ThrRS activity goes down. If you have any data to suggest that may be possible, it would be a very nice discussion point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The central focus of this manuscript is the identification of conditions under which the Animalia specific tRNA deacylase (ATD) may be necessary for deacylation of tRNAs mis-activated with alanine. The evidence that ThrRS contains deacylation activity is solid, as is the evidence that ATD retains deacylation activity in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in vitro. The weakest part of the manuscript concerns the evidence that ATD and ThrRS functions as a de-acylase under oxidative stress conditions. The evidence that ATD reduces mistranslation is promising, but perhaps still a little preliminary. Overall, this manuscript provides additional characterization of the ATD enzyme, but lacks the decisive experiment that would signal a major advance in our understanding of mechanisms of protein quality control.</p><p>Specific comments and concerns:</p><p>1) Concern: The lack of quantitation of specific activity of deacylase makes it difficult to assess the extent of the protective effect of ThrRS with regard to clearing Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>. The argument would be stronger if the authors were able to provide a quantitative comparison of deacylation rates, taking into account enzyme concentrations. This information is likely available from direct fitting of the progress curves that are provided, without performing new experiments.</p><p>2) Comment: The retention of Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> editing across all ThrRS is not that surprising, when you consider the specific contacts in the ThrRS editing site. While there are interactions that promote Ser-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> binding in the editing site, there is no chemical basis to discriminate against Ala in this pocket; hence, this activity is inherent in these enzymes. It also needs to be mentioned that, in prokaryotes, the levels of Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> are likely to be significantly lower as a result of the G3:U70 identity element requirement for AlaRS in these taxa. Thus, there Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> editing may have little biological impact in the parokaryotic context. The narrative could be modified to include a more nuanced discussion of this issue.</p><p>3) Concern: A big concern I have is the use of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a stimulant to induce oxidative stress. It is a good first step but shouldn't be the whole story. The problem is that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has a relatively short life when administered to cells, and the short-term physiological effects that it induces might not be reflective of longer-term adaptation. (inducers of the NADPH oxidase should be considered.) The data suggesting that ATD is essential during oxidative stress would have been more convincing if it were supported by independent measurements of oxidative stress in the cells. The β-mercaptoethanol experiments provide indirect support of the hypothesis at best. A difficulty here is that it is not easy to formally block deacylation activity of ThrRS without blocking aminoacylation. A Potential method to be considered involves use of redox sensitive dye molecules, which can provide quantitative information. The authors might also consider looking at conditions under which stress granules form, given the interest in mistranslation. This represents the only concern where additional experimental work might be warranted.</p><p>4) Comment: While I would have liked to see a SILAC experiment formally comparing the extents of mistranslation ATD+ and ATD- cells, the mass spec data shown are promising and support the hypothesis that ATD forms this important editing function.</p><p>5) Comment: I really like the bioinformatics section of the paper. This was a very thoughtful addition to the study, with nice broader biological implications. Going forward, it will be very interesting to investigate the evolutionary emergence of other components in the protein synthesis quality control apparatus. The approach here is readily adaptable to the analysis of other translation genes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58118.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1) Provide a modified Discussion that addresses (a) the fact that the effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on cells is not prolonged and so your results might apply only to acute oxidative stress; and also, the relationship of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress to the activation of NADPH oxidase;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induces acute oxidative stress, while NADPH oxidase is known to induce chronic oxidative stress.

The house-keeping protein GAPDH is the most widely used loading control and is expected not to vary much among different tissues. Therefore, we agree with the reviewer that ATD expression is high in testis and ovaries hinting at a tissue-specific role, which is known to have high levels of oxidative stress, and the same is now included in the revised manuscript: “ATD expression levels are very likely modulated by the level of oxidative stress as seen in the case of reproductive tissues (Figure 1C, D), ….”</p><p>By stating ATD based normalization, we intended to say that due to high expression of ATD in a few cells/tissues we had to increase the overall protein load of samples in which ATD expression is low, this approach has allowed us to detect ATD in tissues expressing at very low levels. However, the usage of the word ATD-based normalization is not appropriate and hence this is now removed from the manuscript. We have also changed the figure legend of Figure 1—figure supplement 2 from β-actin to GAPDH and reworded as “…ATD protein was used as a positive control and GAPDH as a loading control.” We are very thankful to the reviewer for these suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Do the authors have any predicted regulatory mechanism for the elevated ATD levels shown in Figure 5C?

While there are interactions that promote Ser-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> binding in the editing site, there is no chemical basis to discriminate against Ala in this pocket; hence, this activity is inherent in these enzymes. It also needs to be mentioned that, in prokaryotes, the levels of Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> are likely to be significantly lower as a result of the G3:U70 identity element requirement for AlaRS in these taxa. Thus, there Ala-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> editing may have little biological impact in the parokaryotic context. The narrative could be modified to include a more nuanced discussion of this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>As correctly pointed out by the reviewer, the bacterial AlaRS is not ambiguous in tRNA selection and therefore charges only tRNAs harbouring G3-U70, but not G4-U69. Since G3-U70 is very specific to tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, the problem of tRNA mis-selection does not exist in prokaryotes and therefore ATD is absent in these organisms. This is now more elaborately mentioned in the revised manuscript: “…even though neither Bacteria (bacterial AlaRS is discriminatory and charges only tRNAs containing G3-U70 (Sun et al., 2016)) nor lower eukaryotes (which lack tRNAs containing G4-U69) possess the problem of tRNA mis-selection.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Concern: A big concern I have is the use of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a stimulant to induce oxidative stress. It is a good first step but shouldn't be the whole story. The problem is that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has a relatively short life when administered to cells, and the short-term physiological effects that it induces might not be reflective of longer-term adaptation. (inducers of the NADPH oxidase should be considered.) The data suggesting that ATD is essential during oxidative stress would have been more convincing if it were supported by independent measurements of oxidative stress in the cells. The β-mercaptoethanol experiments provide indirect support of the hypothesis at best. A difficulty here is that it is not easy to formally block deacylation activity of ThrRS without blocking aminoacylation. A Potential method to be considered involves use of redox sensitive dye molecules, which can provide quantitative information. The authors might also consider looking at conditions under which stress granules form, given the interest in mistranslation. This represents the only concern where additional experimental work might be warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this point. As a first major study, we have used H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to bring out the role of ATD in the presence of acute oxidative stress as has been followed generally by others in the field. As correctly stated by the reviewer, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> toxicity experiments are further supported by the toxicity caused due to depletion of reducing agent (β-mercaptoethanol) in mouse ES cells. However, intricate studies would be required in the future to look at the subtle effect of oxidative stress on ATD knockout cells in the presence of NADH oxidase activators in combination with assessing the cellular ROS (using redox dyes). We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of using FlucDM, the sensor of proteome stress, as a screen for testing different conditions in which ATD plays an essential role in maintaining proteome homeostasis, which we intend to use in our future studies. Based on the reviewer’s comments we have now included these aspects in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Comment: While I would have liked to see a SILAC experiment formally comparing the extents of mistranslation ATD+ and ATD- cells, the mass spec data shown are promising and support the hypothesis that ATD forms this important editing function.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and this will be our future course of study in different cell lines using different ROS inducers to precisely quantify the extent of mistranslation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Comment: I really like the bioinformatics section of the paper. This was a very thoughtful addition to the study, with nice broader biological implications. Going forward, it will be very interesting to investigate the evolutionary emergence of other components in the protein synthesis quality control apparatus. The approach here is readily adaptable to the analysis of other translation genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
