The structures reveal that activation of DNA strand cleavage and rejoining involves large conformational changes and DNA bending, suggesting how interaction with the cell division protein FtsK may license recombination at the septum. Together with biochemical and in vivo analysis, our structures also reveal how a small sequence asymmetry in <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> defines protein conformation in the synaptic complex and orchestrates the order of DNA strand exchanges.

In fact, most bacteria have a single circular chromosome. Bacteria multiply by simply dividing in two, and before that happens they must replicate their DNA so that each of the newly formed cells receives one copy of the chromosome.</p><p>Occasionally, mistakes during the DNA replication process can cause the two chromosomes to become tangled with each other; this prevents them from separating into the newly formed cells. For instance, the chromosomes can become physically connected like links in a chain, or merge into one long string. This kind of tangling can result in cell death, so bacteria encode enzymes called Xer recombinases that can untangle chromosomes. These enzymes separate the chromosomes by cutting and rejoining the DNA strands in a process known as Xer recombination.</p><p>Although Xer recombinases have been studied in quite some detail, many questions remain unanswered about how they work. How do Xer recombinases interact with DNA? How do they ensure they only work on tangled chromosomes? And how does a protein called FtsK ensure that Xer recombination takes place at the correct time and place?</p><p>Bebel et al. have now studied the Xer recombinase from a bacterium called <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, which causes stomach ulcers, using a technique called X-ray crystallography. This enabled the three-dimensional structure of the Xer recombinase to be visualized as it interacted with DNA to form a Xer-DNA complex. Structures of the enzyme before and after it cut the DNA show that Xer-DNA complexes first assemble in an inactive state and are then activated by large conformational changes that make the DNA bend. Bebel et al. propose that the FtsK protein might trigger these changes and help to bend the DNA as it activates Xer recombination.</p><p>Further work showed that the structures could be used to model and understand Xer recombinases from other species of bacteria. The next step is to analyze how FtsK activates Xer recombinases and to see if this process is universal amongst bacteria. Understanding how this process can be interrupted could help to develop new drugs that can kill harmful bacteria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19706.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19706.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>site-specific DNA recombination</kwd><kwd>genome maintenance</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic></kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>microbiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Molecular Biology Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bebel</surname><given-names>Aleksandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Karaca</surname><given-names>Ezgi</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Banushree</given-names></name><name><surname>Barabas</surname><given-names>Orsolya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karaca</surname><given-names>Ezgi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Molecular Biology Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International PhD Programme Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bebel</surname><given-names>Aleksandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>DNA-bound crystal structures of an essential Xer site-specific recombinase from the bacterium <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> reveal how large conformational changes initiate the untangling of chromosomes upon cell division.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In organisms with circular genomes, homologous recombination-mediated repair behind a stalled replication fork can join the two nascent daughter chromosomes, resulting in a chromosome dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barre et al., 2001</xref>). Dimer formation prohibits proper segregation of the genetic information at cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and must be repaired to produce viable progeny. In bacteria and archaea, chromosome dimers are monomerized by members of a large family of tyrosine recombinases, the Xer recombinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blakely et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">1993</xref>). These enzymes act by promoting recombination between two DNA sites, called <italic>dif</italic>. The <italic>dif</italic> site is normally present in a single copy at the replication terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carnoy and Roten, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuempel et al., 1991</xref>), but it is duplicated in chromosome dimers, so that intramolecular recombination results in separation (âresolutionâ) ofÂ the two chromosome copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Removal of the <italic>xer</italic> genes or the <italic>dif</italic> site results in increased DNA content, activation of the SOS response, cell filamentation, and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Britton and Grossman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Debowski et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">PÃ©rals et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Val et al., 2008</xref>). Besides chromosome dimer resolution, Xer recombinases can support plasmid resolution and mobilization of the cholera toxin phage CTXÏ and pathogenicity islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer et al., 2010</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19706.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Xer recombination.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The role of Xer recombination in the maintenance of bacterial chromosomes.

The absence of Xer leads to cell division arrest and cell death. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic representation of tyrosine site-specific recombination. Two recombinase monomers (beige ovals) bind one specific DNA site (grey) and two such sites are aligned in antiparallel in a tetrameric synaptic complex (<bold>i</bold>). The catalytic tyrosines of two symmetry-related protomers (red star) cleave one strand of each DNA, creating a covalent 3â phosphotyrosyl bond and a free 5â hydroxyl group (<bold>ii</bold>). The latter then attacks the phosphotyrosyl bond of the partner DNA, forming the HJ intermediate (<bold>iii</bold>). Following an isomerization step, the second pair of protomers becomes catalytically active (<bold>iv</bold>), leading to a reciprocal set of cleavage and strand exchange reactions that resolve the HJ and generate the recombined DNA products (<bold>vâvi</bold>). Only two protein subunits are active in the tetramer at a time (âhalf-of-the-sites reactivityâ), strictly ordering the chemical steps to ensure faithful progression of the recombination reaction to the desired products.

Many other organisms (including <italic>Lactococcus</italic>, <italic>Helicobacter</italic>, <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. and archaea) employ a single Xer recombinase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carnoy and Roten, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cortez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Debowski et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Le Bourgeois et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leroux et al., 2013</xref>), with a prime example, XerH/<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>, found in <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, a gastric pathogen implicated in peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer.</p><p>Xer recombinases are members of the tyrosine site-specific recombinase superfamily, a large group of enzymes that catalyze DNA breakage and rejoining using a conserved tyrosine nucleophile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grindley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Midonet and Barre, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nunes-DÃ¼by et al., 1998</xref>). Tyrosine recombinases promote various programmed DNA rearrangements including the monomerization of phage, plasmid and chromosome multimers, resolution of hairpin telomeres, and the movement of virulence and antibiotic resistance carrying integrative mobile genetic elements (including phages and transposons)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grindley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jayaram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Midonet and Barre, 2014</xref>). In addition, tyrosine recombinases (as exemplified by Cre and Flp) provide powerful genetic engineering tools that are widely used to carry out mutagenesis and DNA insertion in eukaryotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Turan et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Tyrosine recombinases share a common chemical mechanism that involves step-wise breakage and exchange of four DNA strands in pairs, proceeding through a characteristic four-way Holliday junction (HJ) DNA intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gopaul and Duyne, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grindley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holliday, 2007</xref>). They cut each DNA strand with a polarity creating a covalent 3â phosphotyrosyl protein-DNA linkage and a free 5â hydroxyl group. The DNA ends then go on to join with the complementary ends of the partner DNA strand generating the recombined products. All DNA cleavage and rejoining reactions take place in an ordered protein-DNA synaptic complex, comprising four recombinase molecules holding the two recombination partner DNA molecules together.</p><p>An unusual feature of Xer recombination at <italic>dif</italic> is that it requires an accessory factor, FtsK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aussel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Debowski et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Le Bourgeois et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leroux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nolivos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steiner et al., 1999</xref>). This DNA motor protein localizes to the bacterial cell division septum and contributes to segregating the sister chromosomes into the daughter cells by translocating towards their replication termini. On chromosome dimers, FtsK stops at the Xer-bound <italic>dif</italic> sites and activates recombination, triggering resolution of the dimers to monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aussel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grainge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">May et al., 2015</xref>). Without FtsK, Xer-<italic>dif</italic> synaptic complexes are formed, but do not lead to final recombination products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aussel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diagne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grainge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zawadzki et al., 2013</xref>). Regulation by FtsK is critical to ensure that Xer recombination takes place only in the correct spatial and temporal context â at the division septum, when genome replication has been completed â thereby ensuring faithful genome segregation.</p><p>Here, we present two crystal structures of the <italic>H. pylori</italic> XerH recombinase in complex with its recombination site <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>. Together with associated biochemical and in vivo data, these first Xer-DNA complex structures shed light on potential regulatory mechanisms of the recombination pathway. Remarkably, the overall shape and DNA conformation of initially formed XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> synaptic complexes is considerably different from those of other tyrosine recombinases, such as Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> that has served as a model system for the family. The unanticipated conformation of the pre-cleavage synaptic complex suggests a possible model for why Xer proteins require external activation, and in comparison with the post-cleavage complex structure provides clues for how FtsK might stimulate recombination activity. Our structures provide a resource to construct models for other Xer synaptic complexes, including that of the heterotetrameric <italic>E. coli</italic> XerC/D system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of the XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> synaptic complex</title><p>The current mechanistic model of Xer recombination conforms to the tyrosine recombinase paradigm, which is supported by extensive biochemical and structural studies on Xer and other systems (reviewed in: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grindley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Midonet and Barre, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Duyne, 2001</xref>]). This model proposes a step-wise process that starts with two Xer monomers binding to each <italic>dif</italic> site, which then interact to form a synaptic complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, i</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blakely et al., 1993</xref>). Here, two Xer protomers each cleave one strand of one <italic>dif</italic> site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B ii</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blakely et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gopaul and Duyne, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 1997</xref>), and the broken strands are exchanged and rejoined creating the HJ intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, iii</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gopaul et al., 1998</xref>). Then the second Xer pair performs cleavage and strand exchange on the other strand pair, completing recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, vâvi</xref>). Based on available synaptic complex structures of other tyrosine recombinases, it was hypothesized that the <italic>dif</italic> DNA is bent upon synapsis, creating a square planar DNA arrangement that is then maintained throughout the recombination reaction to allow energetically inexpensive exchange of DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gopaul et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">1999</xref>). However, in the absence of direct structural data the exact architecture of Xer-DNA complexes has remained unknown. Previous DNA-free crystal structures of Xer recombinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Serre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Subramanya et al., 1997</xref>) showed a domain arrangement that is incompatible with DNA binding. Another puzzling aspect of the mechanism concerned activation by FtsK. In early work, it was noted that in the absence of <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK, HJ formation was catalysed by XerC, leading to the hypothesis that XerC/D-<italic>dif</italic> synaptic complexes assemble preferentially with XerC in an active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barre et al., 2000</xref>). Subsequently, FtsK was shown to interact directly with the C-terminal domain of XerD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yates et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2006</xref>), and this interaction was hypothesized to promote reassembly of the âXerC-activeâ synaptic complex into a conformation in which XerD is active and performs cleavage of the first DNA strand pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aussel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grainge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zawadzki et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) studies indicated that the majority of XerC/D-<italic>dif</italic> synaptic complexes formed in the absence of FtsK are in a conformation where XerD is catalytically inactive, but ready for direct activation by FtsK without major dis- and reassembly of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zawadzki et al., 2013</xref>). A small proportion of XerC active complexes nevertheless form and create unproductive HJs, but the pre-active XerD synaptic complexes are dominant and are the ones activated by FtsK. However, none of the previous structures or biochemical data have provided an explanation for why Xer recombinases require activation, or what the nature of the proposed conformational rearrangements might be.</p><p>To begin to shed light on these issues, we determined the structure of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> XerH in complex with its <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> DNA substrate. <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) was previously predicted by comparative genome analysis and consists of two XerH-binding arms separated by a 6 bp central region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carnoy and Roten, 2009</xref>). We confirmed XerH binding to <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> by DNase I footprinting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) and analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We then co-crystallized full-length wild-type XerH with a 30 bp <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> DNA duplex. The resulting 2.1 Ã resolution structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) shows a synaptic complex with two <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> molecules and four XerH subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left panel). Each <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> site interacts with two XerH molecules, one molecule (molecule A) binding to the left arm and one (molecule B) to the right arm. The complex has overall two-fold symmetry relating the two DNA molecules and the XerH molecules bound to them (i.e. molecules A and B to Aâ and Bâ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The overall fold of each protein subunit resembles that of other tyrosine recombinases, comprising two mostly helical domains connected by a 7-aa linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The two domains of each subunit form a tight, C-shaped clamp around one arm of the <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The N-terminal domain contacts the DNA using a four-helix bundle (Î±A-Î±D, aa 12â88) and helix Î±F, both of which insert into the major groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These protein segments contribute most of the sequence-specific interactions to the DNA bases, while the catalytic domain contacts mainly the DNA backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). Many interactions of the catalytic domain involve helix Î±K (aa 285â299) that is inserted into the major groove at the outer part of <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>, narrows the groove (17 Ã as opposed to 22 Ã in typical B-DNA) and induces a slight DNA bend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The central region is only involved in sparse backbone interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A</xref>).

These substrates contain a nick in the DNA backbone of each strand, one nucleotide downstream of the cleavage position. Upon XerH-mediated cleavage, the resulting covalent XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> intermediate is trapped and can be detected by SDS-PAGE (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As predicted by the structure, mutations of the inner base-pairs of the arms (where XerH makes base-specific contacts) resulted in abolished or greatly reduced cleavage activity, whereas mutations of the neighboring base-pairs did not affect theÂ activity.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19706.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Differential recognition of the two <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> arms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) XerH binding to <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> and derivatives containing a single <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> arm (<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>L or <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>R) flanked by a random sequence, as quantified from EMSA (see original gels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref> and numerical quantification data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3âsource data 1</xref>).

In several studied examples, this ordering is believed to be linked to asymmetry in the DNA sequences, but the exact mechanisms vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blakely et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ennifar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nolivos et al., 2010</xref>). To determine how the XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> system achieves ordering of the recombination steps, we first tested the roles of the two distinct protein-binding arms of <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in XerH binding and activity. DNA binding assays (EMSA) with substrates containing the sequences of one or both arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>) showed that two XerH monomers bind cooperatively (see especially <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The affinity of a <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>L substrate containing only the left arm sequence, with a random sequence in place of the right arm, was higher (dissociation constant, K<sub>D</sub>Â =Â 180 nM; similar to wild-type <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> K<sub>D</sub>Â =Â 150 nM) than the affinity of a similar right arm-containing substrate <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>R (K<sub>D</sub>Â =Â 230 nM). Similarly, a palindromic substrate containing two <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> left arms (<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>LP) made a stable complex with XerH (observed by SEC), whereas the equivalent right arm substrate (<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>RP) did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). DNA cleavage assays also revealed different efficiencies at the two arms: no cleavage product was detected with <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>R or <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>RP, whereas <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>L and <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>LP substrates were cleaved as efficiently as the native <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). An assay that assesses the efficiency of intramolecular recombination between two plasmid-borne sites in <italic>E. coli</italic> also indicated differential activity at the two <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> arms in vivo: the wild-type recombination rate (9.9% recombination-positive colonies) increased when both <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> sites were replaced with <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>LP (29.4%; p=0.0016, t-test), but decreased to barely detectable levels with <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>RP (1.3%; p=0.0021, t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Our observation that XerH binds and preferentially cleaves the left arm of <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> led us to ask how the arms are distinguished. Remarkably, the sequences of the two arms are identical apart from a single base-pair insertion in the left arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the crystal structure, the respective XerH subunits (A and B) make very similar interactions with the two <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). The inserted base-pair (A6/T25â, brown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) is not recognized directly. Instead, the main difference in the recognition of the two arms involves a conserved thymine base (T4/T5') in the outer parts of the arms: In the left arm, T4 forms hydrophobic contacts with XerH Î±K and makes a specific hydrogen bond with lysine K290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, red insert), whereas in the right arm T5' is closer to the center of <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> and cannot make these interactions. Surprisingly, the three outermost base-pairs of each <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> arm make very similar backbone interactions with their respective XerH subunits, despite the fact that they are shifted in space due to the insertion in the left arm (altering the âhelical phaseâ of the sequence byÂ ~35Â°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, black insert; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). This is possible because the conformation of the DNA is asymmetric â the left arm is more bent than the right arm â and the catalytic domains of the protein subunits are rotated byÂ ~10Â° relative to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Together, the observed differences result in stronger interaction of XerH with the left <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> arm (ÎGÂ =Â â21.3 kcal/mol, estimated by PISA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>]) than with the right arm (ÎGÂ =Â â15.4 kcal/mol). A further difference between the XerH subunits bound to the left and right arms of <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> concerns the C-terminal helices. While the Î±N-Î±O segment of molecule A is fully ordered, the linker and Î±O are partially disordered in molecule B. Also, helices Î±O point in different directions (~100Â° rotation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with the structure, <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> variants containing mutations at the inserted base-pair showed no or only moderate decreases in cleavage in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>) and recombination in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). In contrast, substitutions of T4 practically abolished recombination in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and in <italic>H. pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Debowski et al., 2012a</xref>); and mutation of K290 (K290S) decreased recombination activity by about half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). Insertion of an additional base-pair next to A6/T25â in the left arm, further shifting the positions of the three outermost base-pairs, also abolished cleavage completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Like the arms, the central region of <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> is also asymmetric, with different nucleotides flanking the left and right cleavage sites (positions C13 and G13â). However, XerH does not contact these nucleotides in our structure, and cleavage assays with <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> variants carrying mutations at these positions revealed no reduction in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4B</xref>), suggesting that the identity of these nucleotides does not contribute to XerH binding and cleavage asymmetry.</p><p>Together, these data demonstrate that XerH binds preferentially to the left arm of <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> thanks to favorable interactions with its outer sequence (including T4). Asymmetric interactions with the two arms of <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> also appear to dictate distinct protein conformations in the synaptic complex, including differential positioning of the Î±N-Î±O segment that carries the nucleophilic tyrosine, perhaps helping to define which arm is cleaved first.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A catalytically inactive, pre-cleavage synaptic complex, with almost straight DNA</title><p>Perhaps the most unexpected feature of the XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> synaptic complex structure is the DNA conformation, which is nearly straight. Both DNA molecules in the synapse resemble B-form DNA, with a wide angle (165Â°) between the two <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left panel). This is in sharp contrast to other currently available DNA-bound structures of tyrosine recombinases, all of which contain strongly bent DNA. For example, the <italic>loxP</italic> DNA is bent toÂ ~100Â° in the analogous pre-cleavage structures of Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panel). This bent DNA conformation is maintained throughout the recombination reaction, allowing easy transition between the reaction intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ennifar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gopaul et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 1999</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>In the active site of each XerH subunit, several conserved residues including the catalytic tyrosine Y344, two arginine (R213 and R312), and two histidine (H309 and H335) residues are assembled around the scissile phosphate, together forming a catalytic pocket characteristic of tyrosine recombinases. The active sites of the subunits are very similar, except for the R213 side chain which points in different directions in molecules A and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Electron density for another essential catalytic residue, K239, could not be observed in either of the subunits, so we presume that it is disordered. The catalytic tyrosine Y344 is far away (5.2â5.8 Ã) from the scissile phosphate in all subunits, so the structure represents a catalytically inactive synaptic complex, implying a conformational change is required prior to catalysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conformational rearrangements in the post-cleavage synaptic complex</title><p>To capture XerH in a post-cleavage synaptic complex, we used âsuicideâ <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> substrates (containing a nick in each DNA strand, as in the in vitro cleavage assays described above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Attempts to co-crystallize XerH with suicide versions of the native <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> sequence were unsuccessful, but palindromic <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>LP suicide substrates gave us crystals that diffracted to 2.4 Ã (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The resulting structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) differs considerably from the pre-cleavage structure. Each <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>LP site interacts with two XerH molecules in a tetrameric synaptic complex, but in this structure, the two halves of the tetramer are related by crystallographic two-fold symmetry (relating molecule A to Aâ and B to Bâ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). While the structures of the individual XerH subunits and their interactions with the respective <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> DNA arms in this structure and in the pre-cleavage structure are similar, the overall arrangement of the complex is different. Most strikingly, the <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> DNA is now strongly bent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). The bend mainly originates from a single distortion within the central region of <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>: bases A17â and G18â are un-stacked with a 90Â° tilt, which introduces a kink resulting in asymmetric bending of the DNA (insert in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The total angle of 120Â° between the <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> arms is only slightly wider than the angles observed in previous structures of various tyrosine recombinases (e.g. 109Â° in the post-cleavage structure of Î» integrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biswas et al., 2005</xref>) and 100Â° in Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 1997</xref>); see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, the kink in <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> is at an equivalent position to the kink in <italic>loxP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ennifar et al., 2003</xref>). However, whereas in Cre the nucleotides involved in the kink interact with three arginines within a tight pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ennifar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 1997</xref>), XerH forms only a single interaction with these nucleotides (R129-A17â; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A</xref>) and encircles the kink less tightly. Notably, the nucleotides of the central region of <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> remain fully base-paired after cleavage, unlike the analogous structure of Cre-<italic>loxP</italic>, where several of these are unpaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 1997</xref>). The extensive Cre contacts can thus actively bend <italic>loxP</italic>. In contrast, weaker XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> interactions appear to be insufficient to promote sharp DNA bending, but nicks in both DNA strands of the <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> substrate facilitate bending. When we tried to re-build the DNA strands in the post-cleavage structure to model a bent but un-nicked substrate, we observed a clash with the protein near the tyrosine nucleophile-bearing helix Î±N, suggesting that the nicks might favor the XerH conformation adopted on the bent sites.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19706.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The post-cleavage XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>LP synaptic complex structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall view of the XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>LP structure in cartoon representation.

Also, the synaptic interface is considerably larger (3926 Ã<sup>2</sup>, calculated by PISA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>]) than in the pre-cleavage structure (3040 Ã<sup>2</sup>). The previously disordered parts of the Î±O helices of molecule B are now fully visible, ordered, and more compact (F338 - W359 distance reduced from 43 Ã to 34 Ã; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, left insert).

Consequently, subunit A assumes a fully active conformation, while subunit B is in an inactive conformation with the catalytic tyrosine distant from the scissile phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This simultaneous presence of both active and inactive XerH subunit conformations within the synaptic complex is consistent with the âhalf-of-the-sites reactivityâ mechanism observed for other tyrosine recombinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The marked difference between the XerH subunits bound to the two <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>LP arms (comparable to the asymmetry seen in the pre-cleavage complex with native <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>) is particularly striking considering that the artificially introduced symmetry of the substrate could be expected to mask some asymmetric features of the synaptic complex.

The five conserved catalytic residues (RHRHY) assemble around the catalytic pocket in all XerC and XerD subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In the post-cleavage complex, the XerD subunits are in an active conformation, with their nucleophilic tyrosines approaching the scissile phosphates, whereas the XerC subunits are in an inactive conformation. As in the XerH structures, the three outer base-pairs of each <italic>dif</italic> arm are contacted extensively by the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), and the bases corresponding to T4 in <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> interact with lysine K222 of XerC or histidine H225 of XerD, both counterparts of XerH K290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). These interactions might contribute to the arm specificity of XerC and XerD, as well as to ordering recombination, as we inferred for XerH. The interactions involved in DNA kinking in Cre are absent in the XerC/D-<italic>dif</italic> complex, suggesting that these enzymes, like XerH, might be unable to independently initiate sharp DNA bending.</p><p>The protein arrangements and interfaces observed in our two XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> structures are well accommodated by XerC and XerD, the pre-cleavage model showing nearly straight DNA and the post-cleavage model containing bent DNA and tightened intersubunit interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This suggests that the XerC/D and XerH complexes might undergo similar conformational rearrangements upon activation. In agreement with this idea, two previous smFRET studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diagne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zawadzki et al., 2013</xref>) reported that pre-formed XerC/D-<italic>dif</italic> synaptic complexes undergo conformational change upon activation by FtsK, leading to an increase of the distance between the two <italic>dif</italic> termini from about 53 to 67 Ã across the synapse (as predicted from a change in FRET efficiencies; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zawadzki et al., 2013</xref>]). Our XerC/D-<italic>dif</italic> models predict a similar change from 46 Ã in the pre-cleavage state to 60 Ã in the post-cleavage state.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we investigated the structural and mechanistic bases of Xer site-specific recombination. Using the homomeric XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> system from <italic>H. pylori</italic> as a model system, we report the first high-resolution crystal structures of Xer-<italic>dif</italic> synaptic complexes. These structures demonstrate that Xer proteins follow the established chemical pathway of tyrosine recombinases and reveal how the reaction steps can be choreographed by small differences in the arms of the <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> recombination sites. Together with associated biochemical data, the structures also show that XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> synaptic complexes initially assemble in an inactive state with straight DNA, which must undergo a major conformational change for catalytic activation, as previously observed in single molecule fluorescence studies of XerC/D-<italic>dif</italic> recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diagne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zawadzki et al., 2013</xref>). Our post-cleavage XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> synaptic complex structure elucidates the structural nature of this conformational change, which involves major rearrangement of the protein-protein interfaces and DNA bending (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). With molecular modeling, we extend our structural and mechanistic findings to the prototypical <italic>E. coli</italic> XerC/D-<italic>dif</italic> system, demonstrating that our structures provide a resource for understanding the mechanism of other Xer recombinases.</p><p>The thoroughly characterized Cre site-specific recombination reaction has long been considered a paradigm for tyrosine recombinase-based DNA rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gopaul and Duyne, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grindley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Duyne, 2015</xref>). Unusually, Xer recombinases require an external factor (generally the cell division protein FtsK) for catalytic activation. This feature is essential for Xerâs chromosome maintenance function, but does not have any analogy in the Cre system. Therefore, the structural basis of Xer recombination and its activation have remained debated. From our structural, biochemical, and microbiological data on <italic>H. pylori</italic> XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> recombination we can now propose a mechanistic model for XerH recombination and the regulatory function of FtsK, as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>):<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19706.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for XerH recombination activation.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>) Differential binding affinities of XerH to the left and right arms of <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> DNA trigger an asymmetric DNA conformation and arrange the two protein subunits in distinct conformations (<bold>A</bold>).

The <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> left arm has higher affinity for XerH than the right arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), leading to the second XerH molecule binding to the right arm more often than vice versa. Cooperative binding of XerH involves extensive contacts between the two subunits bound to each <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>, as revealed by our structures (1650.6 Ã<sup>2</sup> surface area with ÎGÂ =Â â12.6 kcal/mol and 1515.5 Ã<sup>2</sup> with ÎGÂ =Â â14.5 kcal/mol between molecules A-B and Aâ-Bâ respectively in the pre-cleavage structure; and 1379.8 Ã<sup>2</sup> surface area with ÎG of â13.8 kcal/mol in the post-cleavage structure). Despite the near-perfect dyad symmetry of the <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> arms, the bound XerH subunits are structurally distinct. The left arm subunit assumes a conformation primed for DNA cleavage, whereas the right arm subunit is forced in an inactive state. This asymmetric configuration defines the order of all subsequent cleavage and strand transfer events.</p><p>Two XerH-bound <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> sites then interact to create a tetrameric synaptic complex, as we see in our crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The sites align in antiparallel, and intersubunit interactions across the synaptic interface anchor the Î±O helices of the right arm-bound XerH subunits on their left arm-bound partner, creating a âcircularâ domain-swapped arrangement, similar to the ones described for other tyrosine recombinases such as Cre and Î» integrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biswas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>The pre-cleavage synaptic complex crystal structure contains nearly straight <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and XerH is in a catalytically inactive conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Correspondingly, we were unable to observe <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> recombination or XerH-mediated cleavage of intact <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> DNA substrates in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>, and data not shown). We cannot exclude the possibility that XerH does still catalyze transient strand cleavage of these substrates, followed by rapid efficient re-ligation making cleavage undetectable, but there is no evidence to support this idea. In contrast, nicked <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> suicide substrates are cleaved efficiently, and our crystal structure in which XerH-mediated cleavage of nicked <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> has occurred showed a sharply bent DNA conformation, consistent with a direct link between DNA bending and cleavage activity. The crystals giving our two structures were grown under different conditions (see Materials and methods), but XerH was active (on nicked <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> substrates) in both conditions (data not shown), supporting our view that both structures are biologically relevant. We hypothesize that our in vitro systems lack a stimulatory factor that is required for normal recombination between intact <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> sites. Septum-borne FtsK was shown to be required for XerH recombination in <italic>H. pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Debowski et al., 2012a</xref>), so we propose that this is the missing factor for XerH activation in vitro. FtsK-promoted rearrangement of the XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> synaptic complex might bring the catalytic tyrosines of the left arm-bound subunits into their active positions close to the scissile phosphates and sharply bend the DNA as seen in our structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Another possibility is that FtsK mediates formation of a different synaptic complex with the right arm-bound subunits activated for cleavage. However, this would be inconsistent with smFRET studies of XerC/D complexes showing that FtsK activates pre-formed synaptic complexes without major remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zawadzki et al., 2013</xref>). Analogy with the XerC/D system suggests that FtsK might directly interact with the C-terminalÂ ~20 amino acids of XerH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yates et al., 2006</xref>) or the back of its C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keller et al., 2016</xref>). However, the role of FtsK in the <italic>H. pylori</italic> Xer system still requires further substantial investigation, and it remains possible that the bent-DNA configuration required for DNA cleavage can be reached from the pre-cleavage structure without the intervention of FtsK.</p><p>Following activation, XerH-catalysed DNA strand cleavage and rejoining presumably follow the conserved tyrosine recombination pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), with the XerH subunits bound to the left arms performing the first strand exchanges. The resulting HJ is then resolved by a reciprocal set of chemical reactions catalysed by the XerH subunits bound to the right arms.</p><p>DNA bending is a prerequisite for activity of many molecular machines, including transcription factors, topoisomerases and recombinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong and Berger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang and Steitz, 1995</xref>). In most of these cases, DNA bending and the downstream function are performed by the same protein or complex, or DNA bending depends on ubiquitously available factors such as IHF. For tyrosine recombinases, the paradigm suggests that sharp DNA bending that is required for DNA cleavage and energetically inexpensive strand exchange, is introduced by the recombinase itself concomitant with DNA binding and synapsis. Here, we show that this is not the case for XerH, which binds and assembles its recombination substrates in an almost straight conformation. The required DNA bending then presumably occurs upon activation by an external factor that is present only in a particular spatial and temporal context, providing an elegant regulatory mechanism to ensure faithful chromosome segregation.</p><p>Our modeling of XerC/D<italic>-dif</italic> indicates that the architectures of the pre- and post- cleavage synaptic complexes are probably conserved between XerC/D and XerH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The DNA conformational changes that we observe for XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> are also consistent with smFRET studies of XerC/D-<italic>dif</italic> synaptic complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diagne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zawadzki et al., 2013</xref>), which imply a conformational change upon FtsK-mediated activation consistent with the differences between our models of the pre-cleavage and post-cleavage complexes. Thus, we expect that the mechanism of catalytic activation proposed here for XerH â preassembly of a synaptic complex with almost straight DNA, followed by FtsK-induced protein and DNA rearrangements activating the complex for catalysis â may be conserved in the XerC/D system.</p><p>In summary, our structures of XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> complexes demonstrate that catalysis by the Xer family of site-specific recombination systems follows the established tyrosine recombinase pathway, with the reaction steps being choreographed by small differences in the arms of the <italic>dif</italic> recombination sites. Contrary to previous assumption, bending of the <italic>dif</italic> sites does not occur concomitantly with synaptic complex assembly but at a post-synaptic step, when the accessory factor FtsK might be needed to license the reaction by promoting a conformational change. We also provide structural insight into the conformational change required for activation (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), and extend our findings to other Xer recombinases through modeling. Our structural insights help us to better understand how Xer proteins function and how they have adapted the tyrosine recombinase machinery for their unique genome maintenance function.

XerC/D tetramers were assembled by superposing individual protein domains onto our XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> structures by rigid structural alignment using FATCAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2006</xref>) with XerD placed onto the left <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> arm (i.e. superposed onto subunit A in the cleavage-competent conformation). Flexible parts that could not be aligned (Î±M-Î±O and Î²2-Î²3 hairpin) were isolated and modeled by threading with Phyre2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karaca and Bonvin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>dif</italic> DNA was modeled with mode-RNA server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rother et al., 2011</xref>) using <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> as a template and refined in HADDOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Zundert et al., 2016</xref>). Both pre- and post-cleavage complexes were modeled and the assembled models were refined in HADDOCK to optimize molecular geometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Database accession codes</title><p>Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 5JK0 (XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> pre-cleavage synaptic complex) and 5JJV (XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>LP post-cleavage synaptic complex).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by: the EMBL; the EMBL International PhD Programme (fellowship to AB); Humboldt Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (to EK).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Gregory D Van Duyne.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Understanding the mechanism of Xer recombination at chromosomal dif sites is acknowledged to be a long-standing, challenging problem. In this regard, the manuscript provides an extensive structural and biochemical analysis of the Helicobacter Xer-dif recombination machine in a well-written and well-documented manner, and that it reveals new details of the steps involved in this important reaction. Showing for the first time high resolution structures of a Xer recombinase complexed with DNA and these structures was unanimously considered to be useful for modelling and understanding other Xer recombinases.</p><p>This said, there was some debate as to the novelty and impact of the insights they propose. One reviewer felt that the model in which inactive, un-bent synaptic Xer/dif complexes form and are then induced to bend and cleave by FtsK is intriguing and would constitute a major advance in understanding Xer/dif recombination (if correct). Another reviewer mentioned that the structures of the pre-cleavage (and catalytically inactive) and post-cleavage (on a nicked 'suicide' substrate) synaptic complexes are important and provide some surprises, but that their mechanistic significance is more incremental, with the final model (at least as depicted) adding little to what has been published previously.</p><p>In going forward, attention should be paid to depicting and improving the discussion of what new insights can gained from the present work to resolve this debate â i.e., how specifically do the structural snapshots and associated biochemistry inform or change the field's understanding of Xer recombination mechanism in a meaningful way? In addition, there are several other issues that need to be addressed before a final decision can be reached. These include:</p><p>1) The paper overreaches in trying to reinforce the biological significance of the work. In the Abstract for example, the statement that the work will &quot;open up new avenues towards the antibacterial treatment&quot; is far-fetched. The same applies to the statement (in the Abstract and elsewhere) that the work provides mechanistic insight into the action of FtsK in stimulating the reaction. Similar overreach is present in the Discussion. In general, statements relating to how FtsK activates Helicobacter Xer recombination or how the present study will aid drug discovery should be downplayed, as there are no direct experiments or data that relate to these points. Relevant to the FtsK, would it be appropriate to bring up and cite the subsequent Zawadzki work (May et al. 2015) on FtsK activation as monitored in single-molecule FRET.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. Was the Xer recombination observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and supporting information)? If the authors still wish to focus on the importance of FtsK in activating Xer recombination, this is an important experiment. If it is FtsK-dependent, is this expected given the differences between Helicobacter FtsK and <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK (and would one expect Helicobacter Xer to be acted on by <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK, if indeed this is the case?). Some comment on this question is needed.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and the associated text, there is a problem with the proposal that the binding of the two recombinases to dif is temporally sequential in a mechanistic sense. How can this be? The observed affinities for the two dif arms are presumably determined by the relative off-rates, meaning that the left site is more often occupied than the right site, and leading to the second molecule binding to the right site more often than vice versa. Why not simply restate this way? Along these lines, a substantial part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is a repeat of what is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. It is suggested that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> be deleted and that relevant new panels be incorporated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>4) The evidence that XerH does not cleave linear dif sites shown in supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> seems weak. <italic>E. coli</italic> XerCD can cleave dif sites in vitro and in vivo in the absence of FtsK, but this cleavage is non-productive (XerC generates and resolves HJs or cleaves and re-ligates; XerD is inactive). By analogy, XerH bound to the left half-site of dif resembles XerC in its properties (i.e., the more active half). The authors have made the opposite assignment in their model of XerC/XerD/dif shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which is consistent with current views that XerD catalyzes the first strand exchange when activated by FtsK. However, this assignment implicitly assigns XerD half to be the more active one, based on the data presented. The synaptic complex structure determined in this work might instead correspond to the alternative 'XerC cleavage' synaptic complex: the one that undergoes futile cycling. The reaction schematic shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> implies that the more reactive dif half-sites initiate strand exchange (with the help of FtsK) and the inactive half-sites resolve the HJ intermediate, based on the structural models and biochemistry presented. This is the opposite of the currently favored mechanism for <italic>E. coli</italic> Xer/dif recombination. Please comment on this point.</p><p>5) The cleaved complex confirms that Xer enzymes proceed through a Cre-like pathway once activated, with sharply bend DNA arms, etc. Unfortunately, the structure has been symmetrized to be Cre-like, possibly masking asymmetric features that may be present. In particular, it may be difficult to conclude much from the inter-subunit interactions present, since the asymmetries introduced by the right half-site have been lost. This point should be noted in the text.</p><p>6) The pre-cleavage complex was crystallized without divalent ions, at pH 5.5. The post-cleavage complex was crystallized at pH 7 in the presence of a high concentration of divalent ions. An alternative interpretation of the current results is that the observed structures reflect the crystallization conditions and that the synaptic complex is actually bent (to some extent) at netural pH with Mg<sup>2+</sup> present. The authors should address this alternative explanation in the paper.</p><p>7) The cooperativity of XerH binding to dif is actually very low, given the similar half-site vs. full site binding constants. The wording in the manuscript is somewhat misleading in this respect â it is surprising how low the cooperativity is, given the extent of inter-subunit interactions on a single dif site. The authors should report what this interaction surface is and discuss the lack of strong cooperative binding in light of the structure.</p><p>8) It would be useful to report whether a bent, but un-nicked duplex substrate can be reconstructed (modeled) from the cleaved complex. This would indicate whether the higher energy bent form of dif is likely to resemble the cleaved configuration, or alternatively, whether the cleaved complex undergoes additional bending and subunit rotations that occur after cleavage has occurred.</p><p>9) The authors suggest that the suicide substrates used are cleaved by XerH because the nicks facilitate the required bend. Usually, the energetic cost of DNA bending is mostly related to unstacking of the bases, which nicking does not solve. Do the current structures explain how the nicks might be specifically allowing higher cleavage for this system â e.g., through relieving a strained backbone configuration? Or are they simply allowing the cleavage product to accumulate? Is the structure of an XerH catalytic mutant bound to nicked dif sites expected to be bent?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structural snapshots of Xer recombination reveal activation by synaptic complex remodeling and DNA bending&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

In the absence of supporting data indicating that XerH will preferentially resolve HJs by bottom strand exchange, this claim should be removed. See also Discussion paragraph 7 in reference to this point.</p><p>3) Discussion section, paragraph one. Aside from the crystal structure reported here, there is other evidence that XerH/dif sites are assembled in an inactive synaptic complex in solution (e.g., Zawadzki et al. should be noted). Is there additional evidence for XerH/difH?</p><p>4) Authors' response #1 and related manuscript sections. What is the evidence that XerH does not cleave dif sites in vitro? This has been a tricky issue in the field, since it is hard to distinguish cleavage followed by rapid ligation from lack of cleavage. Unless the authors can provide data (e.g., using 5'-bridging phosphorothiolates) that demonstrate lack of cleavage, it would be better to take the position that it is not yet clear whether cleavage occurs in vitro. It is also difficult to explain activity in <italic>E. coli</italic> with such a model. In contrast, the behavior is readily explained if XerH bound to the left end behaves like XerC (as in an alternative model). Related to this is the question of whether cleavage is required for stabilization of the synaptic complex, independent of FtsK. This is true of Î» int and several catalytic Cre mutants form much weaker synaptic complexes relative to wild-type Cre, suggesting that this could also be true in XerH as well. The nicked XerH/DNA complex also supports this idea. Thus, the synaptic complex structure observed for XerH could equally well represent a stable intermediate that can reach the transient bent configuration required for cleavage on its own. Please resolve/comment on this issue.</p><p>5) Authors' response #6. The reviewers requested that the authors note the possibility that the synaptic complex structure may be influenced by crystallization conditions (low pH and/or lack of divalents). The authors acknowledge this in their response to reviewers, but do not appear to have modified the manuscript. Given that this structure is central to the authors' proposals for Xer recombination, the readers should be made aware that the conditions for the two structures are quite different. Please revise the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>6) The authors note that several unbound Xer crystal structures show different domain relationships, but continue to promote the idea that a specific conformational change takes place upon DNA binding (as shown in the video). To echo the original review, it is unlikely that the XerD alone structure represents a true &quot;conformational intermediate,&quot; rather than just one of an ensemble of configurations present when Xer subunits are not bound to dif. The three Xer crystal structures in the PDB have their NTDs in completely different conformations. The ideas in the discussion and video illustrating that the NTD has to undergo a significant change when completing the clamp on the dif half-site was assumed many years ago by most people in the field and is true for all tyrosine recombinases. This point should clarified or else its discussion (and the movie) should be removed from the paper.</p><p>7) The distinction between understanding the mechanism of recombination vs. regulation of this process is important, but not made clear (Abstract and Introduction sections). The authors imply that the mechanism of XerC/XerD recombination is still unknown.</p><p>8) Introduction paragraph six. The structures do not delineate the pathway (delete this) but do shed light on potential regulatory mechanisms (reword).</p><p>9) In the same section the structure does not explain why activation is required. It suggests a possible model, as described by the authors, which differs from at least one other XerCD model.</p><p>10) Results paragraph one. The current mechanism is based on much more than the series of Cre-loxP structures cited. A review covering tyrosine recombinase mechanisms (there are many) might be more appropriate here.</p><p>11) Subsection âStructure of the XerH-difH synaptic complexâ need to be redrafted to accurately to describe the historical record (in doing so, the authors should consider point 9 and earlier comments regarding alternative models). The current text is incomplete and in part misleading. In the absence of FtsK, HJs formed by XerC were detected in early work and this led to the hypothesis that the XerC active conformation formed preferentially and FtsK switched the conformation of an XerC active complex to one in which XerD was active. Single-molecule FRET experiments by Zawadzki and colleagues led to the different hypothesis that this is not the case; rather, the major synaptic complex that forms in the absence of FtsK is an 'XerD potentially active conformation,' which is catalytically dead. A small proportion of XerC active complexes nevertheless form and are responsible for the XerC HJs. Nevertheless, the dominant pre-active XerD synaptic complexes are the ones activated by XerD. This is consistent with the results here, but the historical development of these ideas should be explicitly chronicled.</p><p>12) Subsection âStructure of the XerH-difH synaptic complexâ paragraph two.

In addition, there are several other issues that need to be addressed before a final decision can be reached.</italic></p><p>We hope that our revisions have added clarity with respect to the novelty of our study. We have now included a paragraph at the beginning of Discussion to summarize the novel data and insights brought about by our work. We have also modified the text throughout, particularly the final paragraph of the discussion, to better emphasize the impact of our results for understanding of Xer recombination and tyrosine recombination more generally.</p><p>The main novel aspects of our study and their impact are summarized below for your information:</p><p>We report the first high-resolution structures of an Xer recombinase in synaptic complex with its DNA substrates. Such a structure has been long sought, as its absence prevented proper understanding of this important family of site-specific recombination systems. Structural models relying on available structures of the Cre/lox system and others left several questions unanswered. Especially with regard to the molecular mechanism of Xer activation at chromosomal dif sites, it remained unclear why Xer proteins require activation in the first place, and what the molecular assemblies and rearrangements preceding activation might look like (all previous tyrosine recombinase-DNA structures reflected macromolecular assemblies highly similar to the activated state). In this manuscript, we present two structures of the XerH-difH synaptic complex captured at distinct stages of the recombination reaction, which shed light on critical steps of the reaction, and the structural changes involved in XerH activation.</p><p>Our wild-type XerH-difH synaptic complex structure reveals a cleavage-incompetent conformation with almost straight DNA that has never been observed for tyrosine recombinases before. This structure shows that conformational changes are required for recombination activation, and suggests that an external factor may be required to facilitate the transition. Based on published evidence that XerH recombination requires FtsK in H. pylori (Debowski et al., 2012) and by analogy with the XerC/D system, it seems reasonable to predict that the need for this conformational change may be key to the regulation of Xer proteins, and that FtsK may be directly involved in facilitating this transition. While this model requires further validation, our structure will help to create testable experimental hypotheses.</p><p>We also present a post-cleavage XerH-difH synaptic complex structure (trapped using nicked suicide DNA substrates). This structure resembles previously reported post-cleavage structures of other tyrosine recombinases with strongly bent DNA, confirming that the chemistry of catalysis by Xer proteins likely resembles canonical tyrosine recombination. Comparison of our pre- and post-cleavage structures also illustrates the structural rearrangements required for activation of Xer recombination. Unexpectedly, these changes include a major rearrangement of the intermolecular protein interfaces and significant DNA bending. This is consistent with previously published smFRET data (Zawadzki et al., 2013, see below), and supports the idea that pre-formed Xer recombinase synaptic complexes can be remodeled without energetically inefficient disassembly and reassembly of the complex.</p><p>Our structures also show that strong DNA bending is not necessarily concomitant with synaptic complex assembly in tyrosine recombination, at least for the XerH-difH system.</p><p>Our structural and biochemical data reveal how a small asymmetry in the <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> site helps to establish correct ordering of strand cleavages and ligations in recombination by the homomeric Xer recombinase XerH.</p><p>Modeling extends our data to the prototypical XerC/D system, indicating that the XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> structures provide a useful resource for understanding other Xer recombinases.</p><p><italic>1) The paper overreaches in trying to reinforce the biological significance of the work. In the Abstract for example, the statement that the work will &quot;open up new avenues towards the antibacterial treatment&quot; is far-fetched. The same applies to the statement (in the Abstract and elsewhere) that the work provides mechanistic insight into the action of FtsK in stimulating the reaction. Similar overreach is present in the Discussion. In general, statements relating to how FtsK activates Helicobacter Xer recombination or how the present study will aid drug discovery should be downplayed, as there are no direct experiments or data that relate to these points. Relevant to the FtsK, would it be appropriate to bring up and cite the subsequent Zawadzki work (May et al. 2015) on FtsK activation as monitored in single-molecule FRET.</italic> </p><p>In accord with the comments of the reviewers, we have removed all the comments regarding the potential use of our structures for antibiotic discovery. We have also rephrased the text referring to FtsK activation of Xer recombination, to clarify how far our data go and where hypothesis starts.</p><p>We do however maintain that our structural and biochemical data provide some important insights into the activation of XerH recombination by FtsK. First, our observations that wild-type XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> synaptic complexes assemble in a cleavage-incompetent conformation and that XerH alone is unable to cleave wild-type DNA substrates in vitro indicates that the help of an external factor is needed for activation. In agreement with this idea, literature evidence from Debowski et al., 2012 showed that XerH recombination is critically dependent on FtsK in <italic>H. pylori</italic>, and strains lacking the C-terminal part of FtsK show a strong filamentous phenotype and no detectable XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> recombination. Therefore, it seems reasonable to presume that FtsK activates XerH in vivo in <italic>H. pylori,</italic> as <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK activates XerC/D-<italic>dif</italic> recombination in <italic>E. coli.</italic> Second, comparison of the inactive XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> pre-cleavage complex with our activated post-cleavage complex structure indicates that XerH activation involves large conformational changes in pre-formed synaptic complexes. This is also in line with smFRET data reported by Zawadzki et al., 2013 and Diagne et al., 2014 for XerC/D-<italic>dif</italic> complexes.</p><p>Thus, we predict that FtsK is directly involved in activating XerH in <italic>H. pylori</italic>, probably via facilitating the conformational changes observed in our structures. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that our data do not provide clear-cut evidence for the exact function of FtsK, and do not address exactly how FtsK acts on the molecular or structural level. Insights into these questions will require further investigations, and we have now clarified this further in the manuscript (Discussion section).</p><p>Reference to May et al., 2015 has been added (Introduction section).</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>.

If the authors still wish to focus on the importance of FtsK in activating Xer recombination, this is an important experiment. If it is FtsK-dependent, is this expected given the differences between Helicobacter FtsK and E. coli FtsK (and would one expect Helicobacter Xer to be acted on by E. coli FtsK, if indeed this is the case?). Some comment on this question is needed.</italic> </p><p>The experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> used a standard <italic>E. coli</italic> lab strain with wild type FtsK. To check if XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> recombination was dependent on <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK in this assay, we tested recombination in the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain DS9041, which lacks the C-terminal part of FtsK (FtsK-C) (kindly provided by Prof. Dave Sherratt). Note that full deletion of FtsK is lethal and cannot be used in these assays, but FtsK-C deletion was previously shown to be sufficient to abolish XerC/D activation (<italic>Recchia et al., 1999; Steiner et al., 1999</italic>). Plasmid-based intramolecular XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> recombination assays in this strain showed similar levels of <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>-galK-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> cassette excision as was observed in the wild-type strain, suggesting that deletion of FtsK-C does not affect this reaction.</p><p>Chromosome resolution by XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> recombination in its native <italic>H. pylori</italic> is known to require FtsK (<italic>Debowski et al., 2012</italic>). So, to check if chromosome dimer resolution by XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> recombination can occur in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we replaced the <italic>dif</italic> site of the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome with <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>-Km and supplemented this strain with an XerH expression plasmid. This showed a phenotype consistent with loss of chromosome dimer resolution (~10% of elongated <italic>E. coli</italic> cells that are unable to divide), irrespective of the presence or absence of <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK-C. This showed that XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> recombination on chromosomes is compromised in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK cannot fully complement for the function of <italic>H. pylori</italic> FtsK. These results are consistent with previous reports showing that the Xer-FtsK interactions can be species-specific (<italic>Yates et al. 2003</italic>).</p><p>The fact that we still observe detectable levels of intramolecular XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> recombination on plasmid-borne <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>-galK-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> cassettes in <italic>E. coli</italic> may be due to the high sensitivity of this assay (using a protein overexpression plasmid and multi-copy reporter plasmids), or it may indicate that factors other than <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK-C (e.g. DNA bending by supercoiling, or other <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins) can activate XerH in this setting. However, elucidating the exact function of <italic>H. pylori</italic> FtsK and the effects of other interaction partners on XerH recombination requires further investigations, which are beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and the associated text, there is a problem with the proposal that the binding of the two recombinases to dif is temporally sequential in a mechanistic sense.

For the benefit of the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, however, we prefer to keep this model figure separate from the other data figures.</p><p><italic>4) The evidence that XerH does not cleave linear dif sites shown in supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> seems weak. E. coli XerCD can cleave dif sites</italic> in vitro <italic>and</italic> in vivo <italic>in the absence of FtsK, but this cleavage is non-productive (XerC generates and resolves HJs or cleaves and re-ligates; XerD is inactive).

The authors have made the opposite assignment in their model of XerC/XerD/dif shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which is consistent with current views that XerD catalyzes the first strand exchange when activated by FtsK. However, this assignment implicitly assigns XerD half to be the more active one, based on the data presented. The synaptic complex structure determined in this work might instead correspond to the alternative 'XerC cleavage' synaptic complex: the one that undergoes futile cycling. The reaction schematic shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> implies that the more reactive dif half-sites initiate strand exchange (with the help of FtsK) and the inactive half-sites resolve the HJ intermediate, based on the structural models and biochemistry presented. This is the opposite of the currently favored mechanism for E. coli Xer/dif recombination. Please comment on this point.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the referee that assignment of XerC and XerD to the individual XerH subunits in our XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> synaptic complexes is ambiguous. Our XerH cleavage experiments might indeed be reporting on âfutile cyclingâ by the subunit bound at the left arm and we cannot fully exclude the possibility that our structures reflect a âfutile cyclingâ state. However, we note that currently there is no evidence that XerH is subject to the same âfutile cyclingâ mechanism as the XerC/D-<italic>dif</italic> system. (In fact, XerC/D itself is also not subject to this phenomenon when acting on plasmid-borne <italic>cer</italic> and <italic>psi</italic> sites.) Instead, our results indicate that while first XerH cleavage preferentially occurs on the left arm, resolution of a Holliday Junction substrate (mentioned in the Discussion section as âdata not shownâ) occurs by cleavage of the right <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> arm. Drawing analogy with the XerC/D-<italic>dif</italic> system, this observation would map XerC to the XerH subunit bound to the right arm (because it is XerC that resolves preformed HJ substrates with or without FtsK), and thus XerD to the left arm-bound subunit. This, together with the observed lack of cleavage on native (un-nicked) substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>), indicates that XerH might not be affected by futile cycling. Instead, XerH synaptic complexes appear to assemble directly in the correct configuration, but normally remain inactive in the absence of FtsK. Introduction of nicks in the DNA substrates might mimic the effect of FtsK, allowing activation of left arm cleavage as seen in our cleavage assays and the post-cleavage structure.</p><p>We now state this ambiguity and explain our choice for XerC/D assignment (subsection âModeling of E. coli XerC/D synaptic complex based on the XerH-difH structuresâ).</p><p><italic>5) The cleaved complex confirms that Xer enzymes proceed through a Cre-like pathway once activated, with sharply bend DNA arms, etc. Unfortunately, the structure has been symmetrized to be Cre-like, possibly masking asymmetric features that may be present. In particular, it may be difficult to conclude much from the inter-subunit interactions present, since the asymmetries introduced by the right half-site have been lost. This point should be noted in the text.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate that our synaptic complex with symmetrized <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>LP might not fully reflect the subunit arrangement and interactions in the native XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> complex. However, we note that the overall structure of each XerH subunit and their interactions with the respective <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> DNA arms in the XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>LP complex and the XerH â native <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> (pre-cleavage) complex are very similar (see subsection âConformational rearrangements in the post-cleavage synaptic complexâ), suggesting that substrate symmetrization does not have a profound effect on the synaptic complex structure. We note that crystal structures of Cre/lox synaptic complexes also showed highly similar arrangements with symmetrized and native substrates (Guo et al. 1997, Guo et al. 1999, Ennifar et al. 2003). Moreover, we would like to emphasize that â despite the use of symmetrized substrates â the conformations of the two XerH subunits bound to the two arms of one difHLP site are quite different and the XerH-difHLP structure is actually âasymmetricâ in this sense (i.e. the complex has only dyad symmetry connecting the two difH sites across the synaptic interface; there is no symmetry connecting the protein molecules bound to two halves of one difHLP site). Since we observe very similar âasymmetryâ in the native pre-cleavage XerH-difH complex, this feature appears to be intrinsic to the natural system. We have now revised the text (last paragraph in subsection âConformational rearrangements in the post-cleavage synaptic complexâ) to make this clearer.</p><p><italic>6) The pre-cleavage complex was crystallized without divalent ions, at pH 5.5. The post-cleavage complex was crystallized at pH 7 in the presence of a high concentration of divalent ions. An alternative interpretation of the current results is that the observed structures reflect the crystallization conditions and that the synaptic complex is actually bent (to some extent) at netural pH with Mg<sup>2+</sup> present. The authors should address this alternative explanation in the paper.</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge that the crystallization conditions may have an influence. However, we have tested XerH activity under the exact crystallization condition used for the pre-cleavage complex (pH 5.5, no metal ions) and observe a good level of DNA cleavage with nicked DNA substrates, indicating that the crystallization conditions are not primarily responsible for the inactive conformational state we observe in our structure. In the Cre/<italic>lox</italic> system, both pre- and post-cleavage synaptic complexes invariably show a similar DNA bend and inter-subunit arrangement, irrespective of the crystallization conditions which included pH of 5 â 7.6 and various divalent ion (Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+)</sup> concentrations.</p><p><italic>7) The cooperativity of XerH binding to dif is actually very low, given the similar half-site vs. full site binding constants. The wording in the manuscript is somewhat misleading in this respect â it is surprising how low the cooperativity is, given the extent of inter-subunit interactions on a single dif site. The authors should report what this interaction surface is and discuss the lack of strong cooperative binding in light of the structure.</italic> </p><p>All binding constants mentioned in the manuscript were measured with full-length DNA substrates; the substrates <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>L and <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic>R contained random DNA sequence in place of the second <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> arm. Since these substrates can still bind two XerH subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3 âfigure supplement 1B-D</xref>) and all complex species were pooled for K<sub>D</sub> calculations, the reported values do not reflect true âhalf-siteâ binding constants. We apologize for this confusion, and have now revised the manuscript text to make this clear (subsection âdifH asymmetry dictates the order of binding and cleavage eventsâ).</p><p>To evaluate cooperativity, we have prepared Hill plots based on our EMSA data, by plotting the logarithm of the fractional binding of the DNA substrate, against the logarithm of the protein concentration. This gave a high value for cooperativity, in agreement with the very sharp transition of all unbound DNA to all bound (in dimeric complex) observed on our EMSA gels with native <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3 âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, high cooperativity was observed for XerC/D â <italic>dif</italic> binding (e.g. Cao et al., 1997 and Spiers and Sherratt, 1997), and is consistent with the extensive inter-subunit interactions observed in our structures (now reported in Discussion section paragraph four), as also pointed out by the referees. However, we are aware that the exact level of cooperativity cannot be evaluated from our data and have rephrased the corresponding sections in the text.</p><p><italic>8) It would be useful to report whether a bent, but un-nicked duplex substrate can be reconstructed (modeled) from the cleaved complex. This would indicate whether the higher energy bent form of dif is likely to resemble the cleaved configuration, or alternatively, whether the cleaved complex undergoes additional bending and subunit rotations that occur after cleavage has occurred.</italic> </p><p>We have performed the modeling as recommended, and find that the broken DNA strand can be joined in the cleaved complex structure with acceptable geometry, to reconstruct a bent but un-nicked substrate. However, the modeled DNA strand clashes with the protein in a loop region just before helix Î±N. This is now stated in the manuscript (paragraph two subsection âConformational rearrangements in the post-cleavage synaptic complexâ). This observation suggests that the protein might block proper bending of intact DNA, and changes in its conformation may be required to enable full DNA bending. Since the affected protein segment is closely connected to the catalytic tyrosine (on helix Î±N), its movement â perhaps facilitated by interactions with FtsK â may even explain the direct link between DNA bending and catalytic activation. Alternatively, cleavage might occur on partially bent DNA substrates, with additional bending occurring after cleavage. Interestingly, with the nicked substrates, the clash can be avoided thanks to the missing phosphate groups (see also our response to point 9).</p><p>While these hypotheses are intriguing, further experiments are required to evaluate the actual order of DNA bending and cleavage events.</p><p><italic>9) The authors suggest that the suicide substrates used are cleaved by XerH because the nicks facilitate the required bend. Usually, the energetic cost of DNA bending is mostly related to unstacking of the bases, which nicking does not solve. Do the current structures explain how the nicks might be specifically allowing higher cleavage for this system â e.g., through relieving a strained backbone configuration? Or are they simply allowing the cleavage product to accumulate? Is the structure of an XerH catalytic mutant bound to nicked dif sites expected to be bent?</italic> </p><p>Modeling of a putative bent, but un-cleaved XerH-<italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> complex (based on the post-cleavage complex structure as described in point 8) indicated that the DNA might have somewhat strained backbone geometry, and the DNA appears to clash with the protein at the phosphate group exactly one nucleotide downstream of the scissile phosphate. Thus, we believe that the nicks favor the bent DNA conformation (paragraph two subsection âConformational rearrangements in the post-cleavage synaptic complexâ) by helping to increase the flexibility of the DNA strands at the bending points and relieving the strained backbone conformation, and they may also help avoid unfavourable interactions with the protein upon DNA bending due to the absence of the phosphate implicated in the clash. Accordingly, we would expect a catalytic mutant XerH to bind to nicked <italic>dif<sub>H</sub></italic> substrate roughly in the same conformation as the wild type protein, with a sharp DNA bend.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>[â¦] 1) The models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> cause some confusion as to how the structures might be interpreted in light of the XerH mechanism. Please consistently draft these figures with the strand going from 5' [on the left] to 3' [on the right] placed on 'top' in each of the views [i.e. viewing from the minor groove side in each case]. The authors should also acknowledge that an alternative model is consistent with their data in which FtsK is required to make the alternative synaptic complex and/or explain why such a model isn't favored.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this comment and understand the reviewersâ concern regarding our drawings. Unfortunately, presenting the structures with viewing from the minor groove side would obscure visibility of important features of the structures (such as the DNA and the swapped C-terminal helix). Moreover, to conform with the previously published nomenclature of the <italic>difH</italic> arms we prefer to keep the âleft armâ on the left and the âright armâ on the right side in our figures. This means that the schematic models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> should be drawn with the strand going 3â to 5â on the top to be consistent with the structure figures. However, to address the reviewersâ concern and avoid confusion, we have now inverted the representation of the DNA sequence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (as well as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and in the figure supplements) so that it is now consistent with all other figures. In addition, we have clearly labeled both 5â and 3â ends of both strands on all DNA molecules in all drawings (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), and state the directionality of the DNA in the corresponding legends.</p><p>Concerning the possible alternative model for the role of FtsK, this possibility is now mentioned and discussed in the manuscript (<underline>Discussion section paragraph five</underline>).</p><p><italic>2) Subsection âModeling of E. coli XerC/D synaptic complex based on the XerH-difH structuresâ. In the absence of supporting data indicating that XerH will preferentially resolve HJs by bottom strand exchange, this claim should be removed.

Aside from the crystal structure reported here, there is other evidence that XerH/dif sites are assembled in an inactive synaptic complex in solution (e.g., Zawadzki et al. should be noted). Is there additional evidence for XerH/difH?</italic> </p><p>This point has now been noted in the text. For the XerH/difH system in particular, apart from our structural and biochemical data, we are not aware of any additional literature evidence showing that synaptic complexes initially assemble in an inactive conformation.</p><p><italic>4) Authors' response #1 and related manuscript sections. What is the evidence that XerH does not cleave dif sites</italic> in vitro<italic>? This has been a tricky issue in the field, since it is hard to distinguish cleavage followed by rapid ligation from lack of cleavage. Unless the authors can provide data (e.g., using 5'-bridging phosphorothiolates) that demonstrate lack of cleavage, it would be better to take the position that it is not yet clear whether cleavage occurs</italic> in vitro<italic>. It is also difficult to explain activity in E. coli with such a model. In contrast, the behavior is readily explained if XerH bound to the left end behaves like XerC (as in an alternative model). Related to this is the question of whether cleavage is required for stabilization of the synaptic complex, independent of FtsK. This is true of Î» int and several catalytic Cre mutants form much weaker synaptic complexes relative to wild-type Cre, suggesting that this could also be true in XerH as well. The nicked XerH/DNA complex also supports this idea. Thus, the synaptic complex structure observed for XerH could equally well represent a stable intermediate that can reach the transient bent configuration required for cleavage on its own. Please resolve/comment on this issue.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is concerned about the possibility of âfutileâ DNA cleavage and ligation in the XerH-<italic>difH</italic> system. We have no evidence that this occurs in the XerH-<italic>difH</italic> system, but we cannot exclude the possibility based on our data. We now discuss the alternative possibilities raised by the reviewers in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) Authors' response #6. The reviewers requested that the authors note the possibility that the synaptic complex structure may be influenced by crystallization conditions (low pH and/or lack of divalents). The authors acknowledge this in their response to reviewers, but do not appear to have modified the manuscript. Given that this structure is central to the authors' proposals for Xer recombination, the readers should be made aware that the conditions for the two structures are quite different. Please revise the manuscript accordingly.</italic> </p><p>We now point out the difference in crystallization conditions in the manuscript as requested.</p><p><italic>6) The authors note that several unbound Xer crystal structures show different domain relationships, but continue to promote the idea that a specific conformational change takes place upon DNA binding (as shown in the video). To echo the original review, it is unlikely that the XerD alone structure represents a true &quot;conformational intermediate,&quot; rather than just one of an ensemble of configurations present when Xer subunits are not bound to dif. The three Xer crystal structures in the PDB have their NTDs in completely different conformations. The ideas in the discussion and video illustrating that the NTD has to undergo a significant change when completing the clamp on the dif half-site was assumed many years ago by most people in the field and is true for all tyrosine recombinases. This point should clarified or else its discussion (and the movie) should be removed from the paper.</italic> </p><p>The respective discussion and movie have been removed in the current version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) The distinction between understanding the mechanism of recombination vs. regulation of this process is important, but not made clear (Abstract and Introduction section). The authors imply that the mechanism of XerC/XerD recombination is still unknown.</italic> </p><p>The last sentence of the Abstract has been rephrased to better distinguish between catalytic mechanism and its regulation; and the sentence that was in the Introduction has been deleted to avoid incorrect implications.</p><p><italic>8) Introduction paragraph six.

The current text is incomplete and in part misleading. In the absence of FtsK, HJs formed by XerC were detected in early work and this led to the hypothesis that the XerC active conformation formed preferentially and FtsK switched the conformation of an XerC active complex to one in which XerD was active. Single-molecule FRET experiments by Zawadzki and colleagues led to the different hypothesis that this is not the case; rather, the major synaptic complex that forms in the absence of FtsK is an 'XerD potentially active conformation,' which is catalytically dead. A small proportion of XerC active complexes nevertheless form and are responsible for the XerC HJs. Nevertheless, the dominant pre-active XerD synaptic complexes are the ones activated by XerD. This is consistent with the results here, but the historical development of these ideas should be explicitly chronicled.</italic> </p><p>We now describe the historical development of the available models for XerC/D activation in the current version of the manuscript as requested.
