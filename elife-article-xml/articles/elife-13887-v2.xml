lumens in glandular tissues during morphogenesis. Here, we show that the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-resident protein anterior gradient-2 (AGR2), a soluble protein-disulfide isomerase involved in ER protein folding and quality control, is secreted and interacts with the ECM. Extracellular AGR2 (eAGR2) is a microenvironmental regulator of epithelial tissue architecture, which plays a role in the preneoplastic phenotype and contributes to epithelial tumorigenicity. Indeed, eAGR2, is secreted as a functionally active protein independently of its thioredoxin-like domain (CXXS) and of its ER-retention domain (KTEL), and is sufficient, by itself, to promote the acquisition of invasive and metastatic features. Therefore, we conclude that eAGR2 plays an extracellular role independent of its ER function and we elucidate this gain-of-function as a novel and unexpected critical ECM microenvironmental pro-oncogenic regulator of epithelial morphogenesis and tumorigenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13887.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13887.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13887.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer cells multiply abnormally fast and therefore produce protein molecules faster than normal cells. To avoid becoming stressed by this overproduction, cancer cells make use of proteins that fold the new proteins inside the cell. One of these protein folders is called anterior gradient-2 (or AGR2 for short) and is produced at high levels in so-called epithelial cancers, such as breast and lung cancer.</p><p>Previous research has shown that AGR2 inside cancer cells can help them grow and survive and AGR2 can also be found outside cells, such as in the blood or the urine of cancer patients. Therefore some researchers have suggested that measuring the levels of AGR2 in bodily fluids may be a useful marker for detecting cancers. Fessart et al. hypothesized that – apart from becoming a promising diagnostic tool – the AGR2 protein itself, specifically when found outside cells, might make cancer cells more aggressive.</p><p>Fessart et al. used a range of techniques to test this hypothesis. For example, healthy lung cells and lung cancer cells were grown into miniature replicas of lung organs in the laboratory, and in a key experiment, AGR2 was added to the lung organoids grown from the healthy cells. The addition of AGR2 protein was enough to change the non-tumor organoids into tumor organoids and boosted their growth about ten-fold. Further experiments then revealed that AGR2 also makes cells more invasive and capable of moving, both important features of aggressive cancer cells.</p><p>Overall, Fessart et al. have proven that AGR2 is a signalling molecule found outside cancer cells that makes them more aggressive. In future, more research addressing how AGR2 achieves this may lead to new therapeutic strategies against some forms of cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13887.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13887.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>AGR2</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>organoids</kwd><kwd>protein disulphide isomerase</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fessart</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name><name><surname>Delom</surname><given-names>Frederic</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INCa_5869</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chevet</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Epithelial tumors secrete the ER-resident AGR2 in the extracellular matrix to function as a novel essential microenvironmental regulator of epithelial tissue architecture, which leads to tumorigenicity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well established that proper organization, maintenance, and function of the epithelial organs are largely ascribed to cell-cell adhesion and polarization of epithelium and its interaction with extracellular matrix (ECM). Apical-basal polarity is a fundamental feature of epithelial cells required for cell division, differentiation and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Arumugam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nelson, 2009</xref>). Polarization is initiated by signaling from cell-to-cell and cell-to-ECM contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nelson and Bissell, 2006</xref>). Polarization of epithelial cells is implicit for the development of lumens, which are essential for glandular tissues to carry out their normal functions. Conversely, loss of tissue organization is among the earliest hallmarks of epithelial cancer. Therefore, understanding mechanisms of lumen and apical surface formation will improve future prospects for therapy.</p><p><italic>Anterior gradient 2 (AGR2)</italic> encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein mainly expressed in epithelial cells in human. Enhanced intracellular AGR2 (iAGR2) expression is observed in many cancers (reviewed in Ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chevet et al., 2013</xref>]). Previously, we have demonstrated that iAGR2 overexpression could represent a mechanistic intermediate between endoplasmic reticulum quality control (ERQC) and tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chevet et al., 2013</xref>). In such model, increased iAGR2 expression could enhance ER protein homeostasis/proteostasis thereby allowing tumor cells to cope with abnormal protein production and secretion and contributing to the aggressiveness of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higa et al., 2011</xref>). The latter was demonstrated using both in vitro and in vivo approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chevet et al., 2013</xref>). Although the iAGR2-mediated ER proteostasis control model is appealing, it was also observed that in cancer, AGR2 was present in the extracellular space, serum, and urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2011</xref>), thereby opening other avenues for its role on tumor microenvironment. Despite the detailed characterization of its intracellular function, the physiological role of extracellular AGR2 (eAGR2) remains unknown. AGR2 is a Protein-Disulfide Isomerase (PDI), PDIA17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Persson et al., 2005</xref>), and although the intracellular roles of PDIs have been well documented, some of these proteins were also found in the extracellular milieu, with unclear functions. For instance, we have previously shown that PDIA2 is secreted into the lumen of the thyroid follicles by thyrocytes to control extracellular thyroglobulin folding and multimerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delom et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delom et al., 2001</xref>). Further, PDIA3 was found to be secreted and to interact with ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dihazi et al., 2013</xref>) and QSOX1 was reported to participate in laminin assembly thereby controlling ECM functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ilani et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We and others, have recently demonstrated that epithelial organization and many physiological cell-cell and cell-ECM contacts, cellular polarity, and secretory functions are preserved in epithelial organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fessart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimlin et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, to address whether eAGR2 could act as a pro-oncogenic molecule in the ECM, we have used our human epithelial organoid model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fessart et al., 2013</xref>). We demonstrate, for the first time, that eAGR2 plays an extracellular role independent of its ER function and we elucidate this gain-of-function as a novel and unexpected critical ECM microenvironmental pro-oncogenic regulator of epithelial morphogenesis and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AGR2 overexpression in human lung adenocarcinoma correlates with poor clinical outcome</title><p>To evaluate the correlation between AGR2 expression levels and lung cancer, we monitored AGR2 endogenous expression in a panel of human lung bronchial epithelial cell lines. High AGR2 expression was only observed in lung tumor cell lines (A549, H23, H1838) compared to a non-tumorigenic human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Moreover, the expression pattern of AGR2 in tumor and non-tumor bronchial organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) was similar to that observed in 2D culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunohistochemistry of AGR2 in a cohort of 34 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) revealed that AGR2 was overexpressed in tumors compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Consequently, AGR2 expression was increased in NSCLC tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and was essentially restricted to type II pneumocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We then used a log-rank test with Kaplan–Meier estimates to analyze the cohort in order to stratify patient samples as having high, low/intermediate AGR2 expression status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). High AGR2 expression correlated with low survival rate and the low/intermediate AGR2 expression with high survival rate in NSCLCs patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Hence NSCLC patients can be sorted into poor and good prognosis groups as a function of high or low/intermediate AGR2 expression levels, respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrate in vitro and in vivo correlations between AGR2 expression levels and lung cancer, suggesting a function for this protein in tumor development, progression and aggressiveness.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13887.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AGR2 is overexpressed in lung cancer cell lines and tumor tissues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis by immunofluorescence of AGR2 expression in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) and three lung cancer cell lines (A549, H23 and H1838) grown in 2D culture.

First, we monitored the efficacy of AGR2 depletion using immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D,G</xref>) and Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E,H</xref>). Cell growth was strongly inhibited in Sh-AGR2 cells compared to control cells (Sh-ctl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,F,I–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) with no cell death detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Interestingly, soft-agar colony formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L–N</xref>) (used as indicator of malignant transformation) significantly reduced upon AGR2 silencing in adenocarcinoma cell lines, thereby indicating that AGR2 may favor tumor progression by increasing anchorage-independent growth. To further characterize the role of AGR2 in cancer, we assessed the impact of AGR2 depletion using the 3D human bronchial organoids system which we previously established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fessart et al., 2013</xref>). AGR2 silencing dramatically decreased the formation of tumor organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). To determine whether AGR2 is required for tumor progression in vivo, we then evaluated the in vivo tumorigenic potential of Sh-ctl and Sh-AGR2 cells using two different adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549 and H1838), following tail vein injection in immunodeficient mice. Sh-ctl mice presented large metastases that were easily detected at the surface of the lungs compared to mice injected with Sh-AGR2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>). Moreover, AGR2 depletion significantly reduced total metastasis number (by ~50%) in both A549-Sh-AGR2 and H1838-Sh-AGR2 injected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,G</xref>).

AGR2 protein was immunoprecipitated from both intracellular and extracellular organoid extracts and analyzed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In adenocarcinoma organoids (H23), we found ~20% of eAGR2 and ~80% of iAGR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), while in non-tumor organoids (HBEC-EV), AGR2 protein was exclusively intracellular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, AGR2 overexpression in non-tumor organoids (HBEC-AGR2) forced the secretion of eAGR2 (~30% in the extracellular medium) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Next, to test if the distribution of AGR2 could modify other components of the secretory pathway, a ratiometric comparison of both BiP and CANX was performed in tumor organoids (Sh-ctl) as compared to tumor organoids silenced for AGR2 (Sh-AGR2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Results showed that of AGR2 depletion had no impact on BiP and CANX expression. Similarly, we found no difference in the expression of BiP and CANX between non-tumor organoids overexpressing AGR2 (HBEC-AGR2) or not (HBEC-EV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5-—figure supplement 1B</xref>) indicating that the secretory pathway was not altered upon changes in AGR2 expression. To further correlate the amount of AGR2 produced by tumor organoids to the capacity of cancer cells to secrete eAGR2, we transiently blocked protein synthesis using a cycloheximide (CHX) pulse-chase approach and evaluated the amounts of iAGR2 and eAGR2 in tumor organoids. After 8 hr of CHX treatment, eAGR2 was practically undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–H</xref>), whereas ~60% of iAGR2 was still present. These results demonstrate that CHX treatment significantly reduces AGR2 protein synthesis which impacts on AGR2 protein secretion. Indeed, extracellular AGR2 rapidly disappeared from the culture medium through yet unknown mechanisms and became undetectable within 8 hr of CHX treatment, due to the attenuated iAGR2 synthesis and the subsequent reduction of the secreted pool. Although we have not yet identified the mechanisms by which eAGR2 disappears from the medium, several hypothesis could be postulated concerning its extracellular fate. As such the secreted protein could be i) trapped in the ECM and become unavailable as a free protein in the medium; ii) aggregated and therefore remain in the unsoluble fraction before biochemical analysis; iii) degraded by extracellular proteases released by the cell or even iv) internalized by the cells and degraded through an endolysosomal pathway. Thus, the precise mechanisms by which eAGR2 disappears remain to be further investigated.</p><p>Recently, AGR2 was demonstrated to be O-glycosylated upon secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarke et al., 2015</xref>). Protein O-GlcNAcylation was examined in non-tumor organoids overexpressing AGR2 (HBEC-AGR2) or not (HBEC-EV) following eAGR2 immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In intracellular organoid extracts, similar O-GlcNAc levels were observed between HBEC-EV and HEBC-AGR2 organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and, as expected, the presence of AGR2 was only detected in HEBC-AGR2 organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In the extracellular medium from HEBC-AGR2 organoids, eAGR2 was detected but it was not O-glycosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5-—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>In our experimental system, we found that in contrast to BiP, AGR2 was secreted in the extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). This questioned the accessibility of the ER-retention motif present on AGR2, namely the KTEL sequence. Although AGR2 KTEL was described to bind to KDELR1 and to a lesser extent to KDELR2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Alanen et al., 2007</xref>), the secretion of AGR2 might indicate a mechanism specific to this protein. Structural analysis of AGR2 showed that the KTEL motif stemmed out of the core protein and had no interaction with the rest of the protein. The protein backbone is displayed as 'tube' model with the atoms in the KTEL sequence shown in stick format (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Residue interactions within the KTEL motif are seen more clearly: the NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group of K172 forms a very clear salt bridge to the C-terminal carboxylic group of L175, which yields a stable 'hook' shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, bottom panel). Thus, it appears that the KTEL motif really stands out of the core protein and is accessible to bind to its receptors. To explore the functional significance of the KTEL motif for the AGR2 secretion, HEK-293T cells which do not secrete AGR2, were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–K</xref>). HEK-293T cells were transfected with different AGR2 mutant constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>) in which the KTEL motif was mutated to either KDEL, K172D, K172A or a STOP was inserted before the KTEL (ΔKTEL) and the secretion of AGR2 protein was assessed by the presence of AGR2 protein in the extracellular medium. The eAGR2 levels in cells expressing the AGR2 mutants, in the extracellular milieu, were at least equal to that observed in cells expressing wild-type AGR2. Therefore, none of our different KTEL motif mutants displayed a specific intracellular localization and all were secreted.</p><p>Collectively, our results demonstrate that eAGR2 protein is secreted in the extracellular medium, independently of its KTEL motif and most likely as a soluble protein (eAGR2). AGR2 secretion results from high iAGR2 expression levels and is not a consequence of cell death or 'leak' of ER proteins into the extracellular medium.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The secreted eAGR2 interacts with <italic>extracellular matrix</italic> (ECM)</title><p>Several secreted PDIs were shown to interact with ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dihazi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ilani et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized, in a similar manner, that eAGR2 could interact with the ECM. To investigate the interaction between ECM and eAGR2, HBEC cell-derived ECM was purified from HBEC cells overexpressing AGR2 (HBEC-AGR2) or not (HBEC-EV). Since the synthesis and organization of ECM increases with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rashid et al., 2012</xref>), ECM was isolated after 8 days of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). Western blotting revealed the presence of the ECM component laminin in both HBEC-EV and HBEC-AGR2 cell-derived matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>), however AGR2 was only detected in the ECM derived from HBEC-AGR2 cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). To further confirm that eAGR2 interacts with the ECM, immunofluorescence analysis of ECMs from HBEC-EV and HBEC-AGR2 cells was performed. ECM from both cell types stained positive for laminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>). As expected, immunofluorescence staining for AGR2 revealed the presence of eAGR2 in the ECM of HBEC-AGR2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>, lower panels). These results demonstrate the presence of eAGR2 in the ECM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Extracellular AGR2 has a physiological function in epithelial organoid formation</title><p>Given that eAGR2 is secreted by tumor organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and that AGR2 has been reported in the serum of cancer patients with an average level of eAGR2 ranging from 0.5 to 20 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), we assessed whether eAGR2 might exhibit specific extracellular functions. To this end, we used different adenocarcinoma cell lines depleted for AGR2 (A549-Sh-AGR2, H23-Sh-AGR2 and H1838-Sh-AGR2). Remarkably, the addition of recombinant human AGR2 (40 ng/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>) to the medium of AGR2-depleted tumor cell lines reversed the cell growth inhibition induced by AGR2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Indeed, the carboxyl-terminal KTEL domain is required for intracellular AGR2 enzymatic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>). Remarkably, the addition of the human recombinant AGR2-ΔKTEL (40 ng/ml) to the extracellular medium of AGR2-depleted organoids was still able to restore the formation of tumor organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Therefore, the KTEL motif is not necessary for eAGR2 extracellular activity.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether eAGR2 could play a direct extracellular role through its thioredoxin-like domain (CXXS motif) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). To this end, we purified recombinant human AGR2-AXXA, the inactive form of AGR2 thioredoxin-like domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G–J</xref>). AGR2-AXXA mutant, in the ECM of AGR2-depleted organoids, did not restore the formation of tumor organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, the AGR2-AXXA mutant might be improperly folded as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>. The sequence C81-S84 is a loop connecting a β-sheet strand with an α-helix. The mutation to A could affect the structure, since we thereby loose the key interactions stabilizing the 'folding'/closure of that loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). S84 forms strong hydrogen bonds to both the carboxylic acid of D79 and the backbone carbonyl of L78 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we used another inactive form of AGR2 thioredoxin-like domain, the AGR2-SXXS mutant. In contrast to the AGR2-AXXA mutant, AGR2-SXXS mutant restored the formation of AGR2-depleted tumor organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). These results show that the single cysteine residue in the AGR2 thioredoxin-like domain is not essential for the formation of tumor organoids. To further assess the redox function of eAGR2 in such process, we treated tumor organoids depleted in AGR2 (H23-Sh-AGR2) with dithiothreitol (DTT) at a concentration of 5µM and no cell death was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The addition of DTT to the medium of AGR2-depleted H23 cells neither reversed the cell growth inhibition induced by AGR2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) nor restored the formation of tumor organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Thus, these results demonstrate that treating cells with reducing agent cannot mimic the effects of eAGR2.</p><p>We next investigated the effects of eAGR2 in non-tumorigenic HBEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). As expected, eAGR2 enhanced organoid growth ten-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). To determine whether eAGR2 acts through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism, conditioned media from HBEC cells stably infected with empty vector (HBEC-EV) or overexpressing AGR2 (HBEC-AGR2) were added to HBEC organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). Conditioned media from control (HBEC-EV) did not significantly stimulate the formation of HBEC organoids. In contrast, conditioned media from HBEC-AGR2 stimulates the formation of non-tumorigenic organoids eight-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). This demonstrated that eAGR2 secreted by organoids and the bacterially expressed human recombinant AGR2 are both active and have the same role on the organoid growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–L</xref>). Next, to confirm that eAGR2 achieved its functions through an autocrine/paracrine manner, we explored the functional effect of the AGR2-ΔKTEL protein, which is secreted and not retained by the KDEL receptors of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>), on non-tumorigenic organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>). HBECs were infected with either empty vector (HBEC-EV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>) or AGR2-ΔKTEL containing vector (HBEC-AGR2-ΔKTEL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>). AGR2-ΔKTEL overexpression increased the formation of organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>), thereby confirming that the expression of AGR2 dictates organoid-initiating frequency through an autocrine/paracrine manner. These results demonstrate that eAGR2 extracellular functions were independent of its thioredoxin-like domain and occurred through an autocrine/paracrine manner on organoid-initiating frequency, a phenotype of transformed tumor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Extracellular AGR2 disrupts epithelial cell polarity and lumen formation</title><p>Confocal microscopy analysis of non-tumorigenic HBEC organoids was then used to further evaluate the impact of eAGR2 on organoid architecture. We showed that eAGR2-induced re-distribution of polarization markers using confocal microscopy in HBEC organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref> (bottom and right panels), the apical marker GM130 was randomly distributed throughout the HBEC organoids in presence of eAGR2 in the ECM, in contrast to its restriction to the apical localization in HBEC organoids in the absence of eAGR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref> (top and left panels). Fluorescence intensity cross-section profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) revealed that the intensity of GM130 (green) had two side peaks that referred to the control HBEC organoid shell (- eAGR2). In presence of eAGR2, GM130 distributed randomly within the HBEC organoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Similarly, control HBEC organoids exhibited a lumen lined by the tight junction marker ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>; top and left panels), whereas ZO-1 was no longer restricted to the lumen compartment upon eAGR2 exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>; bottom and right panels). Thus, eAGR2 in the ECM, resulted in a disruption of apicobasal polarity, of non-tumorigenic organoids. Therefore, we hypothesize that eAGR2 determines the orientation of epithelial polarity and thereby lumen formation. Hence, we next investigated the development of lumen in HBEC organoids, in the absence (- eAGR2) or in the presence (+ eAGR2) in the ECM of eAGR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–G</xref>) using apical F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>). The presence of eAGR2, at the time of plating, gave rise to organoids unable to form a lumen (+ eAGR2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–G</xref>) thereby showing that eAGR2 interferes with the formation of hollow organoid.

To our knowledge, this is the first time eAGR2 is characterized in the epithelial tissue morphogenesis and tumorigenesis, and this information will increase our understanding of the biological and physiological properties of AGR2 in this field. Studies in the last decade demonstrated that despite the integrity of its KTEL signal (ER retention motif) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>), the ER-resident AGR2 is secreted in various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chevet et al., 2013</xref>). AGR2 is retained in the ER through a mechanism involving its KTEL motif and the three KDEL receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Alanen et al., 2007</xref>). To further support this aspect, we showed that AGR2 KTEL motif is accessible to bind to the KDEL receptors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that eAGR2 secretion is independent of the KTEL sequence and, is not a consequence of cell death or “leaky” release of ER proteins into the extracellular medium. Moreover, the secretory pathway was not dramatically altered upon exposure to eAGR2. Hence, our data show that the production of AGR2 is linked to the amount of secreted eAGR2. Recent studies have suggested that different affinities for the KDEL receptors may impact on subcellular distribution, the latter being dynamic and dependent on conditions such as cell density or growth media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alanen et al., 2011</xref>). This could explain how high levels of iAGR2 expression in cancer cells combined with higher cell density and/or altered growth media could impact on the amount and rate of eAGR2 secretion.</p><p>We observed that eAGR2, which is undetectable in the ECM of non-tumor organoid, is abundantly secreted by tumor organoids and is present in the ECM. Hence, these data suggest an important role for eAGR2 in controlling ECM functionality, and most likely in the remodeling of tumor microenvironment. A similar role was described for PDIA3 in remodeling of the ECM during renal fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dihazi et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, high levels of eAGR2 could directly contribute to the tumorigenecity of tumor cells. Indeed, AGR2 depletion in cancer cells significantly decreased tumor cell proliferation, suggesting that high levels AGR2 in tumor cells is important for sustaining tumor cell growth. This is consistent with the observation that conditioned media from cells silenced for AGR2 have a reduced ability to stimulate proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Arumugam et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, our data show that restoration of eAGR2 in the microenvironment of AGR2-knockdown tumor cells reversed AGR2 depletion-induced cell growth inhibition and thus indicate that the reduced cell proliferation induced by AGR2 depletion is most likely due to the reduction of eAGR2 in the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>To further document the biological function of eAGR2, we have used different human adenocarcinoma organoids genetically depleted for AGR2 and showed the decreased ability of cancer cells to form tumor organoids. This is independent of iAGR2 since the reduced tumor organoids formation in AGR2-depleted cells can be restored by addition of exogenous eAGR2. It has been reported that the carboxyl-terminal KTEL domain is specifically required for intracellular AGR2 enzymatic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>). Our data reveal that for the eAGR2 extracellular activity, the KTEL motif is not required. Remarkably,, tumor organoid formation was restored when AGR2-depleted tumor organoids were supplemented with AGR2-SXXS (thioredoxin inactive), but not in the presence of reducing agent This result suggests a protein-protein interaction between eAGR2 and ECM proteins and/or proteins involved in the control of cell adhesion and cell-matrix interaction in an AGR2 thioredoxin-like domain independent fashion. The interaction of AGR2 with several proteins involved in such processes has been described in the literature. Indeed, AGR2 was found to interact with DAG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fletcher et al., 2003</xref>), LYPD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Alanen et al., 2007</xref>), C4.4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arumugam et al., 2015</xref>), however the exact mechanisms by which AGR2 interacts with those proteins remains unclear and must be further investigated. Nevertheless, our data suggest that this occurs in a thioredoxin-like domain independent fashion. Therefore, our data demonstrate that eAGR2 drives tumor organoids formation, not by changing the redox nature of microenvironment but through its presence within the ECM. However, the precise mechanisms remain to be further investigated. Our experiments provide the first evidence that eAGR2 has a crucial biological function in the tumorigenesis of cancer cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that eAGR2 could be a pro-oncogenic protein secreted in the ECM.</p><p>To confirm that eAGR2 is indeed, an ECM microenvironmental pro-oncogenic protein, we investigated the effects of overexpressing AGR2 in human bronchial epithelial non-tumor cells. We found that overexpressing AGR2 enhanced cell proliferation and increased the formation of organoids. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the presence of eAGR2 in the ECM was sufficient to impact on cell’s autocrine/paracrine signaling to in turn enhance organoid-initiating frequency. Therefore, we investigated the pro-oncogenic mechanisms of eAGR2 in non-tumor organoids to mimic the conditions under which eAGR2 acts in vivo. In normal conditions, HBECs form polarized and spherical organoids with hollow lumens, however in the presence of eAGR2 in the ECM, these identical cells form large, non-polarized, undifferentiated organoids without lumen, therefore mimicking tumor organoids. Disruption of cell polarity and tissue organization is reported to be an important event for the initiation and progression of tumorigenesis. Hence, eAGR2 alone is sufficient to confer a tumorigenic phenotype in non-tumor organoids. We next examined the impact of eAGR2 on cell–cell adhesion and the development of invasive structures. We demonstrated that eAGR2: i) promotes a cell invasion phenotype characterized by the disruption of basal laminin and, ii) disrupts cell-cell contact characterized by the loss of E-cadherin, β-catenin and Laminin-V at the cell membrane. Adherens junctions represent a powerful invasion suppressor complex in normal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pećina-Slaus, 2003</xref>). Disruption of polarized tissue structure and induction of cellular invasion are accompanied by extensive remodeling of the cellular microenvironment (e.g. basement membrane degradation, disruption of cell-ECM interactions). In such context MMPs play critical roles as they stimulate tumorigenesis, cancer cell invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stallings-Mann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Arumugam et al., 2008</xref>). This is consistent with induction of MMP3 and MMP9 observed in eAGR2-treated non-tumor organoids. MMP9 may function to activate local growth factors, stimulate angiogenesis in vivo, and degrade the ECM during cell invasion, whereas MMP3 is critical for the cleavage of E-cadherin and is involved in promoting EMT and invasion in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fingleton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lochter et al., 1997</xref>). This is a mechanism through which eAGR2 may act to promote cell invasion. Moreover, eAGR2 triggers the induction of Vimentin and N-Cadherin. Expression of these mesenchymal markers, together with the loss of E-cadherin and β-catenin from cell–cell contacts, as well as the invasive behavior of the organoids suggests that the non-tumorigenic epithelial cells were converted from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype in presence of eAGR2 in their ECM. We also observed that eAGR2 induced the expression of other EMT-related genes. EMT is a hallmark of tumor progression associated with the acquisition of invasive and metastatic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Although it has been only correlated that AGR2 may stimulate EMT, it is intriguing to find that eAGR2 in ECM is sufficient by itself, to induce EMT in non-tumor epithelial cells. Together, our results indicate that eAGR2 is important for epithelial morphogenesis disruption and metastatic dissemination. Thus, these results provide new insight into the possible mechanisms through which AGR2 may function as a microenvironmental pro-oncogenic protein.</p><p>In conclusion, the findings from the present study demonstrate that eAGR2 is a microenvironmental regulator of epithelial tissue architecture, which has a role in the preneoplastic phenotype and thus, contributes to tumorigenicity in epithelial cells. Indeed, eAGR2 present in the ECM of non-tumorigenic organoids is sufficient, by itself, to disrupt cell polarization and organoid formation, thus leading to a disorganized phenotype with invasive properties. In epithelial cells, dynamic remodeling of the ECM is essential for the development and normal tissue homeostasis. However, loss of polarity and uncontrolled ECM remodeling leads to cancer. Together, our results highlight that eAGR2 represents a novel and unexpected microenvironmental signaling in the epithelial morphogenesis and tumorigenesis which might be explored for development of novel therapeutic strategies for epithelial cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, AGR2 knockdown and overexpression</title><p>Human normal bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) and lung cancer cells have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fessart et al., 2013</xref>).

Mice were followed weekly, and when tumors in any of the groups (mice injected with Sh-ctl or Sh-AGR2 cells) reached around 1 cm<sup>3</sup>, determined by palpation (at 2 weeks), all mice were killed, and their lungs were dissected and processed. A total of 44 mice (12 for each cell lines, A549 and H1838) were used for each condition (Sh-ctl and Sh-AGR2). All animal procedures met the European Community Directive guidelines (Agreement B33-522-2/ N°DIR 1322) and were approved by the ethical committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Tissue samples, immunohistochemistry and histopathological analysis</title><p>Samples of human lung cancer tissues were obtained from the Haut-Levêque University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and reviewed by expert pathologist in the field (H.

The number of human lung samples analyzed and their clinicopathological characteristics are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>. These procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Haut-Levêque University Hospital (NFS96900 Certification). Immediately after the surgical resection, tumor specimens were fixed for 24 hr in 10% buffered formaldehyde, dehydrated and routinely embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed using 4 µm sections. All staining procedures were performed in an automated immunostainer (Bond-III, Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, U.K) using standard reagents provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, after Bond Epitope Retrieval solution 2 (Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, U.K) antigen retrieval for 20 min, de-paraffinized sections were incubated with the anti-AGR2 (Abnova, clone 1C3) human monoclonal antibody at a 1:100 dilution for 15 min at room temperature. For visualization, the Bond Polymer Refine Detection kit (Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, U.K) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each immunohistochemical run contained an internal positive control (bronchiolar epithelium or type II pneumocytes) and an antibody negative control (buffer, no primary antibody). Sections were visualized with a Nikon-Eclipse501 microscope, and images were acquired using NIS-Elements F 3.00 System (Nikon Digital Sight). Immunohistochemical staining was scored by intensity using the following criteria: 0, no staining; 1, mild staining and 2, dark staining. Quantification was done using ImageJ software and analyzing 20 images (20X) per tumor. Tumors of at least six mice were used for quantification. The number of tumor foci was calculated from whole lung sections with a cut-off of &gt;0.32 mm for tumor nodule diameter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>Cells cultured on cover slips were fixed using 4% PFA in PBS for 15 min and then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100.

To purify ECM, cells were removed using the published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rashid et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, growth medium was aspirated and cells were washed with PBS. Cell-derived matrices were denuded of cells by dissolving the cell layer first with a solution of 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS and then with 25 mmol/L NH4OH in PBS, for 3 min each, followed by four washes with PBS. This ECM from HBECs in culture remained intact, firmly attached to the entire area of the tissue-culture dish and free of nuclear or cellular debris. Cell-derived matrices were recovered in Laemmli buffer by scraping, resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting. For immunofluorescence, cells were plated onto coverslips and grown for 8 days before preparing the cell-derived matrices as described above.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Johanna Ivaska as the Reviewing Editor and Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers considered the experiment to be well done and they appreciated the main novel observation: recombinant AGR2 is sufficient to confer proneoplastic phenotypes. Nevertheless, they found the current manuscript to be descriptive and concluded that further functional investigation is needed to clarify how the AGR2, especially the active thioredoxin-like domain (CXXS motif), can regulate the formation of tumor organoids, and how can eAGR2 in ECM enhance the organoid growth by ten-fold. It will also be important to address why is the single cysteine in the active site needed? A solid demonstration that eAGR2 is in ECM and not merely a part of the secretome is currently lacking.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to define what allows AGR2 to bypass retrieval by KDEL receptors, whether the amount and rate of secretion increase during tumor progression.</p><p>2) Related to these points:</p><p>What is the final concentration of AGR2 added to the medium? A titration curve is shown in supplementary material, but the concentration used in the experiments is not clearly indicated. Are they in the ranges found in patients?</p><p>Also, it would be important to address the following issues:</p><p>Is the KTEL still present and accessible in secreted AGR2?</p><p>Is it necessary for activity?</p><p>Is the T to D replacement in the C terminal tetrapeptide required for secretion?</p><p>3) In the Abstract and throughout the manuscript the authors present the eAGR2 as part of the ECM and in this context playing an important role as microenvironment pro-oncogenic regulator, but the experimental data supporting this statement are missing. The authors did not provide any evidence for the eAGR2 as part of ECM. The fact that the eAGR2 was identified in conditioned medium or secretome does not mean that is part of the ECM. The tissue staining did also not confirm the presence of AGR2 in ECM. There was no colocalization with ECM components in stained tumor tissue – this could be easily confirmed by co-staining with antibodies against ECM components. Co-IP could also be an alternative to prove that the eAGR2 is part of the ECM. And since there is no evidence that AGR2 is part of ECM, the data presented and their interpretation are less convincing.</p><p>4) To further clarify the mechanism, the organoid system can be exploited to address the following:</p><p>A) Recombinant AGR2 protein can mimic some of the effects on cell outcomes and an AXXA mutant is used as a negative control. The AXXA mutant might be unfolded or denatured and a better control for the CXXS mutant would be a SXXS mutant, not a AXXA mutant. Could this more subtle AGR2 mutant protein be purified and accessed? For example, the SXXS mutant might be active, meaning a protein-protein interaction (PPI), not redox, is driving this event. Can AGR2 function be replaced by chemical reductants like DTT? If so, then redox could be important. Perhaps both a PPI and redox are driving the signalling events. This can be addressed experimentally.</p><p>B) If authentic AGR2 can be detected in seasoned media, can this replace recombinant bacterially expressed AGR2 and/or can anti-AGR2 antibodies neutralize this effect?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13887.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors need to define what allows AGR2 to bypass retrieval by KDEL receptors, whether the amount and rate of secretion increase during tumor progression.</italic></p><p>To address this point, we have added new experimental data with AGR2 mutants which are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of the revised manuscript. As such, secretion experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 J-K</xref>) and cycloheximide pulse-chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 G-H</xref>) are now shown in the manuscript. This has allowed us to better define the mechanisms by which AGR2 could bypass KDEL receptors and be secreted in the extracellular medium.</p><p>The description of the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> can be found in the Results section of the revised manuscript, “To further correlate the amount of AGR2 produced by tumor organoids to the capacity of cancer cells to secrete eAGR2, we transiently blocked protein synthesis using a cycloheximide (CHX) pulse-chase approach and evaluated the amounts of iAGR2 and eAGR2 in tumor organoids. […] These results demonstrate that the iAGR2 expression increase in tumor organoids was causal to the secretion of eAGR2.”; and “To explore the functional significance of the KTEL motif for the AGR2 secretion, HEK-293T cells which do not secrete AGR2, were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J-K</xref>). […] Therefore, none of our different KTEL motif mutants displayed a specific intracellular localization and all were secreted.”</p><p>Moreover, we have added a section on this point in the revised Discussion as follows: “Studies in the last decade demonstrated that despite the integrity of its KTEL signal (ER retention motif) (Gupta, Dong, and Lowe 2012), the ER-resident AGR2 is secreted in various cancers (Chevet et al. 2013). […] This could explain how high levels of iAGR2 expression in cancer cells combined with higher cell density and/or altered growth media could impact on the amount and rate of eAGR2 secretion.”</p><p><italic>2) Related to these points:</italic> </p><p><italic>What is the final concentration of AGR2 added to the medium? A titration curve is shown in supplementary material, but the concentration used in the experiments is not clearly indicated. Are they in the ranges found in patients?</italic></p><p>The final concentration of AGR2 added to the medium is 40 ng/ml. This is now included in the Results section of the revised manuscript: “Remarkably, the addition of recombinant human AGR2 (40 ng/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-F</xref>) to the medium of AGR2-depleted tumor cell lines reversed the cell growth inhibition induced by AGR2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).”</p><p>Moreover, the concentration of eAGR2 that we used for our experiments is in the range of eAGR2 levels of present in the serum from cancer patients. This information has now been added in the Results section: “Given that eAGR2 is secreted by tumor organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and that AGR2 has been reported in the serum of cancer patients with an average level of eAGR2 ranging from 0.5 to 20 ng/ml (Chen et al. 2010), we assessed whether eAGR2 might exhibit specific extracellular functions.”</p><p><italic>Also, it would be important to address the following issues:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Is the KTEL still present and accessible in secreted AGR2?</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting point raised by reviewers. To address this issue, we have used structural data available to visualize the structure of the KTEL domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref> of the revised manuscript). This structural analysis (performed by Pr. Leif Eriksson (University Göteborg, Sweden), who is now listed as a co-author in the revised manuscript) led us to the conclusion that the KTEL motif is still present and accessible in secreted AGR2. This is now mentioned in the Results section of the revised manuscript, as follows: “This questioned the accessibility of the ER-retention motif present on AGR2, namely the KTEL sequence. […] Thus, it appears that the KTEL motif really stands out of the core protein and is accessible to bind to its receptors.”</p><p><italic>Is it necessary for activity?</italic> </p><p>To address this issue and as suggested by reviewers, we used the recombinant AGR2-△KTEL that lacks the KTEL motif and found that this mutant keeps its ability to stimulate organoid growth. Hence, the KTEL motif is not necessary for its activity.</p><p>These results are now presented in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and in the Results section as follows: “We next tested whether the extracellular role of eAGR2 requires the presence of the KTEL motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). […] Therefore, the KTEL motif is not necessary for eAGR2 extracellular activity.”</p><p>Moreover, we have also discussed these data in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript, as follows: “It has been reported that the carboxyl-terminal KTEL domain is specifically required for intracellular AGR2 enzymatic function (Gupta, Dong, and Lowe 2012). Our data reveal that for the eAGR2 extracellular activity, the KTEL motif is not required.”</p><p><italic>Is the T to D replacement in the C terminal tetrapeptide required for secretion?</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have measured the secretion capacity of AGR2-KTEL as compared to AGR2-KDEL and two others KDEL mutants (K to A or K to D). These experiments were performed by Dr. Tony Avril (Inserm, Rennes, France), who is now listed as a co-author in the revised manuscript. Our data show that the replacements of T to D, K to A or K to D in the carboxyl-terminal KTEL sequence still allowed AGR2 secretion.</p><p>These new results are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of the revised manuscript and described in the Results section as follows: “To explore the functional significance of the KTEL motif for the AGR2 secretion, HEK-293T cells which do not secrete AGR2, were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J-K</xref>). […] Therefore, none of our different KTEL motif mutants displayed a specific intracellular localization and all were secreted.”</p><p><italic>3) In the Abstract and throughout the manuscript the authors present the eAGR2 as part of the ECM and in this context playing an important role as microenvironment pro-oncogenic regulator, but the experimental data supporting this statement are missing. The authors did not provide any evidence for the eAGR2 as part of ECM. The fact that the eAGR2 was identified in conditioned medium or secretome does not mean that is part of the ECM. The tissue staining did also not confirm the presence of AGR2 in ECM. There was no colocalization with ECM components in stained tumor tissue – this could be easily confirmed by co-staining with antibodies against ECM components. Co-IP could also be an alternative to prove that the eAGR2 is part of the ECM. And since there is no evidence that AGR2 is part of ECM, the data presented and their interpretation are less convincing.</italic> </p><p>We agree with reviewers that the proof that eAGR2 is part of the ECM needs to be established. As a consequence, new experimental data were added in the revised manuscript demonstrating that eAGR2 interacts with ECM proteins. To this end, two approaches were used including i) an ECM purification strategy and ii) immunofluorescence microscopy.</p><p>The method is now described in the revised Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript as follows: “To generate cell-derived matrices, HBECs were plated in 6-well plates and cultured for 8 days, changing the growth medium every two days. […] ECM was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and proceeds to immunofluorescence as described previously.”</p><p>The corresponding results are presented in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L-N</xref>. We have also added a new paragraph “The secreted eAGR2 interacts with extracellular matrix (ECM)”in the Results section: “Several secreted PDIs were shown to interact with ECM proteins (Dihazi et al. 2013, Ilani et al. 2013). […] As expected, immunofluorescence staining for AGR2 revealed the presence of eAGR2 in the ECM of HBEC-AGR2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>, lower panels). These results demonstrate the presence of eAGR2 in the ECM.”</p><p>We also added a paragraph about the implications of these data in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript as follows:“We observed that eAGR2, which is undetectable in the ECM of non-tumor organoid, is abundantly secreted by tumor organoids and is present in the ECM. Hence, these data suggest an important role for eAGR2 in controlling ECM functionality, and most likely in the remodeling of tumor microenvironment. A similar role was described for PDIA3 in remodeling of the ECM during renal fibrosis (Dihazi et al. 2013).”</p><p><italic>4) To further clarify the mechanism, the organoid system can be exploited to address the following:</italic> </p><p> <italic>A) Recombinant AGR2 protein can mimic some of the effects on cell outcomes and an AXXA mutant is used as a negative control. The AXXA mutant might be unfolded or denatured and a better control for the CXXS mutant would be a SXXS mutant, not a AXXA mutant. Could this more subtle AGR2 mutant protein be purified and accessed? For example, the SXXS mutant might be active, meaning a protein-protein interaction (PPI), not redox, is driving this event.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by reviewers, the AGR2-SXXS mutant was purified and tested on organoids from H23-Sh-AGR2 cells and compared to the effects yielded by wild type AGR2 (eAGR2). The thioredoxin active eAGR2 mutant restored the formation of tumor organoids. The corresponding results are now presented in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and in the Results section of the revised manuscript as follows: “However, the AGR2-AXXA mutant might be improperly folded as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>. […] These results show that the single cysteine residue in the AGR2 thioredoxin-like domain is not essential for the formation of tumor organoids.”</p><p>We also discussed these data in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript as follows:“Moreover, tumor organoid formation was restored when AGR2-depleted tumor organoids were supplemented with AGR2-SXXS (thioredoxin inactive), but not in the presence of reducing agent, suggesting a protein-protein interaction between eAGR2 and ECM proteins.”</p><p><italic>Can AGR2 function be replaced by chemical reductants like DTT? If so, then redox could be important. Perhaps both a PPI and redox are driving the signalling events. This can be addressed experimentally.</italic> </p><p>To address whether the redox function of AGR2 is important for its extracellular functions we assessed the effect of a chemical reductant (DTT), used at a final concentration of 5 µM, on organoid formation. We found that the addition of DTT to AGR2-depleted H23 organoids did not restore the formation of tumor organoids. The corresponding results are presented in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H-J</xref> and described in the Results section of the revised manuscript, as follows: “To further assess the redox function of eAGR2 in such process, we treated tumor organoids depleted in AGR2 (H23-Sh-AGR2) with dithiothreitol (DTT) at a concentration of 5µM and no cell death was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The addition of DTT to the medium of AGR2-depleted H23 cells neither reversed the cell growth inhibition induced by AGR2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) nor restored the formation of tumor organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Thus, these results demonstrate that treating cells with reducing agent cannot mimic the effects of eAGR2.”</p><p>This result is also discussed in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript, as follows:“Moreover, tumor organoid formation was restored when AGR2-depleted tumor organoids were supplemented with AGR2-SXXS (thioredoxin inactive), but not in the presence of reducing agent, suggesting a protein-protein interaction between eAGR2 and ECM proteins. Therefore, our data demonstrate that eAGR2 drives tumor organoids formation, not by changing the redox nature of microenvironment but through its presence within the ECM.”</p><p><italic>B) If authentic AGR2 can be detected in seasoned media, can this replace recombinant bacterially expressed AGR2 and/or can anti-AGR2 antibodies neutralize this effect?</italic></p><p>As suggested by reviewers, the ability of conditioned medium to replace bacterial recombinant on 3D cell growth in a paracrine/autocrine manner was examined and presented in in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>. Our results show that eAGR2 secreted by organoids in the conditioned medium is active and can replace the bacterial recombinant AGR2. This experiment is described in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript, as follows: “Stimulation with conditioned media: HBEC cells were seeded in 3D matrigel in the presence of conditioned medium from either HBEC-vector or HBEC-AGR2 cells grown in 2D. […] After 48 hours, the medium was changed to fresh diluted 1:3 with the conditioned medium. Ten days later, cell growth in 3D was performed as described previously.”</p><p>The results are also described in the Results section of the revised manuscript: “To determine whether eAGR2 acts through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism, conditioned media from HBEC cells stably infected with empty vector (HBEC-EV) or overexpressing AGR2 (HBEC-AGR2) were added to HBEC organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). […] This demonstrated that eAGR2 secreted by organoids and the bacterially expressed human recombinant AGR2 are both active and have the same role on the organoid growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K-L</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
