Although several genome-wide studies have focused on finding and locating enhancers in the genomes, the fundamental principles governing their internal architecture and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory grammar remain elusive. Here, we describe an extensive, quantitative perturbation analysis targeting the dorsal-ventral patterning gene regulatory network (GRN) controlled by <italic>Drosophila</italic> NF-κB homolog Dorsal. To understand transcription factor interactions on enhancers, we employed an ensemble of mathematical models, testing effects of cooperativity, repression, and factor potency. Models trained on the dataset correctly predict activity of evolutionarily divergent regulatory regions, providing insights into spatial relationships between repressor and activator binding sites. Importantly, the collective predictions of sets of models were effective at novel enhancer identification and characterization. Our study demonstrates how experimental dataset and modeling can be effectively combined to provide quantitative insights into <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory information on a genome-wide scale.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08445.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08445.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08445.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA contains regions known as genes, which may be “transcribed” to produce the RNA molecules that act as templates for building proteins and regulate cell activity. Proteins called transcription factors can bind to specific sequences of DNA to influence whether nearby genes are transcribed. For example, so-called enhancer regions of DNA contain several binding sites for transcription factors, and this binding activates gene transcription. Little is known about how the transcription factor binding sites are organized in enhancer regions, which makes it difficult to use DNA sequence information alone to predict the regulation of genes.</p><p>A transcription factor called Dorsal controls the activity of a network of genes that plays a crucial role in the development of fruit fly embryos. Dorsal binds to the enhancer region of a gene called <italic>rhomboid</italic>, which has been well studied and is known to be a fairly typical example of an enhancer region.</p><p>To understand the regulatory information encoded in the DNA sequences of enhancers, Sayal, Dresch et al. have now used a technique called perturbation analysis to investigate the interactions that are likely to occur between Dorsal and other transcription factors as they bind to the <italic>rhomboid</italic> enhancer. This technique involves systematically mutating the enhancer to remove different combinations of transcription factor binding sites and quantitatively investigating the effect this has on gene activity. A large set of mathematical models were then trained using this data and shown to correctly predict the activity of a range of other gene regulatory regions. The collective predictions of the models identified new enhancer regions and revealed details about how different types of transcription factor binding sites are arranged within enhancers.</p><p>As we enter an era where the DNA sequences of entire human populations are increasingly accessible, we would like to know the functional significance of changes in gene regulatory regions. Sayal, Dresch et al. show that the regulatory properties of specific control proteins are accessible by employing quantitative experiments and mathematical models. Similar studies will be required to learn how mutations found across the genome may alter gene expression, leading to better diagnosis and treatment of disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08445.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08445.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>thermodynamic modeling</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>cis-regulatory grammar</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM056976</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arnosti</surname><given-names>David N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MSU Quantitative Biology Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dresch</surname><given-names>Jacqueline M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mathematical modeling of mutagenesis data for a suite of enhancers uncovers new relationships between the binding sites of transcription factors that help in genome-wide prediction of enhancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Developmentally expressed genes in metazoans are regulated by diverse <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, including distally-acting sequences termed enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith and Shilatifard, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heinz et al., 2015</xref>). Despite more than three decades of progress, surprisingly little is known about constraints on internal structural organization of binding sites ('grammar') within these elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dickel et al., 2013</xref>). Some enhancers show little evolutionary variation, and permit no change in transcription factor binding sites without catastrophic effects on function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thanos and Maniatis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Maniatis, 1997</xref>). Many developmental enhancers, however, demonstrate a more flexible deployment of binding sites, thus functionally conserved elements can exhibit a large degree of evolutionary variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junion et al., 2012</xref>). Although high-throughput studies have dramatically increased our knowledge of genome-wide transcription factor occupancy and transcript expression, we have a limited ability to interpret the functional relevance of quantitative aspects of protein binding or DNA sequence variation. A quantitative understanding of the internal enhancer grammar of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements will provide researchers with powerful tools to better understand the significance of genetic variation that is observed within and between species, critical for exploitation of burgeoning genomic resources. Thermodynamic models employ tools from statistical physics to model gene activity, providing a framework for understanding transcription factor interactions with specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bintu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ay and Arnosti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dresch and Drewell, 2012</xref>) Previous efforts at thermodynamic modeling in eukaryotic systems have demonstrated that diverse types of data can be fit, providing at least a qualitative level of prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zinzen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Segal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drewell et al., 2014</xref>). However, earlier studies relied on heterogeneous and low-resolution datasets, inherently limiting modeling effectiveness. In addition, few types of models were tested, reducing the chance that essential properties of transcription factor interactions will be captured.</p><p>Here, we tested the hypothesis that an in-depth and quantitative analysis of key transcriptional regulators on an archetypal enhancer would reveal common transcriptional behaviors of these proteins for genome-wide analysis. To harness the potential of thermodynamic modeling approaches, we developed an in-depth enhancer perturbation analysis that takes advantage of the quantitative setting of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> blastoderm embryo. The <italic>rhomboid (rho</italic>) enhancer directs gene expression in the presumptive neuroectoderm under the control of the activator Dorsal, a homolog of NF-κB. The Twist activator and Snail repressor provide additional essential inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To extract fundamental information from this data set, we created and fit a comprehensive set of thermodynamic models designed to capture likely interactions between transcription factors as they interact with the enhancer. An extensive set of other coordinately-regulated Dorsal/Twist/Snail target genes was then used to assess the power of this modeling approach for interpretation of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08445.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental deep perturbation analysis of a neuroectoderm-specific enhancer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>rhomboid (rho</italic>) enhancer with footprinted Dorsal activator sites shown in green, Twist activator sites in yellow, and Snail repressor sites in red.

We systematically mutated all activator and repressor binding sites in <italic>rho</italic> neurectodermal enhancer, removing Dorsal or Twist sites individually or in pairs to diminish activation, and removing multiple Snail sites to reduce repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All 38 enhancers were cloned and integrated into the fly genome using a site-specific integration vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bischof et al., 2007</xref>). We measured the transcriptional output using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and confocal laser scanning microscopy, and analyzed gene expression data using an image-processing pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ay et al., 2008</xref>). Expression data from a total of 935 images - a minimum of ten embryos per construct - was normalized and combined to provide average expression patterns for each enhancer variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Mutation of any single Dorsal or Twist activator binding site resulted in a measurable reduction of peak intensity and retraction of the <italic>rho</italic> stripe from the dorsal region, where activators Dorsal and Twist are present in limiting concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liberman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rushlow et al., 1989</xref>). Strikingly, despite the differences in predicted binding affinities and relative positions of the motifs, the elimination of any site individually had similar quantitative effects, reducing gene expression to approximately 60% of the peak wild-type level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In contrast to this uniform picture, the impact of mutation of combinations of two Dorsal or Twist binding sites was highly variable, ranging from slightly lower expression to almost complete loss of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Overall, the double activator site mutagenesis revealed a complex picture of the contributions of activator sites to gene expression. We hypothesize that the variable effects of different pairwise mutations, as opposed to the rather similar effects of individual site loss, indicates that there are multiple and distinct thresholds for specific biochemical events occurring on the enhancer. In contrast to the perturbation of Dorsal and Twist elements, removal of Snail repressor binding sites revealed stark differences in the significance of individual motifs for overall activity. Mutation of all four Snail sites caused pervasive expression in the mesoderm, as expected, while constructs with a single intact Snail2 or Snail3 site showed substantial but not complete repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Snail1 and Snail4 motifs were not nearly as effective at mediating repression, although these have similar binding affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Snail4 and Twist2 sites overlap, which may impair Snail binding and reduce repression efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Thermodynamic modeling of <italic>rho</italic> enhancer perturbation dataset</title><p>Direct examination of the data described above showed that the inter-relationships among activator and repressor sites were complex, and mutant phenotypes were not simply additive. Such complexity is a familiar facet of <italic>cis</italic>-element mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Swanson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2012</xref>). To extract the non-intuitive, quantitative information about transcription factor function and interactions from these results, we created an extensive set of quantitative models. Based on the likely importance of cooperativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kazemian et al., 2013</xref>), we tested models that incorporated a variety of conceptions of distance-dependent homotypic and heterotypic cooperativity, as well as different distance-dependent 'quenching' or repressive interactions between repressors and activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Veitia, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wagner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kulkarni and Arnosti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnosti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barolo and Levine, 1997</xref>). We systematically tested continuous and step functions to determine possible distance relationships affecting interactions. In all, 15 formulations for cooperativity and eight formulations for quenching were employed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Combining these two types of formulations resulted in 120 different models, which were trained on the quantitative expression data of the 38 enhancer variants. Parameters were estimated using CMA-ES, a global genetic algorithm, and overall performance was calculated from the fit to all constructs, using root mean square error (RMSE) as the objective function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hansen et al., 2003</xref>). Examination of model performance at three levels – global RMSE, construct-by-construct RMSE, and specific portions of the expression patterns - provided complementary insights into the nature of how the training data are fit, and the potential utility of the models on other enhancer sequences.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08445.005</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Parameters in each model.

Paramters 16–23 reflect quenching – parameters 16–19 represent Snail quenching Dorsal (at 1–25 bp, 26–50 bp, 51–75 bp, and 76+ bp between bound proteins), likewise parameters 20–23 represent Snail quenching Twist.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08445.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08445.005</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th colspan="8" valign="top">Quenching Model</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cooperativity Model</td><td valign="top">Q1 – MSB (0)</td><td valign="top">Q2 – Linear (2)</td><td valign="top">Q3 – Logistic (2)</td><td valign="top">Q4 – Gaussian (2)</td><td valign="top">Q5 – Binned <break/>4_25 (8)</td><td valign="top">Q6 – Binned <break/>4_35 (8)</td><td valign="top">Q7 – Binned <break/>4_45 (8)</td><td valign="top">Q8 – Binned <break/>10_10 (20)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C1 – Linear (4)</td><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">27</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C2 – Logistic (4)</td><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">27</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C3 – Gaussian (4)</td><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">27</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C4 – Binned <break/>2_25 (4)</td><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">27</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C5 – Binned <break/>2_50 (4)</td><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">27</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C6 – Binned <break/>2_75 (4)</td><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">27</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C7 – Binned <break/>3_50 (6)</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">29</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C8 – Binned <break/>3_60 (6)</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">29</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C9 – Binned <break/>3_70 (6)</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">29</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C10 – Protein Binned <break/>2_25 (8)</td><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">13</td><td valign="top">13</td><td valign="top">13</td><td valign="top">19</td><td valign="top">19</td><td valign="top">19</td><td valign="top">31</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C11 – Protein Binned <break/>2_50 (8)</td><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">13</td><td valign="top">13</td><td valign="top">13</td><td valign="top">19</td><td valign="top">19</td><td valign="top">19</td><td valign="top">31</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C12 – Protein Binned <break/>2_75 (8)</td><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">13</td><td valign="top">13</td><td valign="top">13</td><td valign="top">19</td><td valign="top">19</td><td valign="top">19</td><td valign="top">31</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C13 – Protein Binned <break/>3_50 (12)</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">23</td><td valign="top">23</td><td valign="top">23</td><td valign="top">35</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C14 – Protein Binned <break/>3_60 (12)</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">23</td><td valign="top">23</td><td valign="top">23</td><td valign="top">35</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C15 – Protein Binned <break/>3_70 (12)</td><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">23</td><td valign="top">23</td><td valign="top">23</td><td valign="top">35</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>At a global level, the performance of the models was clearly co-dependent on both the cooperativity and repression formulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Overall cooperativity formulation performance varied according to the type of quenching formulation; the best quenching scheme for one cooperativity scheme was not necessarily optimal for other cooperativity schemes. Such interactive effects are likely a reflection of parameter compensation. Models with more parameters tended to outperform those with the fewest, as expected, but it was notable that this was not a strict correlation; the models with the most parameters were not as effective as those with fewer. Additionally, there were measureable differences between models with identical numbers of parameters, suggesting that the different formulation of the schemes was interrogating aspects of enhancer grammar critical for the <italic>rho</italic> enhancer variants we were fitting. Best overall fits were observed using a model with cooperativity values parameterized in three 'bins' of 60 bp (scheme C14) and quenching in four small 25 or 35 bp bins (schemes Q5 and Q6).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08445.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Performance of 120 thermodynamic models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heat map representation of results of thermodynamic modeling of <italic>rho</italic> perturbation dataset; the performance of each model is represented by a rectangle.

Compared to fitting on the complete data set, most models showed only a modest decrease in performance in predicting left out sets (left column, complete data set, right column, modeling on randomly selected partial data sets). In contrast, selective removal of specific data sets corresponding to one type of mutagenic perturbation (all constructs with mutation to Snail sites, all constructs with mutations to Dorsal sites, etc.) led to parameter sets that were generally significantly less able to fit left-out data (central column). The comprehensive perturbation of the different types of motifs on the enhancers was thus an essential aspect of good model fitting. The low-performing model C4Q4 actually performed better during cross-validation, likely because the parameters determined from the original run do not represent a global minimum.

Here, predictions for 38 constructs are plotted for the 24 models that were fit on a data set lacking all Snail mutant constructs.

The models, represented by rows, were ranked from best to worst based on global performance, and individual fits for each of the 38 <italic>rho</italic> enhancer variants were plotted in columns. The higher ranked models (blue rows) have generally lower RMSEs across all constructs, and groups of models with similar structures had similar patterns of better or worse performance on particular constructs. Some constructs were fit generally less well by most models. Those constructs containing the wild-type ensemble of activators (columns 1, 25, 28, 32) were among those that were less well fit than the bulk of constructs, from which we had removed activator sites; apparently the generally narrower neuroectodermal expression pattern of those constructs with some activator sites removed drove overall parameter fitting. Individual plots of the measured and predicted activity of individual enhancer modules show that some error arises from the models underestimating the activator potential specifically in more dorsal regions of the embryo, where activator concentration is limiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; e.g. construct 1: DMRW). The lower quality fit for these constructs does not represent a model failure; rather, these constructs are likely to be especially informative for activator function, and a modeling effort that entirely lacks these types of constructs would be more over-fit and less informative than the present one. Further examination of individual plots for specific genes provides additional insight into the nature of which features influence RMSE scores the most (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A top-ranking model (C14Q5) accurately captures high and low levels of Snail repression, deviating only in underestimating the expression of <italic>rho</italic> in regions most limiting for Dorsal and Twist. An intermediate-scoring model (C8Q7) was partially successful in capturing general trends of activation with occasional overestimation of activity. This model misestimated Snail repression in some cases as well. The lowest performing model (C4Q4) suffered from poor estimation in Dorsal/Twist activity, as well as a general absence of repression by Snail.</p><p>Thermodynamic models calculate protein occupancy on an enhancer using descriptions of binding preferences distilled from position weight matrices (PWMs), which can incorporate in vitro or in vivo protein-DNA interaction data. A number of studies have tested DNA-binding preferences of Dorsal, Twist, and Snail, therefore we tested the effects of different PWMs on model performance. Three similar but non-identical PWMs were tested for each factor, and all possible combinations of these PWMs were utilized in refitting the data set with a selection of 24 of the entire set of models, including most of the top performers. Overall ranks of model performance remained similar, although RMSEs were lowest using the PWM of Snail that was employed in the global analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; this PWM predicted all four sites previously identified by in vitro footprinting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, the biophysical information about protein-DNA interactions for the transcription factors in this system appears to be sufficiently complete to provide a robust platform for thermodynamic modeling.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08445.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effect of PWM settings on model performance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three versions of each binding site were considered as discussed in Materials and methods, drawing from previously reported in vitro or in vivo binding studies.

We used cross-validation, a statistical technique in which segments of the data set are left out during model fitting, to reveal possible overfitting, and determine the impact of certain portions of the data set on overall success in fitting. We performed cross-validation for the 24 models studied above both by leaving out specific parts of the dataset with common attributes (e.g. all Dorsal or Snail site mutations) as well as by randomly removing portions of the dataset. We used these two complementary approaches to not only test how much data is needed for the model fitting to be successful, but also to emphasize how important experimental design is in a study such as this one. Some studies rely on rely on saturation mutagenesis to achieve the same effect, but testing thousands of variants is impractical in this system, so a targeted survey was called for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">White et al., 2013</xref>). As anticipated, models were in general less able to fit constructs that were left out of the dataset, indicating the contribution that these particular enhancer constructs made to the fitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite similar performance on the entire dataset, individual models showed differing levels of sensitivity to changes in the scope of the data set used for model fitting. For instance, RMSE values for C13Q5 were modestly increased by either systematic or random leave-sets-out treatment, while C11Q4 was more dramatically impacted. In general, removal of entire classes of constructs had a more profound impact than removal of randomly selected constructs.</p><p>To better understand how specific constructs contribute to model performance, we analyzed how leaving out certain sets of constructs affects model predictions on each individual construct, including those used for fitting and those left out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The most profound effects were seen with the omission of the Snail repressor site constructs, where almost all models had striking increases in RMSE for all Snail constructs. Evidently, the elimination of activator sites alone is not sufficient to provide insights into how Snail affects the enhancer’s expression. Collectively, the scope of mutations assayed, targeting recognized Twist, Dorsal, and Snail sites, was sufficient to provide the required information to the modeling effort. The different effects of activator and repressor site mutations illustrate the importance of perturbation of each of these elements to fully explore the functional terrain of the enhancer; for a small number of constructs, a random perturbation of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences may not uncover the most informative changes related to transcriptional relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patwardhan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>All thermodynamic models used here characterized transcription factor activity by estimating parameters for activation and repression potential, as well as the distance-dependence of cooperativity and repression. Several broad trends emerged from analysis of parameter values across many model types, revealing possible biological implications for the modeled enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). First, overall model performance was improved by specifying separate parameters for activator and repressor cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; C1-9 vs. C10-C15). In these latter models, repressor-repressor cooperativities were consistently small, implying that different Snail sites did not show more than additive contributions, a finding that is consistent with the induction of localized chromatin compaction by this class of short-range repressor, which may interfere with simultaneous interactions by repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li and Arnosti, 2011</xref>). Activator-activator cooperativities were in contrast uniformly high, and in general did not show sharp distance dependencies. Such interactions may represent indirect interactions among activators, and may reflect joint repulsion of nucleosomes, or cooperative attraction of coactivators important for engaging the transcriptional machinery. The loose cooperative interactions of activators would explain the need for clustering of these proteins’ binding sites without strong constraints on their exact positioning, a flexibility that is seen with many developmental enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Arnosti and Kulkarni, 2005</xref>). This long-distance cooperativity contrasts with the short-range interactions often included in thermodynamic descriptions of transcription factor cooperativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Segal et al., 2008</xref>). A second trend noted in many but not all models was the distance-dependence of transcriptional repression, a feature inferred from previous studies of the Knirps, Snail, and Giant short-range repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnosti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hewitt et al., 1999</xref>); (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Thus, the overall landscape of estimated parameters both reflects certain known aspects of repression, and sheds light on activator cooperativity, which may involve primarily indirect, not rigidly constrained interactions in this system.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08445.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Estimated model parameters suggest biological properties of long-distance activator-activator cooperativity and weak repressor cooperativity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative estimated cooperativity parameters for Dorsal and Twist transcriptional activators show a trend of high levels of cooperativity with little distance dependence, consistent with indirect, long-range effects i.

We tested the set of 24 models with synthetic data sets to determine sensitivities, and determined that most parameters showed extensive mutual dependence and compensation, evidenced by the low first-order and high second-order sensitivities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). The observed convergence of cooperativity and quenching parameters for a number of models during our data fitting thus suggests that although first-order sensitivities are low, there is important information inherent in these values.</p><p>The objective of our study was to develop a quantitative understanding of novel enhancer sequences, using our models in a predictive mode. To test their efficacy, we first asked whether the perturbation analysis and modeling of <italic>rho</italic> was capable of uncovering a key property of modular enhancers in the embryo, namely the short range of transcriptional repressors that prevents 'cross-talk' with other nearby elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Courey and Jia, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Payankaulam et al., 2010</xref>). Previous work showed that Snail protein is representative of this major functional class of repressors, in studies that involved moving Snail binding sites within transcriptional regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 1994</xref>). Our perturbation dataset did not involve moving Snail binding sites around, however, the top third of models in our test set were able to accurately capture the effects of loss of Snail sites from a 700 bp native <italic>rho</italic> element, as well as correctly characterize modified enhancers in which novel Snail sites were inserted into active as well as inactive locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). To determine whether modeling from <italic>rho</italic> can be broadly extended to other regulatory elements, we measured the quantitative output of other enhancers targeted by Dorsal and Twist, and compared their expression patterns with the predictions of a spectrum of our models. Heterologous elements from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and homologous <italic>rho</italic> enhancers from other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species were successfully modeled by the models trained on the <italic>rho</italic> dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The previous assays tested the models on elements already known to act as Dorsal response elements and to bind Dorsal/Twist. To determine whether models would be able to identify and correctly quantitatively score enhancers embedded in general genomic sequences, we tested the panel of models on 30–40 kb regions flanking a number of developmental genes. The regions were tiled in 500 bp overlapping sequences and predictions generated with parameters from the <italic>rho</italic> dataset fitting. Analysis of the neuroectodermal <italic>brk</italic> and <italic>sog</italic> genes, as well as the more widely expressed <italic>twi</italic> gene showed that most intergenic sequences did not give rise to any appreciable predicted expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). To help one visualize how well the models agreed (or disagreed) on particular regions, average predictions from all 24 models were also generated for each 500 bp window, and plotted along with the standard deviation above and below the mean. A strong consensus among the 24 models for activity was found in two regions flanking the <italic>brk</italic> gene; these regions include mapped embryonic enhancers (primary and shadow) that are known to bind Dorsal and Twist in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Some regions were less uniformly predicted by the models, and in these cases there was less uniformity about the prediction for mesodermal or neuroectodermal expression, indicating that Snail activity was variably predicted. These predictions tended to agree well with genomic protein occupancy information, although there were some regions predicted as enhancers where there was no protein occupancy measured. In contrast, there were fewer predicted active elements in the region surrounding <italic>even-skipped (eve</italic>) locus, which is expressed in an anterior-posterior pattern independent of Dorsal/Twist. In addition, for intergenic regions flanking <italic>eve</italic>, there was greater variability among models in predicted expression levels, patterns of expression, and whether an element was even likely to be active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Similar results were noted for neuroectodermal and mesodermal-specific <italic>short gastrulation (sog</italic>) and <italic>twist (twi</italic>) genes respectively, as well as the non-target gene <italic>fushi tarazu</italic> (<italic>ftz</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The use of multiple models as a predictive 'jury' may help overcome the overfitting that is inherent in modeling, as the effects of such bias for a given model may be more or less prominent in different contexts. The ensemble approach of averaging the 24 model predictions provides a convenient metric for transcriptional potential predictions, yet the graphic display of the individual models also serves an important role, to highlight particular regions where there is a high degree of uniformity about the prediction (e.g. primary and shadow <italic>brk</italic> enhancers) and those in which the models diverge sharply (<italic>eve</italic> proximal region).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Bioinformatic sequence analysis and direct comparison of chromatin features have been used to identify cis regulatory elements in metazoan genomes, however the significance of patterns of binding sites within such elements remains obscure. Many models simply rely on the number of sites to infer some level of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kazemian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heintzman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonn et al., 2012</xref>). Our study indicates that the arrangement and quality of transcription factor binding sites contains an essential common 'grammar' of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions that is shared across distinct regulatory elements; this stands in contrast to recent studies suggesting that in some cases transcription factors may recognize their target sequences primarily through protein-protein rather than protein-DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kulkarni and Arnosti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junion et al., 2012</xref>). Our models were biologically constrained, leading to structural similarities between the different model formulations. Although this may contribute to the clustering of parameter values we have observed, given the overall quality of predictions across the genome, we believe these models and parameter values to be biologically informative. Predictions of enhancer activity from sequence alone remain a challenge, but our study clearly shows that with a suitable training set, there are identifiable aspects of enhancer composition that allow for functional insights of mesodermal and neuroectodermal genes of the Dorsal regulon. Models such as these can guide future studies that mine population- and species-level variation of genomic sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mackay, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Two features were important for the successful implementation of this thermodynamic modeling: development of a high quality perturbation dataset, which in our case involved several dozen carefully designed constructs whose transcriptional output was measured quantitatively, and exploration of a variety of model structures. As we determined when applying these models to genome discovery, using a panel of models provides a more robust platform for interpreting possible regulatory information; the particular parameter sets developed from fitting the <italic>rho</italic> perturbation data may represent a certain level of overfitting with respect to all potential Dorsal/Twist target enhancers. These errors are partially cancelled out when the predictions of several dozen models can be evaluated, providing in effect a type of 'weather report' showing a certain chance of regulation at each element. Here, we have also used an ensemble approach to combine these predictions, averaging model predictions; an approach similar to that which was implemented in a recent study by Samee et. al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samee et al., 2015</xref>). However, in their work they use a single thermodynamic model formulation and average the predictions obtained from different parameter sets with similar fits to their perturbation data.</p><p>In addition to recapitulating known facets of <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory grammar in <italic>Drosophila</italic> including the distance-dependent activity of repressors, this modeling approach identified critical quantitative features of activator and repressor interactions at enhancers. Specifically, for Dorsal and Twist, key regulators of dorsal-ventral polarity in the early embryo, our modeling predicts strong distance-independent homo- and heterotypic cooperativity between activators, but weak cooperativity between the Snail short-range repressors. These effects are likely linked to chromatin-based activities of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li and Arnosti, 2011</xref>). Previous, simpler models suggest that direct protein-protein interactions within a range of ~50 bp are likely to dominate such functional interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Segal et al., 2008</xref>). The extensive survey of model structure allowed us to reject assumptions this simplifying assumption. These predicted properties of transcription factor activity were robustly observed for differently structured models, making us confident that they are biologically relevant and not the result of overfitting, and the initial application of models to genomic sequences points to the future use of these models in genomic characterization of the Dorsal-Twist regulon. Our ability to gain insight into the transcriptional landscape of this network is a proof of concept demonstrating the utility of such a modeling approach for identifying regulatory relationships in other systems.</p><p>Our modeling approach was focused on three main regulators of <italic>rho</italic> activity, and did not take into account additional factors affecting <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, such as intrinsic chromatin occupancy, modification of transcription factor activity by signaling, or additional proteins involved in regulation of some of the enhancers. Nonetheless, future models will incorporate such additional layers of information in more complex treatments, such as including basal chromatin patterns to bias the accessibility of transcription factor sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bryant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Floer et al., 2010</xref>). Our study has addressed only a fraction of the diversity of factors present in the fly embryo; we deliberately focused on the early Dorsal regulon for the richness of quantitative resources available to it, including transcription factor concentrations, binding specificity of trans-acting factors, and genomic data on in vivo targets. With continuing advances in genomics and high-throughput technologies, quantitative modeling can extend our knowledge of other regulons, building on extensive descriptions of gene and protein expression, genomic protein occupancy, and genomic variation. A greater promise for modeling the quantitative grammar of genomes will be in 'personalized genomics', in which investigators predict the effects of sequence variation in human populations, and their physiological relevance in development and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corradin and Scacheri, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Newman and Young, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reporter gene constructs</title><p>The 318-bp <italic>rhomboid</italic> neurectodermal enhancers were cloned into <italic>Age</italic>I and <italic>Fse</italic>I restriction sites of the pHonda1 pattB-based targeted integration vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ip et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sayal et al., 2011</xref>).

For each scan of mounted embryos on a particular day of imaging, the same microscope settings for wild-type <italic>rho</italic> transgenic embryos were employed to all images to allow for direct comparison of intensities. The 488 nm argon laser was used for excitation of the Alexa 488; the 559 nm solid-state laser was used for excitation of the Alexa 555, and the 635 nm solid-state laser was used for excitation of the TOPRO-3. Emitted fluorescence was detected using a 500–545 nm band pass filter for detection of the Alexa 488, a 570–625 nm band pass filter for detection of Alexa 555, and a 655-755 nm band pass filter for detection of TOPRO-3. The pinhole aperture was set to 1.0 Airy unit. PMT voltage was set at maximum for images obtained from embryos transgenic for the wild-type <italic>rho</italic>NEE enhancer, avoiding saturation of signal intensities. Other constructs were imaged subsequently on a single day without changing any of the microscope settings. Embryos were imaged at a scan speed of 12.9 s/scan and a Kalman average of 2. A total of 21–30 confocal images through the Z thickness were acquired for each embryo with a Z-step interval of 1.16 μm per step. CLSM image data was stored as three separate stacks and projections of images for each channel. The section dimensions were 333 mm in length and width, and 1.73 mm in depth. Fluorescence pixels were recorded as 12-bit images and stored as TIFF files. To control for fading of signal post-staining, <italic>rho</italic> constructs containing the wild-type ensemble of activators were stained in parallel and used to normalize overall signal intensity for each imaging day. Stained embryos were imaged within a week to minimize loss of signal. Differences in probe bleaching, laser intensity, gain settings of the CCD etc. all impact overall signal intensity. For the 348 control images captured over 53 imaging sessions, the range of average peak intensities, prior to any background subtraction or normalization, was 56.8 – 255 units (only 3 were at 255, saturation value). The mean was 138.0, with a standard deviation of 36.8. Thus, for the large majority of captured signals, the day-to-day differences in intensities were not very great, and normalization procedures were not changing values by large factors. The background signals from non-expressing portions of the embryos were 52.4 +/- 23.8 (S.D.), thus considerably (2X) below the signal; and in all cases the strong signals measured on any day were well above background measured on any day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image processing</title><p>All confocal microscopy images were processed in a six-step procedure involving binary image generation, rotation, resizing, background subtraction, normalization and intensity-value extraction.

For Dorsal, PWMs were obtained from two sources: a PWM generated by MEME analysis (with default settings) of footprinted binding sites found in FlyReg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Noyes et al., 2008</xref>), herein referred to as DL1, and bacterial one-hybrid experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zinzen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Noyes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozdemir et al., 2011</xref>), referred to as DL2. The two position probability matrices were then averaged, and the log values calculated from this averaged matrix were used to yield a third hybrid PWM for Dorsal, DL3. For Twist, PWMs were used from two different SELEX experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zinzen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozdemir et al., 2011</xref>), herein referred to as TW1 and TW2 respectively. Subsequently, averaging the two PWMs as described above for Dorsal then derived a third hybrid PWM, referred to as TW3. For Snail, three different sources were used: SELEX data from BDTNP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bdtnp.lbl.gov">http://bdtnp.lbl.gov</ext-link>), SELEX data from a previously published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zinzen et al., 2006</xref>), and a PWM generated by MEME analysis of footprinted binding sites found in FlyReg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>), herein referred to as SN1, SN2 and SN3 respectively.

The thresholds used in thermodynamic modeling were evaluated by recovery of known footprinted binding sites, although for some settings not all PWMs were able to find all footprinted sites.

We fit quenching parameters (Q) for each of the bins. We also used the non-monotonic 'quenching' function (Q1) derived from our analysis of short-range repression by the Giant protein in synthetic enhancer constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hansen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fakhouri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suleimenov et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The binned quenching schemes are described as follows.

We tested three different continuous functions (Linear-C1, Logistic-C2 and Gaussian Decay-C3), which were parameterized with a single pair of parameters for all homotypic interactions, and separate values for Dorsal-Twist cooperativity. Additional models with 'binned' distances were also considered. For each of the binned schemes, we used a simpler form in which all homotypic interactions are parameterized with the same values, and a more complex form where each type of protein interaction for a given bin size receives distinct parameters. Each of these schemes therefore generates two model forms – binned and protein-binned respectively.</p><p>Schemes C4 and C10: c1: 1–25 bp, c2: &gt;25 bp</p><p>Schemes C5 and C11: c1: 1–50 bp, c2: &gt;50 bp</p><p>Schemes C6 and C12: c1: 1–75 bp, c2: &gt;75 bp</p><p>Schemes C7 and C13: c1: 1–50 bp, c2: 51–100 bp, c3: &gt;101 bp</p><p>Schemes C8 and C14: c1: 1–60 bp, c2: 61–120 bp, c3: &gt;121 bp</p><p>Schemes C9 and C15: c1: 1–70 bp, c2: 71–140 bp, c3: &gt;141 bp</p><p>For a summary of parameters in each model, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Parameter estimation</title><p>A global parameter estimation strategy, CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation - Evolutionary Strategy) was applied to estimate the parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hansen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Segal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fakhouri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suleimenov et al., 2013</xref>).

This RMSE was calculated using the 17 discrete expression points, as described above, and corresponding data points coming from the model predictions. Note that we used these 17 points, taken from 0–40% of the DV axis, and RMSE which gives each point equal weight, because we wanted to focus on the region of the embryo in which varying expression levels were observed and use the same scoring method with no bias across all construct. Due to the stochastic nature of starting points and fixed maximum number of runs for CMA-ES, estimations were run five times, which was empirically found to be sufficient to produce similar, minimal RMSE values for at least three of the runs in at least 47% of cases.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Model comparison</title><p>Since we tested a number of different model formulations, to evaluate the performance of an ensemble of models, we used multiple different approaches.

We also investigated ensemble approaches using weighted averages, including an average weighted by the model’s performance (one minus the RMSE), and an average weighted by the model’s AIC (Akaike Information Criteria), a fitness measure which penalizes for the number of model parameters.

The aim is to understand how rho-expression depends on binding sites of transcription factors (Twist, Snail, Dorsal) in the rho enhancer. To this end, constructs with individual transcription factor binding sites removed are analyzed and the resulting patterns of rho expression fitted to different models of transcription factor binding, cooperation, and activity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers and the BRE are concerned about the multi-model analysis. They all agree that this analysis is unclear and non-standard. The reviewers were also concerned about the procedure over-fitting to the data. Select comments attached below. Clarification and possibly rethinking the mode of analysis is needed for the revision. One of the main claims of the paper is the ability to estimate biophysical parameters, this claim has to be convincingly demonstrated.</p><p>A few comments from the reviewers on this issue:</p><p>&quot;The concept of ensemble of models is not new and is the subject both of Bayesian statistics (which is essentially about learning how much we can trust each possible model) and non-Bayesian formulations (e.g., mixture-of-experts models). I suspect that employing one of these methodologies would actually lead to a useful predictive rule which might apply on the non-rho enhancers. Right now the discussion that points to the models that support the observations is weak.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Based on their cross-validation results, the individual models are overfit. They claim that fitting a suite of models addresses this because they can identify trends amongst models. However, the set of models is highly related; they vary only in the particular pair-wise interactions that are allowed and the way that the distance-dependence is encoded. I believe it's more appropriate to address overfitting using sensitivity analysis, which they did. Sensitivity analysis should reveal which subset of parameters are well constrained by the data and which are not. But their conclusion is that cooperativity and quenching parameters show extensive mutual dependence, leaving it unclear precisely which parameters they can interpret across models.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The authors find extensive &quot;parameter compensation&quot;, meaning that the data does not constrain the model parameters, implying generally a good model fit but poor predictive performance (unless the instances where prediction is sought are similar to examples already seen during model training). Given the large number of parameters, one would expect a good fit (and also a good cross-validation on examples similar to training data) even if the overlap between models and properties of the enhancer, or models among themselves is poor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Possibly the question how impressive the predictions are can be settled on the basis of the present data. The overlap between predicted and observed expression levels can be plotted on a scatter plot against distance of the enhancer configuration to the most similar configuration in the training set. Results would differ somewhat depending on what distance measure is used, but I expect one can obtain insight into how serious the overfitting is.&quot;</p><p>2) With regards to the experimental data, rigorous measurement of expression levels by typical in situ is not trivial. The analysis here measured differences in expression level by keeping the acquisition settings on the microscope constant and normalizing maximum expression to a WT stain imaged on the same day. However, there can also be significant error from batch to batch variation in probes and stains, which are not accounted for here. This issue should be addressed by examining batch to batch variability and demonstrating that it's not an issue for their system, or by simulating data with more uncertainty in the levels of expression and see if this qualitatively effects their results.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Quantitative perturbation-based analysis of gene expression predicts enhancer activity in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. This includes in particular the minor comments of reviewer #1. In addition, in response to reviewer #2 comment, please be more explicit about the main result that was learnt from your analysis (beside the general modeling success)</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have diligently responded to the previous comments and the manuscript is more clear as a result. Overall, I find the main conclusions – that activators cooperate in a distance independent way while repressors cooperate less and have distance dependent function relative to activators – to be quite interesting. The modeling strategy is somewhat unusual, and while it's presented fairly clearly in the text, I don't find the figures always give great insight. However, for most aspects, I think readers can assess what they did and draw their own conclusions about the validity of the modeling approach and whether it provided useful insights. I do not see any technical errors that would undermine their main conclusions, and I think they are appropriately circumspect. I can therefore support publication.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Minor Comments):</p><p>I still have minor concerns about how their imaging data is being analyzed and incorporated into the model. These are mostly issues of clarification and how to make best use of the dataset that they have in hand.</p><p>First, in response to my previous concern about the variation in their imaging data, the authors quantified variability in their control embryos, which were stained in different batches and imaged on different days, and used to calibrate the acquisition settings of their microscope, thus serving as the effective normalization for peak expression for their test constructs. They analyze the variation in this full set, reporting that their mean peak expression was 138+/- 36.8, and that background was 52.4 +/- 23.8. They are thus seeing about 2X expression above background for their WT controls across all stains by this metric. This is a useful number and it's good to include (I would leave out the qualitative description of it's meaning that follows, but that's a personal preference for numbers over verbal description).</p><p>However, if increases in background and signal are correlated (for example if you have embryos that are brighter or dimmer overall, which is often the case with fluorescent stains), this might be actually be over-estimating their error. Instead, or in addition, they could include the standard error for the WT images used to calibrate the microscope for each construct in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, instead of plotting only the average WT trace across all of these data without any error. It's possible that they did not collect sufficient data on the WT constructs during each imaging session, in which case this wouldn't be helpful. An alternative would be to plot the standard error for the average WT trace after normalization.</p><p>I'm looking for some clarification on the imaging primarily because many of their constructs decrease or move expression moderately and it's helpful to know whether any of those constructs fall within experimental error. In the methods, it states that they imaged each test construct on a single day, so it's not possible to do the bulk analysis of error described above for each construct. The standard error for each construct shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is therefore representative of the variation in their dataset. Including the error for WT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> would largely address this issue.</p><p>I appreciate that they introduced noise into their predictions to try to assess how their error in expression measurement might impact their conclusions. This reveals the sensitivity of the top models, and their likely over-fitting, which confirms the utility of not focusing on a single model, but it is not necessary to include this analysis in this already large paper.</p><p>Second, to clarify how the expression measurements feed into their models, the authors could include a more explicit description of the inputs, outputs and scoring scheme for their models in the section &quot;Thermodynamic modeling of <italic>rho</italic> enhancer perturbation dataset&quot;. For example, did they use continuous expression data as their input, or select expression levels at specific points? The latter seems to be the case based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> where black dots are specific measurements. How/why were these points selected? The output also appears to be at discrete points based on this Figure, where red lines are predictions and I am assuming that the line is from linking together these discrete points. Finally, the RMSE score they use equally weights errors in regions of high expression and low expression. Some alternative scores have been used in other work to emphasize other features of expression patterns (for example the Sinha group has used the weighted Pattern Generating Potential). It is not necessary to score their models differently, but they should discuss the trade-offs of their particular scoring scheme. And how is the RMSE score calculated? Is it done on the continuous data (red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> vs. continuous expression measurements), or on the point by point data as above? I could not find this information in the main text or the methods. I suggest that it is included in the main text as a verbal description of their procedures, and any additional information be put in the methods. It also seems possible and potentially useful to include their experimental error in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, to allow comparison of biological variability against their model performance.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The revised version of Sayal et al. has improved in some ways. Overall I am supportive of this type of work, which involves careful experimental measurements followed by an honest attempt to fit the data to a physically inspired model. The strengths of the paper are the quantitative data, and the attempt to validate the model predictions both by testing the activity of enhancers from other species and by using the model to predict the locations of other enhancers, some of which are already known.</p><p>The main weakness of the paper remains the decision to center the analysis around a collection of 120 related models rather than attempting to find the best model, or a small number of competing models. This gives the analysis a very unsystematic feel; different models are highlighted and put forward in different parts of the paper. The result is that the claims of the paper are vague (that experiments and models can help reveal regulatory principles) rather than something concrete about the grammar of this system. There is no clear statement of what the authors have learned besides the idea that modeling is a good thing.</p><p>In my opinion the issue of over fitting has been dealt with adequately by the experiments in which the activity of orthologous enhancers are predicted and measured and by the demonstration that there is little correlation between the accuracy of new predictions and the similarity of the tested construct to constructs in the training data.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The additional checks requested in the previous round of review alleviate my concern concerning overfitting. My assessment is that this work goes beyond a resource of detailed experimental data, and the statistical analysis unveils aspects of the underlying biology. Detailed analysis of the data can be done in the future and is beyond the scope of this paper. For this reason I recommend publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08445.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The reviewers and the BRE are concerned about the multi-model analysis.

One of the main claims of the paper is the ability to estimate biophysical parameters, this claim has to be convincingly demonstrated. Few comments from the reviewers on this issue: &quot;The concept of ensemble of models is not new and is the subject both of Bayesian statistics (which is essentially about learning how much we can trust each possible model) and non-Bayesian formulations (e.g., mixture-of-experts models).

Right now the discussion that points to the models that support the observations is weak.&quot;</italic> </p><p>A major question concerned our presentation and analysis of the set of models utilized in this study. In the original manuscript, we described the individual fit and performance of a number of models that test cooperativity, activity and quenching (local repression). As the reviewers point out, a common way of evaluating such ensembles is using average or weighted averages to generate a hybrid model that may summarize the overall performance. Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we tested three different schemes for an ensemble approach, a simple average, an RMSE-score weighted average, and an AIC penalized approach. The simple average ensemble model, now shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, generated predictions that were similar to the RMSE-weighted and AIC penalized ensemble models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08445.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Predictions of twenty four <italic>rho</italic>-fit thermodynamic models for the <italic>brinker</italic> genomic region.</title><p>Model structure indicated by nomenclature indicating cooperativity/quenching schemes used, and overall ranking in fitting for <italic>rho</italic> training set.

We also now cite and discuss a paper that was recently published from Saurabh Sinha’s group, in which a different ensemble approach is used to identify regulatory logic of the <italic>ind</italic> enhancer (Hassan Samee et al., Cell Systems). Their approach differs from ours in that a single thermodynamic model structure is utilized, and the different models correspond to unique parameter sets that were found to provide good fits under cis and trans perturbation.</p><p><italic>&quot;Based on their cross-validation results, the individual models are overfit. They claim that fitting a suite of models addresses this because they can identify trends amongst models. However, the set of models is highly related; they vary only in the particular pair-wise interactions that are allowed and the way that the distance-dependence is encoded. &quot;</italic> </p><p>An additional question concerned model structure and overfitting. We do see that performance for individual models drops as we leave out portions of the training dataset, but this is mostly apparent when we partition the training set in a non-random manner. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, models performed well with five-fold random cross validation, but leaving out all of the data from specific classes of perturbations (e.g. removal of repressor sites) had a significant impact on RMSE. We include the “nonrandom” partitioning to indicate how important different types of perturbations are; some studies rely on saturation mutagenesis to achieve the same effect, but testing thousands of variants is impractical in this system, so a targeted survey was called for (White et al., 2013). We have revised the Results section to emphasize this point. As the reviewer noted, the structures of the models are related, which may lead to similarities in identified parameters. We agree that this similarity of models may indeed produce such effects; the reason that we did not try vastly different models is that certain aspects of rho binding proteins are experimentally known, based on extensive empirical research. For instance, we know that Snail is a short-range repressor, thus we used models in which it would be possible to recover such activity, depending on estimated parameters. (However, we could also recover parameters that would be consistent with long-range action, depending on recovered parameters for longer distance intervals). Similarly, strong evidence indicates that Twist and Dorsal are activators, and can show cooperative action, thus models in which the proteins had inverted regulatory activities (as explored by Jaeger and Reinitz on less well-characterized settings) were not included. Our models are not too narrowly structured, merely filling in some parameters for highly detailed biochemical mechanisms, however; complex processes of transcriptional control are subsumed in the single “activity” parameter, which is an appropriate simplifying role for models. Given these limitations, the diversity of the models that was generated helped identify general trends that point to possible important biological properties. For example, we noted a substantial increase in performance for models in which we separately assess activator and repressor cooperativity, indicating that these proteins may have different cooperative potentials.</p><p><italic>&quot;The authors find extensive &quot;parameter compensation&quot;, meaning that the data does not constrain the model parameters, implying generally a good model fit but poor predictive performance (unless the instances where prediction is sought are similar to examples already seen during model training). Given the large number of parameters, one would expect a good fit (and also a good cross-validation on examples similar to training data) even if the overlap between models and properties of the enhancer, or models among themselves is poor.&quot;</italic> </p><p>We did indeed point out in the manuscript that the different model formulations of activation and repression were interdependent, likely a result of parameter compensation, and provide direct evidence for parameter compensation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> i-ii, where Twist activity parameters are higher on one run, correlated with lower homotypic Twist-Twist cooperativity values. The presence of some degree of compensation is neither surprising, nor does it invalidate the approach; depending on the extent of such compensatory interactions, models will be more or less overfit, which will come out as the models are applied to novel situations, tested later in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>“I believe it's more appropriate to address overfitting using sensitivity analysis, which they did. Sensitivity analysis should reveal which subset of parameters are well constrained by the data and which are not. But their conclusion is that cooperativity and quenching parameters show extensive mutual dependence, leaving it unclear precisely which parameters they can interpret across models.&quot;</italic> </p><p>We did indeed conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate the extent to which parameters of different models were informative as well as to determine which were constrained. A low sensitivity overall would indicate that the parameter was not at all informative, while high first-order sensitivities would indicate that a parameter is uniquely informative, and not compensating with other values. We find that most parameters showed high overall sensitivity, indicating their importance in driving model fitting, and high second-order values, indicating that there are interdependencies between these factors (only the Snail activity parameter showed high first-order sensitivities in some models). This latter finding of higher second-order sensitivities is not at all surprising, and it was a factor that we recognized embarking on this study, because the mechanism of transcription involves processes that all contribute to the final output, and research on native biological systems has demonstrated how transcriptional output can be set by complementary contributions of cooperativity or factor potency, for instance. We were interested in determining how useful such models would be despite some degree of parameter interdependence, which is borne out by success in predicting novel enhancers. We do think that the clustering of many parameter values across many models is biologically informative. For instance, the tendency for long-range activator cooperativity vs. low repressor cooperativity is likely to be informative, but this must be tested. We revised the Discussion to note that structural similarities of models may also drive such effects, as the reviewer pointed out.</p><p><italic>&quot;Possibly the question how impressive the predictions are can be settled on the basis of the present data. The overlap between predicted and observed expression levels can be plotted on a scatter plot against distance of the enhancer configuration to the most similar configuration in the training set. Results would differ somewhat depending on what distance measure is used, but I expect one can obtain insight into how serious the overfitting is.&quot;</italic> </p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we tested this idea by plotting the predictions for different novel enhancer sequences against the similarity of the closest element in the training set. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>) The similarity of regulatory sequences was calculated by a standard word-count algorithm from the Vingron laboratory used previously to examine the similarity of metazoan regulatory regions. The plot does not show a strong positive correlation between this simple measure of similarity and modeling success. This result indicates that the simple measure of enhancer relatedness by global feature similarity is insufficient to predict activity. Indeed, the features that dictate enhancer output are very specific and context-dependent. Experimental work has shown individual cases in which subtle changes in a few residues are sufficient to strongly affect enhancer output, while at the same time highly divergent DNA sequences can mediate essentially identical tissue-specific expression of different genes (Crocker and Erives, 2008).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08445.021</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Average RMSE (suite of 24 models) vs enhancer distance as calculated using N2 method.</title><p>There is no strong trend toward increased performance (lower average RMSE) with more closely related enhancers.

In response to this comment, we re-examined the primary data acquired for the modeling, looking at control gene expression used for day-to-day normalization. Differences in probe bleaching, laser intensity, gain settings of the CCD etc. will all impact overall signal intensity. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we reanalyzed 348 control images captured over 53 imaging sessions. We find that for these images of embryos with enhancers containing the wild-type ensemble of activators, the range of average peak intensities, prior to any background subtraction or normalization, was 56.8 – 255 units (only 3 were at 255, saturation value). The mean was 138. +/- 36.8 (S.D.). Thus, for the large majority of captured signals, the day-to-day differences in intensities were not very great, and normalization procedures were not changing values by large factors. The background signals from non-expressing portions of the embryos were 52.4 +/- 23.8 (S.D.), thus considerably below the signal; and in all cases the strong signals measured on any day were well above background measured on any day. We have now included information about this range and variation of signal intensities in the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>“[…]or by simulating data with more uncertainty in the levels of expression and see if this qualitatively effects their results.”</italic></p><p>As suggested here, we also carried out parameter estimation with 5% or 10% noise added to the measured gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3</xref>). As shown below, the top ranked models were generally more strongly affected, while midranked models were more modestly impacted. Such behavior provides an indication of the degree of overfitting for these models. (The lowest ranked model improved with the noisy data sets, consistent with our observation that for this model, the original parameter estimation runs apparently did not achieve a global minimum). It is interesting that the predictions on genomic loci such as <italic>brk</italic> (not used in model fitting) are consistent with the “top” models revealing their overfitting – they did not out performing mid-level models in many cases.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08445.022</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>RMSE for each of 24 models run with data simulating 5% noise and 10% noise.</title><p>Ten datasets were generated to randomly introduce 5% or 10% noise, respectively, into the input data.

To clarify how the expression data was used in our model fitting, we have added a detailed description of how we discretized the continuous data to the Methods section.</p><p>We have also added a verbal description of what data was used to calculate the RMSE, as well as our reasoning behind using this method.</p><p><italic>It also seems possible and potentially useful to include their experimental error in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, to allow comparison of biological variability against their model performance.</italic> </p><p>The experimental error is shown for seven different constructs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This error is representative of the error found in all constructs tested. Due to this fact, we have decided not to include the error in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, as we feel it will add little to the overall message, while reducing the readability of the figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>The revised version of Sayal</italic> et al. <italic>has improved in some ways. Overall I am supportive of this type of work, which involves careful experimental measurements followed by an honest attempt to fit the data to a physically inspired model. The strengths of the paper are the quantitative data, and the attempt to validate the model predictions both by testing the activity of enhancers from other species and by using the model to predict the locations of other enhancers, some of which are already known.</italic> </p><p><italic>The main weakness of the paper remains the decision to center the analysis around a collection of 120 related models rather than attempting to find the best model, or a small number of competing models. This gives the analysis a very unsystematic feel; different models are highlighted and put forward in different parts of the paper.</italic> </p><p>As indicated in our previous revision, there are indeed different aspects to using an ensemble model, as opposed to exploring the significance of the 120 models presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We explicitly tested the importance of exact spacing relationships for the activators by generating models that permitted fine-scale differentiation of protein binding sites, however, most models with separate repressor and activator cooperativity parameters tended to high, and distance-independent positive cooperativity for activators, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We subsequently focus on a single subset of 24 models for sensitivity and cross-validation, showing that broad properties apply across this set of models (and doubtless the entire 120 related models), such as demonstration that certain types of perturbations (e.g. hitting both activator and repressor sites) were critical for optimal fitting, that the overall depth of perturbation was sufficient for obtaining quantitative information about the “transcriptional grammar” of this enhancer, and that on most models, parameter was observed. Thus, in the end we make our major conclusions about two groups of models; the entire set, and the representative subset of 24 (as well as the demonstration that an “average” ensemble captures some, but not all useful information about novel genes that are scanned in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p><italic>The result is that the claims of the paper are vague (that experiments and models can help reveal regulatory principles) rather than something concrete about the grammar of this system. There is no clear statement of what the authors have learned besides the idea that modeling is a good thing.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this aspect of the paper must be clearer. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have summarized the key findings of our paper, along with comments as to how modeling approach provides concrete, testable hypotheses, in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
