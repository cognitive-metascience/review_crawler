pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36217.001</object-id><p>The P2X7 channel is involved in the pathogenesis of various CNS diseases. An increasing number of studies suggest its presence in neurons where its putative functions remain controversial for more than a decade. To resolve this issue and to provide a model for analysis of P2X7 functions, we generated P2X7 BAC transgenic mice that allow visualization of functional EGFP-tagged P2X7 receptors <italic>in vivo</italic>. Extensive characterization of these mice revealed dominant P2X7-EGFP protein expression in microglia, Bergmann glia, and oligodendrocytes, but not in neurons. These findings were further validated by microglia- and oligodendrocyte-specific P2X7 deletion and a novel P2X7-specific nanobody. In addition to the first quantitative analysis of P2X7 protein expression in the CNS, we show potential consequences of its overexpression in ischemic retina and post-traumatic cerebral cortex grey matter. This novel mouse model overcomes previous limitations in P2X7 research and will help to determine its physiological roles and contribution to diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36217.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human body relies on a molecule called ATP as an energy source and as a messenger. When cells die, for example if they are damaged or because of inflammation, they release large amounts of ATP into their environment. Their neighbors can detect the outpouring of ATP through specific receptors, the proteins that sit at the cell’s surface and can bind external agents.</p><p>Scientists believe that one of these ATP-binding receptors, P2X7, responds to high levels of ATP by triggering a cascade of reactions that results in inflammation and cell death. P2X7 also seems to play a role in several brain diseases such as epilepsia and Alzheimer’s, but the exact mechanisms are not known. In particular, how this receptor is involved in the death of neurons is unclear, and researchers still debate whether P2X7 is present in neurons and in other types of brain cells.</p><p>To answer this, Kaczmarek-Hájek, Zhang, Kopp et al. created genetically modified mice in which the P2X7 receptors carry a fluorescent dye. Powerful microscopes can pick up the light signal from the dye and help to reveal which cells have the receptors. These experiments show that neurons do not carry the protein; instead, P2X7 is present in certain brain cells that keep the neurons healthy. For example, it is found in the immune cells that ‘clean up’ the organ, and the cells that support and insulate neurons. Kaczmarek-Hájek et al. further provide preliminary data suggesting that, under certain conditions, if too many P2X7 receptors are present in these cells neuronal damage might be increased. It is therefore possible that the brain cells that carry P2X7 indirectly contribute to the death of neurons when large amounts of ATP are released.</p><p>The genetically engineered mouse designed for the experiments could be used in further studies to dissect the role that P2X7 plays in diseases of the nervous system. In particular, this mouse model might help to understand whether the receptor could become a drug target for neurodegenerative conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>purinergic P2X7 receptor</kwd><kwd>BAC transgene</kwd><kwd>conditional knockout</kwd><kwd>nanobody</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ni 592/4-5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicke</surname><given-names>Annette</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruzzone</surname><given-names>Santina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No 310/11-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koch-Nolte</surname><given-names>Friedrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13/SIRG/2098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>766124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name><name><surname>Nicke</surname><given-names>Annette</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1328</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Magnus</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name><name><surname>Koch-Nolte</surname><given-names>Friedrich</given-names></name><name><surname>Nicke</surname><given-names>Annette</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17/CDA/4708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ni 592/4-7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicke</surname><given-names>Annette</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel BAC transgenic mouse model reveals glial restriction of P2X7 expression in the central and peripheral nervous systems.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The P2X7 receptor differs from all other P2X family members by its low sensitivity to ATP, a particularly long intracellular C-terminus, and its ability to trigger various short and long-term cellular events like the induction of dye uptake and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saul et al., 2013</xref>;

A growing body of evidence suggests that an increased P2X7 receptor function plays a role in various diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) and further supports its importance as a drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharya and Biber, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rassendren and Audinat, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sperlágh and Illes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sociali et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>P2X7 receptors are expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin as well as different types of glial, epithelial, and endothelial cells. The presence and function of P2X7 receptors in neurons, however, remains a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Illes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miras-Portugal et al., 2017</xref>), although an increasing amount of literature describing neuronal P2X7 functions imply a wide acceptance of this view (e.g. in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sperlágh and Illes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gulbransen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jimenez-Pacheco et al., 2013</xref>]).

However, mRNA expression might not necessarily correlate with synthesis of the respective protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carpenter et al., 2014</xref>), selectivity of the available P2X7-specific antibodies has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Nedergaard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sim et al., 2004</xref>), and pharmacology of purinergic receptors is rather complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Nedergaard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Compan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nörenberg et al., 2016</xref>). Also, it has been difficult to differentiate between direct effects of neuronal P2X7 activation and indirect effects of ATP-activated neurotransmitter release from glia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sperlágh and Illes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Illes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miras-Portugal et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the scarcity of information regarding the localization and the molecular and physiological functions of P2X7 receptors in the nervous system stands in sharp contrast to its proposed role as a drug target. To conclusively resolve these important questions, we generated transgenic mouse lines that overexpress EGFP-tagged P2X7 under the control of a BAC-derived mouse P2X7 gene (<italic>P2rx7</italic>) promoter.

As shown for five selected lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), specific labeling with identical patterns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) was obtained. A particularly high P2X7-EGFP density was found in the molecular layers of the cerebellar cortex. In addition, strong labeling was detected in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG), the cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb as well as the thalamus, hypothalamus, substantia nigra, and ventral pons. Comparison of endogenous and transgenic P2X7 levels in different brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) showed similar protein ratios and tissue-specific intensities, demonstrating that expression of the transgene mirrored both the expression pattern and expression level of endogenous P2X7 and thus implying that important regulatory elements governing P2X7 expression are preserved and functional in the chosen BAC construct. Due to the dense but diffuse signal and a higher background fluorescence (probably due to structural organization and/or a high content of endogenous fluorophores) in the cerebellar cortex, identification of cellular structures and P2X7-EGFP-expressing cell types proved difficult in adult cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>): Using confocal microscopy, no conclusive co-localization was seen with Purkinje cell (calbindin D28k) and synaptic (vGlut2) marker proteins nor with astrocytes/Bergmann glia (GFAP or S100β). However, analysis of the cerebellum from animals at postnatal day 7 (P7), before Bergmann glia microdomains are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grosche et al., 2002</xref>), revealed a more structured and clearer GFP signal that aligned with the cell bodies and radial extensions of S100β-immunopositive cells with typical Bergman glia morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, we conclude that P2X7 is expressed in Bergmann glia, in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Habbas et al., 2011</xref>). However, due to the localization in microdomains that give a very diffuse pattern, co-localization with the intracellular Bergmann glia marker GFAP, which visualizes mainly their radial extensions, could not be detected and co-localization with S100β was only dissolved during postnatal development. In addition to Bergman glia, P2X7 is present in microglia of the cerebellum, which was confirmed in acutely dissociated cells from adult tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2D</xref>). Based on our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), we exclude the expression in Purkinje cells in both adult and P7 mice.

In contrast to previous reports, however, P2X7-EGFP was exclusively expressed in microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Likewise, P2X7-EGFP expression was not found in neurons of the spinal cord, DRG, or of teased sciatic nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In Schwann cells of the sciatic nerve fibers, however, P2X7-EGFP was localized to nodes of Ranvier and Schmidt-Lantermann incisures, in perfect agreement with the subcellular distribution pattern of endogenous P2X7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). At the neuromuscular junction, P2X7-EGFP was found in close association with terminal Schwann cells (S100β-positive), but did not co-localize with them or with the post- (α-bungarotoxin-positive) or presynaptic (synaptophysin-positive) membrane, in contrast to previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deuchars et al., 2001</xref>).

To test if tissue damage, that is a condition that is associated with neuroinflammation, could induce neuronal P2X7-EGFP synthesis, we proceeded our analysis with three experimental models of acute and/or invasive CNS injury: ischemic retina, stab wound, and kainic acid-induced status epilepticus. In preliminary experiments with a small number of animals (n = 3–4), an increased microglia reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and microglia number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) as well as other Iba1/P2X7-positive cells (possibly invading macrophages, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) were observed upon transient retinal ischemia in wt animals. Interestingly, this effect appeared to be enhanced in P2X7-EGFP transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Importantly, however, P2X7 was not upregulated in other cell types than microglia, at least 3 days post injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this context, it should be emphasized, that a similar trend was observed in mice subjected to the stab wound injury of the somatosensory grey matter (GM). Compared to the situation in wt mice (n = 2) at 5 days after injury, post-traumatic GM of P2X7-EGFP transgenic mice (n = 3) showed a trend toward increased reactivity of microglial cells at the injury site and increased lesion area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These data support the functionality and correct transcriptional regulation of the construct and suggest a deleterious effect of P2X7 overactivation on neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sperlágh and Illes, 2014</xref>). The low number of animals, however, requires confirmation in future studies. Nevertheless, no induction of neuronal or astroglial P2X7-EGFP synthesis was found in the affected lesion area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), although we cannot exclude a potential obfuscation of the EGFP signal due to autofluorescence in the direct vicinity to the injury. Finally, no induction of P2X7 protein expression was observed in neurons of the dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3 regions 24 hr after induction of status epilepticus by a unilateral intra-amygdala kainic acid injection, although a change of microglia morphology clearly indicated their activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In conclusion, we suggest that P2X7-dependent neurodegeneration that has been observed in various studies is caused by an indirect mechanism, most likely involving P2X7 activation in microglia or oligodendrocytes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36217.021</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Consequences of P2X7 overexpression under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in duplicates on samples from microglia isolated by immunomagnetic separation from control and postischemic (3 days post injury, 3 dpi) retinae.

While some antibodies detect P2X7 in western blots and upon overexpression in cultured cells, they fail to localize it reliably in complex preparations such as brain sections. In addition, an intricate pharmacology and compromised <italic>P2rx7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nicke et al., 2009</xref>) complicate the analysis of its localization and function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, we present a novel P2X7-EGFP BAC transgenic mouse model that overexpresses functional fluorescence-tagged P2X7 and is able to specifically report P2X7 expression at the protein level. Moreover, this model permits studies of the functional consequences of P2X7 overexpression. Detailed analyses of these mice under physiological conditions show that in the CNS, P2X7 is predominantly located in microglia and oligodendrocytes and to a minor extent in a fraction of S100β-positive cells in the cerebrum as well as Bergmann glia in the cerebellum. Given this distribution in physiology and the fact that no upregulation of P2X7 protein in neurons was observed after neural tissue damage or following status epilepticus, it is conceivable that the reported P2X7-dependent neuronal damage is the consequence of the pronounced manifestation of microglia activation rather than direct activation of neuronal P2X7 receptors.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The BAC transgenic approach</title><p>Numerous examples demonstrate that BAC transgenics are valuable tools to investigate endogenous protein expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerfen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang and Gong, 2005</xref>). In comparison to knock-in approaches, they provide the advantages of a stronger signal due to the moderate overexpression which might boost physiological functions and thus make them accessible for an in depth analysis. Together with classical and/or conditional knock-out strategies, this provides a powerful combination for the <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of protein functions. In contrast to small transgenes, in which the expression patterns are often affected by the integration site, BAC transgenes show in most cases an expression pattern that reflects the endogenous promoter within the BAC. However, position effects such as gene deletion or aberrant expression due to integration of (truncated) BAC transgenes in other genes or regulatory elements cannot be excluded. Thus, five transgenic lines were analyzed in detail in this study, and all showed identical expression patterns. A correct expression pattern was further corroborated by 1) a comparative analysis of P2X7-EGFP transgene expression and endogenous P2X7 expression in wt mice using a novel P2X7-specific nanobody-rbIgG fusion construct and 2) cell type-specific P2X7 deletion in oligodendrocytes and microglia using conditional P2X7 knock-out mouse models. Together, these findings all argue against an ectopic P2X7-EGFP expression pattern and indicate a predominant expression of P2X7 in non-neuronal cells within the brain parenchyma.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>P2X7 protein localization in neurons?</title><p>The absence of a neuronal localization of P2X7-EGFP contrasts with findings in a BAC transgenic reporter mouse line (Tg(P2rx7 EGFP)FY174Gsat; GenSat) in which soluble EGFP is expressed under the control of a BAC transgenic P2X7 promoter and a recently described humanized P2X7 knock-in mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Metzger et al., 2017</xref>). Both models show neuronal P2X7 expression but differ remarkably in the observed expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jimenez-Pacheco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Metzger et al., 2017</xref>). Neuronal expression of the soluble EGFP reporter in the GenSat mouse is seen in multiple brain regions whereas P2X7 transcripts in the humanized P2X7 mouse model seem to predominate in CA3 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Metzger et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In contrast to our findings at the protein level, the knock-in model showed only a minor reduction in P2X7 expression in microglia-specific knock-out animals. A possible explanation for these discrepancies could be that alterations in gene structure introduced into the GenSat P2X7 BAC EGFP mice influence post-transcriptional and translational regulatory mechanisms. For example, intron 1, the importance of which is evidenced by the P2X7 k splice variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nicke et al., 2009</xref>), is not fully preserved in the EGFP reporter mouse and soluble EGFP is translated from a truncated mRNA which might lack regulatory elements. In case of the humanized P2X7 model, only RNA transcripts were analyzed which might not correlate with protein synthesis. Moreover, different sensitivities of the detection methods (<italic>in situ</italic> hybridization versus immunohistochemistry) could also account for some of the observed differences. As even minor gene modifications, such as the flanking of the exons with the comparatively small loxP sequences, are able to influence gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Requardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), we kept the <italic>P2rx7</italic> gene structure almost untouched and retained as much of the UTRs as possible to avoid such unpredictable influences. Although we cannot completely rule out an effect of the introduced gene modification within the BAC or a loss of possible modulatory elements that lie outside of the chosen BAC, comparison of the BAC transgenic P2X7-EGFP with endogenous P2X7 expression as analyzed with the novel nanobody-based heavy chain antibody, provide strong evidence that the expression pattern observed in our mouse line matches that of the endogenous protein. This, however, does not preclude species differences. For example, in human but not in murine Müller cells, functional and immunohistological evidence for P2X7 expression has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Innocenti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pannicke et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we cannot exclude neuronal expression that is below the detection limit. As the P2X7 receptor is known to be a highly regulated protein and has been shown to be deleterious to cultured neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohishi et al., 2016</xref>), its expression and localization should be tightly regulated in post-mitotic cells like neurons. If present in neurons, its presence would likely be limited to subcellular regions were synapse formation and selection takes place and/or to areas where damaged cells need to be removed by apoptosis. Possible extrasynaptic or growth cones localizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Díaz-Hernandez et al., 2008</xref>) would be difficult or impossible to resolve <italic>in situ</italic> using the described antibodies and conventional microscopy. However, even upon induction of tissue damage, virtually no P2X7 expression in cerebral cell types other than microglia or oligodendrocytes was observed. Based on our data, we therefore suggest that P2X7-induced neurodegeneration is due to an indirect effect (i.e. extended glial reaction within the acute post-traumatic period), which requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Can P2X7 splice variants account for neuronal P2X7 expression?</title><p>Five murine P2X7 splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nicke et al., 2009</xref>) have been identified. Two of these (variants a and k) contain the C-terminal sequence that was fused to EGFP and should be detectable in our mouse model. The other three variants (b, c, and d) are C-terminally truncated or altered and could therefore escape the detection by both our EGFP-tag and the most commonly used antibodies against the P2X7 C-terminus. However, the nanobody used in our study was selected on intact P2X7 expressing cells and therefore binds at the extracellular P2X7 domain which is present in splice variants b and c. Together with the fact that in the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masin et al., 2012</xref>), protein of the deleted variants was not detected in the brain, this strongly argues against the presence of the mouse P2X7 variants b and c in neurons. Splice variant d contains only one TM domain and cannot be expected to form functional receptors. We therefore consider it highly unlikely that one of the known mouse variants of P2X7 accounts for neuronal P2X7 function or detection. A 65 kD protein band is frequently detected by us and others with antibodies against the P2X7 C-terminus but, unlike the P2X7 protein (variant a, about 75 kD), does not show a size shift upon glycosidase treatment and therefore, most likely does not represent a P2X7 variant.</p><p>In summary, we generated and thoroughly characterized a novel transgenic P2X7-EGFP mouse model that should help to overcome previous limitations in P2X7 research. Using functional assays, we could show that transgenic expressed P2X7-EGFP rescues the phenotype of P2X7 deficiency thus confirming the functionality of the transgene. Our initial characterization, however, indicates that P2X7 overexpression does not per se induce any overt pathologies, but rather represents a natural response observed after tissue damage. This is in line with observations in Schwann cells, where overexpression of P2X7 alone does not alter the basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration: overexpression of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (as it occurs in Schwann cells from patients suffering from Charcot Marie Tooth type 1A), causes instead a secondary overexpression of P2X7 and consequent Schwann cells functional derangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nobbio et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that in addition to P2X7 overexpression, other factors are required to induce P2X7-associated pathologies. Most importantly for our study, neuronal P2X7 protein expression was not induced under pathological conditions. An unresolved question is, whether the high ATP concentrations required to activate the receptor occur physiologically or if the receptor is silent under physiological conditions and mainly expressed and/or activated under pathophysiological conditions. The presented mouse model provides a new tool for addressing this question.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><bold>Type</bold></th><th><bold>Designation</bold></th><th><bold>Source or reference</bold></th><th><bold>Identifiers</bold></th><th><bold>Additional information</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> BAC clone</td><td>BAC clone, RP24-114E20</td><td>Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA</td><td/><td>Strep-tagII-Gly-7xHis-Gly-EGFP-sequence was inserted into the <italic>P2r × 7</italic> BAC clone RP24-114E20</td></tr><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>P2 × 7 EGFP <break/>(FVB/N-Tg(RP24-114E20P2 × 7 StrepHis-EGFP)Ani)</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>Lines: 46, 59 (also in BL/6N), 61</td></tr><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>P2X7<sup>451P</sup>-EGFP <break/>(FVB/N-Tg(RP24-114E20P2 × 7451P-StrepHis-EGFP)Ani)</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>Lines: 15, 17 (also in BL/6N) <break/>Transgenes were backcrossed into C57BL/6 for at least eight generations</td></tr><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>B6-P2r × 7<sup>tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi</sup></td><td>European Mutant Mouse Archive</td><td>MGI:4432150</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(FLP1)Dym</sup></td><td>Farley FW, et al., Genesis. 2000</td><td>MGI:2429412</td><td>FLPe deleter</td></tr><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Tg(EIIa-cre)C5379Lmgd</td><td>Lakso M, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996</td><td>MGI:2137691</td><td>EIIa-Cre mouse</td></tr><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>B6-Cx3cr1<sup>tm1.1(cre)Jung</sup></italic></td><td>Yona S, et al., Immunity. 2013</td><td>MGI:5467983</td><td>Cx3cr-1-Cre</td></tr><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>B6- Cnp<sup>tm1(cre)Kan</sup></td><td>Lappe-Siefke C, et al., Nat Genet. 2003</td><td>MGI:3051635</td><td>CNP-Cre</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>P2 × 7 C-term (rb pAb)</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>Cat# 177003, <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_887755">AB_887755</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:1500 <break/>IHC 1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>P2 × 7 ECD (rb pAb)</td><td>Alomone</td><td>Cat# APR-008 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2040065">AB_2040065</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:500 <break/>IHC 1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>ß-Actin (ms AC-15)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat# A3854 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_262011">AB_262011</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:15.000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Vinculin (ms hVin-1)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat# V9131 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_477629">AB_477629</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:10.000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>800CW gt anti-ms</td><td>LI-COR</td><td>Cat# 925–32210 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2687825">AB_2687825</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:15.000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>680RD dk anti-rb</td><td>LI-COR</td><td>Cat# 925–68073 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2716687">AB_2716687</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:15.000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>680RD gt anti-rb</td><td>LI-COR</td><td>Cat# 925–68071 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2721181">AB_2721181</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:15.000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>CD11b-perCP (rat M1/70)</td><td>BioLegend</td><td>Cat# 101230, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2129374">AB_2129374</ext-link></td><td>FACS 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>CD45-PE-Cy7 (rat 30-F11)</td><td>BioLegend</td><td>Cat# 103114, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_312979">AB_312979</ext-link></td><td>FACS 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>CD16/32 (Fc-Block, rat 2.4G2)</td><td>BioXcell</td><td>Cat# BE0307 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2736987">AB_2736987</ext-link></td><td>FACS 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>P2 × 7 C-term.

Sections were stored in glycol at −20° C until use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Behavioral experiments</title><p>Experiments were performed with 10–13 weeks old mice on 3 consecutive days in the following order.</p><sec id="s4-19-1"><title>Balance beam</title><p>Mice were positioned in the middle of a 50 cm long and round (1 cm diameter) wooden bar, which was fixed 44 cm above a padded surface between two 14 × 10 cm wooden escape platforms. The time for which animals stayed on the beam was measured and if a platform was reached, 60 s were counted. Each test was performed three times for a duration of 60 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19-2"><title>String suspension</title><p>A 3-mm-thick rope was loosely attached to the balance beam platforms in 35 cm height. Mice were hold in front of the middle of the string so that they could grab it with their fore‐paws. The following scoring was used during a 60 s test duration: 0 = unable to stay on rope; 1 = hanging on rope with one pair of paws; 2 = like 1, but with attempt to climb; 3 = sitting on rope, keeping balance; 4 = rope grabbed with all paws and tail together with a laterally movement of the mouse; 5 = escape on platform.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19-3"><title>Hot plate</title><p>The plate was set to 50°C and surface temperature continuously monitored with a digital thermometer. Time measurement started when the animal was gently placed on the hot plate and stopped when the animal licked its hind paw for the first time or jumped off. Animals that failed to react within 60 s were removed from the plate to avoid thermal injury, and were assigned the value of 60 s. Each test was performed three times with at least 15 min intervals between measurements.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice were housed in standard conditions (22°C, 12 hr light–dark cycle, water/food <italic>ad libitum</italic>). Animal handling and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with German and European Union guidelines and were approved by the State of Upper Bavaria (stab wound injury (55.2.1.54-2532-171-11), retinal ischemia (TVV 54/12; 55.2 DMS-2532-2-182), transcardial perfusion (55.2-1-54-2532-59-2016)) and Lower Saxony (generation of BAC transgenic mice, transcardial perfusion (33.9-42502-04-12/0863), behavioral experiments (3392 42502-04-13/1123)). Status epilepticus was induced in accordance with the principles of the European Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC) and procedures reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (REC 205 and 1322) and performed under license from the Department of Health and Children, Ireland. All efforts were made to minimize suffering and number of animals used.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Conny Neblung, Sarah Schlagowski, Annett Sporning, Irina Zamolo, and Heinz Janser for technical assistance, Heinrich Betz and Walter Stühmer for generously providing support and facilities, Stephan Kröger for help with NMJ preparation, Ursula Fünfschilling for advice in animal breeding, Ablynx for permission to use mouse P2×7 specific nanobody 7E2, Klaus Armin Nave for FLIR, EIIa-Cre, and cnp1-Cre mice, and Steffen Jung for Cx3cr1-Cre mice.

This murkiness limits the clinical advancement of P2X7 inhibitors and obscures our mechanistic understanding. This manuscript by Kaczmarek-Hájek et al. is a rigorous examination of P2X7 protein expression throughout the nervous system. The authors have generated P2X7-EGFP fusion BAC mice, demonstrating that the fusion protein is functional and trafficked appropriately. The authors' findings regarding which cell types express P2X7 are in conflict with several reports in the literature. Much of the discrepancy can be explained by the overreliance of past works on non-specific commercial antibodies, the weaknesses of which are exposed here with proper controls (Figure 3—figure supplement 6, Figure 2E). Several transgenic mouse lines have previously been used to monitor <italic>P2rx7</italic> expression, but show limited agreement with each other or the present report. There are several reasons to accept the present work as the authoritative reference for P2X7 expression patterns. First, the GFP-fusion BAC transgenic informs protein expression, which is an improvement upon previous transgenics and RNA-seq datasets. Second, BAC fusion reporter lines represent arguably the most sensitive modern technique for describing protein expression that still maintains high signal specificity. Third, the present analysis is well controlled, often corroborating findings with a validated nanobody or multiple transgenic lines. Finally, this work provides a broad characterization across many regions of the nervous system, avoiding overgeneralization of findings from a focal investigation. Overall, the experiments are very well performed, and data very well analyzed. The results are clearly presented and the paper is well written and accessible to the general reader. The authors should be congratulated for this huge amount of work.</p><p>We have some concerns (enumerated below) about the authors' limited investigation of region-specific P2X7 expression patterns and unsatisfying characterization of injury-induced changes. However, if these issues can be addressed, we would support publication of this work in <italic>eLife</italic> as a well-executed contribution that will be informative to a broad range of disciplines concerned with P2X7 function.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the authors provide evidence that the EGFP-tagged P2X7 construct is functional by a dye uptake assay, they should also show ATP-induced currents by electrophysiology. These data would help the reader to appreciate the influence of the EGFP-tag on activation and deactivation kinetics of the chimeric channel.</p><p>2) The authors observe a band of GFP signal in CA3/dentate gyrus (e.g. bottom-right panel in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B) that would appear to be consistent with functional expression of P2X7 in a subset of neurons as reported (Engel et al., 2012 and Jimenez-Pacheco, 2013). Lack of neuronal expression is a primary claim, so it is important to know: what cell type or structure can this staining be attributed to? We would be satisfied if the authors showed synaptic marker co-staining with the CA3/DG GFP signal, or perhaps include a discussion about that signal that rules out neuronal contribution.</p><p>3) There is strong GFP signal in the adult basal ganglia/hypothalamus and ventral pons that do not seem to be explained by microglia/OPCs (Figure 2A, Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Protein in these regions should also be characterized if the present work is to be considered a comprehensive analysis of P2X7 expression. We would be satisfied with NeuN-GFP co-staining in basal ganglia, hypothalamus, and pons along with TH-GFP co-staining in the basal ganglia.</p><p>4) The authors image apparently non-glial P2X7 in other CNS regions, but don't uncover the source. What cell type is responsible for the S100β- P2X7+ signal in cerebellum?</p><p>5) The authors do not look for changes in which cell types produce P2X7 protein in the retinal injury model and analysis of changes in GFP expression after the stab injury are obstructed by autofluorescence induced by the injury. FACS or chromogenic staining should be used to clarify this, especially since neuronal expression was only detected after kainite-induced seizures. Alternatively, the authors should comment on the potential obfuscation of GFP signal due to injury-induced autofluorescence in Figure 5C.</p><p>6) The authors make statements about trends in altered inflammatory responses in the context of P2X7 overexpression (text related to Figure 5), but their N is too small to justify meaningful claims. The low n makes the conclusions about post-injury impact of P2X7 ambiguous, but this is not essential to the work's major conclusions and this concern could be addressed with changes to the discussion of these data.</p><p>7) The number of animals used throughout Figure 5 is insufficient to support substantive claims. Also, several supplementary stainings are conducted with n=3-6 sections from n=1 animal; these stainings are important and should be repeated in tissue from at least 2 separate animals.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36217.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the authors provide evidence that the EGFP-tagged P2X7 construct is functional by a dye uptake assay, they should also show ATP-induced currents by electrophysiology.

In our P2X7-EGFP BAC transgenic mice, a clear band of GFP signal is regularly detected in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and, to a lesser extent in the CA3 region (e.g. Figure 2A, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A (now B) bottom-right panel). To further exclude neuronal expression of P2X7-EGFP in the CA3 and DG regions, we added, as suggested, co-stainings with synaptic markers of these regions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and 2). Based on our data, we attribute the more intense stainings to a higher density and/or more ramified morphology of microglia in these regions. In particular, they seem to accumulate directly at the border to the granular layer in the DG (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A). In support of our explanation and in contrast to the much larger area seen in the GenSat mouse (e.g. http://www.gensat.org/imagenavigator.jsp?imageID=29030) the thickness of the band in this region equals the radius of microglia with their extensions. The text has been changed accordingly (subsection “Analysis of P2X7-EGFP localization in the brain”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is strong GFP signal in the adult basal ganglia/hypothalamus and ventral pons that do not seem to be explained by microglia/OPCs (Figure 2A, Figure 2—figure supplement 1).

These are now included as Figure 3—figure supplement 5 and referred to in subsection “Analysis of P2X7-EGFP localization in the brain”. No co-localization of GFP and neuronal markers were found, but the morphology of the labeled cells are consistent with oligodendroglial or microglial expression of EGFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors image apparently non-glial P2X7 in other CNS regions, but don't uncover the source. What cell type is responsible for the S100β- P2X7+ signal in cerebellum?</p></disp-quote><p>The fact that we see EGFP immunoreactivity that does not co-localize with S100β immunoreactivity does not necessarily mean that the EGFP is not of glial origin. To identify the responsible cell types, we performed co-staining with calbindin and vGlut2 (Purkinje cells and their glutamatergic synapses) as well as GFAP and S100β (Bergmann glia). The latter are now included in Figure 2—figure supplement 2C.</p><p>However, due to a very dense and uniform EGFP signal and a higher autofluorescence background, co-localization of the EGFP-signal in adult cerebellum with these markers was not possible. Based on the co-localization of EGFP with S100β-positive cells in P7 animals, in which the EGFP signal is less diffuse and more structured, we conclude that P2X7-EGFP is expressed in Bergmann glia and that the formation of Bergmann glia microdomains after the first week of life (Grosche et al., 2002) results in the observed diffuse and dense staining pattern.</p><p>In agreement with our conclusion, co-staining of acutely dissociated cerebellar cells from adult animals with Iba1 and S100β confirmed the presence of EGFP in S100β and Iba1-positive cells (i.e. Bergmann glia and Microglia, respectively). These data are now included in Figure 2—figure supplement 2. The text has been changed accordingly in subsection “Analysis of P2X7-EGFP localization in the brain”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors do not look for changes in which cell types produce P2X7 protein in the retinal injury model and analysis of changes in GFP expression after the stab injury are obstructed by autofluorescence induced by the injury.

Alternatively, the authors should comment on the potential obfuscation of GFP signal due to injury-induced autofluorescence in Figure 5C.</p></disp-quote><p>a) We have now included co-stainings for EGFP with glutamine synthetase and Iba1 in the ganglion cell layer to exclude Müller cell and neuronal expression and confirm restriction to microglia in the ischemic retina model. In addition, we included cell-type specific quantitative PCR data from treated and non-treated retinae of wt and transgenic animals to exclude upregulation of P2X7 in neurons and other retinal cell types. These data are included in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 A-C and referred to in the text (subsection “Consequences of P2X7 overexpression under physiological and pathological conditions”). The original Figure 5A right panel (P2X7 expression in microglia) was included into the new Figure 5—figure supplement 1C to demonstrate the prominent P2X7 expression in microglia in direct comparison to other retinal cell types.</p><p>b) Due to autofluorescence in the area that is immediately adjacent to lesion core and filled with inflammatory cells (~ 0-75μm) we cannot exclude neuronal P2X7 expression. However, in the penumbra that immediately interfaces with, and surrounds, damaged and inflamed tissue lesions after injury (&gt;100μm) no upregulation in NeuN+ neurons was found. Unfortunately, no additional animal experiments, and hence, no chromogenic stainings of injured tissues could be performed in the given time. Therefore, we commented on the potential obfuscation (subsection “Consequences of P2X7 overexpression under physiological and pathological conditions” and legend of Figure 5D), as suggested.</p><p>c) In addition, we obtained slices from mice after kainic acid-induced seizures, which confirmed the lack of P2X7 protein upregulation in neurons in the dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3 regions. These are now included in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and referred to in subsection “Consequences of P2X7 overexpression under physiological and pathological conditions”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors make statements about trends in altered inflammatory responses in the context of P2X7 overexpression (text related to Figure 5), but their N is too small to justify meaningful claims.
