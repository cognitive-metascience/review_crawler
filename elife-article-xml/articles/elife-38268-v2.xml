The neurotransmitter molecules bind to proteins on the receiver neuron called receptors. But what causes the sender neuron to release neurotransmitter in the first place? The process starts when an electrical impulse called an action potential arrives at the sender cell. Its arrival causes channels in the membrane of the sender neuron to open, so that calcium ions flood into the cell. The calcium ions interact with packages of neurotransmitter molecules, known as synaptic vesicles. This causes some of the vesicles to empty their contents into the synapse.</p><p>But this process is not particularly reliable. Only a small fraction of action potentials cause vesicles to fuse with the synaptic membrane. How likely this is to occur varies greatly between neurons, and even between synapses formed by the same neuron. Synapses that are likely to release neurotransmitter are said to be strong. They are good at passing messages from the sender neuron to the receiver. Synapses with a low probability of release are said to be weak. But what exactly differs between strong and weak synapses?</p><p>Akbergenova et al. studied synapses between motor neurons and muscle cells in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Each motor neuron forms several hundred synapses. Some of these synapses are 50 times more likely to release neurotransmitter than others. Using calcium imaging and genetics, Akbergenova et al. showed that sender cells at strong synapses have more calcium channels than sender cells at weak synapses. The subtypes and arrangement of receptor proteins also differ between the receiver neurons of strong versus weak synapses. Finally, studies in larvae revealed that newly formed synapses all start out weak and then gradually become stronger. How fast this strengthening occurs depends on how active the neuron at the synapse is.</p><p>This study has shown, in unprecedented detail, key molecular factors that make some fruit fly synapses more likely to release neurotransmitter than others. Many proteins at synapses of mammals resemble those at fruit fly synapses. This means that similar factors may also explain differences in synaptic strength in the mammalian brain. Changes in the strength of synapses underlie the ability to learn. Furthermore, many neurological and psychiatric disorders result from disruption of synapses. Understanding the molecular basis of synapses will thus provide clues to the origins of certain brain diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>active zone</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>calcium channels</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>synapse development</kwd><kwd>glutamate receptors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH104536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Littleton</surname><given-names>J Troy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cunningham</surname><given-names>Karen L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Active zone release probability is correlated with calcium channel density and calcium influx at single release sites, with release strength increasing in an activity-dependent manner during synapse maturation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic vesicle fusion occurs at specialized regions of the presynaptic membrane known as active zones (AZs). Several evolutionarily conserved structural proteins are enriched in this subdomain of the presynaptic terminal, including RIM, RIM binding protein, Syd-1, Liprin-α, ELKS/CAST/Bruchpilot, Munc13, and Bassoon/Piccolo/Fife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Südhof, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Van Vactor and Sigrist, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhai and Bellen, 2004</xref>). These large macromolecular complexes facilitate clustering of synaptic vesicles and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs), allowing action potential-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to act locally on synaptic vesicles that are docked and primed for release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2016; </xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zito et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bucurenciu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eggermann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fouquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kawasaki et al., 2004</xref>). Synaptic vesicle fusion occurs through a highly probabilistic process, often with only a small percent of action potentials triggering release from individual AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Körber and Kuner, 2016</xref>). Although AZs largely share the same complement of proteins, release probability (<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>) for synaptic vesicle fusion is highly variable across different neurons and between AZs formed by the same neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atwood and Karunanithi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branco and Staras, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Melom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Peled and Isacoff, 2011</xref>).

In addition, some AZ-specific proteins are non-uniformly distributed, and the molecular composition of AZs can undergo rapid changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Glebov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Graf et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Reddy-Alla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sugie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Weyhersmüller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wojtowicz et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) has emerged as a useful system to study release heterogeneity. At this connection, motor neurons form glutamatergic synapses onto bodywall muscles in a stereotypical fashion, with the axon expanding to form ~10–60 synaptic boutons that each contain many individual AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harris and Littleton, 2015</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> AZs contain a similar assortment of proteins to those identified at mammalian AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Böhme et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bruckner et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ehmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feeney et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fouquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Graf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jan and Jan, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaufmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Owald et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wagh et al., 2006</xref>). Each AZ is specifically associated with a postsynaptic glutamate receptor field. Glutamate receptors at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ are excitatory inotropic non-NMDA receptors that exist as tetramers, with three obligatory subunits encoded by GluRIII, GluRIID and GluRIIE, and a variable fourth subunit encoded by either GluRIIA (A-type) or GluRIIB (B-type) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Featherstone et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Marrus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Petersen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Qin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schuster et al., 1991</xref>). GluRIIA containing receptors generate a larger quantal size and display slower receptor desensitization than their GluRIIB counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiAntonio et al., 1999</xref>). The A- and B-subtypes compete for incorporation into the tetramer at individual postsynaptic densities (PSDs) in a developmental and activity-regulated fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Featherstone, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiAntonio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Marrus and DiAntonio, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rasse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Schmid et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The stereotypical alignment of individual AZs to distinct postsynaptic glutamate receptor fields in <italic>Drosophila</italic> allowed the generation of genetic tools to optically follow quantal fusion events at single release sites by visualizing glutamate receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Melom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Peled and Isacoff, 2011</xref>). Classically, studies of synaptic transmission have used electrophysiology to measure the postsynaptic effect of neurotransmitter release over a population of release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Katz and Miledi, 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">1967</xref>), precluding an analysis of how individual AZs contribute to the evoked response. By transgenically expressing GCaMP Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors that target to the postsynaptic membrane, single vesicle fusion events at each individual AZ can be imaged by following spatially localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induced upon glutamate receptor opening. This allows for the generation of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> maps for both evoked and spontaneous fusion for all AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Melom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Muhammad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Newman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Peled et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Peled and Isacoff, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Reddy-Alla et al., 2017</xref>). One surprising observation using this quantal imaging approach is that AZs formed by a single motor neuron have a heterogeneous distribution of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, ranging from 0.01 to ~0.5, with neighboring AZs often showing ~50-fold differences in <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Melom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Peled et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Peled and Isacoff, 2011</xref>). These differences in <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> result in AZs with distinct short-term plasticity properties, suggesting release heterogeneity has functional importance for synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Peled and Isacoff, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Key questions raised by these observations include how <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> is uniquely set for individual AZs and how the heterogeneity in <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> arises during development. <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> variability is likely to be controlled in part by variable Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance at release sites, consistent with the heterogeneity in VGCCs and other associated AZ proteins previously documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Böhme et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ehmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fulterer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Graf et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guerrero et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Peled and Isacoff, 2011</xref>). Indeed, <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> has been shown to correlate with BRP abundance at AZs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Paul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Peled et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Reddy-Alla et al., 2017</xref>) and BRP has a key function in clustering VGCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> has previously been shown to correlate with the number of VGCCs at several vertebrate synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sheng et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> could also be regulated by local synaptic vesicle pools and their number and/or state (i.e. phosphorylation status). Beyond the molecular factors that determine AZ <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, it is unclear how release heterogeneity at <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs arises during development. Intravital imaging at third instar larval NMJs has demonstrated that AZs are born small and gain pre- and postsynaptic components over time in a sequential manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andlauer and Sigrist, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fouquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Füger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rasse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). However, this approach has not been used during earlier stages of larval development to determine whether the release heterogeneity observed at third instar NMJs reflects AZ birth order. To characterize factors regulating <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> at individual AZs, as well as the origin of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> diversity, we employed optical quantal analysis and intravital imaging to examine how <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> heterogeneity arises during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ synapses display heterogeneity in <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, ranging from functionally silent sites to high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> AZs</title><p>Recent studies indicate that release sites possess structural and functional heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Éltes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Holderith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Melom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Peled et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Peled and Isacoff, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Reddy-Alla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sugie et al., 2015</xref>).

In contrast, 9.9% (n = 16 NMJs from 16 animals) of AZs were functionally classified as high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> sites, suggesting that the majority of these sites are not likely to be explained by release from multiple closely clustered AZs.</p><p>SIM visualization of BRP at AZs following <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> mapping revealed that a majority of high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> sites were represented by a single BRP-positive AZ that was not further resolvable after SIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, red circles).

Only 16 ± 3% of these high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> sites were resolved into multiple AZs upon SIM analysis, indicating that most high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> AZs correspond to single release sites.

We applied 200 nM of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore ionomycin to elevate Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations uniformly throughout the terminal independent of Cac abundance. In the presence of ionomycin, differences in fluorescent signals between AZs should be entirely due to heterogeneity in sensor abundance. We observed a rightward shift in the GCaMP-BRP<sup>short</sup> intensity distribution among AZs upon ionomycin application compared to 10 Hz stimulation (average AZ fluorescence during 10 Hz stimulation was 1924 ± 63, and following ionomycin addition was 6105 ± 175; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), indicating that during 10 Hz stimulation, detection of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by GCaMP-BRP<sup>short</sup> is not limited by sensor abundance. Furthermore, we observed a significant difference in the shape of the distribution during 10 Hz stimulation compared to both before stimulation and after ionomycin. The distribution of fluorescence intensities is narrower both at rest and upon ionomycin application; these two distributions should primarily reflect sensor distribution. In contrast, the distribution of GCaMP-BRP<sup>short</sup> fluorescence during 10 Hz stimulation is wider, indicating that the sensor is reporting local changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and not just sensor distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).

PSDs associated with the highest <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> AZs showed a segregated distribution of the receptor subtypes, with GluRIIA concentrating in the center of the receptor field immediately apposing the presynaptic BRP cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, arrows). At these sites, GluRIIB occupied a more peripheral position around the central GluRIIA cluster. A similar localization pattern with a ring of GluRIIB surrounding a central GluRIIA patch was previously noted with antibody staining for the two receptors at a population of AZs in wildtype late third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Marrus et al., 2004</xref>). To analyze this receptor segregation in greater detail, GluRIIA-RFP and GluRIIB-GFP were examined in the absence of co-expressed myrGCaMP6s. Prior analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) indicated the brightest GluRIIA PSDs corresponded to high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> sites. Bright PSDs were selected based on their GluRIIA intensity (two standard deviations above average) and line profiles were drawn across each PSD. The intensity of pixels along that line for each fluorophore was then analyzed. Average pixel intensity revealed drastically distinct profiles for GluRIIB distribution between ‘bright’ and ‘dim’ PSDs classified based on their GluRIIA intensity. GluRIIB was more evenly distributed across the entire PSD at dim GluRIIA sites, but was segregated outward, forming a ring around central GluRIIA puncta at bright GluRIIA sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). In addition, presynaptic BRP intensity was more strongly correlated with postsynaptic GluRIIA levels (Pearson r = 0.53, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.28, p&lt;0.0001, n = 2496 AZs from 19 NMJs from seven animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) than with GluRIIB (Pearson r = 0.24, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.05, p&lt;0.0001, n = 2496 AZs from 19 NMJs from seven animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). These findings suggest that the postsynaptic cell accumulates GluRIIA and redistributes GluRIIB to the PSD periphery at high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Intravital imaging of glutamate receptors and cac channels throughout synapse development</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJ is a highly dynamic structure, with new synaptic boutons and AZs undergoing continuous addition throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harris and Littleton, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rasse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schuster et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zito et al., 1999</xref>). Given the correlation between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance, GluRIIA/B segregation and high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, we were interested in determining how AZs acquire a specific <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> during a larval developmental period that lasts 6–7 days. One model is that certain AZs gain a higher <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> status during development through preferential accumulation of key AZ components compared to their neighbors. Alternatively, high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> AZs might simply be more mature than their low <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> neighbors, having an earlier birthdate and a longer timeframe to accumulate AZ material. To test these models for release heterogeneity, it would be desirable to follow <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> development from the embryonic through larval stages. However, this is not technically feasible due to the small size of AZs and the rapid locomotion that larvae undergo, preventing generation of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> maps in moving animals. Instead, we employed an alternative intravital approach to repeatedly image the same NMJ at muscle 26 directly through the cuticle of intact larvae during anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andlauer and Sigrist, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fouquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Füger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rasse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). During anesthesia, endogenous action potential-induced release and the associated GCaMP signals were eliminated, preventing direct <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> measurements in anesthetized larvae. We instead focused on imaging GluRIIA accumulation and GluRIIA/B segregation, which was strongly correlated with <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), as a proxy for the emergence of high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> sites.</p><p>Previously described in vivo imaging approaches with anesthesia at <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs employed early third instar larvae as the starting time point, and followed the distribution of fluorescently-labeled synaptic proteins during the final ~36 hr of development prior to pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andlauer and Sigrist, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fouquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Füger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rasse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). To follow AZ <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> development beginning soon after synapse formation, we modified these techniques to allow imaging of glutamate receptors at earlier stages of development (see Materials and methods). This allowed successful birth dating and successive imaging of the same AZ over a 6 day period beginning shortly after synapse formation in the early first instar period through the late third instar stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In early first instar larvae (within 12 hr of hatching) GluRIIA and GluRIIB were largely co-localized at postsynaptic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). One exception was the presence of diffuse GluRIIA that accumulated around unusually long axonal extensions that emerged from presynaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). These structures were devoid of any detectable GluRIIB or the bright GluRIIA puncta that are associated with AZs, and may be remnants of previously described muscle filopodial structures, termed myopodia, that interact with presynaptic filopodia to dynamically regulate early synaptic target recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kohsaka and Nose, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ritzenthaler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Ritzenthaler and Chiba, 2003</xref>). GluRIIA was diffusely present on these structures, as has been observed for the leucine-rich repeat cell adhesion protein Capricious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kohsaka and Nose, 2009</xref>). Repeated imaging of these thinner GluRIIA-positive processes revealed that they were capable of developing into mature synaptic boutons with concentrated GluRIIA and GluRIIB synaptic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). By 24 hr of larval growth, GluRIIA rich extensions were no longer observed, indicating these structures are restricted to early developmental stages.</p><p>Prior studies indicated GluRIIA PSD levels closely track with Cac accumulation at corresponding AZs of third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fouquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rasse et al., 2005</xref>), indicating the two compartments are likely to mature at similar rates. To examine this directly, we assayed whether GluRIIA and Cac accumulation were correlated during earlier stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Indeed, the intensity of Cac-GFP and GluRIIA-RFP puncta were strongly correlated at individual AZs during both early and late larval development (first instar; Pearson r = 0.82, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6771, p&lt;0.0001, n = 441 AZs from 8 NMJs from eight animals; third instar; Pearson r = 0.63, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.395, n = 874 AZs from 8 NMJs from five animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3D,E</xref>). One exception was observed in very early first instar larvae, where a few Cac-GFP puncta accumulated along the previously described GluRIIA positive axonal extensions prior to the specific accumulation of GluRIIA at PSDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In contrast, postsynaptic appearance of GluRIIA at the PSD could be observed to slightly precede the accumulation of Cac-GFP at later developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>), similar to previous observations at mature third instar NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rasse et al., 2005</xref>). In summary, the intensity of Cac-GFP and GluRIIA-RFP puncta are strongly correlated at AZs during larval development, indicating that GluRIIA provides a robust marker that reflects the corresponding levels of presynaptic Cac at individual AZs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Analysis of <italic>Pr</italic> acquisition during AZ development using glutamate receptor segregation as a proxy</title><p>We examined how GluRIIA accumulation and GluRIIA/B segregation emerged during development of the NMJ. Live imaging of GluRIIA and GluRIIB distribution at early PSDs in anesthetized first instar larvae demonstrated that the receptors were co-localized and lacked the segregation where GluRIIB clustered around central GluRIIA puncta that was observed at high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> sites later in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The first emergence of GluRIIA/B segregation was observed after 36 hr of imaging starting from the first instar period. The GluRIIA/B segregation always emerged first at the oldest synapses that existed previously on the first day of imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). The most mature PSDs also contained more GluRIIA fluorescent signal (17430 ± 634.0, n = 86 AZs from 8 NMJs from five animals) compared to younger synapses that emerged during the 48 hr imaging session (8909 ± 289.8, n = 210 AZs from 8 NMJs from five animals). During later larval development, the cuticle thickness changed dramatically and prevented reliable comparison of absolute receptor density with earlier stages. However, GluRIIA intensities that were more uniform at the first instar larval stage became more heterogeneous at the third instar stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, histograms of normalized fluorescence intensity (relative intensity scaled from 0 to 1) revealed that GluRIIA and GluRIIB were relatively uniformly distributed at first instar larval PSDs, with GluRIIA distribution becoming more skewed at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). To determine whether muscle 26 exhibits <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> heterogeneity similar to muscle 4, we performed <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> mapping using GluRIIA-RFP and myr-GCaMP6s in dissected non-anesthetized third larvae and confirmed that <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> heterogeneity is extremely similar between muscle 26 (mean <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> = 0.068 ± 0.0048, skewness = 2.27, 365 AZs from 5 NMJs from five animals) and muscle 4 (mean <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> = 0.073 ± 0.0021, skewness = 2.23, 1933 AZs from 16 NMJs from 16 animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>).

This analysis was restricted to newly formed AZs that appeared during the imaging sessions and excluded AZs that were present in the first imaging session performed in first instar larvae.

We quantified the number of synapses present at the same NMJ from the first instar through the early third instar stage from live imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). AZ number roughly doubled each day, such that the average number of AZs found at the first instar stage (day 1) represented 14.7 ± 1.4% (n = 8 NMJs from three animals) of all AZs present by day 4 (3 days after initial imaging in first instars).

One factor that might contribute to these changes in PSD maturation rate is altered growth rate of the entire NMJ secondary to changes in neuronal activity. Indeed, we observed that the rate of new PSD addition over 24 hr in <italic>BRP<sup>69/def</sup>, nap<sup>TS</sup>,</italic> and <italic>sh, eag</italic> mutants showed a similar trend to PSD maturation, suggesting that overall NMJ growth rate is altered in these mutants (control animals increase AZ number by 1.8 ± 0.1 fold over 24 hr compared to <italic>sh, eag</italic> (2.2 ± 0.1 fold), <italic>nap<sup>TS</sup></italic> (1.3 ± 0.04 fold), <italic>syt1</italic> (1.5 ± 0.08 fold), and <italic>BRP<sup>69/def</sup></italic> (1.2 ± 0.06 fold); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). Previous work on activity-dependent NMJ growth in <italic>Drosophila</italic> focused primarily on bouton number, not AZ addition rate, and it will be interesting to explore the molecular mechanisms mediating activity-dependent seeding of new AZs. To measure PSD maturation rate in the context of an otherwise healthy animal, we took advantage of the <italic>rab3</italic> null mutant, where roughly half of the PSDs are apposed by presynaptic areas lacking BRP and Cac, and the remaining AZs contain higher than normal levels of these presynaptic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Graf et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Rab3</italic> AZs containing BRP and Cac have been shown to have higher <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, whereas AZs lacking these presynaptic components are functionally silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Peled and Isacoff, 2011</xref>). This redistribution of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> provides an opportunity to compare PSD maturation with less influence of overall animal health and NMJ growth rate.</p><p>The <italic>rab3</italic> phenotype has been previously analyzed at the third instar stage of larval development. To characterize the dynamics of pre- and postsynaptic maturation during earlier development, we followed <italic>rab3</italic> animals expressing Cac-GFP and GluRIIA-RFP for 48 hr starting in the early first instar larval stage. AZs populated with Cac-GFP early in development were stable over time; Cac-GFP was never lost at these AZs over 48 hr of imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, a divergence in the rate of PSD versus Cac-GFP addition was observed after the first instar stage; new GluRIIA-containing PSDs were added to the NMJ at a rate similar to control, with total PSD number nearly doubling every 24 hr. However, the rate of addition of new Cac-GFP-containing AZs was much lower than in controls, resulting in a decrease in Cac/GluRIIA apposition in <italic>rab3</italic> mutants over development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1D,F</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that PSD growth rate was decreased in the <italic>rab3</italic> null (1.23-fold ± 0.05, 6 NMJs from six animals) when we measured PSDs born in the late first instar or early second instar stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>), while the percent of GluRIIA/B rings seen in the second instar stage was elevated (34.7 ± 3.3% of PSDs had rings, 14 NMJs from six animals) compared to age matched controls (22%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). To avoid complications from the atypical dynamics of AZ apposition during <italic>rab3</italic> NMJ development, we focused the remainder of our analysis on the early first instar stage where the age distribution of AZs is much narrower.</p><p>We next examined first instar <italic>rab3</italic> mutants to determine whether AZs with higher presynaptic activity had more mature postsynaptic receptor fields than their silent neighbors. We imaged GluRIIA-RFP and GluRIIB-GFP in <italic>rab3</italic> 1<sup>st</sup> instars and then dissected and stained for BRP. In muscle 26 of <italic>rab3</italic> mutants, roughly 50% of first instar AZs were populated with BRP (the ratio of GluRIIA-RFP puncta to Cac-GFP puncta was 1.9 ± 0.15); these AZs were opposed by large PSDs, many of which already showed GluRIIA/IIB segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, PSDs lacking BRP were much smaller and lacked receptor segregation. All of the PSDs with GluRIIB rings were BRP-positive, suggesting that PSDs opposite AZs with reduced presynaptic release are less mature at this stage of larval development. Though the mechanism by which rab3 regulates AZ assembly remains unknown, the larger PSD size and enhanced GluRIIA/B segregation opposite BRP-positive AZs and the small size and lack of receptor segregation opposite BRP-negative AZs within the same terminal suggests that PSD maturation depends on presynaptic activity at the level of individual AZs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the current study we used quantal imaging, super resolution SIM, and intravital imaging to examine the development of heterogeneity in evoked <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> across the AZ population at <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs. We first confirmed that release heterogeneity was not caused by summation of fusion events from multiple unresolvable AZs. Indeed, high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> sites corresponded to single AZs with enhanced levels of BRP. These findings are consistent with previous observations using conventional light microscopy that indicate <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> correlates with BRP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Muhammad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Peled et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Reddy-Alla et al., 2017</xref>). By monitoring release over intervals of extensive vesicle fusion during strong stimulation, we also observed that <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> is a stable feature of each AZ. In addition, loss of the synaptic vesicle Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor Syt1 globally reduced <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> without altering the heterogeneous distribution of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> across AZs, indicating that AZ-local synaptic vesicle pools with differential Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity are not likely to account for <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> heterogeneity. Since VGCC abundance, gating, and organization within the AZ are well established regulators of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> across synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borst and Sakmann, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Meinrenken et al., 2002</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zito et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Südhof, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), heterogeneity in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance was a clear candidate for the generation of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> heterogeneity at <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs. Indeed, the Cac Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel responsible for neurotransmitter release is heterogeneously distributed across the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fouquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kawasaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Littleton and Ganetzky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rieckhof et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Smith et al., 1996</xref>). Using transgenically labeled Cac lines, we observed that Cac density at AZs is indeed strongly correlated with <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>. To directly visualize presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at single AZs, we generated GCaMP fusions to the core AZ component BRP. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at single AZs was highly correlated with both Cac density and <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>. The <italic>cac<sup>NT27</sup></italic> mutant with decreased conductance also resulted in a global reduction in <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> without disrupting heterogeneity, further confirming that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx regulates <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> across the range of release heterogeneity.</p><p>Postsynaptically, high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> AZs were enriched in GluRIIA-containing receptors and displayed a distinct pattern of glutamate receptor clustering. While most synapses showed GluRIIA and GluRIIB spread over the entire PSD, high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> AZs were apposed by PSDs where GluRIIA concentrated at the center of the AZ, with GluRIIB forming a ring at the PSD periphery. Indeed, anti-glutamate receptor antibody staining of wildtype larvae lacking tagged glutamate receptors had previously identified a GluRIIB ring around the GluRIIA core in some mature third instar NMJ AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Marrus et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, activity-dependent segregation of GluRIIA and a GluRIIA gating mutant has been observed at individual AZs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Petzoldt et al., 2014</xref>). The correlation of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> with GluRIIA accumulation is especially intriguing considering that this subunit has been implicated in homeostatic and activity-dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frank, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Petersen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sigrist et al., 2003</xref>). By following the developmental acquisition of this postsynaptic property as a proxy for <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> from the first through third instar larval stages via intravital imaging in control and mutant backgrounds, we observed that the earliest formed AZs are the first to acquire this high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> signature over a time course of ~3 days, and that PSD maturation rate can be modulated by changes in presynaptic activity.</p><p>Similar to prior observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Melom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Peled and Isacoff, 2011</xref>), we found that most AZs at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ have a low <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>. For the current study, the AZ pool was artificially segregated into low and high release sites, with high releasing sites defined based on having a release rate greater than two standard deviations above the mean. Given that birthdate is a key predictor of glutamate receptor segregation, and by proxy <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, we expect the AZ pool to actually reflect a continuum of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> values based on their developmental history. However, using the two standard deviation criteria, 9.9% of AZs fell into the high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> category, with an average <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> of 0.28. We also observed that 9.7% of the AZs analyzed displayed only spontaneous release. We could detect no fusion events for either evoked or spontaneous release for another 14.6% of AZs that were defined by a GluRIIA-positive PSD in live imaging. Future investigation will be required to determine whether these cases represent immature AZs with extremely low evoked <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, or distinct categories reflective of differences in AZ content. The remaining AZs that participated in evoked release had an average <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> of 0.05. Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel density and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at individual AZs was a key determinant of evoked <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> heterogeneity, as <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> and the intensity of Cac channels tagged with either TdTomato or GFP displayed a strong positive correlation. Spontaneous fusion showed a much weaker correlation with both Cac density and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at individual AZs, consistent with prior studies indicating spontaneous release rates are poorly correlated with external Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at this synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jorquera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). With synaptic vesicle fusion showing a steep non-linear dependence upon external Ca<sup>2+</sup> with a slope of ~3–4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dodge and Rahamimoff, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heidelberger et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jan and Jan, 1976</xref>), a robust change in <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> could occur secondary to a relatively modest increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance over development. Although the number of VGCCs at a <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ AZ is unknown, estimates of Cac-GFP fluorescence during quantal imaging indicate a ~ 2 fold increase in channel number would be necessary to move a low <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> AZ into the high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> category. Similar correlations between evoked <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance have been found at mammalian synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Holderith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sheng et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting this represents a common evolutionarily conserved mechanism for determining release strength at synapses.</p><p>We did not test the correlation of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> with other AZ proteins besides Cac and BRP, but it would not be surprising to see a positive correlation with the abundance of many AZ proteins based on the observation that maturation time is a key determinant for <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>. Indeed, recent studies have begun to correlate <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> with specific AZ proteins at <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Reddy-Alla et al., 2017</xref>). We also observed that PSD size was robustly increased by 1.6-fold over a 24 hr period of AZ development during the early larval period in control animals. AZ maturation is likely to promote increased synaptic vesicle docking and availability, consistent with observations that correlate AZ size with either <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> or the readily releasable pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Holderith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Matkovic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Matz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Schikorski and Stevens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wadel et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We considered several models for how AZs acquire this heterogeneous nature of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> distribution during a developmental period lasting several days. One possibility is that unique AZs gain high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> status through a mechanism that would result in preferential accumulation of key AZ components compared to their neighbors. Given that retrograde signaling from the muscle is known to drive synaptic development at <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ball et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harris and Littleton, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Keshishian and Kim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">McCabe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Piccioli and Littleton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yoshihara et al., 2005</xref>), certain AZ populations might have preferential access to specific signaling factors that would alter their <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> state. Another model is that AZs compete for key presynaptic <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> regulators through an activity-dependent process. High <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> AZs might also be more mature than their low <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> neighbors, having a longer timeframe to accumulate AZ components. Given the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ is constantly forming new AZs at a rapid pace during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rasse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schuster et al., 1996</xref>), newly formed AZs would be less mature compared to a smaller population of ‘older’ high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> AZs.</p><p>To examine if the release heterogeneity observed at the third instar stage reflects AZ birth order over several days of development, we needed to extend the intravital imaging through a longer time period beginning in the first instar larval stage. GCaMP imaging indicated high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> sites segregate GluRIIA and GluRIIB differently from low <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> sites, with the IIA isoform preferentially localizing at the center of PSDs apposing high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> AZs. As such, we used developmental acquisition of this property as an indicator of high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> sites. Although segregation of glutamate receptors may not perfectly replicate the timing of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> acquisition during development, it is currently the best tool for estimating <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> during sequential live imaging. Based on the acquisition of GluRIIA/B segregation, the data support the hypothesis that increases in <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> reflect a time-dependent maturation process at the NMJ. The continuous addition of new AZs, which double in number during each day of development, ensures that the overall ratio of high to low <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> sites represents a low percentage as the NMJ grows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). We further established confidence in the age-dependency model of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> by mapping release after following NMJs intravitally for 24 hr; using this approach, we found that newly formed AZs are consistently very low <italic>P</italic><sub>r</sub>. Finally, we mapped <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> in the second instar stage and observed that the heterogeneity at this stage is shifted towards higher releasing sites, with a reduction in the fraction of low-releasing sites.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38268.026</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Model depicting the acquisition of release heterogeneity over three days of NMJ development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Presynaptically, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (yellow) and BRP (blue) are added over time to increase release probability.

Is AZ age a static determinant of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, or can growth rate be regulated to allow faster or slower acquisition of high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> AZs? To answer this question, we assayed whether mutants that alter presynaptic activity influence the rate of PSD growth and GluRIIA/B segregation. In <italic>BRP<sup>69/def</sup></italic>, <italic>syt1<sup>null</sup>,</italic> and <italic>nap<sup>TS</sup></italic> mutants with decreased presynaptic release, a significant reduction in postsynaptic maturation rate and in the percentage of PSDs with GluRIIA/IIB rings was observed. Conversely, in the <italic>shaker, eag</italic> double mutant with increased presynaptic excitability, a significantly increased rate of GluRIIB field size and a significant increase in GluRIIA/IIB rings was found compared to controls. To investigate whether differences in synapse growth and maturation rate could be seen between AZs enriched in BRP and Cac versus neighboring AZs that are deficient in these components, we imaged development in the <italic>rab3</italic> null mutant. At the first instar stage when AZs are roughly age matched, release sites enriched in presynaptic components had developed large and mature PSDs in stark contrast with non-enriched AZs, whose PSDs appeared immature. These results indicate that PSD maturation can be influenced by presynaptic activity at the resolution of single AZs.</p><p>Although how AZs are assembled during development is still being established, our data do not support a model where AZs are fully preassembled during transport and then deposited as a single ‘quantal’ entity onto the presynaptic membrane. Rather, these data support a model of seeding of AZ material that increases developmentally over time as AZs matures, consistent with previous studies of AZ development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Böhme et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fouquet et al., 2009</xref>). Although no evidence for rapid changes in <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> were detected in the steady-state conditions used in the current study, homeostatic plasticity is known to alter <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> over a rapid time frame (~10 min) at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frank, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frank et al., 2006</xref>). It will be interesting to determine if Cac abundance can change over such a rapid window, or whether the enhanced release is mediated solely through changes in Cac function and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Müller and Davis, 2012</xref>). Changes in the temporal order of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> development could also occur secondary to altered transport or capture of AZ material. For example, the large NMJ on muscle fibers 6 and 7 displays a gradient in synaptic transmission, with terminal branch boutons often showing a larger population of higher <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guerrero et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Peled and Isacoff, 2011</xref>). If AZ material is not captured by earlier synapses along the arbor, it would be predicted to accumulate in terminal boutons, potentially allowing these AZs greater access to key components, and subsequently increasing their rate of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> acquisition. Alternatively, the gradient of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> along the axon could be due to terminal boutons being slightly older than the rest of the arbor.</p><p>In summary, our data indicate that heterogeneity in release correlates highly with Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at AZs. Postsynaptically, PSDs apposed to high-releasing AZs display increased GluRIIA abundance and form segregated receptor fields, with GluRIIB forming a ring around a central core of GluRIIA. Release sites accumulate these high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> markers during a synapse maturation process in which newly formed AZs are consistently low <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, with AZs gaining signatures of high releasing sites over several days. Finally, mutations that increase or decrease presynaptic activity result in faster or slower rates of PSD maturation, respectively. These data add to our understanding of the molecular and developmental features associated with high versus low <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> AZs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Drosophila stocks</title><p>Flies were cultured at 25°C on standard medium.

The first 90 amino acids of Src64b, containing a myristoylation target sequence, were subcloned into pBID-UASc with EcoRI and BglII (creating pBID-UASc-myr). GCaMP6s cDNA (Addgene plasmid 40753) was cloned into pBID-UASc-myr with BglII and XbaI. To generate the UAS-GCaMP6m-Brp-short line, GCaMP6m (Addgene plasmid 40754) cDNA and Brp-short (gift from Dr. Tobias Rasse) were PCR amplified and double digested with EcoRI/BglII and BglII/XbaI, respectively. The two cDNA fragments were ligated and the product was used to PCR amplify the fused GCaMP6m-Brp-short cDNA. The PCR product was inserted into the vector backbone pBID-UASc after digestion with EcoRI and XbaI to generate the final plasmid pBID-UASc-GCaMP6m-Brp-short.

An Olympus LUMFL N 60X objective with a 1.10 NA was used to acquire GCaMP6s imaging data at 7 to 8 Hz. A Zeiss pan-APOCHROMAT 63X objective with 1.40 NA was used for imaging stained or live animals. third instar larvae were dissected in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free HL3 containing 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. After dissection, preparations were maintained in HL3 with 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1.3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> for 5 min. To stimulate the NMJ, motor nerves were cut close to the ventral ganglion and sucked into a pipette. Single pulses of current were delivered every one second for myr-jRGECO mapping or every three seconds for GCaMP6s mapping with an AMPI Master-8 stimulator using a stimulus strength just above the threshold for evoking EJPs. A 3D image stack was taken before the GCaMP imaging session to generate a full map of GluRIIA or Cac channel distribution. Later, single focal planes were imaged continuously for 4–5 min to collect GCaMP signals. Volocity 3D Image Analysis software (PerkinElmer) was used to analyze images. All images were Gaussian filtered (fine) to reduce noise and a movement-correction algorithm was applied. To enhance identification of myrGCaMP6 flashes, background myrGCaMP fluorescence was subtracted by creating a composite stack of 5–6 images during intervals when no synaptic release occurred. To identify the position of GluRIIA receptors and corresponding Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, a 3D stack image of GluRIIA was merged to create a single plane. AZ position was identified using the ‘find spot’ algorithm in Volocity 3.2 software that detects fluorescent peaks. ROIs with identical 5-pixel size (0.138 µm/pixel) were automatically generated by the software from identified GluRIIA spots. All GCaMP flashes were detected using the intensity threshold tool and assigned to specific ROIs based on proximity of their centroids. The time and location of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were imported into Excel or Matlab for further analysis. The number of observed GCaMP events per AZ was divided by the number of delivered stimuli to calculate AZ <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>. Analysis of Cac, BRP, GluRIIA or GluRIIB intensities was performed similarly, identifying AZ fluorescence peaks and defining three pixel square ROIs around each peak to calculate average fluorescence. Average AZ fluorescence intensities of 3-pixel square ROIs was also used for correlation analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>SIM and airyscan imaging</title><p>SIM microscopy was performed on an Applied Precision DeltaVision-OMX BLAZE-3D-Structural Illumination Microscope equipped with 60X, 1.4 NA oil objective and 3 sCMOS cameras. 3D-SIM images were obtained with 125 nm z-steps. Samples were illuminated by three central diffraction orders with 488, 562, and 640 nm lasers. For initial identification of specific NMJs, larvae were imaged in conventional confocal mode using a 20X oil objective. The positions of NMJ were marked and recorded to provide transition between objectives. A ZEISS LSM 800 microscope with Airyscan was also used to image anesthetized animals. Fluorescence was detected by a concentrically-arranged hexagonal detector array consisting of 32 single detector elements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Live imaging</title><p>Larvae were anesthetized with SUPRANE (desflurane, USP) from Amerinet Choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Larvae were incubated in a petri dish with a small paper towel containing Suprane for 1–2 min in a fume hood. Anesthetized larvae were positioned ventral side up on a glass slide between spacers made by transparent tape, which prevented extreme compression of the larvae. Different size spacers were required for the various larval stages. Larvae were covered with a thin film of halocarbon oil and then with a cover glass. NMJ synapses on muscle 26 in hemi-segment 2 or three were imaged. After an imaging session, larvae were placed in numbered chambers with food in a 25°C incubator. The same data acquisition settings where used to visualize NMJs at different larval stages. Larvae were imaged with either 6, 24 and 36 hr intervals for one data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>), or for 24 hr intervals for the remaining datasets. To keep the size consistent between different time periods, images of the corresponding NMJ area at younger stages were cut (dashed areas in figures) and placed onto a black background.

Your submission has been assessed by a Senior Editor in consultation with a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors (Hugo Bellen). Although the work is of interest, the editors felt more was needed to reveal enough new insight. However, they believe that if additional experiments are carried out and can answer specific questions, the manuscript could be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> given the high quality of the data and the contribution to the field. This means that the work has potential. By rejecting the paper at this point you are free to move on to another journal at this time. On the other hand, if you feel the requested expeiments would substantially improve the manuscript and you wish to do these experiments (or have already done them), <italic>eLife</italic> would welcome a resubmission of this work.</p><p>If you decide to resubmit to <italic>eLife</italic>, some comments should be addressed in the submission. These particular comments are indicated in the reviews with quotation marks (&quot;…&quot;).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, Akbergenova et al. seek to determine how the heterogeneity in release probability (Pr) is established across active zones at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ. Building from previous work this lab has pioneered in imaging presynaptic active zones (AZs) and the postsynaptic response from imaging single quantal release events, the authors now combine this optical quantal imaging with SIM microscopy and newly developed optical probes to provide compelling evidence for four main findings: First, <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> is a stable feature of each active zone and is highly correlated with the intensity of the BRP scaffold and calcium channel Cac at AZs. Second, <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> heterogeneity persists in Synaptotagmin mutants, consistent with AZ structures playing a primary role in determining <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>heterogeneity. Third, the subset of high <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>AZs acquire a change in the postsynaptic receptor field, including an enrichment in GluRIIA-containing receptors centrally opposed to AZs is observed, with GluRIIB-containing receptors located on the periphery. Finally, the authors undertake a challenging developmental analysis to provide evidence that the age of an active zone predicts <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, with the oldest AZs acquiring the most BRP/Cac material and hence exhibiting the highest <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>.</p><p>Overall, this is a technically impressive study that reveals correlations between functional and structural features of AZs and PSDs at unprecedented resolution. The authors findings are consistent with work from many other labs identifying a positive correlation between increasing size, intensity, and/or abundance of AZ components with enhanced release probability. Further, the authors have provided very good evidence for biomarkers of high release probability at individual AZs that will be important for many researchers in the field, in which high <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>AZs are defined by high intensities/size of BRP, Cac presynaptically and acquire the GluRIIA center/GluRIIB periphery structure. Although this central finding, that large active zones with high levels of calcium channels are highly correlated with high <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>was known or strongly suggested from previous studies, the previous work did not put together functional and structural analyses together to demonstrate these properties at such high resolution. Further, it is particularly impressive that the authors go on to developmentally follow AZs as they mature, and provide evidence for what leads to AZs with high <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, which appears to be essentially the age of the AZ. These are all important contributions. However, I have three major criticisms on both technical and biological importance that need to be addressed. The authors frame this study as if there is an open question about whether AZs components are allocated heterogeneously and whether this has a significant impact on <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>heterogeneity. It is not a major question or controversy that AZs with higher levels of calcium channels (and other associated machinery) will have a strong influence on <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>. Studies at the Calyx of Held have demonstrated that calcium channels respond consistently with each action potential at active zones and obviously more channels will give more calcium influx, increasing release probability (see Sheng et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2015; Schneggenburger et al., 2012; Borst and Sakmann, 1996; Meinrenken et al., 2012; Sudhof, 2012, etc). Thus, “I think the authors should clearly lay this out in the Introduction and use their approach here to test the relative importance of AZ size/abundance vs other factors (synaptic vesicle proteins, modifications to AZ machinery) in determining <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>heterogeneity”.</p><p>The technical rigor is what really stands out about this study, and though not particularly surprising, the validation of what many in the field have long suspected is still important. An important addition would be for the authors to estimate how much of the <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>heterogeneity is conferred by size/abundance of BRP/Cac at AZs (see below).</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Framing of manuscript: The authors frame this study as if there was little evidence one way or the other to indicate the likely mechanisms that impose <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>release heterogeneity at synapses. But as the authors point to towards the end the Discussion and in other areas of the manuscript, there is a large body of work that has already established that active zone size (and/or levels of AZ components at individual AZs) plays a major role in release probability and heterogeneity at synapses (see Holderith et al., 2012; Murthy et al., 2001; Matz et al., 2012; Ariel et al., 2012; Murthy et al., 1997; Rosenmund et al., 1993; Graf et al., 2009; Graf et al., 2012; Marrus and DiAntonio, 2004; Matkovic T et al., 2013). Further, it is well established that BRP size/intensity, as well as Cac intensity, varies considerably across AZs at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ; many studies have shown and quantified staining of BRP/Cac and other components at fly NMJs and shown a wide variation in size/intensity (Guerrero et al., 2005; Ehmann et al., 2014; Graf et. al, 2009; Paul et al., 2015; Peled and Isakoff, 2011). Several studies have also demonstrated that synaptic strength is positively correlated with such features (Wagh et al., 2006; Kittel et al., 2006; Kittel and Heckmann, 2016; Weyhersmuller et al., 2011). In addition to AZs, studies using Flash Photolysis at the Calyx of Held have shown that synaptic vesicles release with different intrinsic rates, independently of proximity to calcium sources (Wolfel et al., 2007; Schneggenburger et al., 2002). There is therefore a rich literature in which to frame the study as an investigation of the relative importance of AZ size/intensity/abundance vs other factors.</p><p>&quot;Thus, the Introduction needs to be significantly revised to lay out from the outset what is known and suspected and give proper credit in setting up the motivation for this study.&quot;</p><p>I would strongly encourage and push the authors to frame the manuscript as an effort to define the relative contributions and importance of 1) AZ size/abundance of AZ material; 2) functional modifications (phosphorylation, etc); and 3) synaptic vesicle pools in determining the heterogeneity of <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>at synapses. The authors find a strong correlation between BRP/Cac intensity and <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>, which is not particularly surprising. But can the authors take advantage of their quantitative approach and seek to provide estimates of the relative importance of factors beyond AZ/Cac abundance in determining <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>heterogeneity? Clearly there is not a perfect correlation with <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>and Cac intensity, so can the authors say something about the importance of other factors in contributing to <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>heterogeneity?</p><p>2) Investigate <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>heterogeneity when AZ size/number is altered: The authors provide compelling evidence that <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>heterogeneity persists in synaptotagmin mutants, indicating that heterogeneity is not absolutely dependent on a key determinant of <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>from synaptic vesicles. In this case, is <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>more strongly correlated with BRP/Cac abundance?</p><p>&quot;It would be a great addition to show to what extent <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>heterogeneity persists in a converse experiment – when AZ size is greatly enlarged (including BRP/Cac abundance), while AZ number/density is reduced in rab3 mutants (Graf et al., 2009). This would be of major interest and would nicely complement their study on syt mutants while serving to address the question on the relative importance of AZ size/abundance vs. synaptic vesicle/functional modifications in determining <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>heterogeneity. &quot;</p><p>3) Measuring calcium influx at AZs: The authors target the GCaMP6 reporter to active zones by fusing it to the BRPs sequence and claim that they are measuring differential calcium influx at each AZ (Figure 5 and 6). However, work from many groups have suggested that even the newest GCaMP reporters are too slow to capture the rapid calcium transients at AZ nanodomains, and instead the total calcium influx from all AZs equilibrates before GCaMP can capture the local change in concentration (see work from David DiGrigorio, Graeme Davis, Greg Macleod, etc). This is thought to be true for single action potential events and is even more of a concern using the 10Hz/5 sec paradigm by the authors. Hence, a very likely alternative explanation for the results shown in Figures 5 and 6 is that a similar concentration of calcium is experienced at each GCaMP-BRP puncta following the 10Hz stimulation, and that the abundance of the GCaMP reporter itself varies according to BRP/AZ size. Thus, the authors are simply reporting that GCaMP-BRP abundance correlates with BRP abundance at each AZ.</p><p>&quot;The authors can easily show this by immunostaining their GCamp-BRP NMJ with anti-GFP and correlating the size/intensity with anti-BRP. &quot;</p><p>Indeed, such as analysis was actually performed using a similar reagent published recently (BRPs-GCaMP6-mCherry; Kiragasi et al., 2017). The authors may wish to cite this study and/or even use this reagent to perform ratiometric calcium imaging with the mCherry tag, which may help to control for heterogeneity in abundance of the GCaMP reporter at AZs.</p><p>I don't think this is major point that detracts from the overall study, as higher BRP/Cac size/abundance almost certainly correlates with elevated calcium influx at individual active zones. But this section needs to be thoroughly revised to take into account this major possibility and the many caveats that the authors need to consider in their attempt to measure and interpret calcium influx at single active zones.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>This study used high resolution Calcium imaging to determine the components that contribute to or correlate with the heterogeneous distribution of AZ release probability <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>. Although most of the results confirm what is already known about the AZ <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>and therefore not surprising, providing direct measurement at such spatial and temporal resolution advances our understanding of the AZ <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>. The first half of the paper showed that the <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>heterogeneity is correlated with Calcium channel abundance and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The second half of the paper showed that the birth order of AZs determines the clustering of GluRII and <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>. It remains unclear whether the accumulation of presynaptic AZ material is determined by birth order and whether the coupling of pre- and post-synaptic material accumulation during development requires neurotransmission.</p><p>1) Correlation between pre- and post-synaptic calcium events. In evoked events, presynaptic calcium influx at the AZ is required for synaptic vesicle fusion, and AZ calcium transients are necessary (but not sufficient) for EPSP, therefore, one would expect a stronger correlation between pre- and postsynaptic calcium events (determined in Figure 6) than that between calcium channel localization/abundance and postsynaptic calcium events (Figure 4). However, the authors observed almost opposite results where postsynaptic calcium events seem to correlate better with channel localization/abundance (r=0.62 Figure 4B) than with calcium influx (r=0.56, Figure 6B). The authors didn't offer any interpretation. The conclusion that &quot;Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is the key factor that regulates evoked release at individual AZs&quot; is not fully supported, as the results support a &quot;correlation&quot; between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance/Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>. The actual &quot;regulator&quot;, which determines the presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance and local Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, still remains unknown. Also, in these experiments, it is unclear how the transgenes are expressed separately in the neuron and the muscle. The methods listed both transgenes, UAS-Cac-tdTomato, UAS-GCaMP, but no indication of GAL4 drivers used to express both either together or separately.</p><p>2) Developmental acquisition of <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>property. The finding of developmental clustering of GluRII is fascinating. If the birth order of AZs determines the level of maturation and the accumulation of GluRII, then the birth order also determines <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>and its heterogeneity.</p><p>&quot;It needs to be determined whether the presynaptic terminal influences/contributes to the postsynaptic GluRII clustering. The authors indicated feasibility issues with <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>map, however, measuring developmental/birth order clustering of Cac should be feasible, since Cac abundance is correlated with <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>. In addition, the developmental clustering of Calcium channels and GluRII should be done in syt mutant background to determine the effect of transmission (evoked or spontaneous).&quot;</p><p>3) NMJ specificity. Majority of the analysis focuses on the NMJ formed only by MN4-Ib onto muscle 4 at one time point (early L3 larvae). It will be valuable to at least include another NMJ, and include a different development stage (e.g., late L3 larve) for the <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>map (like Figure 1A-C).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>The authors build on previous work performed by them and others to understand the variability in release probability (<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>) seen at different active zones (AZ) at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ. They use some well-characterized and new genetic tools to measure calcium influx and localization of pre and post-synaptic machinery. Overall, they find Pr to be correlated with (a) BRP levels, (b) calcium channels (Cacophony), (c)Presynaptic calcium influx and d)GlurIIA levels at the PSD (Post synaptic density). They also determine that Synaptotagmin does not influence the heterogeneity of <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>at different AZs. Finally, they do in-vivo imaging to determine that &quot;birth order&quot; of AZ seems to correlate with <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>such that synapses that were formed earlier had higher <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>. Technically, the experiments are done very well. As such, a very nice descriptive analysis of various aspects that control <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>is presented.</p><p>The authors have failed to adequately test or describe the biological significance of the finding. Additionally, it is not clear how the findings presented significantly extend the body of knowledge that is present on how <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>is set at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ or elsewhere. For instance, the variability of <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>at different AZ at Muscle 4 has been demonstrated before and this has been correlated with levels of BRP (Peled, 2011). Levels of BRP is also correlated with the increased accumulation of Calcium channels (Fouquet, 2009) and this would presumably lead to higher calcium influx within these active zones. Furthermore, higher BRP levels are also correlated with higher GluRIIA levels at the PSD (Petzoldt, 2014).</p><p>If there is some finding that does diverge from previous work, the authors should make a stronger point to highlight that fact. Further genetic analysis could be used to delineate exactly how the different components (BRP, Cacophony, GlurII etc.) may affect <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>and. whether these proteins play independent or dependent roles in controlling the heterogeneity of <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>across AZ.</p><p>For example:</p><p>&quot;The authors could investigate how the various BRP alleles affect the <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>. The BRPnude allele does not seem to affect vesicle release but does affect synaptic depression. A conditional reversible knockdown of BRP has been documented (Nagarkar-Jaiswall et al., 2015). This allows one to control Brp levels.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Does the reduction in Cacophony levels by RNAi or mutants change the heterogeneity of <italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic>? would it be possible to use a calcium channel mutant with reduced activity to specifically differentiate whether the presence of the calcium channel is enough to define the high <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>or the influx of calcium is needed?&quot;</p><p>Similar analysis could be done with GluRII mutants or alleles such as GluRIIAE783A.</p><p>Furthermore, how does this developmentally controlled heterogeneity compare to synaptic plasticity? Are the identified high <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>sites the most prone to synaptic depression? Are the low <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>sites preferentially recruited to induce synaptic potentiation?</p><p>In the last section of the Results section, the authors correlate the number of mature AZs at the larval NMJ seen by in-vivo imaging with the number of high <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>AZs observed in the previous <italic>P<sub>r</sub> </italic>mapping. They must avoid concluding that because both numbers are similar (14.7% and 10% respectively), it supports their hypothesis about the link between AZ maturation and high <italic>P<sub>r</sub>.</italic>These are very different experiments (in-vivo imaging vs larval preparations) and are also conducted at different NMJs (Muscle 4 vs Muscle 26). The authors should follow up their in vivo imaging with calcium imaging on larval preps to show that the mature AZ do in fact have high Pr.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38268.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comments on our manuscript and suggestions for improvement.

We indicate the well-described previous links in the field to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in relation to synapse strength. We have reframed our data presentation as the reviewer suggests to lay out the relative importance of the AZ components versus other factors. In addition, we have shifted the last half of the study to investigate how activity alters PSD maturation during development to provide new insights that further separate our study from prior work.</p><p>Investigate P<sub>r</sub> heterogeneity when AZ size/number is altered: &quot;<italic>It would be a great addition to show to what extent P<sub>r</sub> heterogeneity persists in a converse experiment – when AZ size is greatly enlarged (including BRP/Cac abundance), while AZ number/density is reduced in rab3 mutants (Graf et al., 2009).

Prior work with <italic>rab3</italic> (Peled and Isacoff, 2011) had been done with optical quantal imaging to examine <italic>Pr</italic> in the mutant, revealing that the majority of sites have low <italic>Pr</italic>, with a smaller population of large release sites with much higher <italic>Pr</italic>. We observed a similar phenotype in our study and were able to extend the analysis by using the redistribution of <italic>Pr</italic> seen in the <italic>rab3</italic> NMJ as atool to examine the activity-dependence of postsynaptic glutamate receptor field maturation on presynaptic activity using intravital imaging across development (new Figure 10 and Figure 10—figure supplement 1). While prior studies of <italic>rab3</italic> mutants examined the third instar stage, we used sequential intravital imaging throughout the whole developmental window beginning in first instar larvae to determine how the NMJ develops with only a few large AZs containing Cac and BRP, while the rest of the AZs lack these components. We observed that glutamate receptor fields apposing BRP-enriched sites developed into a more mature state than PSDs apposing sites lacking BRP and Cac. This observation suggests that PSD maturation depends on either presynaptic components or presynaptic release at the level of single release sites. Coupled with new data we provide on other mutants that enhance or decrease neuronal activity, our findings indicate that the level of synaptic activity at single AZs is a key factor in controlling the rate of postsynaptic maturation of the glutamate receptor field.</p><p>Measuring calcium influx at AZs: <italic>“A very likely alternative explanation for the results shown in Figures 5 and 6 is that a similar concentration of calcium is experienced at each GCaMP-BRP puncta following the 10Hz stimulation, and that the abundance of the GCaMP reporter itself varies according to BRP/AZ size. I don't think this is major point that detracts from the overall study, as higher BRP/Cac size/abundance almost certainly correlates with elevated calcium influx at individual active zones. But this section needs to be thoroughly revised to take into account this major possibility and the many caveats that the authors need to consider in their attempt to measure and interpret calcium influx at single active zones.”</italic> </p><p>As the reviewer correctly points out, differences in BRP levels at individual AZs may affect our measurement. Although the use of ratiometric GCaMP-mcherry sensors for this work would be great, it is not feasible for our <italic>Pr</italic> mapping as we need the red channel for postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements to assign synaptic vesicle fusion events to individual AZs. As such, we have reworked this section to highlight this important caveat noted by the reviewer. We note that the GCaMP-BRP sensor data is used to support our conclusions drawn from the Cac localization studies and <italic>Pr</italic> mapping.</p><p>In addition, we experimentally addressed the reviewers comment as well. The nc82 antibody recognizes an epitope at the C-terminus of BRP and thus also recognizes BRP<sup>short</sup>. Therefore, we were unable to stain for endogenous BRP in this line without also labeling GCaMP-BRP<sup>short</sup>. We therefore approached this question using a different method; we applied the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore ionomycin to uniformly elevate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> throughout the presynaptic terminal. We then measured the heterogeneity in fluorescence from GCaMP-BRP<sup>short</sup> before applying ionomycin (baseline fluorescence), during 10 Hz stimulation, and after ionomycin application. In the presence of ionomycin, differences in fluorescence signals between AZs should be entirely due to heterogeneity in sensor abundance. We observed a rightward shift in the GCaMP-BRP<sup>short</sup> intensity distribution among AZs upon ionomycin application compared to 10 Hz stimulation (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B), indicating that detection of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by GCaMP-BRP<sup>short</sup> fluorescence during 10 Hz stimulation is not limited by sensor abundance. Furthermore, we observed a significant difference in the shape of the distribution during 10 Hz stimulation compared to both before stimulation and after ionomycin. The distribution of fluorescence intensities is narrower both at rest and upon ionomycin application; these two distributions should primarily reflect sensor distribution. In contrast, the distribution of GCaMPBRP<sup>short</sup> fluorescence upon 10 Hz stimulation is wider, indicating that the sensor is reporting local changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and not just sensor distribution (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, D). Thus, although GCaMP-BRP<sup>short</sup> abundance is likely to contribute to the levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx detected, these results are consistent with heterogeneity in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx across individual AZs. We have modified the text to clearly explain this caveat and have added a new supplemental figure for the ionomycin experiment (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We also added another experimental approach to further strengthen the connection between <italic>Pr</italic> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. We reasoned that if Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at AZs, and not just Cac abundance, is a driving factor in release heterogeneity, then specifically reducing the conductance of Cac should reduce <italic>Pr</italic> across the entire range of release, effectively shifting the distribution towards lower <italic>Pr</italic> but maintaining the overall shape of the distribution. As such, we performed <italic>Pr</italic> mapping in the <italic>cac<sup>NT27</sup></italic> mutant, which has a point mutation in the S4 voltage sensor that reduces Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and observed the expected change. These data provide functional validation that Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are important for overall <italic>Pr</italic> and are not simply correlated (not that this is a controversial assertion given the large number of studies demonstrating this point).</p><p>Reviewer 2 found the developmental analysis fascinating and suggested some valuable additional experiments and some clarifying modifications to the text.</p><p>1a) Correlation between pre- and post-synaptic calcium events. <italic>In evoked events, presynaptic calcium influx at the AZ is required for synaptic vesicle fusion, and AZ calcium transients are necessary (but not sufficient) for EPSP, therefore, one would expect a stronger correlation between pre- and postsynaptic calcium events (determined in Figure 6) than that between calcium channel localization/abundance and postsynaptic calcium events (Figure 4). However, the authors observed almost opposite results where postsynaptic calcium events seem to correlate better with channel localization/abundance (r=0.62 Figure 4B) than with calcium influx (r=0.56, Figure 6B). The authors didn't offer any interpretation.</italic> </p><p>The results represent correlations over a very large number of AZs across multiple animals. Although it is unclear why the correlation with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is slightly lower than with Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel density, it may be reflective of the fact that we have to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during a short train of action potentials rather than with the single stimuli we use to measure <italic>Pr</italic>. As such, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx measurements are not direct assays for single action potential Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and certainly reflect summation of signals over the short train. However, they do support the model that AZs with higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel density and overall higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx are likely to be higher <italic>Pr</italic> synapses. As described in reviewer 1 comment 3, we also added new functional data on the effect of a <italic>Cac</italic> mutant and its ability to support release as a mechanism to strengthen the model.</p><p>1b) Clarifying correlation vs. causation in release<italic>. The conclusion that &quot;Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is the key factor that regulates evoked release at individual AZs&quot; is not fully supported, as the results support a &quot;correlation&quot; between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance/Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and P<sub>r</sub>.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that causation cannot be inferred directly from the correlation between Cac abundance/Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and <italic>Pr</italic>. For example, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx could vary between AZs without serving as the limiting reagent for vesicle fusion. In response to this concern, we performed an additional genetic manipulation to test whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, independent of the structural presence of the channel, is truly a causative factor in evoked release at <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs. When we mapped release probability in <italic>cac<sup>NT27</sup></italic> mutants, which have lower conductance due to a point mutation in the S4 voltage sensor, we observed a significant downward shift in the distribution of <italic>Pr</italic> at the NMJ (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). This suggests that amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, rather than the mere presence of the channels, directly effects release at AZs across the release spectrum.</p><p>1c) The regulator of presynaptic calcium channel abundance. <italic>The actual &quot;regulator&quot;, which determines the presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance and local Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, still remains unknown.</italic> </p><p>Through our developmental analysis of AZ maturation using intravital imaging, we have shown that one key primary regulator of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance is age. Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels accumulate at AZs throughout their maturation process. We demonstrated that AZs add Cac throughout their development by following Cac-GFP and GluRIIA-RFP over time. Unlike the Cac-GFP area, the GluRIIA-RFP field is large enough to be reliably resolved by light microscopy, and we observed that the size and intensity of the GluRIIA field increases over time as AZs mature. Moreover, we saw a strong correlation between Cac-GFP intensity and GluRIIA intensity, suggesting these two components are tightly coupled during synapse maturation. Based on this information, we suggest that Cac abundance at AZs increases during maturation and that AZ age is a major factor in determining AZ Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance. There are likely to be many interesting mechanisms further regulating the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel accumulation and persistence at AZs, as well as the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel gating at individual AZs, and these are topics of interest moving forward.</p><p>1d) Clarifying expression of transgenes. <italic>“It is unclear how the transgenes are expressed separately in the neuron and the muscle. The methods listed both transgenes, UAS-CactdTomato, UAS-GCaMP, but no indication of GAL4 drivers used to express both either together or separately.”</italic></p><p>We thank this reviewer for pointing out the lack of clarity in our methods of transgene expression. In this study, all presynaptically driven transgenes (UAS-Cac-tdTomato, UAS-CacGFP, and UAS-GCaMP-BRP<sup>short</sup>) were expressed using the pan-neuronal driver elav-GAL4. Postsynaptically, UAS-myr-GCaMP6s was driven with the muscle driver <italic>mef2</italic>-GAL4 when coexpressed with GluRIIA-RFP, which was inserted on chromosome III and driven using its endogenous promoter. Myr-GCamP6s was driven using the LexA/LexOP system in muscle when combined with GluRIIA-RFP and GluRIIB-GFP which were both inserted on chromosome III and driven using their endogenous promoters. This has been clarified throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Developmental acquisition of P<sub>r</sub> property. The finding of developmental clustering of GluRII is fascinating. If the birth order of AZs determines the level of maturation and the accumulation of GluRII, then the birth order also determines P<sub>r</sub> and its heterogeneity… It needs to be determined whether the presynaptic terminal influences/contributes to the postsynaptic GluRII clustering. The authors indicated feasibility issues with P<sub>r</sub> map, however, measuring developmental/birth order clustering of Cac should be feasible, since Cac abundance is correlated with P<sub>r</sub>. In addition, the developmental clustering of Calcium channels and GluRII should be done in syt mutant background to determine the effect of transmission (evoked or spontaneous).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This was an excellent set of suggestions, and we performed an extensive number of experiments to address these questions; this new addition enhanced the novelty of this work and we are grateful to the reviewer for contributing these ideas. We addressed the question of whether differences in presynaptic activity levels can alter the maturation rate of synapses at the level of individual AZs. Instead of monitoring Cac-GFP and GluRIIA-RFP over time like the reviewer suggested, we chose to perform these experiments using GluRIIA-RFP and GluRIIB-GFP for two reasons. First, GluRIIA and GluRIIB co-labeling allows us to identify PSDs that display receptor subtype segregation, which is a useful marker for the progression of PSDs through maturation. Second, Cac-GFP puncta are smaller than the resolution limit of conventional light microscopy, and so all quantification through the cuticle would rely on comparisons in Cac puncta intensity that could be affected by bleaching and by varying cuticle thickness.</p><p>We began by measuring the rate of PSD growth (24-hour fold-increase in GluRIIB area) and maturation (percent of PSDs displaying GluRIIA/GluRIIB segregation) in <italic>BRP<sup>69/def</sup></italic> mutants that (1) alter presynaptic structure and (2) decrease release by reducing Cac abundance at AZs. In this mutant we observed a significant reduction in both PSD growth and ring formation. In <italic>syt1<sup>null</sup>,</italic> and <italic>nap<sup>TS</sup></italic> mutants that reduce presynaptic release without structural changes to the AZ, we also observed a significant reduction in postsynaptic maturation rate (Figure 10). In the <italic>shaker, eag</italic> double mutant with increased presynaptic excitability, we observed a significantly increased rate of GluRIIB field size increase when compared to control, and a significant increase in GluRIIB rings at the early second instar stage (Figure 10). Finally, we used the <italic>rab3</italic> null mutant to investigate whether differences in PSD growth and maturation rate could occur between AZs containing BRP and Cac versus neighboring AZs within the same NMJ that are deficient in these components. In the first instar stage when AZs are roughly age matched, we saw that release sites enriched in presynaptic components had developed large and mature PSDs in stark comparison with un-enriched AZs, whose PSDs were underdeveloped (Figure 10, supplementary figure 1). Overall, these results strongly suggest that presynaptic activity drives postsynaptic maturation rate at an AZ-specific level and opens many exciting questions for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>NMJ specificity. Majority of the analysis focuses on the NMJ formed only by MN4-Ib onto muscle 4 at one time point (early L3 larvae). It will be valuable to at least include another NMJ, and include a different development stage (eg, late L3 larve) for the P<sub>r</sub> map (like Figure 1A-C).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that <italic>Pr</italic>mapping at a different developmental stage and another NMJ are valuable additions to this study, even beyond their ability to determine how generalizable our observations of release heterogeneity are across synapses and across developmental stages. Mapping release at muscle 26 serves to connect the work we have done building correlations between release and synapse component density in muscle 4 with the work performed following AZ maturation over development at muscle 26. We were pleased to see that when we mapped release at muscle 26 in the third instar stage, the distribution in <italic>Pr</italic>was indistinguishable from the distribution seen at the NMJ on muscle 4 (Figure 9—figure supplement 1). This suggests that our findings in these two NMJs are indeed comparable, and that <italic>Pr</italic> heterogeneity is not specific to muscle 4. Mapping release in the second instar provides another way to test our model that AZ age and developmental maturation are key determinants of <italic>Pr</italic> heterogeneity during NMJ development. Based on our observation that the number of AZs roughly doubles every 24 hours of development, and that AZs are born weak and undergo a multi-day maturation process where they develop high <italic>Pr</italic>, we would expect the second instar NMJ to show a shift in <italic>Pr</italic> distribution when compared to the third instar NMJ. Specifically, we would expect a lower percentage of low <italic>Pr</italic> sites in second instar stage (as the number of AZs will double over the next 24 hours and the newly added AZs will be low <italic>Pr</italic>). Indeed, when we mapped <italic>Pr</italic> in the second instar stage, we observed the expected shift in the distribution ((Figure 9—figure supplement 1)), providing support for the model that developmental maturation and new AZ addition over time generates heterogeneity at the NMJ.</p><p>Reviewer 3 indicated the manuscript was technically done very well but wanted clarification on the biological significance of the findings and the novelty of the current data.</p><p>1a) Describing biological significance.</p><p>We thank this reviewer for pointing out the lack of discussion on the novelty of this work, and we have altered the text significantly to further contextualize these results. Though it has already been shown that <italic>Pr</italic> heterogeneity exists across the NMJ (Peled 2011, Melom 2013) and that <italic>Pr</italic> correlates with levels of BRP (Reddy-Alla et al., 2017, Muhammad et al., 2015, Peled et al., 2014), the work presented here extends this body of knowledge in multiple important ways.</p><p>Combining our green Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor with GluRIIA-RFP to mark individual release sites has allowed us to provide a higher resolution view of the correlation between single AZ evoked release and BRP, Cac, and GluRIIA abundance. GluRIIA-RFP also allowed us to employ superresolution structured illumination microscopy after quantal imaging to confirm that high releasing sites correspond to single AZs. This increase in resolution is essential for understanding release heterogeneity at the NMJ, where single BRP T-bars are smaller than the resolution of conventional light microscopy and can be closely clustered.</p><p>We have assessed the role of local synaptic vesicle pools in determining local release heterogeneity. Though it has been established that certain synaptic vesicle components (like Syt1) are dominant factors in determining <italic>Pr</italic> at synapses, the role of local synaptic vesicle pools in determining release heterogeneity across AZs of the NMJ has not been explored. By showing that heterogeneity in release is retained in <italic>syt1</italic> null mutants, and is stable during extensive synaptic vesicle cycling, the study indicates that AZ-specific, differentially fusogenic synaptic vesicle populations are unlikely to underlie the heterogeneity in release observed at the NMJ.</p><p>We have shown that AZ maturation throughout the three stages of larval development plays a dominant role in generating the extreme release heterogeneity that we and other labs have observed in the third instar larval stage. The Sigrist lab has previously demonstrated that AZs gain presynaptic and postsynaptic components over time, generating the hypothesis that AZ aging process may lead to increasing AZ <italic>Pr</italic>. However, to demonstrate that the heterogeneity observed at the third instar stage results largely from AZ birth date, we needed to extend this intravital imaging of individual release sites through a longer time period starting much earlier in development to show that the heterogeneity in developmental birth order is a major source of heterogeneity in AZ release probability at the third instar stage. This long-term developmental perspective, extending from early first to third instar stages, provides an important developmental picture of how release heterogeneity arises. Since the field typically uses the third instar NMJ as a model to study presynaptic release, understanding how functional release heterogeneity seen at the third instar NMJ is established from a molecular and developmental perspective provides valuable information about this common model synapse.</p><p>We have included additional experiments to show that postsynaptic maturation rate is activity-dependent and can occur at an active zone-specific level (this is discussed below). To our knowledge, this has not been previously demonstrated at the NMJ. Overall, these results provide a more developmentally complete and technically higher resolution understanding of how release heterogeneity at the NMJ arises during development.</p><p><italic>1b)</italic> Furthering biological significance through more genetic analysis. <italic>“Further genetic analysis could be used to delineate exactly how the different components (BRP, Cacophony, GlurII etc.) may affect P<sub>r</sub> and. whether these proteins play independent or dependent roles in controlling the heterogeneity of P<sub>r</sub> across AZ… The authors could investigate how the various BRP alleles affect the P<sub>r</sub>.The BRPnude allele does not seem to affect vesicle release but does affect synaptic depression. A conditional reversible knockdown of BRP has been documented (Nagarkar-Jaiswall et al., 2015). This allows one to control Brp levels.&quot;</italic> </p><p>This reviewer encouraged us to move beyond building correlations between AZ components and release probability in wildtype animals and to begin using genetic manipulations to further understand the generation of heterogeneous <italic>Pr</italic> at the NMJ. Since we have shown that AZ age is a strong contributor to the abundance of pre- and postsynaptic proteins that our lab and others have shown to correlate with <italic>Pr</italic> heterogeneity at the NMJ, we added an entire set of new experiments to investigate what parameters affect age-dependency of <italic>Pr</italic>. First, we established confidence in the age-dependency of <italic>Pr</italic> using two new experiments; we showed that all new active zones (under 24 hours old) are low <italic>Pr</italic> (Figure 9F, G). Second, we mapped <italic>Pr</italic> in the second instar stage and showed that, in line with what our model predicts, the heterogeneity in release in the second instar is shifted towards higher releasing sites, with a reduction in low-releasing sites (Figure 9—figure supplement 1).</p><p>After further documenting the age-dependence of <italic>Pr</italic>, we addressed the concern that further genetic manipulations could be used to determine how overall component accumulation during development could shape <italic>Pr</italic> distribution by assaying whether mutants that alter presynaptic activity can influence synapse maturation rate (Figure 10). We measured the rate of PSD growth (24-hour fold-increase in GluRIIB area) and GluRIIA/B segregation in mutants with altered presynaptic activity. In the <italic>BRP<sup>69/def</sup>, syt1<sup>null</sup>,</italic> and <italic>nap<sup>TS</sup></italic> mutants with decreased presynaptic release, we observed a significant reduction in postsynaptic maturation rate and a significant reduction in GluRIIA/IIB rings (Figure 10). In the <italic>shaker, eag</italic> double mutant with increased presynaptic excitability, we observed a significantly increased rate of GluRIIB field size increase compared to control, and a significant increase in GluRIIB rings at the early second instar stage (Figure 10).

As another approach to test whether the level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx rather than the structural presence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel is responsible for determining <italic>Pr</italic>, we generated <italic>Pr</italic> maps in the <italic>cac<sup>NT27</sup></italic> mutant using dual color quantal imaging, with GluRIIA-RFP and myrGCamP6s expressed postsynaptically in the muscle. Cac<sup>NT27</sup> channels have reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance due to a point mutation in the Cac S4 voltage sensor (Rieckhof et al. 2003). We observed that <italic>cac<sup>NT27</sup></italic> results in a global decrease in <italic>Pr</italic> across AZs; WT evoked <italic>Pr</italic> ranged from 0 to 0.73 with an average of 0.073, while <italic>Cac<sup>NT2</sup> Pr</italic> ranged from 0 to 0.47 with a significantly lower average of 0.049 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). In this mutant, the entire <italic>Pr</italic> distribution was shifted towards low <italic>Pr</italic> when compared to controls, and the resulting NMJ was almost entirely populated with low-releasing AZs. This result strongly suggests that the levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Cac channels, and not the physical presence of the channels, is a primary determinant of <italic>Pr</italic> at AZs.</p><p><italic>1d)</italic> Differential short term plasticity across AZs <italic>“Furthermore, How does this developmentally controlled heterogeneity compare to synaptic plasticity? Are the identified high P<sub>r</sub> sites the most prone to synaptic depression?

These questions have been previously addressed by Peled and Isacoff (2011); here, the authors demonstrated that high releasing AZs tend to depress during paired pulse stimulation, while lower releasing AZs facilitate. Thus, the developmentally generated heterogeneity in <italic>Pr</italic> across AZs results in a population of AZs with distinct short-term plasticity properties. We have included a description of this result in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1e) In the last section of the Results section, the authors correlate the number of mature AZs at the larval NMJ seen by in-vivo imaging with the number of high P<sub>r</sub> AZs observed in the previous P<sub>r</sub> mapping. They must avoid concluding that because both numbers are similar (14.7% and 10% respectively), it supports their hypothesis about the link between AZ maturation and high P<sub>r</sub>. These are very different experiments (in-vivo imaging vs. larval preparations) and are also conducted at different NMJs (Muscle 4 vs. Muscle 26). The authors should follow up their in-vivo imaging with calcium imaging on larval preps to show that the mature AZ do in fact have high P<sub>r</sub>.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion, and we have altered the text and performed two additional experiments to address this point. First, as the reviewer pointed out, it is not ideal to compare release distributions at muscle 4 versus muscle 26 without directly demonstrating that these two NMJs have a similar distribution of <italic>Pr</italic>. To address this issue, we mapped release at muscle 26 using the same methods that were used to map release in our initial experiments at muscle 4. When we compared the release distributions at the two NMJs, we saw that the distributions were not significantly different (Figure 9—figure supplement 1). Second, we followed the suggestion of this reviewer to directly assess whether AZ age corresponds to <italic>Pr</italic> by mapping <italic>Pr</italic> after determining the developmental age of AZs using intravital imaging. We followed PSDs in animals expressing GluRIIA-RFP, GluRIIB-GFP, and myr-GCaMP for 24 hours using in vivo imaging, and then dissected the animal and mapped <italic>Pr</italic> (Figure 9F). We observed that PSDs that appeared on the second day of imaging (less than 24 hours old) were consistently associated with very low-<italic>Pr</italic> AZs. The mean <italic>Pr</italic>of newly-formed AZs was 0.035, and the <italic>Pr</italic> for AZs older than 24 hours was 0.15 (Figure 9G). This result supports a model in which a vast majority of AZs are born weak, and higher Pr takes more than 24 hours to develop.</p></body></sub-article></article>
