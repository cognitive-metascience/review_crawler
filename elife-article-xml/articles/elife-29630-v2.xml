transcript-dependent nuclear export influence is poorly understood. Here, we report a novel pathway in which LPS/TLR4 engagement promotes nuclear localization of IRAK2 to facilitate nuclear export of a specific subset of inflammation-related mRNAs for translation in murine macrophages. IRAK2 kinase activity is required for LPS-induced RanBP2-mediated IRAK2 sumoylation and subsequent nuclear translocation. Array analysis showed that an SRSF1-binding motif is enriched in mRNAs dependent on IRAK2 for nuclear export. Nuclear IRAK2 phosphorylates SRSF1 to reduce its binding to target mRNAs, which promotes the RNA binding of the nuclear export adaptor ALYREF and nuclear export receptor Nxf1 loading for the export of the mRNAs. In summary, LPS activates a nuclear function of IRAK2 that facilitates the assembly of nuclear export machinery to export selected inflammatory mRNAs to the cytoplasm for translation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29630.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The innate immune system is the body’s first line of defense against invading microbes. Some immune cells carry specific receptor proteins called Toll-like receptors that can identify microbes and the signals they emit. As soon as the receptors have detected a threat – for example through sensing oily molecules that make up the cell membranes of microbes – they produce signaling proteins called cytokines and chemokines to alert other immune cells.</p><p>The DNA in the cell’s nucleus carries the instructions needed to make proteins. To produce proteins, including cytokines and chemokines, the information first has to be transferred into mRNA templates, which carry the instructions to the sites in the cell where the proteins are made. Cytokine and chemokine mRNAs are generally short-lived, but previous studies in 2009 and 2011 have shown that an enzyme called IRAK2 can stabilize them to make them last longer. IRAK enzymes are activated by the Toll-like receptors after a threat has been detected. However, until now it was not known whether IRAK2 also helps to transport the mRNAs of cytokines and chemokines out of the cell nucleus.</p><p>Using immune cells of mice, Zhou et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the previous studies – discovered that IRAK2 helped to export the mRNAs of cytokines and chemokines from the immune cell nucleus into the surrounding cell fluid. The Toll-like receptors recognized the oily molecules of the microbes and consequently activated IRAK2, which lead to IRAK2 being moved into the cell nucleus.</p><p>Once activated, IRAK2 helped to assemble the export machinery that moved selected mRNAs out of the nucleus to build the proteins. To do so, IRAK2 stopped a destabilizing protein from binding to the mRNA, so that instead the export machinery could transport the mRNA of the cytokines and chemokines out of the cell nucleus.</p><p>A next step will be to test whether IRAK2 is required to guide exported mRNA tothe sites in the cell where the proteins are made. This new insight could help to develop new treatments for various diseases. For example, diseases in which the immune system attacks the cells of the body, rather than invaders, can be caused by too many cytokines and chemokines. Since IRAK2 helps to control the availability of cytokines and chemokines it may in future be used as a new drug target.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>toll-like receptor</kwd><kwd>RNA export</kwd><kwd>nuclear translocation</kwd><kwd>sumoylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG5130A2/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiaoxia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2PO1HL029582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiaoxia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000041</institution-id><institution>American Diabetes Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Research Fellow Award,1-16-PDF-138</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015/19/B/NZ6/01578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bulek</surname><given-names>Katarzyna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO1CA062220</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiaoxia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The stimulation of lipopolysaccharides induced nuclear localization of IRAK2 to facilitate nuclear export of a specific subset of inflammation-related messenger RNAs for translation in murine macrophages.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells produce mRNA in the nucleus through a series of events including 5’ capping, 3’-end processing and splicing, which are coupled with transcription. Once these processes are complete, mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it can be translated to generate proteins. Nxf1 (also known as TAP) is the key mRNA export receptor, which only binds processed mRNA. Upon completion of mRNA processing, Nxf1 is recruited to the mRNA along with the TREX complex to promote the nuclear export the mRNA. The nuclear export adaptor ALYREF, a subunit of the TREX complex, plays a critical role in integrating the signals provided by mRNA processing and in triggering nuclear export receptor Nxf1 loading for the export of the target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Viphakone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>). ALYREF-Nxf1 interaction provides a mark on mRNA to signify that nuclear RNA-processing events are complete, and the processed mRNA is ready for export to the cytoplasm. Several other proteins have also been implicated as nuclear export adaptors, including the shuttling SR (serine- and arginine-rich) proteins 9G8, SRp20 and SRSF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2003</xref>). However, it remains unclear how these nuclear export adaptors interact with different classes of mRNAs to achieve sequence-specific, stimulus-dependent export of target transcripts.</p><p>Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling regulates the expression of chemokines and cytokines at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson, 2008</xref>). Cytokine and chemokine mRNAs have short half-lives because of conserved cis-elements in their three prime untranslated regions (3’ UTRs). Much effort has been devoted to understand how the conserved cis-elements within the 3’ UTR can be recognized by RNA-binding proteins (including SRSF1) that function to mediate mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fenger-Grøn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lykke-Andersen and Wagner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mayr, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, whether and how cytokine and chemokine mRNAs are regulated during nuclear export in response to TLR stimulation is unknown. TLRs transduce signals through the adaptor molecule MyD88 and IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) family members, including IRAK1, IRAK2 and IRAK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kawai and Akira, 2011</xref>). IRAK4 is the upstream kinase of IRAK1 and IRAK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). IRAK1 is necessary for TAK1-dependent NFκB activation for the transcription of chemokines and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yao et al., 2007</xref>). IRAK2 is an atypical kinase that mediates posttranscriptional regulation of inflammatory transcripts. Deletion of IRAK2 impairs the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in macrophages in response to TLR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yin et al., 2011</xref>) without affecting transcription of inflammatory genes. However, the precise mechanism by which IRAK2 controls the posttranscriptional regulation of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production is an evolving area of investigation.</p><p>Here, we report that LPS induces IRAK2 nuclear localization to facilitate nuclear export of a subset of inflammatory mRNAs (including <italic>Cxcl1</italic>, <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Cxcl2</italic>) to the cytosol for protein translation. IRAK2 kinase activity is required for LPS-induced RanBP2-mediated IRAK2 sumoylation, which facilitates IRAK2 nuclear translocation. By array analysis, we identified an SRSF1-binding motif enriched selectively in mRNA targets dependent on IRAK2 for nuclear export. IRAK2 phosphorylates SRSF1 and thereby reduces SRSF1 binding to the target mRNAs. On the other hand, SRSF1 knockdown resulted in increased nuclear export of the target mRNAs. Importantly, LPS induced the interaction of IRAK2 with the nuclear export factors ALYREF and Nxf1 recruiting them to the target mRNAs. While the depletion of SRSF1 allowed nuclear export adaptor ALYREF binding to the target mRNAs, LPS/IRAK2-induced recruitment of nuclear export receptor Nxf1 to the target transcripts was abolished by the knockdown of ALYREF. Thus, SRSF1-mediated nuclear sequestration of target mRNAs might be achieved by blocking the binding of ALYREF and Nxf1 to the mRNAs. Taken together, our results suggest that while SRSF1 binding renders target mRNAs sensitive for nuclear export, LPS promotes a nuclear function of IRAK2 that mediates the removal of SRSF1 and facilitates the assembly of nuclear export machinery to export the inflammatory mRNAs to the cytosol for protein translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LPS induced IRAK2 modification and nuclear translocation</title><p>We and others have previously reported that IRAK2 plays a critical role in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to TLR stimulation. However, the detailed molecular mechanism is not completely understood. IRAK2 is an atypical kinase due to the amino acid substitution of key catalytic residues (Asp -&gt; Asn<sup>333</sup>; Asp -&gt;His<sup>351</sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is supported by the demonstration of catalytic activities of atypical kinases such as KSR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brennan et al., 2011</xref>) and CASK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mukherjee et al., 2008</xref>). The recombinant wild-type IRAK2 as well as IRAK2 mutants (ATP-binding site mutant KK235AA and catalytic site mutant H351A) were purified by using a bacterial expression system.

While importin-β is one of the transport receptor mediating translocation of molecules into the cell nucleus, RanBP2 is a major nucleoporin that extends cytoplasmic filaments from the nuclear pore complex and contains phenylalanine–glycine repeats that bind nuclear transport receptors of the importin beta family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yokoyama et al., 1995</xref>).

These results suggest that the IRAK2 kinase activity is not required for IRAK2’s NLS to engage the importin complex. On the other hand, IRAK2 KK235AA and H351A/N333A kinase-inactive mutants and as well as NLS mutant lost interaction with RanBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It has been reported that LPS stimulation induces the phosphorylation of IRAK2 at S136 and T140 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Weintz et al., 2010</xref>).

The subdivision of eukaryotic cells into nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments enables spatial separation of transcription and translation. We hypothesized that LPS-induced IRAK2 nuclear localization may facilitate nuclear export of the inflammatory mRNAs to cytosol for translation after their transcription in the nucleus. To test this hypothesis, we isolated nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA from untreated and LPS-treated wild-type and IRAK2-deficient macrophages, followed by array analysis.

We hypothesized that the impact of IRAK2 on the nuclear exportation of the mRNAs (enriched with SRSF1-binding motifs) might be through IRAK2-mediated modulation on SRSF1. Interestingly, we detected SRSF1-IRAK2 interaction in the nucleus by duo-link assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), which was abolished for IRAK2 kinase-inactive and sumoylation mutants. Furthermore, IRAK2 was able to phosphorylate SRSF1 in the in vitro kinase assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In support of this, we found that LPS indeed induced SRSF1 serine/threonine phosphorylation, which was diminished in IRAK2-kinase-inactive nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Previous studies have shown that SRSF1 binds RNA in its hypo-phosphorylated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sanford et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xiao and Manley, 1997</xref>), suggesting that IRAK2-mediated SRSF1 phosphorylation probably drives the dissociation of SRSF1 from the mRNA targets, promoting their nuclear export. By RNA immunoprecipitation, we indeed found that SRSF1-bound transcripts (<italic>Cxcl1</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic>) were increased in IRAK2-deficient and IRAK2-kinase-inactive macrophages compared to that in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that IRAK2 may directly phosphorylate SRSF1 in the nucleus in response to LPS stimulation, which facilitates the dissociation of SRSF1 from the LPS-induced transcripts, and the subsequent nuclear export of these mRNAs. Notably, SRSF1 also plays a critical role in regulating genes that are constitutively expressed, such as <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> (β-catenin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, SRSF1-bound transcript <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> was not affected by either LPS stimulation or IRAK2 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), indicating that IRAK2 may only regulate a specific subset of SRSF1-targeted mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>IRAK2 mediates the recruitment of ALYREF nuclear export factor to the target mRNAs</title><p>The next question is how IRAK2 mediates nuclear export of the LPS-induced mRNAs bound by SRSF1.

On the other hand, IRAK2 was detected in either SRSF1 or ALYREF immunoprecipitates in response to LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These results suggest that LPS-induced IRAK2’s interaction with SRSF1 and ALYREF are mutually exclusive. The fact that IRAK2 was able to phosphorylate SRSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) led us hypothesize that IRAK2-mediated SRSF1 phosphorylation might drive SRSF1 off the mRNA targets, allowing ALYREF’s binding to the target mRNAs.

Nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments enable spatial separation and regulation of transcription and translation. In this study, we report that LPS/TLR4 engagement activates a nuclear function of IRAK2 that facilitates the assembly of nuclear export machinery to enable export the inflammatory mRNAs to the cytosol for protein translation. IRAK2 kinase activity is required for RanBP2-mediated IRAK2 sumoylation and nuclear translocation. Array analysis identified an SRSF1-binding motif enriched in the mRNAs that are accumulated in the nucleus of IRAK2-deficient and IRAK2-kinase inactive macrophages. Nuclear IRAK2 then phosphorylates SRSF1 and reduces SRSF1 binding to the target mRNAs. At the same time, LPS induces interaction between IRAK2 and nuclear export adaptor ALYREF to replace SRSF1 on the target mRNAs. The recruited ALYREF in turn bridges the interaction between the mRNA targets and nuclear export receptor Nxf1, triggering nuclear export receptor Nxf1 loading for the export of the mRNAs. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) Therefore, LPS-induced IRAK2 activation provides a critical check point for the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by controlling the nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of the LPS-induced transcripts.</p><p>IRAK2 is known as an atypical kinase due to the amino acid substitution of key catalytic residues (Asp -&gt; Asn<sup>333</sup>; Asp -&gt;His<sup>351</sup>). Notably, atypical kinases such as KSR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brennan et al., 2011</xref>) and CASK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mukherjee et al., 2008</xref>) have been reported to carry catalytic activity. We found recombinant IRAK2 was able to autophophorylate and phosphorylate MBP and SRSF1; mutations in the ATP-binding site and catalytic residues impaired the function of IRAK2. IRAK2 kinase-inactive knockin mice showed substantially increased survival after LPS-induced septic shock compared to that of the wild-type mice. Likewise, LPS-induced serum CXCL1 and TNF levels were much reduced in IRAK2 kinase-inactive knockin mice compared to that of the wild-type mice. Taken together, these results indicate that the IRAK2 kinase activity is critical for the function of IRAK2 in LPS-induced pro-inflammatory response.</p><p>While LPS-induced IRAK2 modification was previously reported, we now identified RanBP2 as the E3 ligase for IRAK2 sumoylation. We also for the first time report that LPS induces IRAK2 nuclear translocation, which seems to be dependent on LPS-induced IRAK2 sumoylation. IRAK2 mutants defective in sumoylation were retained in the cytoplasm. Likewise, LPS-induced IRAK2 nuclear translocation was abolished in RanBP2 knock-down cells, supporting the critical role of IRAK2 sumoylation for its nuclear translocation. Consistently, RanBP2 was shown to modulate cytoplasmic and nuclear transport of macromolecules. RanBP2 is a major nucleoporin that extends cytoplasmic filaments from the nuclear pore complex and contains phenylalanine–glycine repeats that bind the transport receptor importin-β. Indeed, IRAK2 was also shown to interact with importin-β, which requires the NLS on IRAK2. It is intriguing that although IRAK2 kinase inactive mutants still interact with importin-β, they were unable to interact with RanBP2 and failed to translocate into the nucleus. While these results suggest a potential impact of IRAK2 kinase activity on RanBP2, IRAK2 autophosphorylation may affect its interaction with RanBP2. Our data showed that mutations in putative IRAK2 phosphorylation sites S136/T140 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Weintz et al., 2010</xref>) substantially reduced the interaction of IRAK2 with RanBP2. It suggests that the activation of IRAK2 may result in auto-phosphorylation at S136A and T140A, which in turn mediates the interaction with RanBP2. Future studies are required to elucidate the detailed mechanism for how phosphorylation of IRAK2 affects its interaction with RanBP2 and subsequent sumoylation.</p><p>In addressing the functional impact of LPS-induced IRAK2 nuclear translocation, we found that IRAK2 plays a critical role in promoting nuclear export of LPS-induced transcripts. By array analysis, a SRSF1-binding motif was found to be enriched in the mRNAs targets that are dependent on IRAK2 for nuclear export. As discussed above, recombinant IRAK2 was able to phosphorylate SRSF1 and LPS-activated IRAK2 can phosphorylate SRSF1 and thereby reduces SRSF1 binding to the target mRNAs in macrophages. These results suggest that SRSF1 binding endows target mRNAs with sensitivity for LPS to promote nuclear export, and that LPS induces nuclear function of IRAK2 to mediate the removal of SRSF1 from the target mRNAs. Importantly, Mass Spec analysis showed that IRAK2 also interacts with nuclear export adaptor ALYREF in addition to importin-β and RanBP2. Notably, ALYREF and SRSF1 actually belong to the same family of proteins called the shuttling SR (serine- and arginine-rich) proteins, sharing a similar RNA-binding domain. Indeed, we found SRSF1 and ALYREF were able to bind to the same SRSF1-binding motif; and the removal of SRSF1 allowed nuclear export adaptor ALYREF binding to the target mRNAs, suggesting that SRSF1-mediated nuclear sequestration of target mRNAs might be achieved by blocking the binding of ALYREF to the mRNAs. Importantly, previous studies have reported that ALYREF (a subunit of the so-called TREX complex for nuclear export) makes contact with nuclear export receptor Nxf1, serving as a bridge between mRNA and nuclear export receptor Nxf1. Thus, nuclear IRAK2 mediates the removal of SRSF1 and facilitates the assembly of nuclear export machinery to export the inflammatory mRNAs to the cytosol for translation. Interestingly, about 10–30% LPS-induced inflammatory transcripts were exported out of the nucleus in the absence of IRAK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which was consistent with the residual ALYREF’s binding to these transcripts in IRAK2-/- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results implicate that there might be yet another mechanism besides IRAK2 that allows ALYREF binding to the target mRNAs for nuclear export. Future studies are required to identify additional players that modulate TLR-induced nuclear/cytosol distribution of inflammatory transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>IRAK2-deficient mice were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wan et al., 2009</xref>).

Permeabilized cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 hr at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 10% normal goat serum supplemented with 0.1% Tween at 4°C overnight. Following the incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with two PLA probes (Duolink In Situ PLA Probes Anti-rabbit PLUS and Anti-Mouse MINUS, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hr at 37°C. After probe incubation, the samples were incubated in ligation solution for 1 hr at 37°C. After ligation, cells were washed with Wash Buffer A and incubated in the amplification solution for 2 hr at 37°C. Cells were then serially washed twice in 1 × Wash Buffer B, 0.01 × Wash Buffer B once, and PBS once, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted in Duolink In Situ Mounting Medium supplemented with DAPI. Fluorescence images were obtained with a confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Real-time PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from spinal cord with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 µg total RNA for each sample was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The resulting complementary DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR using SYBR Green Real-Time PCR Master Mix. All gene expression results are expressed as arbitrary units relative to expression Actin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Microarray analysis</title><p>Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA were extracted from WT and IRAK2-deficient macrophages and subjected to microarray analysis. Targets preparation was performed on a Biomek FXP (Beckman Coulter) using a GeneChip HT 3′IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instruction. Labeled cRNA were hybridized on an Affymetrix GeneChip HT-MG-430PM-96 (Affymetrix). Array hybridization, washing, and scanning were performed on GeneTitan (Affymetrix). Three independent biological replicates were analyzed in each experiment. Probe signals were subjected to presence calling and normalized to derive relative transcript abundance. The ratio (R) between the nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) abundance of each transcript is calculated (R = N/C) to quantify the nuclear retention of the transcript. The nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of the transcript in the LPS-treated IRAK2 knockout BMDMs (RKO) is then divided by that of the same transcript in the corresponding wild-type BMDMs (RWT). The resulting value is used as an index (I = RKO/ RWT) to measure the impact of IRAK2 deficiency on the nuclear retention of the transcript. Transcripts induced by LPS treatment are ranked based on the index I and the top 70 transcripts are used as the positive set for motif enrichment analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Motif enrichment analysis</title><p>To define the sequences, mouse (Mus Musculus) genes were downloaded from Ensembl BioMART in June 2014 and represent the GRCm38.p2 release of gene models. When there are multiple isoforms for the same gene we used the longest isoform to define its mature mRNA sequence and the genomic locus covered by its pre-mRNA sequence. We performed RNA-READ algorithm (unpublished work, XL, HDL, and QM, in preparation) to perform motif enrichment test. Specifically, we performed a likelihood ratio test to assess whether any of the previously defined RBP motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ray et al., 2013</xref>) from our collection could better distinguish the positive set from the negative set when provided to a regression algorithm that also had access to a control set of features that consisted of all the dinucleotides contained within the corresponding motif as well as the length of the target sequence; the construction of these regression models is described below. The comparisons between the motif and the control features were restricted to specific regulatory region of the transcripts (i.e., 3’ UTR, 5’UTR or the coding region). We scored each regulatory region using a given motif by summing the accessibility of all the target sites, where a target site was defined as a perfect match to the IUPAC representation of the motif and the accessibility of a target site was defined as the average single base accessibility of the bases in the site. A score of zero was assigned to those regulatory region did not contain a motif match. The single base accessibility was assessed using RNAplfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernhart et al., 2006</xref>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2010</xref>). We used the parameters with W = 200, L = 150 and U = 1. Although the analysis was applied in specific regulatory region, the entire transcript was input into RNAplfold to ensure correct folding of the bases close to the start codon and stop codon. We used the glmnet.R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Friedman et al., 2010</xref>) to apply Lasso penalized logistic regression. In the Lasso regression, the hyper-parameter lambda (i.e. the regularization strength) was selected through a five-fold cross-validation procedure, from the lambda sequence computed by glmnet using the default settings of nlambda and lambda.min.ratio. The final value for lambda was the one (from the sequence) with the smallest average generalization error across the five folds. We then used this value of lambda with the ‘glmnet.fit’ object on the entire dataset to compute the weights for the features. The features with non-zero weights were selected as contributing most to the prediction. After the non-zero weight features were defined, we trained two standard logistic regression models: one using all non-zero weight features (including the motif) and one that contained only the non-zero weighted control features, and then assessed whether there was a significant difference in predictive power between these two nested models using a log-likelihood ratio test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>LPS-induced septic shock</title><p>Ten pairs of Wildtype and IRAK2 KI mice were injected intraperitoneal with 10 mg of LPS/kg, and survival was monitored for 72 hr.

Tremendous efforts have been put on investigating the underlying mechanisms at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. It is known that binding to chemokine/cytokine mRNAs to the SRSF1 (AF2/ASF) protein mediates decay of these mRNAs in the nucleus, but the molecular mechanism by which pro-inflammatory mRNAs are regulated during nuclear export remains unknown. It is also known that IRAK2, downstream of the TLRs, plays a critical role in regulating chemokine/cytokine expression, but the exact mechanism is not defined. In the present study, the authors performed comprehensive analyses using multiple state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate for the first time that activation of TLR4 induces nuclear localization of IRAK2 to promote nuclear export of pro-inflammatory mRNAs (CXCL1, TNF and CXCL2) for ribosomal translation. Interestingly, IRAK2 kinase activity is essential for its nuclear translocation via LPS-induced RanBP2-mediated sumoylation of IRAK2. The nuclear IRAK2 then phosphorylates SRSF1 to reduce its binding to the target mRNAs. Meanwhile, IRAK2 also assembles a complex with the nuclear export adaptor ALYREF, which promotes the binding of those cytokine mRNAs to ALYREF and facilitates loading of the nuclear export receptor NXF1 to the mRNAs for nuclear export of those inflammatory chemokine/cytokine mRNAs. These novel and interesting findings answer a longstanding question in the field. The study is well designed and the conclusion is supported by extensive convincing biochemical and cell biological analyses. The discoveries of IRAK2 sumoylation and its regulation of nuclear export of the target chemokine/cytokine mRNAs represent a major step-forward in our understanding TLR and innate immune signal transduction system.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Throughout the study, the authors only examined 2-3 chemokine/cytokines that are known to have the SRSF1-binding sites in their 3' UTR. To strengthen the finding and the mechanism proposed, the authors should include analysis of an IRAK2-independent or a constitutively expressed cytokine/chemokine mRNA, and provide negative control data for key experiments including those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>.</p><p>2) IRAK2 kinase activity is required for its interaction with RanBP2 and subsequent sumoylation modification. Can the authors further elaborate on this? Is IRAK2 autophosphorylation required for binding to RanBP2? If so, can the authors demonstrate this by using the phostag gel electrophoresis?</p><p>3) The exact function of IRAK2 binding to ALYREF is a little confusing. Data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> suggest that the only function of IRAK2 is to remove SRSF1 from binding to the target mRNAs (therefore CXCL1 and TNF mRNAs were efficiently exported to the cytosol in SRSF1 knockdown cells in the IRAK2-independent manner). However, in subsequent presentation the authors also conclude that IRAK2-ALYREF interaction facilitates the assembly of nuclear export complex on target chemokine/cytokine mRNAs. Is there any inconsistency here?</p><p>4) In general, the RIP protocol used (low salt and without cross-linking) is sub-optimal. The lack of cross-linking means RNA and proteins re-association could easily occur post lysis, which, combined with the low-salt condition, means that some of the effects could be non-specific. Whilst it is not necessary for the authors to repeat all those experiments, such caveats regarding the RIP data should at least be noted and discussed in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29630.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Throughout the study, the authors only examined 2-3 chemokine/cytokines that are known to have the SRSF1-binding sites in their 3' UTR.

It has been reported that LPS stimulation induces the phosphorylation of IRAK2 at S136 and T140 (Weintz et al., 2010). We found that mutation at these two phosphorylation sites (IRAK2 S136A/T140A double mutant) abolished LPS-induced interaction of IRAK2 with RanBP2 and its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), although the IRAK2 S136A/T140A double mutant still retained the interaction with importin-β. These findings suggest that the activation of IRAK2 may result in auto-phosphorylation at S136A and T140A, which in turn mediates the interaction with RanBP2. In support of this, it is indeed the modified form of IRAK2 was specifically co-immunoprecipitated by RanBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, the phos-tag gel electrophoresis showed that the phosphorylated IRAK2 preferentially binds to RanBp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We have revised the Results subsection” RanBP2-mediated IRAK2 sumoylation is required for its nuclear translocation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The exact function of IRAK2 binding to ALYREF is a little confusing.

SRSF1 prevents mRNA nuclear export by binding to the target mRNAs. IRAK2 phosphorylates SRSF1 in the nucleus, promoting the dissociation of SRSF1 from the target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-G</xref>). On the other hand, IRAK2 mediates the recruitment of nuclear export complex (Nxf1) to the target mRNAs through the interaction with ALYREF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-D</xref>). Based on these results, we proposed that the IRAK2-mediated dissociation of SRSF1 from the target mRNAs is required for the subsequent IRAK2-dependent recruitment of ALYREF/Nxf1 complex. In support of this, the interaction of IRAK2 to SRSF1 and to ALYREF are mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In general, the RIP protocol used (low salt and without cross-linking) is sub-optimal.
