Animals, plants, and fungi primarily make their ATP in a specialised compartment called the mitochondrion, which is found inside their cells. The mitochondrion is often referred to as the powerhouse of cells as it captures and stores the energy that animals gain from eating food in the molecule ATP. Other enzymes in the cell break apart ATP to release the stored energy, which they use to power various cellular processes.</p><p>The interior architecture of the mitochondrion includes a highly folded inner membrane where electrical energy is transformed into chemical energy. The tight folding of the inner membrane is thought to make this process more efficient. An enzyme named ATP synthase performs the final steps of the energy transformation process by producing ATP (ATP synthase literally means ‘ATP maker’). This enzyme sits in pairs along the edges of the inner membrane folds. This raises the question: does the ATP synthase cause the membrane to fold or does this enzyme just ‘prefer’ these folded edges (which are instead caused by something else inside the mitochondrion)?</p><p>To investigate this question, Jiko, Davies et al. extracted ATP synthase from the mitochondria of cow hearts and mixed them with modified fat molecules to form a ‘2D membrane crystal’: a membrane containing an ordered pattern of enzymes. An electron microscope was used to generate a three-dimensional volume of the 2D membrane crystal via a process similar to a MRI or CAT scan that one might have in hospital. In the three-dimensional volume of the membrane crystal, Jiko, Davies et al. discovered that instead of being flat as expected, the membrane of the 2D membrane crystal was rippled and that this ripple was caused by the membrane-embedded part of the ATP synthase. The geometry of the ripple exactly matched half of the bend at the edge of the membrane folds in the mitochondrion. Therefore, Jiko, Davies et al. concluded that a pair of ATP synthases, as found in mitochondria, was responsible for defining the tight folds of the inner mitochondrial membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06119.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06119.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase is a membrane-embedded nano-machine and a member of the rotary ATPases (F-, V- and A-ATPases), which are found in energy-converting membranes of all eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Muench et al., 2011</xref>). The enzyme catalyses the formation of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) using the energy stored in a trans-membrane electrochemical gradient of protons or sodium ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">von Ballmoos et al., 2009</xref>). The bovine heart enzyme has a molecular mass of approximately 600 kDa and consists of 17 different subunits (α<sub>3</sub>, β<sub>3</sub>, γ, δ, ε, <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>8</italic>,</sub> <italic>d</italic>, <italic>e</italic>, <italic>f</italic>, <italic>g</italic>, A6L, F<sub>6</sub>, oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein [OSCP], DAPIT, and a 6.8 kDa protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Meyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Runswick et al., 2013</xref>). The enzyme can be subdivided into four essential functional parts: the catalytic part, (αβ)<sub>3</sub>, which binds and converts ADP and P<sub>i</sub> to ATP; the membrane-embedded part (<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>8</italic></sub>, <italic>e</italic>, <italic>f</italic>, <italic>g</italic>, A6L, DAPIT, and the 6.8 kDa protein) through which protons move across the membrane; the central stalk, γδε, which transmits the rotation of the membrane-embedded rotor-ring (<italic>c</italic><sub><italic>8</italic></sub>) to the catalytic region; and the peripheral stalk (<italic>b</italic>, <italic>d</italic>, <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>6</italic></sub> and OSCP) which holds the catalytic part stationary relative to the membrane region. The catalytic and central stalk regions form the F<sub>1</sub> subcomplex and the remainder, the F<sub>o</sub> subcomplex.</p><p>Structural studies of the intact F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase complex have been held back by the tendency of the enzyme to dissociate when extracted from the membrane. Nevertheless, a number of atomic models have been obtained by x-ray crystallography for various parts of the yeast and bovine mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase including the F<sub>1</sub> subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahams et al., 1994</xref>), the F<sub>1</sub>/<italic>c</italic>-ring subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stock et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Watt et al., 2010</xref>), the peripheral stalk subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dickson et al., 2006</xref>), and the F<sub>1</sub>/peripheral stalk fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rees et al., 2009</xref>). All these structures except the <italic>c</italic>-ring belong to the soluble region of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase. The membrane-embedded part of the mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase has two important functions. First, it allows protons to cross the membrane, thereby driving ATP synthesis; and second, it causes the dimerisation and oligomerisation of the enzyme in the membrane. The first structure of the membrane-embedded region of an F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase dimer was recently determined for the colourless green algae, <italic>Polytomella sp.</italic>, by single-particle cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allegretti et al., 2015</xref>). At 7 Å, the map shows that the conserved <italic>a</italic>-subunit forms a pair of horizontal helix haripins adjacent to the <italic>c</italic>-ring, whereas the peripheral stalk forms an intricate and unique dimerisation interface which is different from that of the bovine or yeast enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In mitochondria, F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthases occur as rows of dimers on highly curved ridges in cristae membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Strauss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2012</xref>). Knock-out studies in yeast demonstrated the involvement of subunits e and g in dimer formation and cristae morphology, suggesting a crucial role of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase dimers in cristae formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Paumard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davies et al., 2012</xref>). Subtomogram averaging of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase dimers in situ revealed an angle of 86° between the monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davies et al., 2012</xref>). Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations have indicated that the shape of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase dimer alone is sufficient to deform the lipid bilayer and drive the self-assembly of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase dimers into rows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davies et al., 2012</xref>). However, a recent single-particle cryo-EM map of detergent solubilised, bovine F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase monomers found the detergent micelle around the F<sub>o</sub> domain was bent leading to the suggestion that the monomer alone could deform lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Electron cryo-crystallography and electron cryo-tomography allow the structure of membrane-embedded proteins to be investigated in a lipid environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujiyoshi and Unwin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davies and Daum, 2013</xref>). To determine the structure of membrane-embedded bovine heart F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase, we generated 2D crystals of intact and active bovine heart F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase using the synthetic lipid 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC). By a combination of subtomogram averaging and electron crystallography of tomographic slices, we determined the in situ structure and packing of the enzyme complex in 2D crystals. The oblique orientation of individual complexes in the membrane results in a zigzag arrangement of the lipid bilayer, which perfectly matches the observed bend in the detergent micelle of the isolated complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2012</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the transmembrane region of bovine mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase monomer is sufficient to bend the lipid bilayer. This membrane deformation is likely to be a prerequisite for the self-association of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthases into dimers and dimers into rows, as observed in mitochondrial cristae.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Formation of stable 2D crystals</title><p>Monomeric mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase was purified from bovine heart muscle tissue by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and ion-exchange chromatography. For 2D crystallisation, fractions exhibiting high oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity (&gt;95%) and a high content of native lipids (&gt;100 lipid molecules per F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase) were mixed with synthetic DMPC. When the detergent was removed by dialysis, abundant crystalline vesicles formed that were stable for weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Analysis by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry confirmed that the crystalline vesicles contained all subunits of the bovine F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase, including the small F<sub>o</sub> subunits <italic>e</italic>, <italic>f</italic>, <italic>g</italic>, A6L, DAPIT, and the 6.8-kDa protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Thus, to gain insight into the structure of the membrane-embedded F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase, we performed electron cryo-tomography and sub-tomogram averaging.

The stalk region showed four distinct densities related by a twofold rotation.

Due to the mild conditions during protein purification and reconstitution, the protein remained stable and active for several weeks outside mitochondria. This enabled us to study the structure of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase in situ in a lipid bilayer. Sub-tomogram averaging of 2D crystals revealed the structure of bovine heart F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase in the membrane to approximately 24 Å. A model of molecular packing, determined by repositioning the sub-tomogram average into the tomographic volume, indicates that the membrane domain of the monomeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase from bovine heart bends the lipid bilayer.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Map resolution</title><p>Our structure of the bovine heart F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase reconstituted into a lipid bilayer is consistent with the monomeric detergent-solubilised complex determined by single-particle analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2012</xref>). Even though the resolution of our sub-tomogram average at 24 Å is nominally less good than that of the single-particle map at 18 Å, several features are more clearly resolved. This includes the densities of the central and peripheral stalks, the OSCP subunit and the α- and β-subunits, which are clearly separated in the sub-tomogram average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This may be a result of the more accurate particle alignment, which used 3D volumes rather than 2D projection images. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al. (2012)</xref> recently reported that by reducing their data set by 82% to include only the best projection images, structural features of their cryo-EM map became clearer, although the nominal resolution, determined by the Fourier shell correlation, was unchanged. The resolution of our sub-tomogram average is about 1.5× better in the x–y plane than the z direction due to the single orientation of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase particles in the crystal relative to the missing wedge of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Radermacher, 1988</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The peripheral stalk</title><p>In our sub-tomogram average, the peripheral stalk is positioned along the non-catalytic αβ interface as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rees et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2012</xref>) but is more offset towards the α-subunit than in the x-ray structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rees et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A small connecting density visible between the midpoint of the peripheral stalk and α-subunit may account for this difference. A similar connection is seen in the single-particle cryo-EM map of the bovine complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2012</xref>). Analysis of the fitted x-ray structure suggests possible ionic interactions between subunit <italic>d</italic> and residues 463–475 of the α-subunit, which is the point where the structures of the α and β-subunits diverge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Walker et al., 1982</xref>). This additional contact may help the peripheral stalk in its role as a stator, but may also prevent the stalk from interfering with the catalytic cycle of the β-subunit by pulling it away from the α/β interface. Alternatively, the peripheral stalk may be pulled away from the α/β interface by its interactions in the membrane.</p><p>The dominant density of the peripheral stalk in the sub-tomogram average suggests that this region is more rigid than other parts of the complex. In accordance with this, we were able to fit the bovine heart peripheral stalk fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dickson et al., 2006</xref>) extended by several residues from the F<sub>1</sub>-peripheral stalk structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rees et al., 2009</xref>) into the density as a rigid body without the need to introduce hinges as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This fit therefore challenges the notion that the peripheral stalk acts as a flexible linker that stores torque or elastic energy during the catalytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sorgen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sorgen et al., 1999</xref>). This hypothesis was based on the bacterial enzyme, which has a peripheral stalk consisting of only two long alpha helices. The bovine peripheral stalk, in contrast, consists of one long alpha helix plus subunits <italic>d</italic>, F<sub>6</sub> and the N-terminal domains of other F<sub>o</sub> subunits, which would generate a more rigid structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dickson et al., 2006</xref>). A rigid peripheral stalk would hold the (αβ)<sub>3</sub> hexamer in a stationary position relative to the membrane. This is probably more important in mitochondria than in bacteria, as the mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase has another important role in generating local membrane curvature and maintaining cristae morphology through the formation of dimer rows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davies et al., 2012</xref>). The dimer interface is located at the base of the peripheral stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2012</xref>) and thus any flexibility in the structure of the peripheral stalk may compromise the formation and stability of the dimer.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The membrane region</title><p>Despite the prominent structural features visible in the membrane-extrinsic regions of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase, the membrane-embedded parts in our sub-tomogram average were not well-resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This was surprising as the <italic>c</italic>-ring, located directly beneath the central stalk, is easily visible in x-ray models filtered to 20 Å resolution. Therefore, if the sub-volumes are well enough aligned to give an overall resolution of 24 Å, we would expect to see the <italic>c</italic>-ring in the lipid bilayer. In our sub-tomogram average, we only see a weak density for the <italic>c</italic>-ring. The lack of detail in the membrane region is unlikely to be caused by the missing wedge as we have observed a similar phenomenon in sub-tomogram averages of other membrane proteins, which have no missing wedge of information, and in single-particle maps when the resolution does not extend beyond 15 Å. The extent of this problem appears to correlate with the composition of the surrounding lipid or detergent. Thus, the lack of protein density in the membrane region for our averages at this resolution seems to be caused mainly by contrast matching between the surrounding lipid and protein.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>2D crystal processing of tomographic slices</title><p>The projection images generated from selected z-slices of tomographic volumes enabled us to use electron crystallographic image processing, even though the coherently packed areas of the 2D crystals were small. This improved the signal-to-noise ratio because noise originating from additional crystal layers or surrounding buffer was removed in silico by careful selection of the z-slices and Fourier filtering of the diffraction pattern. Thus 2D processing of tomographic 3D crystal volumes poses an attractive alternative for the electron crystallographic treatment of small 2D crystals of large membrane complexes that are not accessible to canonical image processing due to limited size and order. As exemplified in our 2D crystal of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase, the molecular packing of multi-subunit membrane complexes with large extramembranous domains can be complicated with multiple layers and multiple tilt angles relative to the crystal plane. These are circumstances under which projection maps alone are easily misinterpreted and our approach of combining electron tomography with electron crystallography enables a straightforward interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tani et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase and membrane curvature</title><p>In mitochondria, the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase forms rows of dimers along the highly curved ridges of cristae membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Strauss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 2011</xref>).

Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase dimer structure alone is sufficient to bend the lipid bilayer and drive row formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davies et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, single-particle cryo-EM of mitochondrial ATP synthase complexes indicates that the bend of the dimer may originate from the structure of the F<sub>o</sub> domain in a single monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Through our analysis of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase packing in 2D crystals, we have shown that the F<sub>o</sub> domain of monomeric bovine heart F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase indeed induces a substantial kink in the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5, 6</xref>) explaining in molecular terms the zigzag appearance of the membrane in the 2D crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). When two monomeric complexes join to form a dimer in the inner mitochondrial membrane, the resulting angle between the long axes of the monomers would be ∼86° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) exactly as observed in the subtomogram averages of the bovine F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davies et al., 2012</xref>). This dimer angle gives rise to the high local curvature of membranes required to shape the cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davies et al., 2012</xref>). We conclude that the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> monomer is the basic building block of the ATP synthase dimer rows.

Your article has been evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and four reviewers, and we invite you to submit a revision.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sjors Scheres (Reviewing editor) and Henning Stahlberg (peer reviewer). Three other reviewers remain anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers much appreciated the fact that 2D crystals of active and intact complexes were obtained, as well as the novel image processing procedures that were used to analyse the tomographic data of these crystals. All reviewers also agreed that the main conclusion of the paper, that the membrane part of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase monomer by itself bends the lipid bilayer, is very interesting and supportive of earlier results. However, a majority of the reviewers did feel that this conclusion needs additional experimental evidence. In particular the fact that the zig-zag pattern of the monomers is only inferred from the crystal packing, and not observed directly, was judged to be an important weakness of the current manuscript. This should be adequately addressed in a revised version. Possible options discussed were the inclusion of a cross-section plot from the edges of a vesicular 2D crystal, the inclusion of subtomograms from such edges in the averaging procedure to decrease the effects of the missing wedge on the membrane region in the subtomogram average, recording dual-axis tomograms to 70°, or recording images on cryo-sections of crystals.</p><p>In addition, two reviewers raised concerns about the possibility to distinguish between different conformations of the alpha/beta pairs at this resolution. Such claims should be backed by more information about the fittings of the different conformations in the maps. In addition, to exclude that random noise in the map could lead to one conformation fitting better than another, the authors could refine two halves of the data independently (i.e. gold-standard procedure, so a FSC=0.143 criterion could be used to assess resolution) and perform the fittings of the different conformations in both half-maps.</p><p>Lastly, it was felt that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is not representative of the actual results in the paper. It should contain a panel with the relative orientations of the monomers in the 2D crystal, and how the 20° inclination of the c-ring, together with the 2D crystal lattice parameters, lead to the same 43° angle as observed in the single-particle reconstruction (which also isn't very clear from the paper). This figure should also show that the crystal packing is actually very different from the 86° dimer.</p><p><italic>Minor comments:</italic></p><p>How was the resolution of the tomography reconstruction of 21Å determined? The authors list FSC 0.5 as criterion. But was any Gold Standard method applied here? What about reference bias?</p><p>Why is the unit cell given as p1 symmetry?

If so, then they should state it as such.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3A</xref> should have reference markers.</p><p>It would be helpful to have an introductory sentence in the Results section describing the crystalline vesicles so that the reader can understand that '2D crystals', 'crystalline tubes', 'rectangular-shaped vesicles', 'tubular 2D crystals', and 'tubular crystals' all mean the same thing.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: the fact that there are many more ATPase heads on the insides of the vesicles than on the outsides (whereas there should be equal numbers) suggests there may be some degradation, despite the biochemical analyses suggesting the enzyme is complete and active?</p><p>I cannot understand <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>. Why do the gels show mixtures of monomers and dimers, and why do the digitonin-resolubilised 2D crystals have a larger proportion of dimers? I don't understand the significance of the two curves in B. They need to be explained more fully in the caption.</p><p>The discussion on the membrane region (first paragraph of the subsection headed “The membrane region”) is not good. The lack of detail in the membrane region is surely due simply to poor resolution perpendicular to the membrane associated with the (quite substantial) missing wedge. It is not a contrast-matching issue. Analyses of helical tubes, where there is no such missing information, have demonstrated clearly that densities of a protein are well contrasted against the lipid bilayer at resolutions near 20Å, and certainly do not require a resolution of 8Å to be visible.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06119.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>All reviewers much appreciated the fact that 2D crystals of active and intact complexes were obtained, as well as the novel image processing procedures that were used to analyze the tomographic data of these crystals.

We have now visualized the zigzag membrane morphology directly by collecting tomograms of crystalline vesicles in thick vitreous ice (&gt;200nm). One of these vesicles was optimally orientated relative to the electron beam to reveal the zigzag membrane structure both in projection and in cross-sections of the tomographic volume.

Thus the migration profile of proteins solubilized from three-week-old 2D crystals using digitonin (lane 3 and 4) was directly compared to freshly purified bovine F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthases (lane 1 and 2). The aim of this gel was simply to show that both samples behave in the same way, which they do, and not to determine the molecular mass of the ATP synthase monomer and dimer. These molecular masses are well known, so the bands act as their own markers, far better than any extrinsic marker of soluble proteins would do for a blue native PAGE of a membrane protein. The migration behavior of membrane protein complexes on such a gel is highly dependent not only on the size and charge of the protein but also the shape and amount of bound lipids or detergents.</p><p><italic>It would be helpful to have an introductory sentence in the Results section describing the crystalline vesicles so that the reader can understand that '2D crystals', 'crystalline tubes', 'rectangular-shaped vesicles', 'tubular 2D crystals', and 'tubular crystals' all mean the same thing</italic>.</p><p>We have simplified the terminology and now just use the terms: crystalline vesicles and rectangular crystalline vesicles. The latter contains 2D crystals, which showed the highest degree of crystalline order.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref>: <italic>the fact that there are many more ATPase heads on the insides of the vesicles than on the outsides (whereas there should be equal numbers) suggests there may be some degradation, despite the biochemical analyses suggesting the enzyme is complete and active?</italic></p><p>We can exclude proteolytic degradation as a cause of missing ATPase heads, as the blue-native gel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref> shows clearly that this is not the case. We agree that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> in the original manuscript did seem to suggest that there were more ATPase heads on the inside. However, this figure was not representative, as the apparent number of ATPase heads on either side of the membrane depends on the exact position of the tomographic slice relative to the 2D lattice and the curvature of the membrane at the edge of the vesicle. In the revised manuscript, we have replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> by a new figure, in which the plane of the slice was chosen more carefully to indicate roughly similar numbers of heads on either side of the membrane. This is also evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and from the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>I cannot understand</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 3</italic></xref><italic>. Why do the gels show mixtures of monomers and dimers, and why do the digitonin-resolubilised 2D crystals have a larger proportion of dimers? I don't understand the significance of the two curves in B. They need to be explained more fully in the caption</italic>.</p><p>The F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase form rows of dimers in mitochondrial cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davies et al., 2012</xref>). To isolate the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase, these membranes were solubilized using decyl maltoside (DM). Although this detergent is relatively harsh, the purification procedure used in this study was mild enough to retain a significant portion of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase dimers. Therefore a clear dimer band is seen in lane 1 and 2, as expected.</p><p>The 2D crystals were solubilized using the very mild detergent digitonin. It is well known that this detergent preserves oligomeric assemblies of mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase dimers upon membrane solubilisation. In the 2D crystal, the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase interacts strongly via its c-ring with complexes of opposite orientation and weakly with complexes of the same orientation via its peripheral stalk. Some of these interactions are likely to be maintained during the solubilisation of the 2D crystals with the mild detergent digitonin.</p><p>As digitonin is a milder detergent than DM, more protein-protein interactions are preserved when the 2D crystals are solubilized with digitonin than when the mitochondrial membranes are solubilized with DM. Hence the larger proportion of dimers in lanes 3 and 4 compared to lanes 1 and 2.</p><p>To explain the two curves in B more clearly, we added the following statement to the caption:</p><p>“Hydrolysis of ATP by the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase was monitored using an enzyme couple assay by detecting NADH oxidation at 340 nm at 20°C in the absence (blue trace) or presence (green trace) of oligomycin. Oligomycin inhibits ATP hydrolysis by binding to and stopping rotation of the F<sub>o</sub> motor, i.e. oligomycin sensitivity is a measure of the relative proportion of coupled, intact F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase complexes in the digitonin resolubilised 2D crystals, in this case &gt; 95%.”</p><p><italic>The discussion on the membrane region (first paragraph of the subsection headed “The membrane region”) is not good. The lack of detail in the membrane region is surely due simply to poor resolution perpendicular to the membrane associated with the (quite substantial) missing wedge. It is not a contrast-matching issue. Analyses of helical tubes, where there is no such missing information, have demonstrated clearly that densities of a protein are well contrasted against the lipid bilayer at resolutions near 20Å, and certainly do not require a resolution of 8Å to be visible</italic>.</p><p>In our crystallographic projection map Fourier filtering allowed the visualization of transmembrane protein density in the presence of a dense and intact lipid bilayer even at 30 Angstrom resolution and a strong missing wedge. This is because the lipid bilayer has no regular order, and the Fourier terms originating from the membrane are filtered out during the masking of the protein diffraction pattern. A similar process also occurs during helical reconstructions, which means the signal from the protein is enhanced whereas the signal from disordered lipid is removed. In contrast, subtomogram averaging is conducted using real space cross correlation-based methods and all Fourier terms including those from the membrane contribute to the final average. This means both contrast matching and the missing wedge greatly affects the final average and both are likely to be important causes for the absence of transmembrane density in our subtomogram average.</p><p>The lack of protein density in the membrane region of our subtomogram average is not a consequence of the missing wedge. We have calculated subtomogram averages of several membrane-embedded ATP synthases that were randomly orientated in the tomographic volume. We found that every single average lacks protein density in the membrane region. We know from the single-particle averages of ATP synthase dimers (Allegretti et al., Nature 2015) published by us (KMD, WK) since the present manuscript was submitted that the c-ring density is seen clearly only at 10Å resolution or better, where membrane-spanning helices begin to become visible. At lower resolution, the mean scattering densities of the protein and surrounding lipid or detergent are too similar to show a clear boundary.</p></body></sub-article></article>
