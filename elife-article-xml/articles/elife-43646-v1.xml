We show that presenilin-1 (PS1)/γ-secretase is required for axon growth in the developing mouse brain. PS1/γ-secretase mediates axon growth by inhibiting RhoA signaling and cleaving EphA3 independently of ligand to generate an intracellular domain (ICD) fragment that reverses axon defects in PS1/γ-secretase- and EphA3-deficient hippocampal neurons. Proteomic analysis revealed that EphA3 ICD binds to non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) and increases its phosphorylation (Ser1943), which promotes NMIIA filament disassembly and cytoskeleton rearrangement. PS1/γ-secretase-deficient neurons show decreased phosphorylated NMIIA and NMIIA/actin colocalization. Moreover, pharmacological NMII inhibition reverses axon retraction in PS-deficient neurons suggesting that NMIIA mediates PS/EphA3-dependent axon elongation. In conclusion, PS/γ-secretase-dependent EphA3 cleavage mediates axon growth by regulating filament assembly through RhoA signaling and NMIIA, suggesting opposite roles of EphA3 on inhibiting (ligand-dependent) and promoting (receptor processing) axon growth in developing neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PS/g-secretase</kwd><kwd>axon growth</kwd><kwd>EphA/ephrin signaling</kwd><kwd>neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2013-43900-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saura</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2016-80027-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saura</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIBERNED CB06/05/0042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saura</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002809</institution-id><institution>Generalitat de Catalunya</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ICREA Academia</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saura</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002809</institution-id><institution>Generalitat de Catalunya</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017 SGR749</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saura</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>EphA signaling plays dual opposite roles on axon dynamics in neurons, so it inhibits and promotes axon growth through ligand binding and receptor processing, respectively.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Growth of axons towards their targets is a critical event during the establishment of neuronal connections in the developing nervous system. Growth, guidance and collapse of axons require the constant reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton at the growth cone and axons. Several signaling receptors regulate axon growth and guidance by affecting Rho family of GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patel and Van Vactor, 2002</xref>). Rho plays a critical role in the regulation of axon initiation, elongation, guidance and collapse by regulating the assembly, disassembly and rearrangement of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hall and Lalli, 2010</xref>). Rho promotes or inhibits axon elongation through its effectors mDia and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), respectively. RhoA regulates negatively axon growth by activating ROCK, whereas the Rho members Rac and Cdc42 promote axon growth in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). ROCK inhibits axon growth by blocking depolymerization of actin filaments indirectly by activating LIM kinase that phosphorylates ADF/cofilin, and directly by increasing phosphorylation and activating myosin II light chain (MLC) resulting in contraction of actin fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Da Silva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Govek et al., 2005</xref>). In neurons, non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA)/myosin-9 promotes neurite retraction caused by repulsive signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wylie and Chantler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kubo et al., 2008</xref>). Phosphorylation of NMIIA heavy chain by several kinases, including protein kinase C (PKC) or casein kinase 2 (CKII), prevents formation and/or disassembles myosin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breckenridge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dulyaninova and Bresnick, 2013</xref>), although the role of NMIIA phosphorylation in axodendritic morphology is unknown.</p><p>The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their cell-attached ephrin ligands inhibit axon growth by mediating growth cone collapse through regulation of Ras and Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Noren and Pasquale, 2004</xref>). Binding of ephrins to EphA or EphB receptors of opposing cells triggers Eph phosphorylation and recruitment of cytoplasmic proteins, such as CrkII, resulting in cell-cell repulsive signals. For instance, binding of ephrinA1 to EphA4 induces Rho GEF ephexin-1 binding, which triggers RhoA activation and consequently induces growth cone collapse in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shamah et al., 2001</xref>). Binding of ephrin-A5 to EphA induces growth cone collapse in a RhoA/ROCK-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wahl et al., 2000</xref>). EphA3 signaling, a relevant regulator of cell migration and neurite and axon outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shi et al., 2010</xref>), regulates elongation and navigation of axons and trajectories and assembly of spinal motor neuron axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marquardt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallarda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nishikimi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Eph/ephrin-mediated repulsive signals in developing neurons are largely limited to cell-cell contacts during axon guidance. At present, it is unclear whether Eph receptors regulate axon elongation independently of classical ephrin signaling, but a mechanism involving shedding of ephrin ligands and receptors was recently shown to regulate EphA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Egea and Klein, 2007</xref>). EphA activation triggers ADAM10-mediated ephrinA2 cleavage to regulate cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hattori et al., 2000</xref>), whereas binding of ephrinA5 to EphA3 induces an ADAM10-induced trans cleavage of the ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janes et al., 2005</xref>). Notably, several Eph receptors and ephrin ligands are cleaved by presenilins (PS: PS1 and PS2), the catalytic component of γ-secretase involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lleó and Saura, 2011</xref>). EphB2 and ephrinB2 undergo sequential cleavages by metalloproteases and PS/γ-secretase, and the ephrinB2 intracellular domain (ICD) resulting from this latter cleavage regulates RhoA through Src kinase in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Georgakopoulos et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Litterst et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, γ-secretase-dependent EphA4 cleavage regulates dendritic spine morphology by affecting Rac signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inoue et al., 2009</xref>). These findings suggest that cleavage of Eph receptors regulates actin cytoskeleton through alternative mechanisms different from the classical Eph-ephrin signaling. The physiological contribution of Eph receptor shedding on axon growth and whether this event occurs independently of cell-attached ephrins remain still unclear. Here, we found that PS/γ-secretase-dependent EphA3 cleavage mediates axon elongation independently of cell-attached ephrins by promoting filament disassembly and cytoskeleton rearrangement.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Presenilin-1/γ-secretase is essential for axon elongation in vitro and in vivo</title><p>Presenilin-1 (PS1; <italic>Psen1</italic>), the catalytic component of the γ-secretase complex, is mutated in most of familial Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Strooper and Annaert, 2010</xref>).

In all cases, γ-secretase inactivation was confirmed by accumulation of N-cadherin and APP CTFs. To test for a possible metalloprotease-mediated EphA3 shedding before γ-secretase cleavage, we used the ADAM/matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors MMP9/13, GM6001 and 1,10-phenanthroline (1,10-PNT).

Particularly, EphA3/ephrin-A5 signaling inhibits axon growth and regulates navigation of axons in developing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marquardt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nishikimi et al., 2011</xref>).

By contrast, <italic>Epha3</italic>/<italic>Epha4</italic> deletion causes disturbances in motor axon guidance and sensory-motor neuron assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallarda et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, it is well established that PS1 regulates axon guidance and kinesin-mediated axonal transport of motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamal et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2011</xref>). Loss of function mutations in the presenilin genes <italic>sel-12</italic> and <italic>hop-1</italic> result in abnormal axonal projections in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, an effect attributed to altered Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wittenburg et al., 2000</xref>). While our study indicates that PS1 promotes axonal growth, a recent study demonstrates that loss of PS1 function results in neurite outgrowth by increasing APP intracellular fragments and activating CREB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deyts et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, inactivation of β-secretase (BACE1), which is involved in APP processing, also causes axon guidance defects mediated by altered processing of the neural cell adhesion molecule close homolog of L1 (CHL1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hitt et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, proteolytic processing of neuregulin-1 by BACE and ADAM17 proteases mediates myelination of axons in the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Willem et al., 2006</xref>). Of interest, familial-AD linked PS1 mutations, acting through a partial loss of function mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Strooper, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shen and Kelleher, 2007</xref>), cause aberrant APP-dependent axodendritic growth in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pigino et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deyts et al., 2016</xref>). Despite these evidences, the PS1/γ-secretase-dependent mechanisms mediating cytoskeleton rearrangement during axon growth have been elusive.</p><p>Our results reveal that PS1/γ-secretase-dependent EphA3 cleavage mediates axon elongation. PS1/γ-secretase-regulated EphA3 processing is essential for constitutive axon elongation as suggested by the mimicking and occluding effects of <italic>Epha3</italic> inactivation on axon elongation in PS-deficient neurons. Indeed, EphA3 ICD expression recovered axon defects of PS1-deficient neurons in vitro (cultured neurons) and in vivo (embryonic brain). PS1/γ-secretase/EphA3-dependent axon growth contrasts with the classical role of ligand-induced EphA3 signaling in axon retraction. In agreement, both ligand-induced signaling and blocking ligand-independent EphA3 cleavage (e.g <italic>Epha3</italic> silencing) inhibit axon growth suggesting that both mechanisms occur in cellular conditions. It is puzzling that not only deletion of the EphA3 C-terminal but also removal of the PDZ or LBD impair recovery of axon length in EphA3- and/or PS1/γ-secretase-deficient neurons, suggesting that the EphA3 structural conformation is important for mediating axon growth. Whereas the role of specific EphA3 domains on regulation of cytoskeleton assembly is still unclear, PS1/γ-secretase-dependent axon growth is independent of classical EphA3 signaling. Ephrin-A5 does not affect EphA3 processing nor cause additional defects on axon morphology in EphA3- and PS/γ-secretase-deficient neurons. In contrast, both ligand and neuronal activity regulate PS1/γ-secretase-dependent processing of EphB2 and EphA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Litterst et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inoue et al., 2009</xref>). We cannot rule out the possibility that metalloprotease-mediated ephrinA shedding or other intracellular EphA3 effectors mediate PS-dependent axon elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hattori et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Janes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mohamed et al., 2012</xref>). It is also plausible that EphA3 ICD could mediate axon growth by acting through transcriptional mechanisms as described for APP and Notch ICDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lleó and Saura, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The PS/γ-secretase/EphA3-dependent mechanism mediating axon elongation involves RhoA signaling, a pathway implicated in growth cone collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Noren and Pasquale, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hall and Lalli, 2010</xref>). PS1/γ-secretase-deficient neurons show increased RhoA activity, whereas EphA3 ICD inhibits RhoA and reverses axon growth defects. By contrast, a constitutive active RhoA mutant causes the opposite effect, that is, prevents EphA3 ICD-induced recovery of axon growth. Importantly, proteomic analyses revealed that EphA3 ICD interacts with NMIIA heavy chain, a cytoskeleton protein that promotes neurite retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wylie and Chantler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kubo et al., 2008</xref>). PS1/γ-secretase-deficient neurons show increased insoluble NMIIA and reduced NMIIA phosphorylation (Ser1943), a form that dissociates or prevents cytoskeleton assembly of myosin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breckenridge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dulyaninova and Bresnick, 2013</xref>). Future investigations are needed to uncover the mechanism by which EphA3 ICD enhances NMIIA phosphorylation. It is possible that EphA3 ICD could affect activity and/or localization of protein kinase C and casein kinase II, the main kinases that phosphorylate NMIIA heavy chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breckenridge et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, TGF-β increases NMIIA Ser1943 phosphorylation during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beach et al., 2011</xref>). Since TGF-β plays essential roles during neuron specification and activates RhoA-dependent signaling another possibility is that EphA3 ICD could regulate TGF-β signaling affecting RhoA and NMIIA phosphorylation. Nonetheless, our results suggest that PS1/γ-secretase promotes disassembly or inhibits formation of stable filaments leading to F-actin-mediated axon extension. This idea is consistent with previous findings indicating that myosin inhibition induces extension of growth cones and filopodia by reducing retrograde F-actin flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 1996</xref>). On the contrary, EphA3 ICD elevates phosphorylated NMIIA heavy chain and enhances NMIIA/actin colocalization in PS-deficient axons, indicating that it induces axon growth by promoting filament disassembly. Since pharmacological inhibition of NMIIA filament assembly reverses axon growth defects in PS/γ-secretase-deficient neurons, and it does not cause additional effects in the presence of EphA3 ICD, we conclude that PS1/γ-secretase/EphA3 signaling mediates axon growth by promoting disassembly or preventing assembly of axonal NMIIA/actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The knowledge of NMIIA function in the nervous system is still very limited. Our results may pave the way for future investigations on EphA3/NMIIA function in brain development and degeneration. Our findings are also relevant for memory-related diseases in which disrupted axon morphology occurs in some cerebral pathological conditions. Specifically, loss-of-function <italic>Psen1</italic> mutations cause dramatic changes in tau-related axon morphology and transport and synapses, which are early events in the pathogenesis of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stokin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peethumnongsin et al., 2010</xref>). PS/γ-secretase inactivation in neurons increases tau pathology and axonal transport deficits leading to synaptic plasticity and memory deficits and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peethumnongsin et al., 2010</xref>). Since EphA3/ephrin-A5 regulates synaptogenesis and septohippocampal projections in the limbic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yue et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otal et al., 2006</xref>), a brain circuit essential for learning, memory and emotional responses, our findings may be relevant for synaptic dysfunction in AD. Nonetheless, septohippocampal projections are severely damaged at early AD stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Riekkinen et al., 1987</xref>), whereas altered γ-secretase-dependent EphA4 processing was recently associated with synapse pathology in AD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsui et al., 2012</xref>). Since myosin NMIIB regulates synaptic actin dynamics during synaptic plasticity and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rex et al., 2010</xref>), it will be interesting to study whether NMIIA regulates the function of PS1/γ-secretase on synapses. Considering the experimental therapies targeting Eph and myosin in nerve regeneration and cancer pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyd et al., 2014</xref>), it is conceivable that a better understanding of the PS/γ-secretase/EphA3/NMIIA crosstalk may provide new perspectives on common mechanisms regulating human brain development and diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">HEK293 (Human embryonic kidney293 cells)</td><td valign="bottom">American Type Culture Collection</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">PS1/PS2<sup>-/-</sup> MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblast cells)</td><td valign="bottom">B.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors’ note: this article was originally rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal against the decision.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Presenilin/γ-secretase-dependent EphA3 processing mediates axon elongation through non-muscle myosin IIA&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>While the reviewers found the work interesting, the number of substantive questions raised was such that we feel we must reject it. In particular, the reviewers felt that the in vivo data relating to the specific role of EphA3 ICD in axon growth is lacking. See the comments (below) that provide more details with respect to this issue as well as other concerns raised by reviewers.</p><p>Addressing these issues would likely require more than the typical time allowed for a standard <italic>eLife</italic> revision. We would be happy to consider the manuscript at a more distant date, should you consider to pursue the work along the suggestions of reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors report that the receptor EphA3 is cleaved by presenilin-1 in a ligand- (ephrinA) independent manner and that, the resulting intracellular domain promotes axon growth by phosphorylating non-muscle myosin IIA. Presenilin-1 was previously shown to interact with, and to cleave another axon guidance player, namely the netrin receptor DCC; a process that increases the fidelity of commissural axons pathfinding (Bai et al., 2011). Hence, this manuscript adds to our understanding of the mechanisms by which presenilin-1 regulates directional growth of axons.</p><p>Technically, the study is well conducted, the results are convincing, and the conclusions are supported by the findings. However, in vivo evidence is lacking as most experiments were performed in vitro. Authors may at least discuss better and stress axon defect similarities, overlaps, and differences between presenilins and EphA3/ephrinAs mutant mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The present manuscript shows the potential role of presenilin/γ-secretase cleavage on axon elongation, indicating that the mechanism mediating this effect is the cleavage of EphA3/ephrin. The study demonstrates that the formation of the intracellular domain (ICD) seems to inhibit Rho signalling and interact with non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA), affecting filament assembly. The findings are new and interesting and the study is very well designed, however some points need to be further clarified:</p><p>1) The authors have only demonstrated the role of PS1 using PS1 knockout cells, although DAPT could also affect PS2 activity. Perhaps it would be interesting to use PS2 knockout cells or cells transfected with siRNA for PS2.</p><p>2) The study has been done in embryonic brains, are there also differences in axonal length/white matter density in older PS1 knockout mice?</p><p>3) Although this study points to the interaction of the ICD with Rho signalling and NMIIA, it should also be ruled out that the effect is not mediated by transcriptional related mechanisms, as it occurs with other intracellular fragments resulting from PS1 cleavage, such as NICD and AICD.</p><p>4) In Figure 5A-C the use of a Rho-kinase inhibitor does not seem to have any effect on axonal length in PS1 wild-type cells, by looking at the quantification shown in the graphs. Is this the case? What could be the interpretation? The sentence in subsection “EphA3 cleavage mediates axon elongation by inhibiting RhoA signalling” is a bit confusing and could be changed to &quot;dominant-negative RhoA mutant (RhoA T19N) efficiently reversed axon length defects in PS1- and γ-secretase activity-deficient neurons&quot;.</p><p>5) The authors should propose a potential mechanism whereby the ICD affects NMIIA phosphorylation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Javier-Torrent and coworkers proposes a new mechanism by which presenilin-1/γ-secretase regulates axon growth. PS1 induces EphA3 cleavage generating an intracellular domain (ICD) fragment that is sufficient to promote axon growth, inhibit RhoA signaling, and modulate non-muscle myosin IIA serine phosphorylation. These results suggest that axon growth can be regulated by EphA3 in two ways: a ligand (ephrin)-dependent way that results in growth inhibition (as previously published), and a ligand-independent, EphA3 processing-dependent way that results in accelerated growth.</p><p>The presented data is generally of high technical quality and largely convincing. The topic is interesting, and the story quite well presented. However, several essential experiments are missing, and others could be improved. Moreover, in some cases, the conclusions are overstated.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The requirement of PS1 for axonal growth in vivo is not well documented. Determination of axon length based on neurofilament (NF) immunostaining of brain sections is not optimal. NF staining intensity appears to be reduced in immature neurons (Figure 1B). Hence, the reduction in NF staining in PS1<sup>-/-</sup> tissue may let the axons appear shorter. A better approach would be length measurements of DiI-traced axons.</p><p>2) In Figure 2, the authors demonstrate the presence of an EphA3 CTF in PS1<sup>-/-</sup> brains and take this as indirect evidence for lack of PS1 activity.

Using PS1<sup>-/-</sup> neurons is the better experiment than using DAPT. I would also request that the EphA3 shRNA knock down experiment includes the rescue with full-length EphA3 (panel E).

They should demonstrate that the axon growth defect caused by PS1 inhibition is rescued by overexpression of EphA3 ICD, and that this brings RhoA activity down to normal levels.

It is well-established that PS1/γ-secretase-generated intracellular fragments, including those of APP, Notch1 or ErbB4, are localized at the nucleus where they act as transcriptional regulators (Carpenter, 2003; Lleó and Saura, 2011). It is possible that EphA3 ICD may affect transcriptional mechanisms during axon growth. This is a very interesting question that will obviously require further studies in the future. We sincerely believe that this is far from the scope of the present study but since this issue is very relevant we added a comment in the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>“It is also plausible that EphA3 ICD could mediate axon growth by acting through transcriptional mechanisms as described for APP and Notch ICDs (Lleó and Saura, 2011)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 5A-C the use of a Rho-kinase inhibitor does not seem to have any effect on axonal length in PS1 wild-type cells, by looking at the quantification shown in the graphs.

It is possible that EphA3 ICD could affect activity and/or localization of protein kinase C and casein kinase II, the main kinases that phosphorylates NMIIA heavy chain (Breckenridge et al., 2009). Interestingly, TGF-β increases NMIIA Ser1943 phosphorylation during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Beach et al., 2011).

Biochemical detection of endogenous ICDs has been a difficult task for most of PS/γ-secretase substrates, even for the classical ones APP and Notch1 since these cleaved fragments are rapidly degraded o transported to the nucleus. For detecting intracellular fragments, γ-secretase in vitro assays were developed and extensively employed by different laboratories (Sastre et al., 2001).
