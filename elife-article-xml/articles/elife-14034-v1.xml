in the face of spatial and temporal noise remains unclear. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and phasor analysis to measure endogenous retinoic acid (RA) directly in vivo, we have investigated the amplitude of noise in RA signaling, and how modulation of this noise affects patterning of hindbrain segments (rhombomeres) in the zebrafish embryo. We demonstrate that RA forms a noisy gradient during critical stages of hindbrain patterning and that cells use distinct intracellular binding proteins to attenuate noise in RA levels. Increasing noise disrupts sharpening of rhombomere boundaries and proper patterning of the hindbrain. These findings reveal novel cellular mechanisms of noise regulation, which are likely to play important roles in other aspects of physiology and disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14034.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14034.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14034.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal cells need to be able to communicate with each other so that they can work together in tissues and organs. To do so, cells release signaling molecules that can move around within a tissue and be detected by receptors on other cells.</p><p>We tend to assume that the signaling molecules are evenly distributed across a tissue and affect all the receiving cells in the same way. However, random variations (noise) that affect how many of these molecules are produced, how they move through the space between cells and how they bind to receptors makes the reality much more complex. Cells responding to the signal somehow can ignore this noise and establish sharp boundaries between different cell types so that neighboring cells have distinct roles in the tissue. Few studies have attempted to measure such noise or address how cells manage to respond to noisy signals in a consistent manner.</p><p>Retinoic acid is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in the development of the brain in animal embryos. It forms a gradient along the body of the embryo from the head end to the tail end, but it has proved difficult to measure this gradient directly. Sosnik et al. exploited the fact that this molecule is weakly fluorescent and used microscopy to directly detect it in zebrafish embryos. The experiments show that retinoic acid forms a gradient in the embryos, with high levels at the tail end and lower levels at the head end.</p><p>Sosnik et al. also found that there is a large amount of noise in the retinoic acid gradient. Two cells in the same position can have very different retinoic acid levels, and the levels in a particular cell can vary from one minute to the next. The experiments also show that proteins that interact with retinoic acid help to reduce noise within a cell. This noise reduction is important for sharpening the boundaries between different brain regions in the embryo to allow the brain to develop normally. A future challenge will be to see if similar retinoic acid gradients and noise control occur in other tissues, and if the noise has any positive role to play in development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14034.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14034.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>noise</kwd><kwd>hindbrain</kwd><kwd>retinoic acid</kwd><kwd>rhombomere</kwd><kwd><italic>Danio rerio</italic></kwd><kwd>morphogen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50-GM76516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sosnik</surname><given-names>Julian</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Likun</given-names></name><name><surname>Rackauckas</surname><given-names>Christopher V</given-names></name><name><surname>Digman</surname><given-names>Michelle</given-names></name><name><surname>Gratton</surname><given-names>Enrico</given-names></name><name><surname>Nie</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name><name><surname>Schilling</surname><given-names>Thomas F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41-GM103540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gratton</surname><given-names>Enrico</given-names></name><name><surname>Digman</surname><given-names>Michelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM107264</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nie</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name><name><surname>Schilling</surname><given-names>Thomas F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Direct measurements of retinoic acid using fluorescence lifetime imaging reveal a new role for cellular retinoic acid binding proteins in noise attenuation that is critical to sharpen hindbrain rhombomere boundaries.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells responding to signals need to be able to distinguish these signals from random fluctuations (i.e., noise) and presumably have evolved mechanisms to do so. Noise is inherent in biological systems, but until recently we have lacked the tools to study such complexity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gregor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Holloway et al., 2011</xref>). Noise in signaling pathways arises from many sources, including stochastic variation in transcription, protein synthesis, and cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>). Morphogens are long-range signals thought to induce different cell behaviors in a concentration-dependent manner, but how such graded signals can be established in the face of noise and how they specify sharp boundaries of target gene expression remain unclear.</p><p>Retinoic acid (RA) is thought to act as a morphogen in the embryonic vertebrate hindbrain to pattern cells into a series of segments, called rhombomeres, which give rise to different domains of the adult brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">White and Schilling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Niederreither and DollÃ©, 2008</xref>). A small hydrophobic signaling molecule derived from dietary precursor Vitamin A, RA is produced in mesoderm near the head/trunk boundary and forms an anteriorly declining gradient across the hindbrain progenitor domain, in part through the activities of RA-degrading enzymes, Cyp26s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sirbu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hernandez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">White et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, self-enhanced degradation through induction of Cyp26a1 by RA itself was shown to be critical for gradient formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">White et al., 2007</xref>). Excess RA during human embryogenesis can cause anterior-posterior (A-P) patterning defects, and RA has been implicated in the development and maintenance of numerous cell types as well as in cancers (leukemia), stem cells (pancreas) and regenerating organs (cardiomyocytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duester, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tang and Gudas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rhinn and Dolle, 2012</xref>). Due to its hydrophobic nature, RA requires proteins to bind and transport it through extracellular and intracellular space, which enhances robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cai et al., 2012</xref>) but also introduces various sources of noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schilling et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our computational models suggest that noise in RA signaling can also play a positive role in hindbrain segmentation through noise-induced switches in gene expression at rhombomere boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), but until recently methods were lacking to test this hypothesis. Here we present a novel methodology utilizing fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and a phasor analysis (phasor-FLIM) to study the abundance of endogenous RA in vivoÂ in zebrafish embryos. Using this new tool to visualize endogenous RA in living cells we quantify variability in RA levels and provide some of the first evidence that cells actively control the magnitude of noise in a signaling molecule in a multicellular system in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) measures endogenous RA directly in vivo</title><p>We took advantage of the fact that RA is a fluorescent molecule to quantify its endogenous abundance in vivo in the developing zebrafish hindbrain. Due to the low abundance of RA in cells and its wide spectra of absorbance and emission, traditional fluorescence microscopic techniques fail to detect RA specifically. We opted instead to visualize RA by its unique fluorescence lifetime, rather than its fluorescence intensity. Focusing on the presumptive neural ectoderm of mid-gastrula stage embryos (8â8.5âhr post fertilization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref>) we used FLIM to measure the relative abundances of RA as a function of cell position along the A-P axis. This revealed that intracellular free RA forms an anteriorly-declining gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), similar to that previously reported with FRET reporters for RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shimozono et al., 2013</xref>) and suggested by the pattern of RARE-lacZ expression in late-gastrula mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sirbu et al., 2005</xref>). Relative abundances were calculated using phasor-FLIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Digman et al., 2008</xref>), where within the phasor space, each individual fluorescent species is represented in a characteristic and invariable position. Mixtures of molecules generate a FLIM signature that lies along a line connecting the positions of the individual component species and the position in that line is weighted according to the relative abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Because we know the absolute position of pure RA (in the lower right corner of phasor space) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Stringari et al., 2011</xref>), we can use the Cartesian distance within this space as a measure of the relative abundance of RA expressed as 1-d<sub>RA</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We observed that 1-d<sub>RA</sub> increased progressively as measurements were taken further posteriorly within the hindbrain field, suggesting that our FLIM approach is sensitive enough to detect endogenous RA gradients. An ordinary least squares regression analysis of gradient shape could not distinguish between exponential, linear, and quadratic fits, but confirmed the presence of a gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Unfortunately FLIM is also sensitive to the fluorescence emitted by transgenic markers of rhombomeres or other landmarks in embryos, making it difficult to determine precise segmental locations within the hindbrain field.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14034.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Measuring RA gradients in zebrafish embryos with Phasor-FLIM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of a zebrafish embryo at mid-gastrula stage (8.5âhr post-fertilization) with the imaging area (black square â encompassing positions 230â330 in <bold>B-D</bold>) in the neural ectoderm (NE) centered ~200 Î¼m from the advancing blastoderm margin (white line) (A: anterior, P: posterior, Y: yolk).

(<bold>C</bold>) The exponential curve is based on the linear fit of x with the logarithm of [RA]. Note that the magnitude of differences in [RA] is sufficiently small that the logarithmic change basically becomes a translation. Thus on the semi-translated data lower points in the middle cause the linear fit of the log to have a small slope, making the exponential of the coefficient small enough to make its resulting fit look linear. Thus, given measured differences in relative RA abundance, exponential, linear, and quadratic fits are indistinguishable, even at the tail end of the gradient.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14034.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14034.005</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14034-fig1-figsupp2-v1"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>To confirm that with phasor-FLIM we could detect RA specifically and its relative levels, we treated embryos with 10âÎ¼M DEAB to prevent the enzymatic conversion of retinal to RA, which eliminated the gradient at mid-gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and incubating these in 0.7 nM RA re-established the gradient as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">White et al., 2007</xref>).

Phasor analysis of the third harmonic of the laser pulse frequency (240 MHz instead of the standard 80 MHz) revealed similar gradients. Analyzing a different harmonic de-couples d<sub>RA</sub> from any other component of the mixture â i.e. the locations of each component in the phasor plot will vary independently of changes in d<sub>RA</sub> - and thus provides an independent means of confirming the specificity of the RA phasor-FLIM signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We next asked if we could detect RA gradients at later stages, when rhombomere boundaries are being established, by performing FLIM measurements in the transgenic line MÃ4127 (Egr2b:mCherry), which labels rhombomeres 3 and 5 (r3, r5), in regions devoid of transgene fluorescence to avoid interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Distel et al., 2009</xref>).

Injection of embryos with morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) targeting Aldh1a2, to inhibit RA synthesis greatly reduced the separation between FLIM signatures in r2, r4 and r6, which was partially rescued by transplantation of wildtype (WT) paraxial mesoderm to restore the local RA source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1DâF</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">White et al., 2007</xref>).

Thus we next applied this technique to measure stochastic fluctuations (noise) in RA levels across the embryonic hindbrain. Our models predict that the magnitude of such noise is large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lander, 2013</xref>), as we have argued that these fluctuations help cells switch between stable states of gene expression and thereby sharpen gene expression boundaries, i.e. noise-induced switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), but direct evidence of such noise is lacking.

We also calculated the maximum theoretical uncertainty due to photon shot noise and verified that the noiseÂ weÂ measured is significantly larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Colyer et al., 2008</xref>). Thus the fluctuations in RA levels that we observed in embryos are clearly biological in origin.</p><p>Noise in RA levels could be largely irrelevant for downstream gene expression if its frequency is faster than cellular responses, and is therefore averaged out. To address this possibility we performed an autocorrelation analysis of our temporal noise measurements using a moving window on each cell to search for significant lags. This revealed significant correlations (lags 13 and 14) corresponding to a predominant frequency on the order of 2.7âmin. This is significantly slower than the half-life of the RA-Crabp2a complex, which is approximately 1.7âmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dong et al., 1999</xref>). Because Crabp2 helps deliver RA to its nuclear receptor, and considering the scale of noise in transcriptional activation, noise at this time scale in RA signaling could propagate downstream. Thus it seems likely that cells possess mechanisms to limit this noise propagation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cellular RA binding proteins actively modulate noise</title><p>If cells actively control noise in RA signaling, they likely do it through intracellular RA-binding proteins, Crabps, or RA-degrading enzymes, Cyp26s, that can rapidly alter freely available RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kleywegt et al., 1994</xref>) and both of which have been shown to play critical roles in RA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sirbu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hernandez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">White et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cai et al., 2012</xref>).

In contrast, we show that noise in a secreted signal in the multicellular context of the vertebrate hindbrain influences noise in expression of its transcriptional targets. Our FLIM measurements demonstrate noisy concentration gradients of RA along the A-P axis and reveal a novel role for Crabp2a in noise-attenuation distinct from that of Cyp26a1. Crabp2a could control noise in RA levels rapidly by binding RA and facilitating its entry into cells or buffering its availability within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maden et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boylan and Gudas, 1992</xref>) and our previous studies have demonstrated its critical roles in signal robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cai et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, both Crabp2a and Cyp26a1 inhibit noise in downstream targets of RA. Previous studies have shown that transcriptional inhibitors act as noise filters within narrow levels of expression, since outside of this range, transcriptional noise in their target genes increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dublanche et al., 2006</xref>). Such a biphasic response resembles our results with Crabp2a and Cyp26a1. Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) often act as transcriptional repressors until they bind RA. Thus Crabp2a and Cyp26a1 may modulate noise in RA targets by altering this balance between activation and repression. As such, both must be present within a narrow optimal range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dublanche et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">White and Schilling, 2008</xref>).

Rather than using the traditional intensity of fluorescence to analyze microscopic samples, FLIM measures the lifetime fluorescence decay of the fluorophore. Fluorophores possess a characteristic lifetime of fluorescence that represents the time that takes an excited electron to relax back to its basal state emitting a photon. This technique eliminates most sources of noise present in intensity-based fluorescence microscopy techniques. This is due to the fact that most sources of noise, like thermal flickering or dark current have no lifetimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Colyer et al., 2008</xref>). However photon shot noise remains a source of uncertainty, but this is inversely proportional to the square-root of the fluorescence signal intensity. FLIM also requires a high numerical aperture objective (40X/NA 1.2), which intrinsically has a short working distance, making it impossible to perform the measurements at lower magnification.</p><p>Representing FLIM data in a phasor plot instead of a time-delay histogram allows analysis of the entire image, rather than pixel by pixel. In addition, because each molecular species is represented in a defined area of the phasor space, it allows analysis of samples with multiple fluorescent species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Digman et al., 2008</xref>). Individual fluorescent molecules have a constant lifetime, independent of concentration. Because the phasor space operates linearly, analysis of relative concentrations of fluorophores in samples with complex mixes can be performed. Samples with complex mixtures of fluorescent molecules generate a FLIM signature in the phasor plot that corresponds to the linear combination of the positions of the individual fluorescent species in a weighted manner. By calculating the Cartesian distance in the phasor space one can calculate the relative contributions of the different constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Digman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Stringari et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>An additional advantage of this method over the use of reporters is the direct measurement of the endogenous fluorophore of interest in vivo and without the potential artifacts introduced by genetic manipulations/transgenic reporters. Genetically encoded FRET reporters published previously for RA, bind RA proportionally to their association/dissociation constants (k<sub>a</sub>/k<sub>d</sub>) and either emit or stop emitting a signal. This binding biases the data (both spatially and temporally) according to the binding constant of the reporter.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>FLIM imaging</title><p>Embryos were dechorionated and mounted dorsally on #1.5 coverslips with 1% low-melt agarose in EM without methylene blue.

Embryos were hybridized in hybridization buffer containing 1 pmol of each of 5 (five) different DNA probes designed against Krox20 containing the B1 double initiator arms and Hoxb1a containing the B2 double initiator arms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) at 45Â°C for 16âhr. Probe specificity was verified by blast search and controlled by adding the hairpins but no initiator probe, which showed no non-specific signal, as well as single probe experiments. Excess probe was removed and embryos were gradually buffer exchanged to 5xSSCT and washed in 5xSSCT for 3.75âhr at 45Â°C. Samples were then pre-amplified in amplification buffer for 30âmin at roomÂ temperatureÂ (RT) after which they were left to amplify in amplification buffer containing B1H1 and B1H2 snap-cooled hairpins conjugated to Alexa 594 and B2H1 and B2H2 snap-cooled hairpins conjugated to Alexa 647 at room temperature for 16âhr. Finally the embryos were washed in 5xSSCT and counterstained with DAPI before mounting in soft agar on number 1.5 thickness coverslips for confocal imaging. Samples were imaged with a Leica SP8 scanning confocal microscope acquiring z-stacks covering the entire hindbrain as 12 bit 512 X 512 images and analyzed using ImageJ software. Experiments were performed with 12 embryos per condition and repeated 4 (four) times. Microscope settings were kept constant throughout. Mean intensity values obtained from HCR experiments were of 190000 for the WT embryos, with an average cell size of 85 pixels, making the average signal 50% of the maximum.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14034.013</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Sequences of the probes used for HCR corresponding to the specific genes as indicated and flanked by the corresponding adaptor sequences (B1 or B2).

separated after dechorionation and total RNA extracted with 150âÎ¼l of Trizol reagent. After chloroform addition and separation of the aqueous phase, the samples were concentrated using the DNA-Free RNA Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Poly A-RNA was transcribed using SuperScriptII. SYBR Green qPCR reactions were performed with primers 5â-ATCTATTCGGTGGACGAGC-3â and 5â-TAATCAGGCCATCTCCTGC-3â for Krox20 and 5â-CAAGGGATGGAAGATTGAGC-3â and 5â-AACCATACCAGGCTTGAGGA-3â for EF1Î±. Primer sets were tested and confirmed to have an amplification efficiency of 2. In order to study the individual variability in gene expression on each embryo, a homogeneous standard was generated with RNA pooled from 100 embryos at the same stage (3 somites-11 hpf-) of development and reactions of this 'standard' were run in parallel. The â³â³Ct method was used to analyze the samples. All samples were run in triplicates and the experiment was repeated 4 (four) times.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, statistical analysis was performed using Prism 5 (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA).

In order to establish significance in the changes in variation, a Leveneâs test was performed using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). To establish the significance of the changes in mean values, a Newman-Keuls test was used.</p><p>For the rescue experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1DâF</xref>) a two-way ANOVA analysis was performed and significance was established after the Bonferroni post test correction.</p><p>To establish the predominant frequency of the noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) an analysis of the datasets for different cells was performed using a moving window and searching for lags for which a correlation function would provide significant p-values using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Lags 13 and 14 gave p-values between 0.08 and 0.01. Average of these lags corresponds to a frequency of about 2.7 min.</p><p>Boundary sharpness was calculated as the ratio between the length of the theoretical sharp boundary and the actual measured length of the boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

These finding provide insight into the dynamic spatial heterogeneity of RA and its implications for hindbrain patterning. Despite the interesting set of experiments, the paper had several weaknesses in presentation and analysis of data, which we anticipate will require extensive reanalysis, and the generation of additional data. Since it is <italic>eLife</italic> policy to only invite revisions in cases where revisions can be reasonably completed within two months, we cannot invite revision of the current manuscript. However, we are in principle interested in the study, and we would consider a substantially revised version that addresses our concerns, with the proviso that it will be treated as a new submission.</p><p>The key revisions that came from the discussions among the reviewers are:</p><p>1) Indicate if their RA measurements show significant shifts in the position of the anterior boundary of RA as time proceeds (as was seen with RARE-lacZ in mouse where RA activity is first at the r2/r3 boundary, then at r3/r4, then at r4/r5) or do they see a more noisy decline in RA as time proceeds since they are detecting RA itself rather than RA activity. (This may require more imaging of the gradients).</p><p>2) Describe the shape of the RA relative abundance in the zebrafish hindbrain as a function of A-P position.</p><p>3) Show single cell resolution at the presumptive rhombomere boundaries.

The sharpness index (S) in their Zhang Mol Sys Biol 2012 paper defined as 'the mean location of the boundary between <italic>hoxb1</italic> and <italic>krox20</italic> expression domains as the intersection of their distributions at 50% of the normalized value. A decrease in S over time indicates noise attenuation and a sharper boundary. (Perform more imaging and in situ experiments).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript provides important new information on the mechanism of retinoic acid (RA) signaling during hindbrain development. Determination of RA concentration gradients has been a difficult task, hampering efforts to understand RA function. Here, the authors present a novel methodology utilizing fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to determine the abundance of endogenous RA along the A-P axis of the zebrafish hindbrain. They show that inherent noise exists in the concentration of RA in individual cells of the hindbrain, and that CRABP2 (an RA-binding protein) attenuates the noise to allow proper expression of downstream targets. Overall, these studies have significantly increased our understanding of RA gradient action during hindbrain formation.</p><p>Specific Points to Address:</p><p>1) Paragraph one, subheading âFluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) measures endogenous RA directly in vivoâ â the authors could add that their observation of a declining RA concentration from posterior to anterior hindbrain is consistent with the pattern of RARE-lacZ expression along the hindbrain of late-gastrulation stage mouse embryos (Sirbu, Development 2005).</p><p>2) Paragraph two, subheading âFluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) measures endogenous RA directly in vivoâ â how do the authors results on differential RA concentration along the hindbrain A-P axis over time compare with results from mouse RARE-lacZ suggesting that RA activity experiences shifting hindbrain boundaries from anterior to posterior as development proceeds (Sirbu Development 2005)?</p><p>3) Paragraph two, subheading âFunctional roles for noise in RA target gene expressionâ â it would help if the authors further discuss whether their analysis of Cyp26a1 (an RA-degrading enzyme) supports a role for Cyp26 in generating rhombomere boundaries like suggested in other studies (such as Hernandez, Development 2007).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic>in vivo visualization of retinoic acid (RA) by light microscopy has proved challenging due to the non-peptidic structure of RA, its low abundance in cells, and wide spectra of absorbance and emission. This has made it difficult to address the specific question of whether an RA gradient exists during segmentation of the vertebrate hindbrain into distinct rhombomeres, and if so how noisy RA levels in the hindbrain are modulated by cells in order to refine gene expression at rhombomere segment boundaries.</p><p>In this paper, the authors present an excellent application of fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FLIM) and phasor analysis to more accurately measure endogenous RA directly in the living zebrafish embryo, examine noise in RA signaling, and investigate how modulation of this noise (by intracellular RA-binding proteins (Crabps) or RA-degrading enzymes (Cyp26s)) affects patterning of hindbrain segments using fluorescence in-situ hybridization chain reaction technology (HCR) to more clearly define rhombomere-specific gene expression (Krox20). The authors clearly show their Phasor-FLIM strategy is accurate in vivo.</p><p>However, there are several significant concerns regarding the data presented that limit my enthusiasm for their primary conclusions and publication.</p><p>1) The authors argue this is the first method to directly measure RA concentration levels in the living embryo and only briefly mention a previous FRET-reporter based approach which makes this claim (Shimozono et al., Nature, 2013) and was used to measure RA concentration in the zebrafish hindbrain. This can easily be fixed with more description in the Introduction and a revision of the wording. However, what is troubling here is that the authors appear to move back and forth between two distinctly different tissue architectures (neural ectoderm (2D) vs hindbrain (3D) in their measurements of RA concentration and noise levels. That is, we don't know the shape of the RA relative abundance in the zebrafish hindbrain as a function of A-P position. Also, the result that Crabps modulates noise in RA is again based on measurements made in the neural ectoderm and not the hindbrain.</p><p>2) HCR is a more sensitive method to detect mRNA expression that the authors use to examine sharpening/fuzziness of Krox20 expression in response to changes in RA levels. This is precisely the type of experiment to perform in response to their computational modeling simulations of noise-induced switching and boundary sharpening. Unfortunately, the authors completely under-utilize this method and this brings their data and conclusion into question. That is, the HCR images (z-projections) are over-exposed and should be of high enough quality to present an accurate 3D spatial representation of the subregions near presumptive rhombomere boundaries (instead of reducing to a 2D analysis and segmentation that does not include the cell membrane outlines as a 3D volume). Further, this conclusion really begs for single cell resolution at the presumptive rhombomere boundaries which is not clear. Overall, this is a poor presentation compared with the more elegant Phasor-Flim analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Sosnik et al. uses fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and phasor analysis to measure endogenous retinoic acid (RA) levels within zebrafish embryos. The authors studied the amplitude of noise in RA signaling, and how modulation of this noise affects rhombomere patterning. The authors argue that RA forms a noisy gradient during critical stages of hindbrain patterning and that cells use distinct intracellular binding proteins to attenuate noise in RA levels. Increasing noise disrupts sharpening of rhombomere boundaries and proper patterning of the hindbrain. The work is very interesting and innovative. The general concerns are that the experiments are difficult to understand and it appears important controls are lacking. We would support the paper being accepted for publication if these issues are addressed.</p><p>In the subsection âFunctional roles for noise in RA target gene expressionâ, the authors state: âTo determine how altering RA levels influences noise in gene expression within the hindbrain we disrupted Crabp2a or Cyp26a1 and assayed expression of <italic>krox20</italic> in r3 and r5.â</p><p>Each MO treatment seems to have had an effect on <italic>krox20</italic> expression. Considering that MO could have broad effects on RNA expression levels, where any MOs unrelated to the RA pathway injected and analyzed.</p><p>It is not apparent that HCR is a reliable indicator of gene expression levels. This is a novel USE of HCR, so proper controls should be considered. What other RNAs besides <italic>krox20</italic> were measured? Were other RNAs that should not be affected and presumed to be affected by altering RA levels within the hindbrain also examined? These could also be measured within the other rhombomeres.</p><p>Is it possible to use the Tg(shhb:KalTA4,UAS-E1b:mCherry) transgenic zebrafish to compare cherry protein vs. RNA expression levels in the rhombomeres as a quick control?</p><p>The HCR images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> appear saturated, which would prevent accurate quantitation of <italic>krox20</italic> RNA levels.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Noise modulation in retinoic acid signaling sharpens segmental boundaries of gene expression in the zebrafish hindbrain&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers have read and discussed your manuscript and in principle feel it is worthy of publication if you can made a few minor changes and address one major area of concern that needs to be clarified.</p><p>Major Concern:</p><p>The major concern deals centers about the HCR analyses. It is the opinion of the reviewers that the authorsâ claim of using HCR for the relative quantification of target mRNAs is novel and important and thus requires solid data to prove that their approach is indeed quantitative. As presented the HCR experiments are difficult to understand and important controls are lacking. The authors should include 1 control data point. That is, no initiator probe + hairpins to show that there is no non-specific signal.</p><p>The authors responded to the reviewersâ previous comments with the following statement:</p><p>âHCR is an established technique that linearly amplifies the signal of an RNA target (Dirks and Pierce, 2004; molecularinstruments.org; Choi et al., 2010; 2014). As mentioned above, we also analyzed the RNA of <italic>hoxb1</italic>a in r3, r4 and r5 (only r3 and r5 data are presented here â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 2</xref>) at early stages when its expression is low and uniform across the hindbrain field. The MO and RNA injections had no significant effects on <italic>hoxb1</italic>a expression as assayed by HCR.â</p><p>There is disagreement with this response. Choi et al. 2014 (ACS Nano 8, 4284) is the most relevant paper since it describes the use of DNA probes to detect RNA targets and describes the method followed by the authors. However, the Choi paper does not demonstrate HCR's capability of doing relative (or absolute) quantification of target mRNAs. Choi et al. compared signal intensities and signal-to-background between one- and two-initiator probes using multiplex approaches. Thus, the authorsâ claim of using HCR for the relative quantification of target mRNAs is novel and important and thus requires a higher burden of proof that it is indeed quantitative.</p><p>The basic experimental framework put forth by the authors is based upon the idea of imaging the HCR signals from the tissue/embryonic region of interest (hindbrain r3-5) and examining whether HCR provides a quantitative readout of relative mRNA abundance within single cells for a statistically significant number of image sets. Determining relative intensities using HCR can be complicated by several factors that contribute to background signals (ACS Nano 8, 4284). Auto-fluorescence (AF) in the embryos may prevent an experimenter from observing the true intensities directly in the experiments. Non-specific amplification (NSA) of hairpins and non-specific detection (NSD) of the targets can also corrupt the true signal measurement. All of these controls were presumably run by the authors and would be valuable additions to the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14034.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>Thank you for considering our manuscript for review entitled âNoise modulation in retinoic acid signaling sharpens segmental boundaries of gene expression in the zebrafish hindbrainâ. We have addressed all of the comments, both experimentally and in textual revisions. We appreciate the importance of the more detailed spatial and temporal analyses requested both by reviewers and editors (Editorâs comments #1) and we have addressed these experimentally and/or computationally where possible. However, as we explain below there are no morphological landmarks of individual rhombomeres at the stages when most of our measurements were performed, and fluorescent transgenes that mark rhombomeres at late gastrula stages (when segments are sharpening) interfere with the RA emission and therefore with the FLIM measurements. The FLIM technique is based on spontaneous autofluorescence of RA and any fluorescent marker will strongly perturb the basic FLIM- phasor fluctuation analysis. We have clarified these limitations of the technique in the text, and we have managed to perform a more detailed analysis of gradient shape with additional FLIM and computational analyses, as requested (Editors comment #2). We also now include data to address concerns regarding quantification of the HCR data in 3D and at the level of single cells (Editors comment #3), as well as the lack of controls for these experiments (Reviewer 3, major comment #1). Overall, the reviewers agree that these are novel findings that improve our understanding about the function of morphogen gradients and an understudied dimension of cell signaling. Following are our specific responses to the points raised by editors and reviewers to our previously submitted manuscript.</p><p> <italic>The key revisions that came from the discussions among the reviewers are:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Indicate if their RA measurements show significant shifts in the position of the anterior boundary of RA as time proceeds (as was seen with RARE-lacZ in mouse where RA activity is first at the r2/r3 boundary, then at r3/r4, then at r4/r5) or do they see a more noisy decline in RA as time proceeds since they are detecting RA itself rather than RA activity. (This may require more imaging of the gradients).</italic></p><p>As we discussed in the overall response, we would love to do these more detailed spatial and temporal analyses. However, fluorescent transgenes that mark rhombomeres at these early stages interfere with FLIM measurements of spontaneous RA autofluorescence. We tried to address the issue of posterior shifts in the gradient by collecting a series of successive FLIM measurements within individual live embryos, leaving them embedded in agar on the microscope to retain the field of view, but this failed because of the excessive laser exposure. These technical limitations were not clearly discussed in the original manuscript and are now clarified in the text (paragraph one, subheading âFluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) measures endogenous RA directly in vivoâ).</p><p> <italic>2) Describe the shape of the RA relative abundance in the zebrafish hindbrain as a function of A-P position.</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent point. We evaluated gradient shape in more detail with additional FLIM measurements and a least squares regression analyses (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Exponential, linear and quadratic curve fits were produced for the entire field, but because each of these fits explains similar amounts of the variance it is hard to differentiate between the curve types. We also tried to see if the shape of the gradient differs between anterior and posterior, by splitting the FLIM dataset at the 310 um point along the A-P axis and computed the fits on the two portions. The results were almost identical to the full fit and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>, panels B and C. While it is difficult to distinguish between exponential, linear, and quadratic functions, the measured RA clearly fits a shape with characteristics shared by all three, strongly confirming the presence of a spatial gradient of RA.

(2007) reference (Introduction).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p> <italic>1) The authors argue this is the first method to directly measure RA concentration levels in the living embryo and only briefly mention a previous FRET-reporter based approach which makes this claim (Shimozono et al., Nature, 2013) and was used to measure RA concentration in the zebrafish hindbrain. This can easily be fixed with more description in the Introduction and a revision of the wording.</italic> </p><p>While the FRET-reporters for RA (GEPRAs) directly bind RA, the measurements made in that paper are of the fluorescent FRET reporters and therefore inherently indirect. Our methodology directly measures the endogenous autofluorescence of RA, making it the first truly direct method. The text has been modified (subheading âFLIM measurements reveal high noise levels in RAâ).</p><p><italic>However, what is troubling here is that the authors appear to move back and forth between two distinctly different tissue architectures (neural ectoderm (2D) vs hindbrain (3D) in their measurements of RA concentration and noise levels. That is, we don't know the shape of the RA relative abundance in the zebrafish hindbrain as a function of A-P position. Also, the result that Crabps modulates noise in RA is again based on measurements made in the neural ectoderm and not the hindbrain.</italic> </p><p>The âneural ectodermâ in this case refers to the region of the ectoderm of the gastrula stage embryo that will form the hindbrain, based on previous fate maps generated at mid-gastrula stages (8-8.5 hpf; Woo and Fraser (1995) â Development 121, 2595). We (and others) have shown previously that these are the critical stages for RA in hindbrain segmentation (White et al., 2007; Hernandez et al., 2007). FLIM measurements are 2D and performed on individual confocal slices. FLIM requires a high numerical aperture objective (40X/NA 1.2) â that intrinsically has a short working distance â making it impossible to perform the measurements at lower magnification. Fortunately at these stages the neural ectoderm is extremely thin (2-3 cells thick). An explanation of the limitations of the technique has been added to the Phasor-FLIM supplementary text (paragraph one, subheading âPhasor-FLIMâ).</p><p><italic>2) HCR is a more sensitive method to detect mRNA expression that the authors use to examine sharpening/fuzziness of Krox20 expression in response to changes in RA levels. This is precisely the type of experiment to perform in response to their computational modeling simulations of noise-induced switching and boundary sharpening. Unfortunately, the authors completely under-utilize this method and this brings their data and conclusion into question. That is, the HCR images (z-projections) are over-exposed and should be of high enough quality to present an accurate 3D spatial representation of the subregions near presumptive rhombomere boundaries (instead of reducing to a 2D analysis and segmentation that does not include the cell membrane outlines as a 3D volume). Further, this conclusion really begs for single cell resolution at the presumptive rhombomere boundaries which is not clear. Overall, this is a poor presentation compared with the more elegant Phasor-Flim analysis.</italic> </p><p>We performed all HCR analyses on raw 3D data.

It is the opinion of the reviewers that the authorsâ claim of using HCR for the relative quantification of target mRNAs is novel and important and thus requires solid data to prove that their approach is indeed quantitative. As presented the HCR experiments are difficult to understand and important controls are lacking. The authors should include 1 control data point. That is, no initiator probe + hairpins to show that there is no non-specific signal.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the concern raised by the reviewers and we have done this control, which produces no non-specific signal (at precisely the same settings on the Leica confocal microscope that was used for all of our images), which we now mention on subheading âHybridization Chain Reaction (HCR)â. We have also expanded the description of HCR in the Materials and methods and include a 3D rendering (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Further evidence for specificity in the hairpins includes: 1) the signal outside of rhombomeres 3 and 5 (for Krox20 probes) is very low and evenly distributed along the sample (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), 2) single initiator controls give comparable background, and 3) Hoxb1a initiators show a distinct pattern.</p><p><italic>The authors responded to the reviewersâ previous comments with the following statement:</italic> </p><p><italic>âHCR is an established technique that linearly amplifies the signal of an RNA target (Dirks and Pierce, 2004; molecularinstruments.org; Choi et al., 2010; 2014). As mentioned above, we also analyzed the RNA of hoxb1a in r3, r4 and r5 (only r3 and r5 data are presented here â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 2</xref>) at early stages when its expression is low and uniform across the hindbrain field. The MO and RNA injections had no significant effects on hoxb1a expression as assayed by HCR.â There is disagreement with this response. Choi et al. 2014 (ACS Nano 8, 4284) is the most relevant paper since it describes the use of DNA probes to detect RNA targets and describes the method followed by the authors. However, the Choi paper does not demonstrate HCR's capability of doing relative (or absolute) quantification of target mRNAs. Choi et al. compared signal intensities and signal-to-background between one- and two-initiator probes using multiplex approaches. Thus, the authorsâ claim of using HCR for the relative quantification of target mRNAs is novel and important and thus requires a higher burden of proof that it is indeed quantitative. The basic experimental framework put forth by the authors is based upon the idea of imaging the HCR signals from the tissue/embryonic region of interest (hindbrain r3-5) and examining whether HCR provides a quantitative readout of relative mRNA abundance within single cells for a statistically significant number of image sets. Determining relative intensities using HCR can be complicated by several factors that contribute to background signals (ACS Nano 8, 4284). Auto-fluorescence (AF) in the embryos may prevent an experimenter from observing the true intensities directly in the experiments. Non-specific amplification (NSA) of hairpins and non-specific detection (NSD) of the targets can also corrupt the true signal measurement. All of these controls were presumably run by the authors and would be valuable additions to the paper.</italic> </p><p>These issues have now been addressed in the expanded HCR description in Materials and methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
