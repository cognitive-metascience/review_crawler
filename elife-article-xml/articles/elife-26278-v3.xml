molecular mechanisms that mediate this process. We used optogenetics to drive individual mouse CA1 hippocampal neurons to fire in theta frequency bursts to understand how cell autonomous, postsynaptic activity leads to synapse elimination. Brief (1 hr) periods of postsynaptic bursting selectively depressed AMPA receptor (R) synaptic transmission, or silenced excitatory synapses, whereas more prolonged (24 hr) firing depressed both AMPAR and NMDAR EPSCs and eliminated spines, indicative of a synapse elimination. Both synapse silencing and elimination required de novo transcription, but only silencing required the activity-dependent transcription factors MEF2A/D. Burst firing induced MEF2A/D-dependent induction of the target gene <italic>Arc</italic> which contributed to synapse silencing and elimination. This work reveals new and distinct forms of activity and transcription-dependent synapse depression and suggests that these processes can occur independently.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MEF2</kwd><kwd>synapse silencing</kwd><kwd>activity-dependent synapse plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Chia-Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Chia-Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilkerson</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name><name><surname>Hale</surname><given-names>Carly</given-names></name><name><surname>Gibson</surname><given-names>Jay R</given-names></name><name><surname>Huber</surname><given-names>Kimberly M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Increasing periods of neuronal activity progressively weaken and then eliminate synapses through the activation of specific transcription factors and genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory experience and learning refine cortical circuits through activity-dependent stabilization and elimination of excitatory synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hua and Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zuo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu and Zuo, 2011</xref>). Surprisingly little is known of the molecular mechanisms by which experience and neural activity patterns lead to synapse elimination in cortical neurons. Importantly, deficits in experience-dependent synapse elimination are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X Syndrome, autism and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Patel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagaoka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sekar et al., 2016</xref>). Determining the mechanisms and roles of disease-linked genes in synapse elimination will be key to understanding and treating these disorders. Activity- and experience-regulated transcriptional control is a candidate mechanism to transduce activity signals into long-term changes in circuit connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Flavell and Greenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">West and Greenberg, 2011</xref>). In support of this idea, the MEF2 (Myocyte-Enhancer Factor 2) family of activity-dependent transcription factors has been implicated in functional and structural elimination of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Flavell et al., 2006</xref>). All four MEF2 family members (MEF2A-D) are expressed in the brain. MEF2A and MEF2D are highly expressed in hippocampal CA1 neurons and MEF2C is expressed more in the dentate gyrus and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lyons et al., 1995</xref>). MEF2C and MEF2D as well as MEF2 target genes, are implicated in human autism, intellectual disability, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease and/or epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rocha et al., 2016</xref>). In mice, deletion of <italic>Mef2a,c,</italic> and/or <italic>d</italic> leads to behaviors relevant to autism and drug addiction and alterations in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pulipparacharuvil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cole et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harrington et al., 2016</xref>). Regulation of activity-dependent circuit refinement by MEF2 may contribute to these behaviors and brain disorders in humans.</p><p>Most evidence linking MEF2 activation with synapse elimination comes from studies utilizing a constitutive, transcriptionally active MEF2, constructed by fusing the MADS/MEF2 DNA binding domains of MEF2C to the viral transcriptional activator VP16. MEF2-VP16 expression causes rapid elimination of excitatory synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Flavell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilkerson et al., 2014</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hu et al., 2010</xref>). In support of a role for endogenous MEF2 genes in synapse elimination, MEF2C knockout mice display enhanced spine number and excitatory synaptic function of dentate gyrus granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2008</xref>) and knockdown of MEF2A/D in hippocampal cultures increases excitatory synapse markers, an effect that relies on activity of the cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Flavell et al., 2006</xref>). However, MEF2A/D knockdown does not always lead to increases in synapse number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elmer et al., 2013</xref>) suggesting there may be specific activity patterns or other factors necessary to observe MEF2A/D dependent synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, nothing is known of the physiological activity patterns that regulate MEF2 transcriptional activity in neurons or whether such patterns eliminate synapses through MEF2 transcriptional activation of specific gene targets.</p><p>To address these questions, we used optogenetics to drive firing of individual CA1 neurons in specific firing patterns. Blue light driven firing of postsynaptic neurons in 3 Hz bursts (patterned photostimulation; 1 hr; brief PPS;) depressed AMPA receptor (R) mediated synaptic transmission, but not that mediated by NMDARs, thus silencing excitatory synapses. In contrast, increasing the duration of PPS to 24 hr, depressed both AMPA and NMDAR synaptic transmission and eliminated dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goold and Nicoll, 2010</xref>). Surprisingly, MEF2A/D was necessary for activity-induced silencing of excitatory synapses, but not functional synapse elimination, revealing an unexpected role for endogenous MEF2A/D genes in synaptic plasticity. Brief PPS induced a MEF2A/D-dependent induction of the immediate-early gene <italic>Arc</italic>, previously implicated in the selective endocytosis of AMPARs, which was necessary, but not sufficient, for synapse silencing and contributed to synapse elimination. These results suggest that there are mechanistically distinct steps and multiple MEF2A/D-dependent target genes by which patterned firing of neurons leads to synapse elimination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell autonomous bursts of theta frequency postsynaptic action potentials induce a long-term depression of excitatory synaptic transmission</title><p>MEF2 is an activity-dependent transcription factor that eliminates synapses onto hippocampal CA1 neurons, but little is known of the neural activity patterns that lead to synapse elimination and whether this depends on MEF2.

We further explored this paradigm to determine whether shorter durations of postsynaptic bursting were sufficient to induce synaptic depression and elimination.

Transfected neurons exposed to 1 hr (brief) PPS displayed a robust (~50%) depression of evoked EPSC amplitude and mEPSC frequency relative to untransfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, mEPSC amplitude and paired pulse facilitation of evoked EPSCs were unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Longer durations of PPS (6 or 24 hr; chronic PPS) also depressed evoked EPSCs and mEPSC frequency (measured 24 hr after PPS onset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), without affecting mEPSC amplitude or paired-pulse facilitation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

NMDARs colocalize with AMPA receptors (AMPAR) at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kawashima et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, if brief PPS functionally eliminates synapses, we would predict a depression of both AMPAR and NMDAR-mediated EPSCs. To test this, we acquired paired recordings from ChR2-mCherry transfected and neighboring untransfected neurons 24 hr after the onset of brief PPS and measured AMPAR EPSCs and pharmacologically isolated NMDAR EPSCs (DNQX at +40 mV). Although brief PPS suppressed evoked AMPAR EPSCs, it had no effect on NMDAR EPSCs recorded 24–30 hr after the onset of PPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To determine if NMDAR EPSCs are initially depressed by brief PPS, but recover after PPS offset, we measured AMPA and NMDAR EPSCs at earlier time points after brief PPS onset, either 3–7 or 12–16 hr, and observed a selective depression of AMPAR, but not NMDAR EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Here we used optogenetics (patterned photostimulation; PPS) to drive firing of postsynaptic CA1 neurons in bursts at 3 Hz, similar to the theta frequency patterns of bursting observed in CA1 neurons during environmental exploration and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colgin, 2013</xref>). We observed two forms of synaptic depression that depended on the duration of postsynaptic bursting. Relatively brief periods of postsynaptic bursting (PPS; 1 hr) resulted in a selective depression of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission, or a silencing of excitatory synapses, whereas chronic (~24 hr) bursting activity depressed both AMPAR and NMDAR-mediated synaptic depression and reduced spine number, suggestive of a synapse elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goold and Nicoll, 2010</xref>).

In contrast, much less is known of how cell autonomous activity of individual neurons homeostatically regulates their inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burrone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ibata et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goold and Nicoll (2010)</xref> first demonstrated using chronic PPS that increases in cell autonomous activity depress and eliminate excitatory synaptic inputs. Here, we extend upon this study and demonstrate that distinct forms of homeostatic synaptic depression are induced depending on the duration of postsynaptic bursting. Brief (~1 hr) PPS caused a decrease in mEPSC frequency and evoked AMPAR-EPSCs without affecting NMDAR-EPSCs, dendritic spine number or paired-pulse facilitation of evoked EPSCs, a measure related to presynaptic release probability. Taken together, these results suggest that brief PPS causes a removal or inactivation of all AMPARs, at a subset of synapses, or creates silent synapses. Chronic PPS (~24 hr) also depressed the frequency of mEPSCs, but in contrast to brief PPS, depressed both evoked AMPA and NMDAR-mediated EPSCs and reduced spine number without affecting paired-pulse facilitation. If synapse silencing by brief PPS precedes or promotes removal of NMDARs and spines in response to chronic activity is unclear. Because brief or chronic PPS did not affect the average amplitude of mEPSCs, this suggests that synapses are silenced and eliminated across a range of synaptic strengths. However, measurements of synaptic protein markers are necessary to conclusively determine if synapses are eliminated by chronic PPS. The synaptic basis of this ‘cell autonomous’ homeostatic plasticity is distinct from the well characterized homeostatic ‘scaling’ down of mEPSC amplitudes observed with increased network activity, which results from removal or inactivation of a proportion of AMPARs from all synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wayman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vitureira et al., 2012</xref>). While homeostatic scaling maintains the relative synaptic weights of synaptic inputs onto a neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wayman et al., 2008</xref>), cell autonomous homeostatic silencing would be expected to eliminate some synaptic inputs, while leaving others unchanged. Therefore, these two forms of homeostatic plasticity (cell autonomous vs. network) would have distinct effects on neural network connectivity and computation and may serve divergent functions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Endogenous MEF2A/D is required for cell autonomous, activity-induced synapse silencing</title><p>Brief and chronic PPS both require L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity and transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goold and Nicoll, 2010</xref>) for synapse silencing and elimination, but MEF2A/D is only required for brief PPS-induced synapse silencing. Consistently, brief PPS induced the MRE-GFP transcriptional reporter and target gene <italic>Arc</italic>, in a MEF2A/D-dependent manner. Functional synapse elimination in response to chronic PPS did not require MEF2A/D. This result was surprising because overexpression of a constitutively active MEF2, MEF2VP16, causes elimination of functional and structural synapses in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Flavell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>). Our data implicate postsynaptic MEF2A/D in activity-driven silencing of synapses. Consistent with this result, knockdown of MEF2A/D in developing cultured cortical neurons enhanced synaptic expression of GluA1, but not pre-or postsynaptic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elmer et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that endogenous MEF2A/D promotes synaptic removal or endocytosis of GluA1-containing AMPARs.</p><p>Surprisingly, postsynaptic deletion of MEF2A/D in CA1 neurons in slice culture did not affect baseline synaptic function. This result contrasts with the robust increase in synaptic transmission we have reported with postsynaptic expression of a constitutive transcriptional repressor form of MEF2, MEF2-Engrailed in CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>). MEF2A/D recruits transcriptional repressors to MEF2 target genes, such as class IIa HDACs, and deletion of MEF2A/D would be expected to prevent both repression and activity-induced activation of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shalizi and Bonni, 2005</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that under basal activity conditions in slice cultures, MEF2A/D is not actively repressing transcription of genes that depress or eliminate synapses, but can be recruited by neural activity to induce transcription of gene targets, such as <italic>Arc</italic>, that silence synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Alternatively, steady-state levels of MEF2A/D and/or Arc may maintain the ability of CA1 neurons to depress in response to activity. Although acute blockade of transcription blocks PPS-induced silencing, we do not know if PPS-induced transcriptional activity of MEF2A/D or induction of Arc induces synapse silencing.</p><p>Chronic PPS-induced synapse elimination relies on transcription and CaMKIV, a known regulator of activity-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wayman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goold and Nicoll, 2010</xref>), and, as we demonstrate, quantitatively on <italic>Arc</italic>. If or what activity-dependent transcription factors necessary for synapse elimination in response to chronic PPS are unknown. It is unlikely that compensation by MEF2C occurs with MEF2A/D deletion, because MEF2C is not expressed in CA1 pyramidal neurons postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lyons et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kamme et al., 2003</xref>) and MEF2A/D deletion fully prevented chronic PPS-induced MRE-GFP reporter expression. Important future experiments are to determine whether <italic>Arc</italic> is induced by chronic PPS in MEF2A/D KO neurons and if other activity-regulated transcription factors, such as CREB or SRF, can compensate or contribute to <italic>Arc</italic> induction and synapse elimination in the absence of MEF2A/D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kawashima et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have primarily used high KCl-mediated depolarization to induce MEF2A/D transcriptional activation and target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Flavell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flavell et al., 2008</xref>). While these paradigms show some overlap with experience-induced genes in vivo, the physiologically-relevant neural activity patterns that drive gene expression is not known. CA1 neurons fire in bursts at a theta frequency (3–8 Hz) during exploratory or orienting behavior, as well as REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colgin, 2013</xref>). Postsynaptic bursting at 3 Hz induced MEF2A/D dependent transcription of <italic>Arc</italic> and synaptic depression which may contribute to synaptic plasticity during these behaviors. Additional studies are needed to determine the relevant and optimal neural firing patterns that drive MEF2A/D-dependent transcription and synaptic plasticity and understand relevant in vivo activity conditions that drive these forms of synaptic plasticity. Surprisingly, brief PPS did not induce other MEF2A/D gene targets, such as <italic>Pcdh10</italic>, <italic>Homer1a</italic>, and <italic>Rgs2</italic>, which are induced by MEF2VP16 or high KCl depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flavell et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that other activity patterns may also engage MEF2A/D to induce these genes. It is important to note that different genes may be induced with PPS of individual CA1 neurons in slice culture in comparison to dissociated CA3-CA1 cultures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Arc is necessary, but not sufficient, for synapse silencing and contributes to synapse elimination</title><p>Brief PPS robustly induced <italic>Arc</italic> in cultured hippocampal neurons and Arc was essential for synapse silencing in response to brief PPS. Arc promotes endocytosis of AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chowdhury et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shepherd et al., 2006</xref>) and may do so through interactions of the AMPAR-interacting protein stargazin (TARPγ2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Penley et al., 2013</xref>). However, postsynaptic exogenous expression of Arc was not sufficient to cause synaptic depression or elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilkerson et al., 2014</xref>), but rescued PPS-induced synaptic depression in Arc KO CA1 neurons. Therefore, other activity-induced, MEF2A/D dependent gene targets, in addition to <italic>Arc</italic>, are likely necessary to silence synapses. In support of this idea, Arc was unable to rescue PPS-induced synaptic depression in MEF2A/D KO neurons. Arc also contributed quantitatively to synapse elimination in response to chronic PPS. Consistent with this finding, Arc is required for MEF2VP16-induced synapse elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilkerson et al., 2014</xref>) and developmental and activity-induced elimination of climbing fiber axons onto cerebellar Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mikuni et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to what we observe in CA1, <italic>Arc</italic> overexpression is not sufficient eliminate climbing fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mikuni et al., 2013</xref>). Arc-mediated synapse silencing may precede and target synapses for elimination during chronic activity increases. Alternatively, silencing and elimination may be distinct processes that both utilize Arc. Arc interacts with a number of synaptic proteins, including GluN2A, GluN2B, GKAP and WAVE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Penley et al., 2013</xref>), through which it may function to depress NMDAR function or spine number, independent of its effects on AMPARs. Because MEF2A/D is required for synapse silencing, but not elimination, this supports the idea that silencing is not necessary for elimination.</p><p>Alterations in synaptic pruning or cortical neurons, either during development, in response to experience or with aging are associated with a number of neuropsychiatric diseases, including autism, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sekar et al., 2016</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

This study combines two previous lines of investigation – one of which previously showed that prolonged low frequency ChR2-mediated stimulation of hippocampal neurons was sufficient to drive transcription-dependent synapse elimination and the other which has implicated the transcription factor <italic>MEF2</italic> in activity-dependent synapse elimination. Here the authors first show that both short and long-term delivery of patterned ChR2-mediated neuronal firing can induce <italic>MEF2</italic>-dependent transcription, then they use knockouts of MEF2A/D and its target gene <italic>Arc</italic> to determine the requirements for this transcriptional signaling pathway in excitatory synaptic depression and elimination. These data reveal that both MEF2A/D and <italic>Arc</italic> are required for activity-induced synaptic depression, but only <italic>Arc</italic> and not MEF2A/D are required for activity-induced synaptic elimination.</p><p>As the authors state in their Introduction, nothing is known of the physiological patterns of stimulation that are sufficient to activate <italic>MEF2</italic>-dependent transcription, thus the report of this finding alone is highly novel. However this paper is particularly important because it takes a further step toward combining the extensive molecular knowledge of activity-inducible transcription factors and placing it in the context of physiologically relevant effects on synapse plasticity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are a number of points that should be addressed with respect to the writing of the manuscript. Experimentally, the only significant weaknesses are at the 24hr time point after PPS, where adding findings will more firmly support the model proposed.</p><p>Writing:</p><p>1) The authors need to be more careful in their wording so as to be more accurate in their descriptions of the data. As an example, spine loss is not necessarily synapse loss, and so it should not be stated as such. In some places, this is appropriately stated, but in others (e.g. subsection “Brief periods of postsynaptic bursting silence excitatory synapses, whereas chronic bursting causes synapse elimination”), it is not. In an example of the second point, the authors state that PPS induced a MEF2A/D-dependent induction of <italic>Ar</italic>c that was necessary but not sufficient for synapse silencing and elimination. Although the data are compelling suggesting that <italic>Arc</italic> is necessary for depression (neurons from the <italic>Arc</italic> KO mouse failed to show synaptic depression after brief PPS, and neurons transfected with <italic>Arc</italic> cDNA can rescue PPS-induced synapse silencing in dissociated cultures, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B and C</xref>), the data also show that chronic PPS can induce a significant decrease in evoked EPSCs (Figure 5E2) in the <italic>Arc</italic> KO mouse slices, demonstrating that <italic>Arc</italic> is, in fact, not necessary for depression, at least with chronic PPS. The authors did find that the depression in the KO was significantly different from the WT (Figure 5E3), however the decrease is similar to other decreases in evoked EPSC's that are considered depressed (e.g. 5B1).</p><p>2) The authors repeatedly state the importance of defining the relationship between physiological activity patterns and both <italic>MEF2</italic> activation and synaptic refinement; yet they only test a single pattern – albeit a physiologically relevant one – throughout the course of the study. This raises a number of questions that could be addressed experimentally or, at least, raised as Discussion points. 1) Is there anything significant about 3 Hz burst firing with respect to <italic>MEF2</italic> activation and synapse silencing/elimination? Would other patterns of burst firing (e.g. high theta, or γ) yield different outcomes?; 2) Is burst firing of the postsynaptic neuron required? Related, How reliably does the specified 50 ms blue light pulse evoke a burst of action potentials in the postsynaptic cell?; 3) Is it only the duration of the 3 Hz postsynaptic activity that differentially engages pathways for synapse silencing or elimination, or does the total amount of activity play a role? In other words, could high frequency activity (~15-20 Hz, allowing for a corresponding shortening of the light pulse duration?) administered for only 1 hr possibly engage the same transcriptional networks that promote synapse elimination in response to 24 hrs of 3 Hz stimulation? Obviously, the parameter space for patterned stimulation protocols is endless, but a discussion of these issues is warranted.</p><p>Experiments:</p><p>1) The authors performed the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> to determine if depressed NMDAR EPSC amplitudes might be detected nearer to cessation of the brief PPS. Could 12 hours post-PPS still be too late to detect the effect? The spread of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> suggests this could be a possibility.

We agree with the reviewer that spine loss does not equal synapse loss. We revised the wording to indicate that based on a combination of measures, depression of evoked AMPA and NMDAR EPSCs and mEPSC frequency, but not mEPSC amplitude, and spine loss, suggests that chronic PPS causes an elimination of synapses. And also added to the Discussion “measurements of synaptic protein markers are necessary to determine if synapses are eliminated by chronic PPS.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In some places, this is appropriately stated, but in others (e.g. subsection “Brief periods of postsynaptic bursting silence excitatory synapses, whereas chronic bursting causes synapse elimination”), it is not.

At this time, we have only tested 3 Hz, 50 msec light pulse protocol, and the effects of different durations of stimulation. In this revision, we included, as requested, additional results on the time course and persistence of synaptic changes after cessation of brief or chronic PPS (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, D</xref>) and the dependence on MEF2A/D (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We observed in our early experiments when we optimized the intensity blue light pulses, we observed that neurons fired in bursts (2 or more action potentials) in ~85% of the pulses and in single spikes ~15% of pulses. Because L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, are required for the MEF2A/D transcriptional activation (Flavell et al., 2006) and synaptic depression, and these typically require strong depolarization, we would anticipate that action potentials and a burst or prolonged depolarization (~80-100 msec) would be required (Kapur et al., 1998). We added in the Discussion”Additional studies are needed to determine the relevant and optimal neural firing patterns that drive MEF2A/D-dependent transcription and synaptic plasticity and understand relevant in vivo activity conditions that drive these forms of synaptic plasticity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experiments:</p><p>1) The authors performed the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> to determine if depressed NMDAR EPSC amplitudes might be detected nearer to cessation of the brief PPS. Could 12 hours post-PPS still be too late to detect the effect? The spread of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> suggests this could be a possibility. Alternatively, would depressed NMDAR EPSC amplitudes manifest 24 hrs following the cessation of chronic PPS?</p></disp-quote><p>We assume the reviewer is referring to the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and these are excellent points. We performed several additional experiments to determine whether the depression of NMDARs EPSCs was determined by the duration of PPS (brief vs. chronic) or when, after PPS, we performed the recordings. As suggested by the reviewer, we recorded evoked AMPAR and NMDAR EPSCs, at earlier time points after brief PPS, 3-7 hours (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar to that observed with recordings at 12-16 or 24-28 hours after brief PPS, evoked AMPAR EPSCs were selectively depressed and NMDAR EPSCs were unchanged.</p><p>These results strengthen our original conclusions and indicate that brief PPS silences synapses within 3 hrs and this change persists for &gt;24 hr.</p><p>As requested by the reviewer, we performed the converse experiment with chronic PPS, and waited &gt;24 hours after cessation of chronic PPS to record evoked AMPAR and NMDAR EPSCs in both WT (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and MEF2A/D deleted neurons (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As observed in experiments recording immediately after chronic PPS, we observed persistent (&gt;24 hr) depression of both AMPAR and NMDAR EPSCs in WT (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and MEF2A/D deleted neurons (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This result was also previously observed in rat hippocampal slice cultures (Goold and Nicoll, 2010). These results strengthen our original conclusions and indicate that the duration of PPS determines whether synapses are silenced or functionally eliminated and silencing selectively utilizes MEF2A/D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should show if Arc is still induced by 24hrs of PPS since that is the stimulus used for the synaptic elimination study. Also it is important to know if Arc is induced in the absence of MEF2A/D after 24 hrs of PPS since that would be assumed from the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and attempted to perform this experiment. Unfortunately, we have had technical problems with the health of our dissociated neuron cultures for the past few months, perhaps caused by lot of changes in reagents, that has prevented us from observing robust, reliable induction of <italic>Arc</italic> with chronic PPS. We are willing to continue to troubleshoot these experiments, but practical interests of having a publication in a timely manner (Dr. Chang going to a postdoc, Dr. Huber’s grant renewal) dictate that we not further delay resubmission of the paper. We hope the reviewers will consider our sincere attempts to do this experiment and allow us to add to the Discussion as an alternative “Important future experiments are to determine whether <italic>Arc</italic> is induced by chronic PPS in MEF2A/D KO neurons and if other activity-regulated transcription factors, such as CREB or SRF, can compensate or contribute to <italic>Arc</italic> induction and synapse elimination in the absence of MEF2A/D (Kawashima et al., 2009).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
