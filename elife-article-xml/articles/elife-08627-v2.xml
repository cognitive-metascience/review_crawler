Yet, how the lengths of actin-based stereocilia are regulated remains poorly understood. Mutations of the molecular motor myosin 15 stunt stereocilia growth and cause deafness. We found that hair cells express two isoforms of myosin 15 that differ by inclusion of an 133-kDa N-terminal domain, and that these isoforms can selectively traffic to different stereocilia rows. Using an isoform-specific knockout mouse, we show that hair cells expressing only the small isoform remarkably develop normal stereocilia bundles. However, a critical subset of stereocilia with active mechanotransducer channels subsequently retracts. The larger isoform with the 133-kDa N-terminal domain traffics to these specialized stereocilia and prevents disassembly of their actin core. Our results show that myosin 15 isoforms can navigate between functionally distinct classes of stereocilia, and are independently required to assemble and then maintain the intricate hair bundle architecture.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08627.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08627.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08627.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sound is detected by the cochlea, a coiled structure encapsulated within the inner ear of humans and other mammals. Inside this organ, intricate arrays of sensory hair cells are stimulated by sound to generate neural signals that are transmitted to the brain. The ‘hairs’ that give hair cells their name are actually structures called stereocilia that act like antennas to detect sound waves. Damage to these delicate mechanical sensors, through genetic mutations or loud noise, are a significant cause of hearing loss in humans.</p><p>A protein called myosin 15 is a molecular motor needed for stereocilia to develop and grow to their normal height. Mutations of this protein cause hereditary deafness in humans. Hair cells produce two versions of myosin 15, which are identical except for one version having an extra region called the N-terminal extension.</p><p>Using genetic engineering, Fang et al. created mutant mice that only produce the smaller version of myosin 15 that lack the N-terminal extension. These mutant mice helped reveal that when hair cells are young, they mostly produce the smaller version of myosin 15, and this is sufficient for stereocilia to grow normally. Once hair cells mature however, they switch to producing the larger version of myosin 15 that contains the N-terminal extension. In the mutant mice that lacked the larger version of myosin 15, stereocilia ultimately deteriorate, leaving the hair cells unable to detect sound.</p><p>Myosin 15 was previously known to help stereocilia grow, but Fang et al. now show that this protein is also required to maintain stereocilia throughout life. The next challenge is to understand how the N-terminal extension enables myosin 15 to preserve the structure of adult stereocilia, and to investigate whether this activity might be stimulated to prevent hearing loss.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08627.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08627.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

bundles that project from the apical surface of cochlear hair cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwander et al., 2010</xref>). Each hair bundle is composed of actin-based stereocilia that are arranged into rows of increasing height to create a staircase-like architecture; a feature evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manley, 2000</xref>). Extracellular tip-link filaments connect the tip of each stereocilium to the lateral shaft of its taller neighbor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pickles et al., 1984</xref>). Tensioning of these links during hair bundle deflection initiates mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) by gating mechanotransducer ion channels that are located at the tips of shorter rows of stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beurg et al., 2009</xref>). Formation of the mature staircase architecture involves a complex program of differential elongation and thickening of the individual stereocilia actin cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tilney et al., 1988</xref>). How this process is developmentally specified with sub-nanometer tolerances and subsequently maintained throughout adult life is poorly understood.</p><p>Unconventional myosin 15 (encoded by <italic>Myo15</italic>) is an actin-based molecular motor and a key regulator of hair bundle development. In mice with mutations of the myosin 15 motor or tail domain, <italic>shaker 2</italic> (<italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>sh2/sh2</italic></sup>) or <italic>shaker 2-J</italic> (<italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>sh2-J/sh2-J</italic></sup>), respectively, hair bundles are short and this results in profound hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Probst et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2000</xref>).

Myosin 15 is required for stereocilia elongation and traffics molecules to the stereocilia tips, including whirlin, a cytoskeletal scaffolding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mburu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belyantseva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delprat et al., 2005</xref>), and epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (Eps8) which has actin binding, bundling and barbed-end capping activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Disanza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manor et al., 2011</xref>).

Isoform 2 transcripts skip exon 2 and use a translation start codon in exon 3 to encode a 262 kDa protein including the motor ATPase domain and C-terminal MyTH4, SH3 and FERM moieties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Isoform 1 transcripts include exon 2 that contains an alternate translation start codon and adds a 133-kDa N-terminal extension in frame with the motor domain and tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both isoform transcripts are detected in inner ear cDNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyantseva et al., 2003</xref>) and are expressed by hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caberlotto et al., 2011</xref>).

Furthermore, the independent segregation of myosin 15 isoforms within the hair bundle provides a mechanism for why the <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>ΔN</italic></sup> and <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>sh2</italic></sup> alleles cause strikingly different hair bundle phenotypes. Whilst both isoforms are absent from <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>sh2/sh2</italic></sup> hair bundles, isoform 2 is still present in stereocilia of <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>ΔN/ΔN</italic></sup> hair cells and is sufficient to drive hair bundle elongation. It follows that isoform 1 has a function critical for hearing that is unrelated to stereocilia bundle development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Isoform 2 is sufficient to traffic Whirlin and Eps8 within the hair bundle</title><p>Myosin 15 regulates hair bundle development by transporting a molecular complex containing Eps8 and whirlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belyantseva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manor et al., 2011</xref>) to sites of actin polymerization at the stereocilia tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schneider et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drummond et al., 2015</xref>). Since stereocilia elongated normally in isoform 1-null <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>ΔN/ΔN</italic></sup> hair cells, we investigated whether isoform 2 was sufficient to traffic whirlin and Eps8 within the developing hair bundle. In normal <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>+/ΔN</italic></sup> cochleae, whirlin was concentrated at the tips of the tallest row of IHC and OHC stereocilia at both P7 and P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Weaker signal (relative to the tallest row) was also detected on the shorter stereocilia rows of IHCs at both ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). When examined in isoform 1-null <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>ΔN/ΔN</italic></sup> cochleae at both P7 and P14, the localization of whirlin in IHCs and OHCs was indistinguishable from their <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>+/ΔN</italic></sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Similarly, Eps8 was detected at the tips of the tallest stereocilia row of control <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>+/ΔN</italic></sup> IHCs at both P7 and P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Weaker Eps8 labeling was also detected on the second stereocilia row of control IHCs at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and on the tallest row of control OHC stereocilia at both P7 and P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). In isoform 1-null <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>ΔN/ΔN</italic></sup> cochleae, Eps8 labeling in IHCs and OHCs appeared unchanged from the wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E,F,G</xref>). We conclude that isoform 2 by itself is sufficient to establish the wild-type distribution of Eps8 and whirlin in IHCs and OHCs.</p><p>Whirlin and Eps8 bind to domains in the C-terminal tail of myosin 15 that are common to both isoforms 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belyantseva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delprat et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manor et al., 2011</xref>). It is striking therefore that the localization of whirlin and Eps8 do not depend upon isoform 1, despite the abundance of isoform 1 in hair bundles from P7 onwards. The apparent selectivity for isoform 2 explains how Eps8 and whirlin are primarily trafficked to the tallest stereocilia row and why the ablation of isoform 1 does not interfere with stereocilia development in <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>ΔN/ΔN</italic></sup> cochleae.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Isoform 1 influences the deflection sensitivity of MET machinery in IHCs</title><p>To test whether isoform 1 is a critical component of the transduction machinery, MET currents were measured from <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>ΔN/ΔN</italic></sup> hair cells, which have normal staircase morphology and correctly oriented tip-links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Whole cell MET current responses of young postnatal IHCs and OHCs (P3-4 + 3–5 days in vitro) were evoked by graded stereocilia deflections using a rigid probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>).

This sensitivity depends on the mechanical stiffness of a theoretical ‘gating spring’ that is connected to the MET channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howard and Hudspeth, 1987</xref>). A stiffer gating spring would transmit the maximal opening force to the MET channel at a smaller bundle deflection, resulting in earlier saturation of the current-displacement relationship.

The over-elongated tips of <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>ΔN/ΔN</italic></sup> IHCs were filled with actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), indicating that actin polymerization was dysregulated at this location.

In agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rzadzinska et al., 2004</xref>), we confirmed that the tip density was absent from the tips of young postnatal <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>sh2/sh2</italic></sup> stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E–I</xref>), supporting the role of this structure in stereocilia elongation and actin polymerization.

We conclude that isoform 1 is required for the postnatal maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton, specifically in shorter row mechanotransducing stereocilia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrate that mutations in <italic>Myo15</italic> cause deafness through two fundamentally different mechanisms: (i) a failure to initially develop mechanosensory hair bundles, or (ii) a failure to maintain them once assembled. The involvement of myosin 15 isoform 2 in stereocilia development was previously established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belyantseva et al., 2005</xref>), however our finding that isoform 1 is required to maintain mature stereocilia was unexpected. These contrasting functions for myosin 15 are underlined by their different expression profiles during development. Furthermore, the isoforms have distinct spatial localizations within the hair bundle. A growing number of proteins exhibit asymmetrical distributions within different stereocilia rows of the hair bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peng et al., 2011</xref>), yet how these gradients are formed remains unclear. Our study shows that myosin 15 isoforms can selectively traffic to different stereocilia rows and establish the distribution of other proteins (e.g., whirlin and Eps8) critical for stereocilia development.</p><p>What molecular signposts influence the trafficking of myosin 15 isoforms to specific stereocilia rows? Because isoform 2 has no unique sequence when compared with isoform 1, the unique N-terminal extension of isoform 1 must be responsible for regulating its ultimate destination within the hair bundle. Several targeting mechanisms are conceivable. Under a selective retention model, both isoforms would uniformly enter all stereocilia, but be captured at the tips of the tallest or shorter rows by isoform-specific interactions. Alternatively, a selective entry model would specifically restrict isoforms from entering at the base of each stereocilium. A physical ‘gate keeper’ structure restricts cytosolic access to primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dishinger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2010</xref>), but an equivalent apparatus has yet to be identified in stereocilia or actin-rich protrusions like microvilli. Rather than being restricted by a physical barrier, the two myosin 15 isoforms may exhibit different motility on stereocilia actin filaments. The <italic>shaker 2</italic> (p.C1779Y) mutation within the actin-binding motor domain prevents both isoforms from accumulating in stereocilia, and indicates that the interaction with actin is likely critical in the trafficking process. Actin-binding proteins can direct myosin motility within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brawley and Rock, 2009</xref>) by enhancing, or inhibiting the acto-myosin binding interface to create permissive or restrictive actin tracks. Although row-specific variations in actin topology have not yet been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tilney et al., 1983</xref>), stereocilia and rootlets contain a plethora of actin-binding proteins that may provide guidance cues to spatially regulate the activity of myosin 15 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drummond et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28a">Kitajiri et al., 2010</xref>). The recent purification of myosin 15 will allow its motility to be tested on different types of cross-linked actin filaments, and to examine how the N-terminal extension might modulate this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bird et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartman et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We found that Eps8 and whirlin do not require isoform 1 to traffic to their normal locations within the hair bundle. The sole dependence upon isoform 2 is intriguing since both myosin 15 isoforms share identical Eps8 and whirlin binding sites in the tail domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belyantseva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manor et al., 2011</xref>). The molecular basis for this selectivity is unknown, although a distinct possibility is that the N-terminal extension may interact with the tail domain of myosin 15 to regulate binding to cargo proteins. This type of intra-molecular regulation is common in other myosin classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sellers and Knight, 2007</xref>). We postulate that selective binding of cargo protein to isoform 1, or 2, forms the basis of a targeted protein trafficking system within mechanosensory hair bundles. Binding partners of the N-terminal extension are now of great interest, since isoform 1 may be responsible for trafficking proteins to the vicinity of the MET machinery on the shorter stereocilia rows.</p><p>The spatial segregation of myosin 15 isoforms within the hair bundle has implications for existing models of stereocilia length regulation, which remain controversial. In one model, isoform 2 is required for elongation but does not set the absolute length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyantseva et al., 2003</xref>). This model is supported by the fact that exogenous expression of isoform 2 does not cause additional elongation of developing stereocilia in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyantseva et al., 2003</xref>). An alternate model posits that the quantity of myosin 15 at each stereocilia tip determines its length, and that graded increases on each row specify the overall staircase architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rzadzinska et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manor and Kachar, 2008</xref>). We found that although isoform 1-null <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>∆N/∆N</italic></sup> hair cells have a reduced quantity of myosin 15 on their shorter stereocilia rows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), no gross change in the initial development of the staircase architecture was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data argue against the hypothesis that myosin 15 ‘dose’ controls the length of individual stereocilia.</p><p>Isoform 1 is dispensable for the normal elongation of stereocilia in young postnatal hair cells; by inference, we conclude that isoform 2 is sufficient to drive stereocilia development. There is growing experimental evidence that myosin 15 regulates the actin cytoskeleton in developing stereocilia: (i) <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>sh2/sh2</italic></sup> hair cells have short stereocilia where the actin core fails to elongate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Probst et al., 1998</xref>); (ii) exogenous expression of isoform 2 in <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>sh2/sh2</italic></sup> hair cells rescues elongation of the stereocilia core, which entails actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belyantseva et al., 2005</xref>); (iii) expression of isoform 2 in COS-7 cells induces filopodia formation, again entailing actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyantseva et al., 2003</xref>); (iv) our present study shows that the loss of isoform 1 results in progressive disassembly of mature mechanotransducing stereocilia. Considering the exceptional stability of the stereocilia actin core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drummond et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Narayanan et al., 2015</xref>), this implies changes to how the actin cytoskeleton is regulated at the stereocilia tips of isoform 1-null hair cells. Actin filaments at the stereocilia tip are embedded within an electron-dense plaque, which is proposed to cap the filament barbed ends and regulate polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tilney et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeRosier and Tilney, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rzadzinska et al., 2004</xref>). The tip density was prominent in all rows of <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>ΔN/ΔN</italic></sup> stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that isoform 1 was not necessary for formation of this critical structure. However, once stereocilia are assembled, the postnatal incorporation of isoform 1 into the tip density, along with its cargoes, may repurpose the actin polymerization machinery from driving elongation towards the fine-tuning of local actin dynamics; which are normally restricted to the tips of mature stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drummond et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Narayanan et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, we note that the onset of stereocilia abnormalities in the second row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>) and changes to the staircase architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) occur around the same time as the appearance of isoform 1 within normal hair bundles (i.e. by P7).</p><p>The selective degeneration of only mechanotransducing stereocilia in <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>∆N/∆N</italic></sup> hair cells may result from the previously hypothesized link between MET currents and actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tilney et al., 1988</xref>). This is consistent with the tallest stereocilia rows not degenerating in <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>∆N/∆N</italic></sup> hair cells, since MET currents are not detected on the tallest rows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beurg et al., 2009</xref>). A role for mechano-transduction has been further evidenced in hair cells of mutant <italic>Ush1g</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> mice, which lose tip-links and MET currents prior to degeneration of the shorter row stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caberlotto et al., 2011</xref>). However, the loss of MET currents can occur alone without any apparent effects on stereocilia morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kawashima et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the absence of MET currents was unlikely the cause of stereocilia disassembly in <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>∆N/∆N</italic></sup> hair cells, since we found grossly normal transduction in these cells. We argue that membrane tension is instead a critical factor controlling actin polymerization at the tips of mature mechanosensitive stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diz-Munoz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr-Gillespie, 2015</xref>) and that isoform 1 may contribute to a tension-sensing mechanism. The selective degeneration of shorter mechanotransducing stereocilia in <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>∆N/∆N</italic></sup> hair cells is reminiscent of the phenotype described in <italic>Ush1g, Tmhs, Eps8L2, Xirp2, Fscn2, Dstn, Wdr1</italic> and <italic>Pls1</italic> mouse mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caberlotto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Furness et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perrin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Francis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Narayanan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scheffer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). Our observations allude to isoform 1 being part of a larger macromolecular complex, or signaling pathway, that maintains shorter row stereocilia with active MET channels.</p><p>How might isoform 1 regulate the stereocilia actin cytoskeleton in response to tension? One possibility is that isoform 1 traffics components of a tension-sensing mechanism directly to the MET machinery. The 133-kDa N-terminal extension, unique to isoform 1, contains dense clusters of poly-proline helices (data not shown) that are ligands for SH3, WW and Enabled/VASP homology (EVH1) domains commonly found in actin-regulatory proteins. The N-terminal extension may thus interact with a broad range of proteins capable of directly orchestrating cytoskeletal dynamics. The unusual physical properties of the N-terminal extension raise another distinct possibility. The N-terminal extension is predicted as intrinsically disordered due to its high-proline content (16.8%) and low sequence complexity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dis.embl.de">http://dis.embl.de</ext-link>; data not shown). Intrinsically disordered domains can explore multiple structural conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunker et al., 2002</xref>), and in some cases act as entropic spring elements, such as the PEVK domains within the giant muscle protein, titin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Linke et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watanabe et al., 2002</xref>). We found that hair bundle deflection sensitivity was increased in isoform 1-null <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>∆N/∆N</italic></sup> IHCs, consistent with the alteration of a spring element within the MET machinery. In a further parallel with the N-terminal extension, the reversible unfolding of titin's PEVK domains during muscle extension is proposed to expose buried SH3 ligands and enable force-dependent biochemical signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). If the N-terminus were similarly mechano-sensitive, this may result in tension-dependent interactions with SH3, WW and EVH1 domains, and retention of isoform 1 at sites of mechanical stress, e.g. in the vicinity of the lower tip-link insertion point on stereocilia. A mechano-sensitive N-terminal extension may also explain the localization of isoform 1 to the tallest rows of OHC stereocilia, since the tips likely experience tension from their attachment to the tectorial membrane during sound-induced deflections. Understanding the properties of isoform 1 and the N-terminal extension are now key to deciphering how the actin cytoskeleton is regulated in adult stereocilia, and to ultimately understand how these mechanosensory organelles are continually maintained throughout life.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>E1086X</italic></sup> <sup><italic>(∆N)</italic></sup> mice</title><p>To model the c.3313 G &gt; T (p.E1105X) allele of <italic>MYO15A</italic> (Genbank: NM_016239.3) that causes DFNB3 deafness in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nal et al., 2007</xref>), we made the equivalent amino acid change c.3256GAG &gt; TAA (p.E1086X) in <italic>Myo15</italic> (Genbank: NM_010862.2) using homologous recombination in mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The z-stack position was adjusted for each individual ROI to obtain the maximum fluorescence signal. Integrated fluorescence values were divided by the corresponding ROI area to yield an integrated fluorescence density for each stereocilia tip. To allow comparisons between stereocilia from different samples, fluorescence densities of individual ROIs (from the first and second row) from a single hair cell were normalized to the mean fluorescence density of the first row measured from the same hair cell. This yielded a relative intensity (RI) index, that expresses the fluorescence density at each stereocilia tip as a ratio of the fluorescence intensities observed (on average) at the tips of the tallest stereocilia row.</p><p>Implicit in this analysis is the assumption that fluorescence values on the tallest stereocilia row remain constant between different genotypes, and can thus act as an internal calibration standard.

Hair bundles were imaged as perpendicular to the stereocilia axis as possible to minimize projection errors. To quantify the shape of the second row stereocilia tips in IHCs, an outline was traced around the edge of each stereocilium, extending up to 300 nm down from the most distal point of the tip.

Hair cells were observed with a TE2000 inverted microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) using an 100x oil-immersion objective and differential interference contrast optics. To access the basolateral plasma membrane of the hair cells, the outermost cells were removed by gentle suction with a ∼5 µm micropipette. Smaller pipettes for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): CsCl (140), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (2.5), Na<sub>2</sub>ATP (2.5), EGTA (1.0), HEPES (5.0). The pipette resistance was typically 4–6 MΩ when measured in the bath. Patch clamp recordings were performed with an AxoPatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Series resistance was compensated (up to 80%, lag 7–10 µs). After compensation, the time constant of the recording system was in the range of 35–70 µs. Hair cells were held at −60 mV except for short periods of MET recordings, when the holding potential was temporarily changed to −90 mV. All recorded hair cells were approximately at the middle turn of the cochlea.</p><p>Hair bundles were deflected using a stiff glass probe that was fire-polished to a diameter of ∼5–7 µm, matching the shape of the hair bundle. The protruding part of the probe was 2–3 mm long, which prevented lateral resonances. The probe was moved by a fast piezo actuator (PA 8/14 SG, Piezosystem Jena, Hopedale, MA), custom-modified for a faster response with a time constant of 26–28 μs. The built-in strain gauge sensor of this actuator provided a direct reading of the probe's axial displacement.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Walter Marcotti (reviewer #1), the other two reviewers chose to remain anonymous.</p><p>All of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work. We look forward to receiving the revised version of your manuscript, letter. The three full reviews are included in this letter, as there are multiple specific and useful suggestions in them.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors have provided an in depth analysis of the function of myo15 in the growth and maintenance of the stereociliary hair bundle of the mammalian auditory hair cells. The hair bundle is composed of an array of actin-based stereocilia of increasing height projecting from the top of hair cells. This complex structure is the site of mechanotransduction. Despite the pivotal role of the hair bundle in sound detection, we still have a very limited understanding of how it is put together during development and maintained throughout life. Myosin 15 has been shown to be required for the initial elongation of stereocilia. Hair cells express two isoforms of myosin 15 through alternative spicing (isoform 1 and 2), but the function of isoform 1 is still unknown. Isoform1 transcript includes the exon 2, which causes deafness in human when mutated. The authors have generated a knockout mouse to ablate isoform 1 but leaving the other isoform intact. They have found a time-dependent expression of both isoforms with 2 being mainly expressed at very early stages of development (hair bundle elongation period) and 1 during later stages (maintenance period). Moreover, the two isoforms appear to selectively traffic to different stereocilia rows, with the isoform 1 being a crucial element for the morphological maintenance of adult hair bundles and their function. The authors concluded that myosin 15 can be differentially recruited at different stereocilia and play a crucial role in initial growth and maintenance of the mechano-sensory transducer apparatus. This is an excellent manuscript tackling an important research question. It is also well presented and the numerous experiments are well executed.</p><p>I have some comments that should be addressed in order to clarify some of the findings/statements and improve the message of the manuscript (not listed in order of importance):</p><p>In the subsection “<italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>∆N/∆N</italic></sup> hair cells develop normal stereocilia bundles”. I am assuming that the SEM images are taken from young mice. If so, I am not convinced that the hair bundles in mutant mice develop normally. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the tip of the stereocilia of mutant hair cells is abnormally elongated (both of those that are visible) compared to that of controls. This abnormality is only highlighted by the authors later on in the manuscript, when describing adult/mature hair bundle. Have you made some quantification supporting your conclusion in young mice?</p><p>In the subsection “Isoform 1 localizes to the tips of shorter row mechanotransducing stereocilia”. Although very interesting, the statement that the localization of myosin 15 is linked to “sites under mechanical tension” is too speculative. I guess it would be quite difficult to prove this, but I guess you could look at mutants that lack the normal hair bundle resting tension or the tectorial membrane.</p><p>In the subsection “Isoform 2 is sufficient to traffic Whirlin and Eps8 within the hair bundle”. Consider that Eps8 is also present in the shorter stereocilia.</p><p>In the subsection “Isoform 1 influences the deflection sensitivity of MET machinery in IHCs“. Add the number of cells tested for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Also, use “300 nm” instead “200 nm” to match the Figure (the Figure shows significant difference also at 300nm). Moreover, I cannot see any direct evidence supporting the statement that the mutation causes a change in the overall bundle stiffness. This statement should be validated by measuring bundle stiffness in both controls and littermate ko hair cells and values given in the test.</p><p>In the subsection “Isoform 1 is required for postnatal maintenance of shorter row mechanotransducing stereocilia”. “isoform 1 is not required for initial tip density formation...” This statement needs some additional verification – see above (subsection “<italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>∆N/∆N</italic></sup> hair cells develop normal stereocilia bundles”).</p><p>In the sixth paragraph of the Discussion. “We argue that membrane tensioning..., and that the absence of isoform 1 cripples this mechanisms”. I am not sure about this explanation; although possible it is unlikely for several reasons. While isoform 1 is mainly expressed during mature stages, the characteristic staircase structure of the bundle is defined during early postnatal days. Hair bundles with no resting tension, (e.g. Myo7a mutant mice) are able to initially develop a staircase structure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The study by Fang et al., presents the characterization of the deletion of a long isoform of Myo15, which is an uncoventional myosin required for function of hair cells. The results suggest that this isoform resides in different rows of stereocilia in inner hair cells in contrast to the shorter isoform of Myo15, and each Myo15 isoform plays a different role in assembly and maintenance of the structure of hair bundles. Overall, the study presents interesting findings and provides some insight into the function of the longer isoform of Myo15, which has been a bit of an enigma with regard to the function of the N-terminus present only in the longer isoform.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and I only have some minor concerns/comments:</p><p>The data in the first figure show that hair bundles in mice lacking the long isoform of Myo15 are normal, yet the mice are deaf. In a way, this figure is misleading because the SEM image is of an immature hair bundle at P4 and the tests for hearing function are performed much later (P14 and onwards). The reader is not shown the degeneration of hair bundles and likely cause for the hearing deficits until the penultimate figure of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> establishes the late onset of expression of the long isoform of Myo15, which corroborates nicely with the rest of the study. It is also satisfying to see that expression levels of each isoform do not change in the mouse mutants. So no major concerns with this figure, other than it is difficult to discern which isoform is more abundant. Presumably the relative expression level is relative to the level seen at P0, but not to each other.</p><p>The authors show that the long isoform is mainly localized to the shorter rows of inner hair cells. This pattern is not the case in outer hair cells. Is the localization pattern specialized only in cochlear inner hair cells? What about vestibular hair cells? Is this a universal feature of hair cells or something specific to inner hair cells? If the long isoform plays a special role in mechanotransduction, then it is hard to explain why it is found in the tallest row of stereocilia in outer hair cells. It is true that OHCs are not the main “transducers” in the cochlea, but rather help to amplify cochlear signals, however, this type of hair cell is, after all, the most often used cell type to measure transduction in mouse models. The authors mention the possibility of tension being created by the attachment of the tectorial membrane, so one might guess that this isoform will not be present in the tallest stereocilia of vestibular hair cells. Showing the localization in vestibular hair cells would make this idea, i.e. the long isoform is present at tips that experience tension, more compelling.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is key in showing a different pattern of localization for isoform 2. There are, however, a number of issues with this figure. All of the stages shown are from time points when isoform 2 is expressed at 10 fold lower levels as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. What about P0 or earlier, when isoform 2 is supposed to be exerting its function and important for development? In panel 4D, where are the shorter rows of stereocilia in this image? In panel 4F, whirlin is present in the shorter rows of stereocilia, yet the whirlin (and epsin8) signal is absent in the shorter rows shown in panels H and J. Why do these panels differ so much if they are of the same genotype?</p><p>In panel 4G: Unlike panel B, there appears to be whirlin protein in the shorter stereocilia. It appears that whirlin is localized to some extent independently of the shorter isoform of Myo15.</p><p>The changes in the MET currents are subtle and the authors emphasize the earlier opening of channels in the long isoform mutant, yet ignore the earlier onset of saturation of the current. The authors should also comment on this part of the phenotype and explain how it fits in with the idea of a missing spring element.</p><p>Also, the lower two rows of the OHCs have the long isoform present, yet the changes differ considerably from the IHCs (less current, slower adaptation). Why see these differences between the two hair cell types? The effects are challenging to interpret.</p><p>The final figure focuses on the ultrastructural changes in stereocilia upon deletion of the long isoform. It would behoove the authors to substitute a better image of the wild type tip link area that doesn't have a big, artifactual bleb. An outside reader may be misled into thinking that this membrane protrusion is normal. The stretching of the tips is certainly interesting, but there is no quantification of this defect. How often was it seen? In the Discussion, the authors say that “eruptions” are happening at the tips, but there is just one static TEM image in this study and there is no evidence that actin assembly is being dysregulated within this zone.</p><p>In general, there is a lot of speculation in the Discussion. Based on the evidence of this study, it is difficult to say whether Myo15 “regulates” actin filaments. The “eruptions” described above could be the simple extension of actin filaments into space during development. Evidence is lacking in terms of the time scale of this particular phenotype (and also the frequency of stretched tips is not shown). The actual thinning of stereocilia may be an indirect effect of the chronic loss of Myo15. Such a phenotype is also seen in other mouse mutants, such as the pirouette/GRXCR1 mutant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Fang et al. employ two new tools to study Myosin 15 function in hair cell development and physiology. Together these reveal the functional significance of alternative splicing of the Myosin 15 gene. The tools include antibodies that detect protein sequences encoding by Myosin15 exon two that are only found in Isoform1, and an engineered mouse model that mimics a human deafness allele that specific disrupts expression of Myosin 15 Isoform 1. Together these reagents reveal the interesting and significant findings of the paper; (1) that distinct protein Myosin15 isoforms contribute to hair cell development versus hair cell function and stereocilia homeostasis and (2) that distinct Myosin15 isoforms are trafficked to different rows of stereocilia. The figures are presented in a clear and concise manner, the data appears to be interpreted accurately and supports the conclusions drawn by the authors. Overall it is a good manuscript and is ready for publication.</p><p>The principal concern is primarily semantic. The title, “An unique N-terminal domain...” implies that this is the first report of myosin 15 alternative splice isoforms and the discovery of sequences unique to Isoform 1. However as stated in the Introduction, alternative splicing of the Mysoin15 gene was initially reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liang et al. (1999)</xref>, and humun mutations in exon2 that only affect Isoform 1 were previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bashir et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cengiz et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fattahi et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nal et al. 2007</xref>). A new title that accurately reflects the state of the field is recommended.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08627.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>[…] I have some comments that should be addressed in order to clarify some of the findings/statements and improve the message of the manuscript (not listed in order of importance):</italic></p><p><italic>In the subsection “</italic>Myo15<sup>∆N/∆N</sup> <italic>hair cells develop normal stereocilia bundles”.

Have you made some quantification supporting your conclusion in young mice?</italic></p><p>We are very grateful to the reviewer for spotting this inconsistency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> as originally submitted showed a hair cell in which most of the second row stereocilia tips exhibited a more “tented” shape compared to the control.</p><p>Variations of IHC stereocilia tip shapes throughout the analyzed region of the cochlea (middle of the apical turn) have now been systematically quantified in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–Figure supplement 3</xref>. In this analysis, we fit ellipses to the 2<sup>nd</sup> row stereocilia tips using ImageJ and calculated aspect ratios (elliptical major axis divided by minor axis). We also quantified the staircase architecture of the hair bundle using measurements of row-to-row steps, a technique previously used to study <italic>Tmhs</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>, PMID: 23217710). This data is presented in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>. Full details of these quantification techniques have been added to the Materials and Methods.</p><p>Both of these analyses reveal that at P4, the stereocilia bundles of <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> IHCs are indistinguishable with controls. A morphological phenotype only becomes detectable later in development, by P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref>), consistent with the onset of isoform 1 expression around this age. Based upon these new data, we have replaced the image of a <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> IHC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> with one more representative of the actual measured distribution. The age of the cells (P4) and their location along the cochlea (at the middle of the apical turn) are now referenced in the figure and legend.</p><p>It is worth stressing that the normal variations of stereocilia tip morphology along the analyzed region of the cochlea in wild-type IHCs are fundamentally different from the over-extended stereocilia observed in <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). At P8, the second row stereocilia in <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> inner hair cells exhibit large variations of the lengths even within the same row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), which are not observed in the control stereocilia bundles. The extent of non-uniformity of the mutant stereocilia is particularly well highlighted by this new analysis. We thank the Reviewer for suggesting that we make these measurements. Overall, they have strengthened our assertion that <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> hair bundles initially develop with a normal architecture.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Isoform 1 localizes to the tips of shorter row mechanotransducing stereocilia”. Although very interesting, the statement that the localization of myosin 15 is linked to “sites under mechanical tension” is too speculative. I guess it would be quite difficult to prove this, but I guess you could look at mutants that lack the normal hair bundle resting tension or the tectorial membrane.</italic></p><p>We agree that our idea of isoform 1 associating with sites under mechanical tension remains entirely speculative at this present time. We wanted to highlight this association only as a possible hypothesis for why isoform 1 localizes differently to the tallest stereocilia in IHCs vs OHCs. This idea has been moved from the Results to the very end of the Discussion, as we feel that it is still worth proposing. The experiments suggested by the Reviewer are an interesting approach to exploring this relationship and are an area for future investigation.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Isoform 2 is sufficient to traffic Whirlin and Eps8 within the hair bundle”. Consider that Eps8 is also present in the shorter stereocilia.</italic></p><p>We assume that the reviewer is referring to the mechanism of how Eps8 is localized to shorter row stereocilia. The quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> shows that there is some isoform 2 present on the shorter stereocilia rows at P7, but that isoform 1 is the major species at this location. The presence of smaller quantities of isoform 2 is consistent with our detection of whirlin and Eps8 on the 2<sup>nd</sup> IHC stereocilia row at P7.</p><p>An updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref> has been provided to show Eps8 labeling on the shorter stereocilia in P7 <italic>Myo15ΔN/ΔN</italic> IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1G</xref>). In our hands, the labeling of shorter stereocilia with Eps8 immunofluorescence is very weak.</p><p>The text in the subsection “Isoform 2 is sufficient to traffic Whirlin and Eps8 within the hair bundle” has also been modified to highlight that the segregation of Eps8 and whirlin to the tallest stereocilia row is not 100% at P7.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Isoform 1 influences the deflection sensitivity of MET machinery in IHCs“. Add the number of cells tested for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>. Also, use “300 nm” instead “200 nm” to match the Figure (the Figure shows significant difference also at 300nm). Moreover, I cannot see any direct evidence supporting the statement that the mutation causes a change in the overall bundle stiffness. This statement should be validated by measuring bundle stiffness in both controls and littermate ko hair cells and values given in the test.</italic></p><p>As requested, we have added the number of cells examined to the main text. The main text now reads as, “Maximal MET current amplitudes were not statistically different between mutant <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> (n=12) and control <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>+/ΔN</italic></sup> IHCs (n=10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). However, the responses to small bundle deflections (150-300 nm) were significantly larger in mutant <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> IHCs, indicating an increased deflection sensitivity of the transduction apparatus in the absence of isoform 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>)”. We also added the number of OHCs tested, <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> (n=9), <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>+/ΔN</italic></sup> (n=7), in the relevant sentence at the end of that paragraph.</p><p>We did not intend to suggest that the overall stiffness of the hair bundle is affected in <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> hair cells. Instead, we referred to the stiffness of the theoretically defined gating spring element attached to the MET channel. In young postnatal mammalian inner hair cells, even complete disruption of MET machinery with BAPTA does not result in significant changes to the overall bundle stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28a">Kitajiri et al., 2010</xref>). Measurements of the non-linear mechanical compliance of the MET machinery in mammalian auditory hair cells also varies in the hands of the same group (Kennedy et al., 2005, PMID:15696193; Beurg et al., 2008, PMID:18178649). These measurements are certainly beyond the scope of our current characterization of <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> mutants. To avoid confusion, we have rephrased the relevant text as follows:</p><p>“This sensitivity depends on the mechanical stiffness of a theoretical “gating spring” that is connected to the MET channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howard and Hudspeth, 1987</xref>). Our data show that isoform 1 is not essential for MET responses in IHCs but may contribute to the stiffness of this gating spring”.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Isoform 1 is required for postnatal maintenance of shorter row mechanotransducing stereocilia”. “isoform 1 is not required for initial tip density formation...” This statement needs some additional verification – see above (subsection “Myo15</italic><sup><italic>∆N/∆N</italic></sup> <italic>hair cells develop normal stereocilia bundles”).</italic></p><p>Our current manuscript shows that the tip-density is clearly present in both wild-type and isoform 1-null <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> hair cells at P7. We have now additionally examined the tip- density in <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> hair cells at P3, and found that the tip-density is also detected at this younger age (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). Combined with our new analysis of stereocilia morphology, these data further strengthen our assertion that stereocilia bundles initially develop normally (at least to P4) in the absence of isoform 1.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08627.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>TEM images of ultrathin sections cut along the longitudinal stereocilia axis of <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>+/ΔN</italic></sup> (A) and <italic>Myo15</italic><italic><sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> (B) inner hair cells at P3.

This idea is still speculative, as we stressed to Reviewer 1, however we do believe this hypothesis is worth presenting to generate discussion in the field and guide future experiments.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have examined PB888 labeling of isoform 1 in wild-type mouse utricles at P14. We observe PB888 immunofluorescence labeling primarily in striolar hair cells where it is present at the tips of all stereocilia rows (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>). PB888 labeling of extra-striolar hair cells is weak and sporadic (data not shown). These data are entirely consistent with isoform 1 localizing to sites under tension, since the tips of the tallest stereocilia rows in vestibular hair cells are coupled to the kinocilium, which is ultimately connected to the otoconial matrix.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08627.021</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>PB888 labeling of isoform 1 in a striola hair cell from a P14 utricle.

Quite the opposite: we only detect minor changes to MET currents in the absence of isoform 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and these could result from subtle changes to the protein complexes that presumably couple the membrane or MET channel complex to the stereocilia actin core. According to our data, the major function of isoform 1 is to maintain the actin cytoskeleton in mechanotransducing stereocilia (i.e. those with active MET). This function is conserved in both IHCs and OHCs, despite minor differences in isoform 1 localization in these cells.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>is key in showing a different pattern of localization for isoform 2.

Why do these panels differ so much if they are of the same genotype?</italic></p><p>We agree that the current figure layout is confusing. To improve figure clarity, we have moved the ages and genotypes to within each image, and furthermore grouped images that are logically connected into combined panels.</p><p>The images refered to are all from normal-hearing <italic>Myo15<sup>+/ΔN</sup></italic> cochleae, but Panel F is P7 (whirlin, now panel D), whilst panels H (whirlin, now E) and J (Eps8, now F) are from P14 cochleae. The Reviewer is correct that in normal mice, both Eps8 and whirlin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1E, G</xref>) are detected on the 2<sup>nd</sup> row IHC stereocilia at P7, and that this labeling is not evident in older animals at P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>, top row). These age-dependent changes in the localization of whirlin and Eps8 are identical to previously published data in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belyantseva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delprat et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Furness et al., 2013</xref>). The changes in Eps8/whirlin also mirror the time course of isoform 2 loss from the shorter stereocilia rows between P7 and P14 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>, lower rows).</p><p><italic>In panel 4G: Unlike panel B, there appears to be whirlin protein in the shorter stereocilia. It appears that whirlin is localized to some extent independently of the shorter isoform of Myo15.</italic></p><p>The Reviewer is absolutely correct that a weak whirlin signal is present on the shorter stereocilia of isoform 1-null hair cells at P7. This is entirely consistent with the small amounts of myosin 15 isoform 2 that we detect at P7 (quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) at this location.</p><p>The existing manuscript does allude to this in the subsection “Myosin 15 isoforms are differentially trafficked within the hair bundle”: “This indicates that the majority of myosin 15 in the second row is isoform 1 and that isoform 2 is the minor species at this location”.</p><p><italic>The changes in the MET currents are subtle and the authors emphasize the earlier opening of channels in the long isoform mutant, yet ignore the earlier onset of saturation of the current. The authors should also comment on this part of the phenotype and explain how it fits in with the idea of a missing spring element.</italic></p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the following sentence to subsection “Isoform 1 influences the deflection sensitivity of MET machinery in IHCs”, “A stiffer gating spring would transmit the maximal opening force to the MET channel at a smaller bundle deflection, resulting in earlier saturation of the current-displacement relationship. This was indeed observed in <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>)”.</p><p><italic>Also, the lower two rows of the OHCs have the long isoform present, yet the changes differ considerably from the IHCs (less current, slower adaptation). Why see these differences between the two hair cell types? The effects are challenging to interpret.</italic></p><p>We agree that the different effects of isoform 1 deficiency upon MET currents in mutant IHCs and OHCs are hard to interpret; especially so if one assumes that the mechanotransduction mechanisms are identical in all vertebrate hair cells. There is however, growing evidence of essential differences between IHCs and OHCs in the MET apparatus itself. A notable example is the tonotopic distribution of the single MET channel conductance in OHCs, but not in IHCs (Beurg et al., 2006, PMID: 17065441).</p><p>Furthermore, the shaker 2 mutation, which we show in the current manuscript affects both myosin 15 isoforms, causes different effects on the hair bundle staircase and MET currents in IHCs versus OHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stepanyan &amp; Frolenkov, 2009</xref>, PMID: 19339598). Without the exact knowledge of all proteins that populate the different stereocilia tips of OHCs and IHCs, it is premature to speculate on the detailed mechanisms of MET changes following isoform 1 loss in these different sensory cell types.</p><p>We would like to clarify that fast adaptation in <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> OHCs is not slower than control OHCs. We state in the subsection “Isoform 1 influences the deflection sensitivity of MET machinery in IHCs”, “The time constant of adaptation was not affected in either IHCs or OHCs of <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> mice compared to <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>+/ΔN</italic></sup> controls”. This is also illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>. In fact, the extent of this adaptation (the percentage of the adapted current) is even larger in mutant OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), indicating that the adaptation machinery is likely to be unaffected by isoform 1 deficiency.</p><p><italic>The final figure focuses on the ultrastructural changes in stereocilia upon deletion of the long isoform. It would behoove the authors to substitute a better image of the wild type tip link area that doesn't have a big, artifactual bleb. An outside reader may be misled into thinking that this membrane protrusion is normal.</italic></p><p>We have replaced the image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, as requested.</p><p><italic>The stretching of the tips is certainly interesting, but there is no quantification of this defect. How often was it seen? In the Discussion, the authors say that “eruptions” are happening at the tips, but there is just one static TEM image in this study and there is no evidence that actin assembly is being dysregulated within this zone.</italic></p><p>We have now quantified the shape factor (aspect ratio of an ellipse fitted to the stereocilia tip) of 2<sup>nd</sup> row stereocilia in both normal hearing <italic>Myo15<sup>+/ΔN</sup></italic> and mutant <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> IHCs at P4, P6 and P8 (see the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref>), and thank the Reviewer for requesting this important addition to our manuscript.</p><p>At P4, we do not detect a difference in the distribution of aspect ratios. However by P6 and P8, there are statistically significant increases in the tip aspect ratios of <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> stereocilia. Critically, we observed stereocilia at P8 with aspect ratios &gt;&gt; 2 (note the compressed axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref>), and these correspond to the unusually over-elongated stereocilia tips shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>.</p><p>It is possible that the tips are stretched, but we favor the hypothesis that abnormalities in the actin cytoskeleton are the driving force behind the membrane distension. TEM images of sections through over-elongated tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) reveal actin filaments in close apposition beneath the membrane, which is consistent with the actin cytoskeleton providing force to distend the membrane, similar to an extending lamellipodium of a motile cell. Since this type of more extreme protrusion morphology was not observed at P4 or P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref>), the actin cytoskeleton must have remodeled to power this morphological change.</p><p>Our SEM measurements provide a static snapshot of what is a likely dynamic process. Future experiments will use live cell imaging experiments to investigate this phenomenon further, but these are beyond the scope of our current study.</p><p>We have removed the word “eruption” from the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>In general, there is a lot of speculation in the Discussion. Based on the evidence of this study, it is difficult to say whether Myo15 “regulates” actin filaments. The “eruptions” described above could be the simple extension of actin filaments into space during development. Evidence is lacking in terms of the time scale of this particular phenotype (and also the frequency of stretched tips is not shown).</italic></p><p>We are grateful to the Reviewer for encouraging us to quantify the morphological phenotype of mutant stereocilia. These new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2 fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplements 2 and 3</xref>) allow us to address these points directly.</p><p>The over-elongation of stereocilia involves the extension of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), however the new analysis of stereocilia morphology does not support a model where actin filaments simply overextend during development. The overall staircase architecture of mutant hair cells is indistinguishable from normal samples at P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>) and over- elongated tips were not observed in either mutant or wild-type at this age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>This indicates that at P4, the stereocilia actin cytoskeleton is still similarly regulated in mutants compared with wild-type controls. However by P8, over-elongated stereocilia tips are detected in mutant hair cells but are absent from littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref>). This demonstrates that the changes observed in mutant hair cells are not a recapitulation of the normal developmental program. We note that the onset of stereocilia tip over-elongation in mutant hair cells occurs within a similar time window to when isoform 1 normally localizes to the stereocilia bundle.</p><p>We have taken this opportunity to revise parts of the Discussion to try and clarify the argument for myosin 15 regulating the actin cytoskeleton and how this might operate in hair cells. Clearly, we do not have a detailed biochemical mechanism, so we use “regulate” in the broadest possible sense to include either direct, or indirect regulation of actin filaments by myosin 15.</p><p>As a comparison, the Rho family of GTPases were originally identified as molecules that could regulate the actin cytoskeleton and generate stress fibers, lamellipodia and filopodia (Nobes and Hall, 1995, PMID: 7536630). It was not until later that the multiple effector proteins and pathways that mediate this effect were identified.</p><p><italic>The actual thinning of stereocilia may be an indirect effect of the chronic loss of Myo15. Such a phenotype is also seen in other mouse mutants, such as the pirouette/GRXCR1 mutant.</italic></p><p>The mechanism of stereocilia thinning is unknown, except to say that it involves the loss/depolymerization of actin filaments from within the core. It is unlikely due to a chronic loss of myosin 15, since <italic>Myo15<sup>sh2/sh2</sup></italic> hair cells (which lack both isoforms in the stereocilia bundle) have nearly identical stereocilia thicknesses in all rows within the hair bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stepanyan and Frolenkov, 2009</xref>, PMID:19339598). Furthermore, unlike the <italic>pirouette</italic> mouse that exhibits thinning of all stereocilia rows, we observe a specific thinning of the mechanosensitive shorter rows only. The <italic>Myo15<sup>ΔN/ΔN</sup></italic> phenotype is therefore unlikely due to general hair cell degeneration, since the tallest stereocilia row appears unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>[…] The principal concern is primarily semantic.
