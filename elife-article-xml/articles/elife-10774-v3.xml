Here we used rapid, reversible optogenetic inhibition to test the role of cortex during a head-fixed task in which mice reach, grab, and eat a food pellet. Sudden cortical inhibition blocked initiation or froze execution of this skilled prehension behavior, but left untrained forelimb movements unaffected. Unexpectedly, kinematically normal prehension occurred immediately after cortical inhibition, even during rest periods lacking cue and pellet. This ‘rebound’ prehension was only evoked in trained and food-deprived animals, suggesting that a motivation-gated motor engram sufficient to evoke prehension is activated at inhibition’s end. These results demonstrate the necessity and sufficiency of cortical activity for enacting a learned skill.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10774.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10774.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10774.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many of the movements that humans and other animals make every day are deceptively complex and only appear easy because of extensive practice. For example, picking up an object involves several steps that must be precisely controlled, including reaching towards the item and holding it using the right amount of pressure to not crush it or drop it. Part of the brain called the motor cortex is thought to be important for learning and controlling these skilled movements, but its exact role in these processes is not clear.</p><p>A technique called optogenetics allows the roles of individual parts of the brain to be studied by rapidly altering their activity, whilst minimizing the likelihood that the brain will compensate for these changes. By genetically modifying animals to produce light-sensitive channel proteins in certain brain cells, the activity of particular regions of the brain can be controlled by shining light onto them. Guo et al. have now used optogenetics to control the motor cortex as the mice performed a task they had been trained to do – reaching for and picking up a food pellet.</p><p>Suddenly shutting down the motor cortex at the start of a trial prevented the mice from starting the task, and shut down part way through the task caused the front limbs of the mice to freeze in midair. However, only the learned, skilled task was frozen by motor cortex shutdown; mice could still move their limbs normally if the motor cortex was instead shut down during routine movements. When the cortex was reactivated, the mice instantly resumed trying to pick up the food pellet.</p><p>Unexpectedly, even during rest periods when there was no food pellet and the mice were just waiting for the experiment to begin, turning the motor cortex off and then back on again suddenly caused the mice to perform the complete grabbing motion. This implies that the cortical activity evoked at the end of inactivation acts to trigger the full movement sequence. This was particularly likely to occur if the animal had been deprived of food before the test or was particularly well trained, but did not depend on the position of the limb.</p><p>Overall, Guo et al.’s work opens the question of how the instructions that describe the learned movement are encoded within the motor cortex and its downstream networks. Future studies could also investigate how learning a set of movements affects the structure of cortical neurons and their connections, thus suggesting how these memories are stored.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10774.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10774.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>motor control</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Branson</surname><given-names>Kristin</given-names></name><name><surname>Hantman</surname><given-names>Adam W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Optogenetic inhibition demonstrates that the cortex is necessary and sufficient for the initiation and execution of a learned, skilled action.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Execution of complex voluntary movements depends on many functions including choosing a behavior, specifying each step, enacting the movements, and learning to perform with increasing skill. Motor control is achieved by the coordinated activity of myriad neural structures, including the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Neurophysiological recordings, inactivation experiments, and stimulation studies have been used to describe the role of cortex in motor control. Cortical neurons display dynamic activity patterns during movement planning and execution, but their functional contribution to skilled action cannot be assessed from recordings alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lemon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scott, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Evarts, 2011</xref>). Previous inactivation experiments have suggested the cortex tunes—rather than initiates and executes—motor programs to achieve dexterous movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Walker and Fulton, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lawrence and Kuypers, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castro, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Passingham et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Martin and Ghez, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Whishaw, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fogassi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peters et al., 2014</xref>). The classical perturbation methods used in these studies lack temporal specificity and allow for the emergence of compensatory mechanisms (but see supplement of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peters et al., 2014</xref>). Electrical stimulation of cortex has been shown to be sufficient to elicit complex movements, but it remains difficult to resolve if evoked behaviors are caused by direct cortical neuron stimulation or antidromic activation of inputs to cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferrier, 1873</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Penfield, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gottlieb et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graziano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ramanathan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harrison et al., 2012</xref>). Thus the precise role of cortex in skilled movement remains unclear. Here we inhibited cortex with an optogenetic method that minimizes compensation, and selective stimulation of cortical neurons was achieved by the cessation of inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To test the role of the cortex for control of skilled motor tasks, we developed a multi-step, cued, prehension task in which head-fixed mice reach for a food pellet, grab it, and bring the pellet to the mouth for consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). This prehension behavior was broken down into six sequential epochs (Lift, Hand open, Grab, Supinate, At mouth, and Chew; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>) that divide the complex movement into components that involve distinct muscle activations. Unlike previous paradigms, our task employed head fixation to reduce postural variability, allow examination of reaction time, and enable future physiological investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Whishaw et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Osborne and Dudman, 2014</xref>). All animals that underwent training learned the task. Reaching for the pellet could be achieved in 5–10 sessions and stable performance (median success rate was 74%, n = 13 animals) could be realized in approximately 15 sessions. We used high-speed video and machine-learning-based tracking to semi-automatically convert filmed movements into hand trajectories (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).

To avoid this confound, we employed rapid onset, within-trial suppression by light-activating channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-expressing inhibitory neurons (expressing the vesicular GABA transporter [<italic>Slc32a1</italic>]) in cortex with pulses of light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). This method presumes that activation of <italic>Slc32a1-</italic>COP4*H134R/EYFP-positive neurons selectively suppresses cortex, although other possibilities do exist (for evidence against, see methods). Cortical inhibition was limited in space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and time by regulating the position and duration of light exposure. To limit compensation, light was delivered on less than 20% of trials during a behavioral session. We first applied inhibition at cue onset to test the role of cortex for behavior initiation. The only effective area of cortical suppression was centered over contralateral forelimb motor cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). Because forelimb motor and sensory cortices are overlapping at this resolution in the rodent, we will refer to this region as sensorimotor (SM) cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayling et al., 2009</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10774.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Initiation of head-fixed prehension behavior requires contralateral sensorimotor cortex.</title><p>Optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic inhibitory neurons in <italic>Slc32a1-</italic>COP4*H134R/EYFP mice was used to suppress specific cortical areas, as depicted in the schematic.

In contrast to prehension, voluntary grooming was not impacted by sensorimotor cortical suppression (11/11 trials, n = 4 animals, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). To rule out that initiation failure was due to an inability to process the cue, we activated cortical inhibitory neurons during a cued licking task in which a pellet of food positioned close to the mouth was captured by the tongue; this behavior was not affected by sensorimotor inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Videos 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">7</xref>). During this cued licking task, animals sometimes moved their forelimb from the perch to their mouth/table (2/3 animals, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). While these movements shared some features with the trained prehension behavior, they were not kinematically stereotyped. Contralateral sensorimotor cortical suppression did not prevent these forelimb movements during cued licking (forelimb movement in 44/44 control trials and 20/20 laser trials for two animals, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>).

Sensorimotor cortical suppression during the Lift, Hand open, Grab, and Supination components of the movement resulted in a “freezing” of progression towards the target, after a short latency (5/5 animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Videos 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">12</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media16">16</xref>). The latency to freezing (between 72–170 ms for a representative animal) implies that this is the timescale over which the cortex commands specific components of the movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A4–D4</xref>). Movement during the delay was not simply the result of momentum, since in many cases the movement progressed to the next distinct component before freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A3–E4</xref>). Cortical suppression was not effective at impeding hand movements involved in chewing, suggesting these motor programs do not require sensorimotor cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Videos 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media15">15</xref>), despite involving similar muscle groups.

An involuntary nature of rebound prehension was supported by its occurrence even on cued trials when the animal had already grabbed the pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Videos 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">12</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media16">16</xref>). To further test this, we removed both the pellet and the cue to disengage the animal from the task. During these uncued experiments, the animals remained motionless during contralateral sensorimotor cortical inhibition as expected. Surprisingly, immediately (~250 ms) following light cessation, the animals reached and grabbed at the empty pellet tray (initiation in 192/224 trials, n = 8 animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media17">Videos 17</xref>). Rebound execution did not occur in untrained animals (3/3 animals) and was specific to prehension; no other type of movement was generated following light termination (n = 1434 trials, n = 5 animals). If a pellet was in the target position but the animal was not alerted of its presence, cessation of inhibition frequently generated the full reach-grab-eat sequence (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media18">Videos 18</xref>). Taken together, these observations indicate that rebound prehension is not the result of ongoing sensory information or the animals’ remembered behavioral state. Rather, termination of inhibitory neuron activation in sensorimotor cortex, in combination with plastic changes induced by training, is sufficient to evoke a complex, learned motor act.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media17" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-10774-media17.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10774.028</object-id><label>Video 17.</label><caption><title>Even in the absence of a cue or a pellet, cessation of optogenetic inhibition of contralateral sensorimotor cortex evokes prehension.</title><p>Contralateral sensorimotor cortex inhibition (2 s of light delivery) in <italic>Slc32a1-</italic>COP4*H134R/EYFP mice was not paired with a cue or a pellet.

Anatomically, no area outside of sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the utilized limb was effective in evoking the behavior in the no cue/no pellet condition (ipsilateral sensorimotor, 0/68 trials, n = 3 animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; frontal, 0/20 trials, n = 2 animals; visual, 0/21 trials, n = 3 animals). Duration of cortical inhibition was also a critical factor in initiating rebound prehension. At least 2 s (median across animals) of cortical inhibition was required to achieve rebound prehension rates above 90% (n = 4 animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Longer durations (4 s was longest tested) of cortical inhibition also reduced the latency variability of prehension initiation (n = 2 animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Interestingly, long durations of photostimulation (2 s or more) were specifically associated with prominent rebound spiking in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This raises the possibility that rebound spiking in the cortex is responsible for rebound prehension. Rebound prehension itself is also cortically dependent, as reactivation of sensorimotor inhibitory cortical neurons freezes progression of the rebound movement (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media19">Videos 19</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The presence of food in the mouth decreased rebound prehension rates (18/95 trials exhibited rebound; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Videos 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media15">15</xref>). For nearly all of these (93/95) trials, animals were still chewing at light termination. To distinguish whether the reduced rate of rebound prehension was related to motor-program competition (chewing versus prehension) or to motivation (due to consumption of the pellet), we assayed rebound rates for failure trials where animals were chewing without the pellet (29/256 trials, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Prehension generally occurred (21/29 trials) if the light was terminated during pelletless chewing. To further test the role of hunger/satiety, we terminated food deprivation; animals on free food for one day exhibited significantly reduced rates of rebound prehension despite still engaging in the control version of the behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). These results suggest that motivational drive, operating along both short (eating) and long (sated) time scales, gates rebound prehension. Therefore, evocation of the learned behavior depends not only on features of the inhibition but also on the satiety of the animal.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media19" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-10774-media19.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10774.030</object-id><label>Video 19.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic inhibition of contralateral sensorimotor cortex (3 s of light delivery twice, separated by 320 ms) during Supinate of a post-inhibitory prehension attempt can stop progression to the mouth.</title><p>Contralateral sensorimotor cortex inhibition in <italic>Slc32a1-</italic>COP4*H134R/EYFP mice occurred during Supinate of a post-inhibitory prehension attempt.

Contrary to the view that cortex is only involved in achieving dexterity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kawai et al., 2015</xref>), we found cortex to be necessary for initiating and executing the dexterous and non-dexterous steps of this skilled movement. The necessity of cortex for initiation and execution is consistent with some interpretations of experiments where cortical stimulation delayed or interrupted voluntary movements in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Penfield and Jasper, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Day et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lemon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchland and Shenoy, 2007</xref>). Apparent disagreements between our work and that described by Kawai et al. may be due to differences in the behavior and/or the perturbation methodology. The forelimb-lever press task in the study by Kawai et al. requires animals to learn a time interval but not the precise spatial position of an external target. In contrast, the prehension behavior studied here requires the animal to learn the position of the pellet and how to precisely execute a reach to that location. This difference suggests that cortex is not required for interval tasks but rather skilled interactions with objects in the environment. An outlier animal described by Kawai et al. provides support for this hypothesis; this animal was unique in that it made precise movements to the lever and showed a significant decrease in performance after cortical perturbation. Additionally, the two experiments also differ in the acuteness of the cortical manipulations; we used rapid onset optogenetic inhibition while Kawai et al. utilized pharmacological and surgical manipulations. The rapidity of optogenetic inhibition may impede compensation mechanisms that ameliorate resulting phenotypes.</p><p>We found that termination of inhibitory neuron activation in sensorimotor cortex suffices to drive a full action sequence to the learned target. Previous activation studies of cortex have shown that electrical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferrier, 1873</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Penfield, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gottlieb et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graziano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ramanathan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonazzi et al., 2013</xref>) and optogenetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harrison et al., 2012</xref>) stimulation for behaviorally relevant durations produces motor sequences. Rebound prehension differs from these movements in three ways: rebound prehension is a coordinated sequence of movements (reaching, grabbing, and eating) accurately directed to an external goal regardless of starting position, depends on training, and is gated by motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ramanathan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harrison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonazzi et al., 2013</xref>). These differences suggest that termination of inhibition evokes a motor engram specifying a learned goal/end-point of a trained behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</xref>). Cortical synapses modified during the learning of skilled actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rioult-Pedotti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) may be responsible for the formation of these motor engrams. Alternatively, the engram could be stored elsewhere, and relief of cortical inhibition could trigger or permit its activation in a downstream network. The ability to specifically elicit a post-manipulation transition of cortical state from quiescence to motor engram activation should enable functional characterization of the neural programs responsible for enacting skilled multi-step behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care and transgenic mouse lines</title><p>Animal procedures were performed in accordance with protocols (Protocol number: 13–99) approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Janelia Research Campus.

This apparatus was placed in a light tight, ventilated, soundproof 28-inch cubic behavioral box. A near-infrared-sensitive webcam was used to monitor animals. Mice were initially trained for approximately 30 min per day, until they started licking pellets (10 or 20 mg; Test Diet; St Louis, MO) placed directly below their mouth. Food pellets arrived ~ 200 ms after the start of an auditory tone (5 kHz) by rotating the turntable with a servomotor driven by custom-programmed Arduino software. Mice were initially (1–5 training sessions) trained to retrieve a food pellet by licking and eating the pellet, often using their hand to guide the pellet into their mouth. After cued licking was learned, the turntable was moved progressively further away (over 3–10 sessions) to encourage mice to reach for the pellet after the cue. After mastering the task (approximately 15 sessions), turntable placement was reproduced daily for each animal by aligning live images to a reference image. Inter-trial intervals ranged from 20 s to 1 min and approximately 50 trials were collected per day. Mice almost always started with hands on perch and trials where animals lifted the hand before the cue were discarded. Mice were trained each day for approximately 60 min until they routinely responded to the auditory cue (within 1 s) and grabbed the pellet.

Fibers were positioned on or above (1–2 mm) the skull at stereotactic coordinates for different cortical regions (cM1: 0.5 mm anterior to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral of midline; iM1: 0.5 mm anterior to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral of midline; V1: 4.0 mm posterior to bregma, 3.0 mm lateral of midline; FrC: 3.1 mm anterior to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral of midline). 40 Hz sinusoidal stimulation with average power of 1–15 mW at the fiber’s end was delivered for 0.1–4 s, and power was reduced to 0 mW over the final 100 ms of stimulation. The approximate diameter of the light spot on the skull/window surface was 400 μm. Laser power of 10–15 mW has been shown to silence spike rates by 90% within 1.5 mm of the center of the laser spot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). We found no significant differences between prehension evoked with 2–4 s laser pulses, so they were grouped. To compensate for potential confounds of visible blue light during optogenetic stimulation, the behavioral box was illuminated with a blue LED throughout training and testing. During testing, trials with optogenetic perturbation were interleaved with control trials without laser stimulation (&lt; 20% laser trials, randomly interspersed).</p><p>Optogenetic activation of cortical inhibitory neurons and subsequent local cortical suppression most parsimoniously explains the reported phenotypes; however, other mechanisms are possible using the technique employed in this paper. The <italic>Slc32a1-</italic>COP4*H134R/EYFP mouse line used in this study expresses ChR2 in a small set of striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). This raises a possibility that blue light directed onto the cortical surface activates striatal neurons and this stimulation is responsible for the described phenotypes. We directly measured the transmission of blue light through the cortex into the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). At the depths (+1.8mm) of the striatum, the intensity of the 473 nm light is negligible using our experimental strategy. We also implanted fibers into striatum (FT200UMT; Thorlabs Inc; Newton, New Jersey; coordinates: 1.7 mm lateral of midline; 0.5 mm anterior of bregma; 2.25 mm deep of brain surface) of three trained <italic>Slc32a1-</italic>COP4*H134R/EYFP mice. Delivery of 473 nm light did not halt prehension behavior (prehension initiation in 190/191 laser trials versus 271/271 control trials) in any of these animals. Therefore, it is very unlikely that activation of striatal neurons is responsible for the behavioral phenotypes described in this paper. Another possibility is that long-range GABAergic inputs to the cortex are labeled in the <italic>Slc32a1-</italic>COP4*H134R/EYFP and antidromic activation of these inputs inhibits a non-cortical area that is necessary for prehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>). However, using photostimulation, we were able to produce prehension deficits in mice (n = 2 animals, mouse 1 exhibited prehension initiation in 1/24 laser trials versus 69/72 control trials, mouse 2 exhibited prehension initiation in 11/21 laser trials versus 67/67 control trials) where viral injection limited ChR2 expression to sensorimotor cortical neurons (AAV 2/1 or 2/7 Synapsin-FLEX-REV-ChR2, 5 sites in sensorimotor (forelimb) cortex, depths of 300 and 600 μm) in Gad2-IRES-Cre (Stock number: 010802; The Jackson Laboratory; Bar Harbor, ME) mice. Finally, long-range inhibitory cortical outputs have been reported more rostral of forelimb motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the blue light activates such neurons in motor cortex resulting in inhibition of non-cortical areas that are responsible for the phenotype. However, evidence for GABAergic projection neurons does not exist for areas that produce the phenotypes described in this paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). We also did not detect ChR2-positive axons in the external capsule or corpus callosum of <italic>Slc32a1-</italic>COP4*H134R/EYFP mice (data not shown), further ruling out the possibility that long range cortical inputs and outputs mediate the reported phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Light detection</title><p>A custom photodetector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bittner, et al., 2015</xref> was fabricated by inserting a small plug of 650 nm-emitting quantum dots (Ocean Nanotech; Dunedin, FL) inside the tip of a glass pipette, and sealing the tip in clear epoxy (Henkel; Rocky Hill, CT). Quantum-dot fluorescence excited by laser light was collected by a high-index gel waveguide within the pipette taper and delivered to a 100 μm core optical fiber (0.22 numerical aperture).

The photodetector was mounted on a Sutter MP-285 motorized manipulator (Novato, CA) and light intensity measurements were taken at 100 μm increments from the dural surface to 3.0 mm deep.

Per-mouse, we computed the location of the pellet and the mouth as the average position of the hand at the start of Grab and At mouth epochs, respectively, during tone-cued prehension. We separated laser trials by the epoch interrupted, defined as the last component initiated before the laser-on time point. We excluded trials for which the prehension behavior was not impeded. For Lift through Supinate epochs, lack of inhibition was detected as the occurrence of the Chew epoch during the laser-on period. For the At mouth and Chew epochs, lack of an effect was not detectable, thus we included all trials. We constructed a control comparison data set, for example, laser during Lift trials, as follows. For each tone-cued trial, we select the time interval starting <italic>t</italic> frames after a randomly chosen Lift, where <italic>t</italic> is the time between the last Lift preceding laser-on and the laser-on time point for a randomly selected laser during Lift trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Nearest-neighbor positional comparison</title><p>To measure how similar control and rebound trajectories were, we used a strategy based on nearest-neighbor classifiers. First, we aligned all trajectories in time based on the relative distance traveled in the trajectory. We then asked, for a given distance, how well we could predict whether a trial was a control or rebound trial based on the hand position using a 1-nearest-neighbor classifier. For all mice, the accuracy of this classifier was close to chance. We report the balanced accuracy: the average of the true positive and true negative rates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Neuronal recordings and analysis</title><p>Extracellular spikes were recorded from <italic>Slc32a1-</italic>COP4*H134R/EYFP mice (n = 2) using silicon probes (A4 × 8-5 mm-100-200-177; NeuroNexus; Ann Arbor, MI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Voltage signals (32 channels) were multiplexed, digitized by a PCI6133 board at 312.5 kHz (National Instruments; Austin, TX) at 14 bit, demultiplexed (sampling at 19531.25Hz). Brain movement was minimized by applying silicone gel (3–4680, Dow Corning, Midland, MI) over the craniotomy after the electrode was positioned in the brain. Recordings began several minutes thereafter to allow the brain to settle. Under awake, non-behaving condition, the mice remained idle during different photostimulation conditions. Recordings (n = 2 per animal) were made through the same craniotomy on subsequent days. The extracellular recording traces were band-pass filtered (300–6000 Hz). Events that exceeded an amplitude threshold (4 standard deviations of the background) were subjected to manual spike sorting to extract single units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Eighty-seven single units were recorded under awake, non-behaving conditions. For each unit, spike width was computed as the trough-to-peak interval in the mean spike waveform. Units with spike width &lt;0.35 ms were defined as fast spiking neurons (10/90) and units with spike width &gt;0.45 ms were defined as putative pyramidal neurons (77/90) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Units with intermediate values of spike width (0.35–0.45 ms, 3/133) were excluded from our analyses.</p><p>Effect of photoinhibition on activity was quantified in “average spike rate” across the population. The time course of photoinhibition and rebound activity was computed from averaged peristimulus time histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank V Iyer, A Mittal, and W Dickson for developing acquisition software; J Dudman and J Osborne for designing the RIVET head-restraint apparatus; P Polidoro for developing the Arduino controller; D Flickinger for designing the laser delivery apparatus; G Denisov for guidance with statistics; S Sawtell for constructing infrared LEDs mounted on cameras; J Magee and K Ritola for viruses; Tim Harris and Brian Barbarits for the silicon probe recording system; and G Rubin, J Dudman, A Lee, K Svoboda, J Magee, and M Kabra for helpful conversations and comments on the manuscript.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Guo et al. explored the role of motor cortex in the execution of a skilled forelimb reaching task. To address this, the authors adopted a prehension task, widely used as a motor skill learning paradigm in rodents, to head-fixed mice. Combining this task with optogenetic inactivation, which allows inactivation with high temporal resolution, the authors show that mid-movement inactivation is still effective in pausing the execution of learned prehension behavior. The authors also make the surprising observation that the cessation of cortical inactivation often coincides with a short-latency, low-jitter execution of the learned movement. This phenomenon is only seen in learned, motivated animals but does not require the presence of actual food pellets. The authors interpret these results as rebound excitation following inactivation being 'sufficient' to activate the motor engram.</p><p>The role of cortex in motor learning and execution of learned movements has been the subject of many studies, but is still hotly debatable. Previous studies did not distinguish, for example, whether cortex is necessary just for the initiation of a motor sequence or whether it is necessary for the execution throughout. This study is particularly timely given the controversy raised by a recent study (Kawai et al., Neuron 2015) suggesting that motor cortex in rodents is not necessary for the execution of movements, and is just required for learning. The previous study used mostly lesions and a lever pressing task. In contrast, the present study uses optogenetic inactivation, providing better temporal resolution (less compensation) and a task where more skilled prehension is required. To summarise, the present study provides compelling evidence that motor cortex is necessary – at least when performing this particular task – for movement execution even after the initiation of movement. This is novel and important.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The cessation-induced prehension behavior is an intriguing observation that is not simple to interpret. One extreme scenario which may be implied by the authors is that cortex contains all the instructive information about the movement sequence that is activated upon cessation. However, many other explanations are also possible, including that the motor sequence information is entirely subcortical and cortical activity simply provides non-specific excitation sufficient to elicit the subcortical activity. We encourage the authors to make a greater effort to discuss these and other possibilities.</p><p>2) An important mechanistic question is how inactivation translates to cortical activity. The authors assume rebound excitation, serving as motor cortex specific stimulation. First, it would be helpful to show with a few recordings what kind of activity, if any, is evoked at inactivation cessation. Does it indeed result in reliable low-jitter spiking of most motor cortex neurons? Also, it is unclear if this is in any way different from microstimulation. The authors claim that inactivation cessation achieves area-specific activation, while microstimulation can activate fibers of passage. Area-specific stimulation can be achieved by optical stimulation while restricting the opsin expression to a specific area. It would be interesting to know if this method would reproduce the prehension behavior, or if inactivation cessation is special. The latter possibility would suggest that inactivation is important in setting the system in a certain state that is more likely to produce the learned movement upon stimulation. It would also be helpful to know if an independent method of optogenetic inhibition targeted to principal cells results in rebound prehension (presumably not). While we know that asking for extra data collection here is somewhat counter to <italic>eLife's</italic> policy, it seems particularly pertinent to the major claim of the study to get at least one of these extra datasets, or preferably both.</p><p>3) The authors should be more careful in citing previous literature. Most problematically, they claim that 4 of the characteristics of the cessation-induced behaviors are different from those evoked by cortical stimulation. The first two characteristics, namely that it is a coordinated sequence of movements and that it is directed to a goal regardless of the starting position, are actually the very characteristics seen in at least one of the studies they cite (Graziano). Graziano's long stimulation resulted in, for example, the monkeys bringing their arm and hand to their mouth, regardless of the starting position, coinciding with the opening of the mouth. Another example is that, despite their contention that previous studies used temporally non-specific inactivation, Peters et al. used optogenetic inactivation, much the same way used in the current study. Furthermore, despite the contention that their study is contrary to the view proposed by Kawai et al., the current skilled movement being studied would be considered 'dexterous' in their definition and so there is not a contradiction between these previous studies and the present work; further and more balanced discussion of why this report comes to a fundamentally different conclusion to that of Kawai et al. (2015) would therefore be useful. Finally, previous work showing that the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation of M1 in humans, which also interrupts actions which are then completed several 100 ms later, might be worth citing (e.g. Day et al. 1989, Brain; Lemon et al. 1995 J. Neurosci. Figure 8).</p><p>4) Please add more information about the reach and grasp task in the mouse as a model for skilled movement. How long did it take to train the mice used? How many of the mice selected were able to learn the task? What was the average success rate of fully trained mice on the task?</p><p>5) Why was the 'chew' phase so extended by SM inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-E</xref>)?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>: Would you not expect the trained licking task to be affected by (face/jaw/tongue) SM inhibition?

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors' efforts to characterize further their manipulations and discuss some controversial interpretations have strengthened the study, as have the in vivo recordings. However, it is unclear why the authors did not do this during behavior given that their task is head-fixed; and also how pyramidal neurons were separated from fast-spiking neurons. The authors should try to explain their cell classification better, and be more cautious if this classification relied heavily on inhibition and excitation of activity. The authors should also add the data from the additional 3 animals to the main group analyses.</p><p>Another remaining concern is about the description of the training procedure. The authors added a small amount of detail to the revised manuscript in response to the initial review. However, they should provide much more detail to make the results reproducible by other labs. Specifically, the methods on behavioral training describe several shaping steps. The authors should provide the specific duration, with the range, for each step.</p><p>Finally, since the authors have elected not to do some of the requested experiments (direct excitation of pyramidal cells to analyze the effects of rebound excitation, and/or direct inhibition of pyramidal neurons to see that it does not happen), they should tone down the description of the rebound effects to be more speculative, and focus more on the deficits caused by inhibition. We suggest that they also provide more discussion about different potential mechanisms for the effects they observe.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10774.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The cessation-induced prehension behavior is an intriguing observation that is not simple to interpret.

(2014, Neuron). However these recordings were not performed in cortical areas relevant to the work in this manuscript. Thus, to address this critique, we have collected recordings from sensorimotor cortex and have included this data as a supplemental figure. Reliable spiking in putative pyramidal and fast-spiking neurons) occurs at the termination of photostimulation in <italic>Slc32a1-COP4*H134R/EYFP</italic> mice. Interestingly, prominent rebound spiking specifically occurred under the stimulation parameters that were most effective in generating rebound prehension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>Also, it is unclear if this is in any way different from microstimulation.

We are currently performing these experiments as well as studying the differences in cortical activity after microstimulation and rebound prehension. This will be the subject of a future manuscript. For the purposes of the present manuscript, because inhibitory neurons do not project, our manipulation is at least as locally restricted as prior methods, and arguably more than microstimulation. For this reason, we assert that this manipulation advances the degree to which the locality of the effect can be inferred.</p><p><italic>It would also be helpful to know if an independent method of optogenetic inhibition targeted to principal cells results in rebound prehension (presumably not). While we know that asking for extra data collection here is somewhat counter to eLife's policy, it seems particularly pertinent to the major claim of the study to get at least one of these extra datasets, or preferably both.</italic></p><p>We have attempted to inhibit Layer 5 pyramidal neurons using ArchT and Halorhodopsin. We have yet to find an effective strategy for achieving robust and reliable inhibition with these methods.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should be more careful in citing previous literature.

While Graziano did show multi-joint egocentric movements, to our knowledge, he did not report coordinated sequence of movements to an allocentric goal.</p><p><italic>Another example is that, despite their contention that previous studies used temporally non-specific inactivation, Peters et al. used optogenetic inactivation, much the same way used in the current study.</italic> </p><p>We agree that in addition to the muscimol experiments we were referring to, optogenetic cortical inhibition was included in the supplement of Peters et al.

How much do the authors know about the cortical extent of spread of the induced inhibition?</italic> </p><p>We were a bit surprised by the inability to stop the lick task. We attempted to directly photoinhibit the “lick” cortical areas and we were still unable to prevent licking. Perhaps our lick task is not cortically dependent or photoinhibition did not cover a large enough area. For example bilateral inhibition may be required to prevent licking. We have included some discussion of this matter in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>7) Why is there no freezing of subsequent action phases in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref> (in others such <xref ref-type="other" rid="media16">Video 16</xref>, the action is stopped and the pellet dropped)?</italic> </p><p>The animal actually does freeze in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref>. We included this video because the animal engages in a very interesting behavior after freezing. The animal uses its unaffected limb to pull the frozen limb to the mouth. This interesting behavior was discussed in the legend, but as a result of this critique, we have now given this behavior a bit more emphasis in this version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>8) If possible, a slightly higher N of animals would be advisable (at least in some of the experiments: e.g. currently 5/5 in the best cases and 3/3 in some).</italic> </p><p>We have included 3 additional animals. These animals are subjects in a follow up study and trial analysis is still ongoing for these animals. Each of these animals shows cessation of movement during the inhibition and shows rebound prehension following photostimulation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The authors' efforts to characterize further their manipulations and discuss some controversial interpretations have strengthened the study, as have the in vivo recordings. However, it is unclear why the authors did not do this during behavior given that their task is head-fixed;</italic> </p><p>We agree that performing recordings (both electrophysiology and imaging) in trained animals is a very interesting direction of study. This is currently a major effort in the lab, but requires many new trained animals and detailed analysis. This data will be the subject of a future manuscript.</p><p><italic>And also how pyramidal neurons were separated from fast-spiking neurons. The authors should try to explain their cell classification better, and be more cautious if this classification relied heavily on inhibition and excitation of activity.</italic> </p><p>For the last resubmission we added the following text, which clarifies that we classified based on spike width rather than opto-tagging.</p><p>“For each unit, spike width was computed as the trough to peak interval in the mean spike waveform. Units with spike width &lt;0.35 ms were defined as fast spiking neurons (10/90) and units with spike width &gt;0.45 ms as putative pyramidal neurons (77/90). Units with intermediate values of spike width (0.35 - 0.45 ms, 3/133) were excluded from our analyses.”</p><p>This analysis thus does not rely on opto-tagging approaches. However, as expected on average, putative fast spiking neurons increased their firing during light exposure and putative pyramidal neurons showed a depression of activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). For clarity, we also described the classification scheme in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>.</p><p><italic>The authors should also add the data from the additional 3 animals to the main group analyses.</italic> </p><p>We have now added this data.</p><p><italic>Another remaining concern is about the description of the training procedure. The authors added a small amount of detail to the revised manuscript in response to the initial review. However, they should provide much more detail to make the results reproducible by other labs. Specifically, the methods on behavioral training describe several shaping steps. The authors should provide the specific duration, with the range, for each step.</italic> </p><p>We added information about the range of sessions for each shaping step.</p><p><italic>Finally, since the authors have elected not to do some of the requested experiments (direct excitation of pyramidal cells to analyze the effects of rebound excitation, and/or direct inhibition of pyramidal neurons to see that it does not happen), they should tone down the description of the rebound effects to be more speculative, and focus more on the deficits caused by inhibition.</italic> </p><p>We have changed conclusion sentences throughout the Results sections to be more direct. We have also toned down the following sentence in the Discussion to make the description of the rebound effects to be more speculative.</p><p>“The engram need not be stored entirely within the cortex; rebound cortical activity may be sufficient to trigger or open a gate for an engram stored in a downstream network.”</p><p>To</p><p>“Alternatively, the engram could be stored elsewhere, and relief of cortical inhibition could trigger or permit its activation in a downstream network.”</p><p><italic>We suggest that they also provide more discussion about different potential mechanisms for the effects they observe.</italic> </p><p>The above change to the Discussion section directly suggests a different potential mechanism for our observed effects, namely that cortex may be permissive of downstream engrams. We also refer (in the main text) to the Methods section that examines other possible mechanisms using this optogenetic technique.</p></body></sub-article></article>
