Sleep regulatory processes are assumed to lie exclusively within the brain mainly due to the strong behavioral manifestations of sleep. Whole-body knockout of the circadian clock gene <italic>Bmal1</italic> in mice affects several aspects of sleep, however, the cells/tissues responsible are unknown. We found that restoring <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression in the brains of <italic>Bmal1</italic>-knockout mice did not rescue <italic>Bmal1</italic>-dependent sleep phenotypes. Surprisingly, most sleep-amount, but not sleep-timing, phenotypes could be reproduced or rescued by knocking out or restoring BMAL1 exclusively in skeletal muscle, respectively. We also found that overexpression of skeletal-muscle <italic>Bmal1</italic> reduced the recovery response to sleep loss. Together, these findings demonstrate that <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression in skeletal muscle is both necessary and sufficient to regulate total sleep amount and reveal that critical components of normal sleep regulation occur in muscle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26557.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26557.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26557.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>We spend nearly one third of our lives asleep. Sleep plays a critical role in human health and is regulated by multiple brain regions. Genes are some of the factors that control sleep. Recent studies have shown that mice in which a gene called <italic>Bmal1</italic> had been completely removed, sleep more than mice that still have the gene. These <italic>Bmal1</italic>-deficient mice also respond differently to sleep loss. However, until now, it was not known which tissues and cells that carry active (or ‘expressed’) <italic>Bmal1</italic> are involved in regulating sleep.</p><p>To find out if <italic>Bmal1</italic> activity in the brain is sufficient to recover from sleep loss, Ehlen, Brager et al. compared genetically modified mice that either expressed <italic>Bmal1</italic> only in the brain, or only in the muscle tissue that covers the skeleton. After the mice were kept awake for six hours, their sleep was monitored by measuring electrical signals on the surface of the skull. Contrary to what they expected, Ehlen et al. found that mice with <italic>Bmal1</italic> expressed in the skeletal muscle were able to have a normal sleep pattern, while mice with <italic>Bmal1</italic> expressed in the brain had an abnormal sleep pattern.</p><p>Further experiments show that removing <italic>Bmal1</italic> from the skeletal muscle of mice, but allowing the gene to be expressed in other tissues, produced sleeping patterns that were similar to those seen in mice that were completely missing the <italic>Bmal1</italic> gene. These results indicate that <italic>Bmal1</italic> in skeletal muscle is important to help regulate sleep, and that the signal for sleepiness does not only originate from the brain.</p><p>This is the first study to show that skeletal muscle can regulate sleep. The next step will be to identify the specific signal the muscle uses to trigger the brain to sleep. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate sleep may help to develop new treatments for sleep disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

The mechanisms that are responsible for the recovery from sleep loss are not well understood. Genetic deletion of the circadian transcription factor <italic>Bmal1</italic> (brain and muscle ARNT-like factor; gene symbol <italic>Arntl</italic>) in mice completely ablates circadian clock function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bunger et al., 2000</xref>) and has effects on sleep that include: increased total sleep amount, increased non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep intensity and reduced ability to recover from sleep loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Laposky et al., 2005</xref>). Because <italic>Bmal1</italic> whole-body deletion causes a broad range of physical abnormalities (e.g. reduced locomotor activity, joint abnormalities, reduced lifespan; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kondratov et al., 2006</xref>), we sought to isolate sleep phenotypes from the potential effects of other phenotypes using tissue-specific <italic>Bmal1</italic> rescue and knockout models.</p><p>We first attempted to rescue electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep-phenotypes in <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout mice by restoring functional <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression selectively in brain. To do this, we used a transgenic model that rescues <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression in the brain of <italic>Bmal1</italic> whole-body KO’s, thus restoring circadian behavior (<italic>Scg2::tTa; tetO::Bmal1-HA;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McDearmon et al., 2006</xref>). Surprisingly, transgenic <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression in the brain (i.e., brain rescued) did not restore NREM sleep-amount—one of the most prominent sleep changes in whole-body <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Since circadian rhythms of locomotor activity are restored in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McDearmon et al., 2006</xref>), our finding suggests that the sleep disturbances in <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout mice are not exclusively the result of disrupted circadian behavior. More importantly, the results show that <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression in brain does not restore normal sleep amounts in <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout mice, suggesting that expression in other tissues may be important.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26557.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rescuing <italic>Bmal1</italic> in skeletal muscle restores daily non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep amount.</title><p>24 hr electroencephalographic recordings were conducted in undisturbed mice listed in the legend.

This model rescues several muscle-related phenotypes despite non-cycling BMAL1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McDearmon et al., 2006</xref>). To our surprise, although REM sleep was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), we found that restoring <italic>Bmal1</italic> in skeletal muscle completely restored NREM sleep amount to wild-type levels in otherwise <italic>Bmal1</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also assessed whether <italic>Bmal1</italic> function in the skeletal muscle altered sleep intensity by measuring NREM slow wave activity (SWA, 0.5–4 Hz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Borbély et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dijk et al., 1990</xref>). In our hands, NREM SWA was not altered in <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout mice; similarly, NREM SWA was not significantly altered by rescuing BMAL1 in brain or muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). These experiments demonstrate that restoring <italic>Bmal1</italic> in the skeletal muscle of otherwise <italic>Bmal1</italic>-deficient mice is sufficient to restore normal NREM sleep amount, independently of <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression in the brain. The diurnal rhythm in sleep amount, however, is not restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the effect of <italic>Bmal1</italic> function on recovery from sleep loss, we subjected the <italic>Bmal1</italic> mouse lines to 6 hr of forced wakefulness and monitored sleep EEG’s during recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The amount and type of recovery sleep observed in response to forced wakefulness is commonly used to assess changes in sleep homeostasis (i.e., sleep drive)—this recovery is typically characterized by increased sleep amount and increased SWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehlen et al., 2013</xref>). Whole-body KO of <italic>Bmal1</italic> did not affect NREM recovery-sleep amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), but did significantly prevent increased NREM-SWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Rescue of <italic>Bmal1</italic> in either brain- or muscle-rescued mice reduced NREM recovery-sleep following forced wakefulness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), a finding that indicates <italic>Bmal1</italic> restoration in either tissue reduces sleep drive following forced wakefulness. Notably, NREM SWA in whole-body KO mice was rescued by restoring <italic>Bmal1</italic> in skeletal muscle, but not brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). These findings demonstrate that restoring <italic>Bmal1</italic> in the skeletal muscle of <italic>Bmal1</italic>-deficient mice is sufficient to restore normal SWA following sleep loss.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26557.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Rescuing <italic>Bmal1</italic> in skeletal muscle or brain reduces the amount of NREM sleep recovered after forced wakefulness.</title><p>Continuous sleep recordings during 18 hr of recovery sleep were obtained from the mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> after 6 hr of forced wakefulness (<bold>A</bold>; yellow double arrow = forced wakefulness).

It is common for mice to exhibit some sleep during prolonged forced-wakefulness paradigms, however, <italic>Bmal1</italic> muscle-overexpressed mice were awake more than WT littermates during these 24 hr of forced wakefulness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

In addition, waking SWA (a measure of accumulating sleep pressure during extensive durations of sleep loss; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cajochen et al., 2002</xref>) rose more rapidly and was consistently higher than in WT mice during 24 hr of forced wakefulness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Combined, these results demonstrate that overexpressing <italic>Bmal1</italic> in the skeletal muscle renders mice less sensitive to the effects of sleep loss, portending muscle as a potential therapeutic target for sleep loss.</p><p>How might peripheral tissues such as muscle influence sleep? The rapidly emerging area of muscle-derived factors on systemic health provides a potential model for our findings. In particular, there are several examples of muscle-derived factors that alter brain processes. Notably, overexpression of PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α, gene symbol: <italic>Ppargc1a</italic>) selectively in mouse skeletal muscle reduces the depressive phenotypes induced by stress by preventing plasma kynurenine from reaching the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agudelo et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, PGC-1α activation stimulates release of the muscle-derived peptide irisin into circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boström et al., 2012</xref>). Plasma irisin, in turn, induces BDNF expression in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wrann et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, <italic>PGC-1α</italic> expression is rhythmic in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2007</xref>) raising the possibility that alterations in <italic>Bmal1</italic> expresion/function may alter rhythmic <italic>PGC1α</italic> expression through a change in clock function. However, the studies presented here are not sufficient to determine if the sleep effects of loss/gain of <italic>Bmal1</italic> function in skeletal muscle are via core clock or non-clock mechanisms. Furthermore, whole body deletions of other circadian factors such as <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shiromani et al., 2004</xref>), and <italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Cry2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wisor et al., 2008</xref>), do not have similar effects on sleep. Other potential contributors could be related to changes in muscle metabolism as <italic>Bmal1</italic> metabolic phenotypes have been reported in both muscle mouse-lines used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harfmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brager et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have highlighted that sleep disruptions in humans are associated with peripheral circadian desynchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cedernaes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schroder and Esser, 2013</xref>). The current study demonstrates that manipulating levels of the circadian transcription factor <italic>Bmal1</italic> specifically in skeletal muscle alters sleep. Moreover, a majority of these effects of <italic>Bmal1</italic> on sleep are not dependent on circadian timing in the brain—dependence on circadian timing in the skeletal muscle remains a possibility. Although it has been established that sleep is important for skeletal muscle function (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chase, 2013</xref>), these investigations are the first to implicate molecular processes within skeletal muscle in signaling sleep regulatory mechanisms in the brain. Studies in our lab are currently underway to determine the nature of the pathway skeletal muscle uses to signal sleep regulatory mechanisms in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All mice in the brain lines and muscle rescued/overexpressed lines were maintained on a 12-hr light:12-hr dark schedule throughout the study.

Breeding was conducted in-house, and genotypes were recorded as they became available from breeding. Recordings from approximately 20–25 litters makup the dataset. All wildtype and KO littermates resulting from a litter, up to a maximum of 50%, were recorded with tissue-specific knockout/rescue mice. Mice were allowed a minimum of 7 additional days to acclimate to the tether and recording chamber. Recording of EEG and EMG waveforms began at zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 (light onset). Data acquisition was performed on a personal computer running Sirenia Acquisition software (Pinnacle Technologies), a software system designed specifically for polysomnographic recording in rodents. EEG signals were low-pass filtered with a 40 Hz cutoff and collected continuously at a sampling rate of 400 Hz. After collection, all waveforms were classified by a trained observer (using both EEG leads and EMG) as wake (low-voltage, high-frequency EEG; high-amplitude EMG), NREM sleep (high-voltage, mixed-frequency EEG; low- amplitude EMG) or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (low-voltage EEG with a predominance of theta activity [6–10 Hz]; very low amplitude EMG). EEG epochs determined to have artifact (interference caused by scratching, movement, eating, or drinking) were excluded from analysis. Recordings where artifact comprised more than 5% of total recording time were excluded from analysis. Analysis of NREM delta power and NREM spectral distribution was accomplished by applying a fast Fourier transformation to raw EEG waveforms. Only epochs classified as NREM sleep were included in this analysis.

Brains were immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hr then sunk in 30% sucrose (24 hr at 4°C). Cryostat sections (40µm-thick) were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody (c-fos; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; chicken polyclonal IgY antibody [ChAT]; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and immunoreactivity was visualized using Vectastain Elite ABC kit with 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) as chromagen (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA).

Briefly, brain (hypothalamic) and skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) tissues were collected from mice sacrificed at ZT5 and ZT17 (ZT12 was lights-off under a 12 hr: 12 hr light:dark cycle); these are the mid-points of peak and trough <italic>Bmal1</italic> gene expression in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McCarthy et al., 2007</xref>). Total RNA was extracted from frozen brain and skeletal muscle using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and diluted to 0.1 mg/ml. Samples were converted from RNA to cDNA with Applied Biosystems RT-PCR kit reagents according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Real-time PCR assays were performed using the comparative amplification detection threshold of target gene expression (CT) method. mRNA levels detected with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA) were measured by determining the cycle number at which CT was reached. In each sample, CT was normalized to <italic>Gapdh</italic> expression (ΔCT) performed on the same plate. Normalized gene expression (ΔΔCT) for each gene with respect to genotype and time point was computed with Bio-Rad CFX Manager.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Brain hemispheres were homogenized in a microfuge tube using a pellet pestle in 700 ul lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM NaF, 0.3% Triton-X 100, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 250 nM PMSF, and complete protease inhibitor mix (Sigma), and tumbled at 4C overnight prior to quantification and loading on the gel.

Data were collected in 10 min bins. Nighttime activity onset (designated as zeitgeber time [ZT] 12 under LD and circadian time [CT] 12 under DD) was defined by the initial 10 min period that: (1) exceeded 10% of the maximum activity for the day, (2) was preceded by at least 4 hr of inactivity, and (3) was followed by at least 60 min of sustained activity. Nighttime activity offset was defined as the final period of nighttime activity that: (1) was preceded by at least 60 min of sustained activity and (2) was followed by at least 4 hr of inactivity. Alpha (measured in h) represented the time between nighttime activity onset and offset. Rhythm period was determined from extrapolation of the least squares line through activity onsets on days 3–14 under LD and DD. The duration (bout) and intensity (count) of wheel running under LD and DD were also measured.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8-2"><title>Beam breaks</title><p>A SmartHomeCage data acquisition system (AfaSci, Redwood City, CA) equipped with a multi-layer 3D array of infrared sensors was placed around the home cages of male mice (n = 7–8/genotype) to measure gross and fine motor movements under LD (following entrainment) and DD (third full 24 hr period, CT time derived from each individual animal’s rhythm period).

Therefore, we determined the effects of <italic>Bmal1</italic> muscle overexpression on neuronal activation in sleep regulatory regions. FOS-immunoreactivity (IR) was measured in the following brain areas: (1) forebrain (nucleus accumbens [NAc/s], basal forebrain [BF], ventral pallidum [VP]); (2) hypothalamus (ventral lateral [VLPO] and medial preoptic [MPOA] areas, suprachiasmatic nucleus [SCN]); (3) thalamus (lateral habenula [LAh]); and (4) hindbrain (ventral [VTA], pedunculopontine [PPT], and laterodorsal [LDT] tegmental areas (S1). Brains were collected at midday under basal (undisturbed) conditions or immediately after a 6 hr of sleep deprivation.</p><p>FOS-IR was increased in the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain of <italic>Bmal1</italic> muscle-overexpressed mice relative to WTs (BF: F<sub>1,16</sub>=26.6; p&lt;0.001, univariate ANOVA; Hb: F<sub>1,16</sub>=75.6; p&lt;0.001; PPT: F<sub>1,16</sub>=31.0; p&lt;0.001; LDT: F<sub>1,16</sub>=34.5; p&lt;0.001). There were also significant increases in FOS-IR in the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain (NAc: F<sub>1,16</sub>=15.5; p=0.001; BF: F<sub>1,16</sub>=6.8; p=0.01; PPT: F<sub>1,16</sub>=12.6; p=0.004; Hb: F<sub>1,16</sub>=26.6; p&lt;0.001; MpOA; F<sub>1,16</sub>=15.6; p=0.001) of sleep-deprived mice. Most notably, there were no main effects for genotype or treatment in the SCN. This observation indicates that disrupted circadian timing is not responsible for sleep phenotypes in <italic>Bmal1</italic> muscle-overexpressed mice.</p><p>Coincidentally, the brain areas that had increases in FOS-IR in response to <italic>Bmal1</italic> muscle overexpression—the basal forebrain, lateral habenula, and pedunculopontine tegmentum—are known to be arousal promoting and have extensive cholinergic tone. We double-labeled with ChAT (enzyme necessary for acetylcholine synthesis) to determine if cholinergic neurons are FOS-positive. Our findings indicate that increases in Fos-IR of <italic>Bmal1</italic> muscle-overexpressed mice occurred in cholinergic neurons (BF: F<sub>1,20</sub>=5.6; p=0.02; Hb: F<sub>1,20</sub>=14.8; p=0.002; PPT: F<sub>1,20</sub>=13.5; p=0.003; S1).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10-2"><title>Overexpression of <italic>Bmal1</italic> in the skeletal muscle does not cause circadian impairments in wheel running</title><p>The patterns of circadian wheel-running activity have been reported in the majority of mouse models reported here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McDearmon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wisor et al., 2008</xref>); however, this wheel-running activity is not available for <italic>Bmal1</italic> muscle-overexpressed mice.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, J Ptáček (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John B Hogenesch (Reviewer #2) and Katja A Lamia (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In Ehlers et al., the authors study the role of <italic>Bmal1</italic> in regulating sleep and recovery from sleep debt. Earlier, it was noted that <italic>Bmal1</italic> null mice, like most circadian clock null mice, have sleep abnormalities including increased total sleep and NREM sleep intensity and reduced recovery to sleep loss. The authors rescued <italic>Bmal1</italic> function in the brain with a <italic>Scg2::tTA</italic> system, but while this rescued circadian function, surprisingly, it had no effect on sleep. Next, they restored <italic>Bmal1</italic> function to skeletal muscle using a <italic>Acta1</italic> driven <italic>Bmal1</italic> construct in a constitutive fashion and showed that <italic>Bmal1</italic> in muscle is sufficient to restore normal NREM sleep amount. They went on to show similar results for recovery from sleep deprivation. To demonstrate the necessity of <italic>Bmal1</italic> function in skeletal muscle, they generated muscle-specific <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout mice and showed sleep phenotypes consistent with muscle <italic>Bmal1</italic> function being important for sleep. They went on to overexpress <italic>Bmal1</italic> in skeletal muscle, sleep deprived animals, and showed further resistance to sleep deprivation, demonstrating that <italic>Bmal1</italic> is gene dose limiting in mediating resistance sleep deprivation.</p><p>The findings are supported by the data and will be of interest to a broad scientific audience. The paper could be strengthened by more thorough description and discussion of their data in relation to other studies. Some of the conclusions should be clarified with respect to possible underlying direct or indirect mechanisms and in relation to other findings. Finally, some of the data presentation should be clarified.</p><p>Despite these technical concerns, I feel this is interesting and worth reporting but that it will be necessary for the authors to acknowledge potential problems noted above to be sufficiently conservative in interpretation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a very interesting idea and the data is strongly suggestive. It is clear that exercise improves subsequent sleep quality and it is interesting to speculate that this might result from some humoral factor released from muscle. The main concern is that the authors are not sufficiently careful in the interpretation of their findings. They used <italic>Scg2-Bmal1</italic> to rescue the brain expression. Obviously the expression of <italic>Scg2</italic> (levels, cell types, etc.) are somewhat different from that of endogenous <italic>Bmal1</italic>, although the circadian rhythm phenotype could be rescued. However, little is known about sleep regulation and all of the brain regions that might be involve. So even if <italic>Scg2-Bmal1</italic> could not rescue the <italic>Bmal1</italic> KO sleep phenotype, it is overstated that brain-specific expression of <italic>Bmal1</italic> could not rescue the sleep phenotype. Perhaps the relevant brain region (and specific cell types) do not have sufficiently high expression of the exogenous <italic>Bmal1</italic> to rescue the phenotype.</p><p>Similarly, they used <italic>Acta1-Bmal1</italic> as the model of muscle specific rescue. Although <italic>Bmal1</italic> in this model is supposed to be restricted, it is impossible to exclude the expression of this promoter in some specific area or cell types in the brain that might be critically relevant for rescue of the phenotype.</p><p>1) The authors speculate that a <italic>Bmal1</italic> target gene involved in regulation of a circulatory factor mediates the sleep effects seen in muscle perturbation of <italic>Bmal1</italic> function. This seems highly likely. Does this imply it's likely to be a circadian-clock regulated gene or a non-circadian target of <italic>Bmal1</italic>? This point may merit discussion.</p><p>2) The promoters used here should be described more clearly. E.g. Where is <italic>Scg2</italic> expressed in the brain, broadly or discretely? Constitutively or in a circadian fashion? Similarly, while the <italic>Acta1</italic> promoter used is supposed to be quite clean, was this verified by ICC or immunoblot? Expression of transgenes can 'leak' over time.</p><p>3) The kyurenine hypothesis is interesting, but as far as I can tell, the aminotransferase thought to be responsible, Ccbl1, is more likely to be a Ror (driven by Pgc1a) than <italic>Bmal1</italic> target. (Ccbl1 also shares phase with <italic>Bmal1</italic> in liver, opposite from canonical <italic>Bmal1</italic> targets such as Dbp and Nr1d1.)</p><p>5) There seems to be a correlation between reduced locomotor activity, altered temporal organization of activity, and reduced NREM sleep and altered temporal organization of NREM sleep patterns. Could altered levels of physical activity contribute to differences in sleep structure?</p><p>6) The authors should more carefully describe the phenotypes to clearly state that the diurnal patterns of sleep are not restored by rescuing <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression in skeletal muscle. Perhaps <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> could include quantification of the light and dark phase NREM and REM sleep. This is reminiscent of the earlier report showing that in a <italic>Bmal1</italic>KO background rescue of <italic>Bmal1</italic> in brain restored diurnal activity patterns but not the overall amount of activity while rescue in muscle restored levels of activity but not consolidation (McDearmon et al., 2006). That study also showed that rescuing <italic>Bmal1</italic> in muscle restored body weight of <italic>Bmal1</italic> KO mice. Could there be an overarching metabolic change that contributes to both body weight restoration and sleep propensities?</p><p>7) The statement in the Abstract that &quot;[…] most of these phenotypes could be reproduced or rescued by knocking out or restoring BMAL1 exclusively in the skeletal muscle […]&quot; is too strong. This should be qualified with a statement about rescuing the overall levels but not the altered timing of sleep.</p><p>8) More detail should be provided with respect to the tissue specificity of the mouse lines used. The <italic>Scg2::tTa</italic> is limited to the SCN and several other regions; this should be clarified to avoid the implication that rescue of <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression throughout the brain has no effect on sleep. Is it known that <italic>Acta1-cre/Esr1*</italic> line does not express Cre in brain regions that are important for modulating sleep?</p><p>9) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, &quot;wildtype&quot; and &quot;knockout&quot; data are presented with both the muscle-rescued line and the brain-rescued line but it is unclear whether these are the same data from an independent colony or whether the &quot;knockout&quot; mice are littermates of the brain-rescued and muscle-rescued animals.</p><p>10) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, it is unclear what exactly is shown in panels A and B. It seems to be a calculation based on comparison to the corresponding interval during undisturbed sleep for the same genotype or the same animal but could this artificially alter the value since the undisturbed diurnal sleep patterns are quite different for the different genotypes? It might be better to present the &quot;baseline&quot; and the &quot;recovery&quot; data together to get a clear picture of how the genetic changes affect recovery from sleep deprivation, as in Laposky et al., 2005 demonstrating effects of ubiquitous <italic>Bmal1</italic> loss on sleep.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26557.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>[…] 1) The authors speculate that a Bmal1 target gene involved in regulation of a circulatory factor mediates the sleep effects seen in muscle perturbation of Bmal1 function.

This point may merit discussion.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s question regarding potential clock vs. non-clock mechanisms. We have attempted to address this in our discussion of potential mechanisms in paragraphs 8 and 9. In our opinion the current data do not provide sufficient evidence and determining the involvement of the clock will depend on identification of the mechanistic link between muscle and brain. Therefore, we have integrated this discussion with our discussion of muscle-derived factors. A complete description of these changes can be found in 3) below.</p><p>It is important to point out that whole-body deletions of other canonical circadian clock genes do not have similar effects on sleep. The following sentence was added to paragraph 8 of the manuscript: “Furthermore, whole body deletions of other circadian factors such as Per1 and Per2 (Shiromani et al., 2004), and Cry1 and Cry2 (Wisor et al., 2008), do not have similar effects on sleep.”-</p><p><italic>2) The promoters used here should be described more clearly.

Expression of transgenes can 'leak' over time.</italic> </p><p>We have included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> to demonstrate the appropriate tissue-specific expression of the transgene in the <italic>Acta1::Bmal1-HA</italic> line. In addition, the following text has been added to the Material and methods section:<italic>“In situ</italic> hybridization studies demonstrate that <italic>Scg2</italic> mRNA is found throughout the brain with the higher expression in the hypothalamus and peak expression in the SCN. […] Brain specificity has been demonstrated by western blot which shows an absence of HA-staining in both the muscle and liver of double transgenic mice (McDearmon, 2006<italic>).”</italic></p><p>“The <italic>Acta1</italic> promoter used for both mouse lines (muscle rescued/overexpressed and muscle KO) is a 2.2 kb sequence directly upstream from the human skeletal actin (<italic>Acta1</italic> gene) translational start site. […] We verified this finding by western blotting an entire brain hemisphere or gastrocnemeous muscle in mice bred at our facility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). HA-tag was detected in skeletal muscle, but not brain.”</p><p> <italic>3) The kyurenine hypothesis is interesting, but as far as I can tell, the aminotransferase thought to be responsible, Ccbl1, is more likely to be a Ror (driven by Pgc1a) than Bmal1 target. (Ccbl1 also shares phase with Bmal1 in liver, opposite from canonical Bmal1 targets such as Dbp and Nr1d1.)</italic> </p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have altered the text to clarify our hypothesis and address comment 1). The text in paragraph 8 and 9 now reads: “How might peripheral tissues such as muscle influence sleep? […] Furthermore, whole body deletions of other circadian factors such as <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> (Shiromani et al., 2004), and <italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Cry2</italic> (Wisor et al., 2008), do not have similar effects on sleep.”</p><p><italic>5) There seems to be a correlation between reduced locomotor activity, altered temporal organization of activity, and reduced NREM sleep and altered temporal organization of NREM sleep patterns. Could altered levels of physical activity contribute to differences in sleep structure?</italic> </p><p>A correlation between decreased activity and altered temporal organization is seen in whole-body <italic>Bmal1</italic> KO’s (Pendergast et al., 2008) and WT levels of activity are associated with WT-like sleep structure in the muscle-KO line (Harfmann et al., 2016). However, the patterns observed in the rescue lines are not consistent with this hypothesis. Locomotor activity remains low in brain-rescued mice and sleep structure is partially restored, whereas activity levels are partially restored in the muscle-rescued mice without a restoration of sleep architecture (McDearmon et al., 2006). Based on these data, it still isn’t clear if differences in physical activity contributes to differences in sleep architecture.</p><p> <italic>6) The authors should more carefully describe the phenotypes to clearly state that the diurnal patterns of sleep are not restored by rescuing Bmal1 expression in skeletal muscle. Perhaps <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> could include quantification of the light and dark phase NREM and REM sleep. This is reminiscent of the earlier report showing that in a Bmal1KO background rescue of Bmal1 in brain restored diurnal activity patterns but not the overall amount of activity while rescue in muscle restored levels of activity but not consolidation (McDearmon et al., 2006). That study also showed that rescuing Bmal1 in muscle restored body weight of Bmal1 KO mice. Could there be an overarching metabolic change that contributes to both body weight restoration and sleep propensities?</italic> </p><p>We have altered paragraph 3 to address this first issue. The text now reads: “To begin this investigation of other tissues we chose mice harboring a transgene that restores <italic>Bmal1</italic> specifically in skeletal muscle, but does not restore circadian behavior (i.e., muscle rescued; <italic>Acta1::Bmal1-HA</italic>).”</p><p>“These experiments demonstrate that restoring <italic>Bmal1</italic> in the skeletal muscle of otherwise <italic>Bmal1</italic>-deficient mice is sufficient to restore normal NREM sleep amount, independently of <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression in the brain. The diurnal rhythm in sleep amount, however, is not restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).”</p><p>We have begun to address the issue of metabolic changes in our recent publication using muscle-overexpressed mice (Brager et al., 2017). We found no baseline differences in: body composition, respiratory exchange ratio, energy expenditure, total activity counts, and ex vivo insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, between muscle-overexpressed and WT mice. We did find that muscle-overexpressed mice had lower energy expenditure during treadmill running and reduced insulin sensitivity following sleep deprivation (Brager et al., 2017). This indicates that there are few metabolic changes in the muscle-overexpressed mice, a line that exhibits significant differences in SWA; however, differences in body composition and glucose tolerance were recently reported in muscle KO mice (Harfmann et al., 2016) and this line displayed increased sleep amount and SWA. Thus, it is possible that metabolic phenotypes contribute to the sleep phenotypes described here.</p><p>We have added the following to paragraphs 8 to address this: “Other potential contributors could be related to changes in muscle metabolism as <italic>Bmal1</italic> metabolic phenotypes have been reported in both muscle mouse-lines used here (Harfmann et al., 2016; Brager et al., 2017).”</p><p><italic>7) The statement in the Abstract that &quot;[…] most of these phenotypes could be reproduced or rescued by knocking out or restoring</italic> BMAL1 <italic>exclusively in the skeletal muscle […]&quot; is too strong. This should be qualified with a statement about rescuing the overall levels but not the altered timing of sleep.</italic> </p><p>We have rewritten this sentence in the Abstract: “Surprisingly, most sleep-amount, but not sleep-timing, phenotypes could be reproduced or rescued by knocking out or restoring BMAL1 exclusively in skeletal muscle, respectively.”</p><p> <italic>8) More detail should be provided with respect to the tissue specificity of the mouse lines used. The Scg2::tTa is limited to the SCN and several other regions; this should be clarified to avoid the implication that rescue of Bmal1 expression throughout the brain has no effect on sleep. Is it known that Acta1-cre/Esr1* line does not express Cre in brain regions that are important for modulating sleep?</italic> </p><p>The transgene expression-patterns exhibited in these lines is addressed in item 2).</p><p> <italic>9) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, &quot;wildtype&quot; and &quot;knockout&quot; data are presented with both the muscle-rescued line and the brain-rescued line but it is unclear whether these are the same data from an independent colony or whether the &quot;knockout&quot; mice are littermates of the brain-rescued and muscle-rescued animals.</italic> </p><p>We have added the following text to the Material and methods to clarify: “For rescue lines, animals from approximately 20-25 litters comprised the entire dataset. WT littermates obtained from these litters were kept separate for comparisons in each line. KO mice were offspring from independent crosses of heterozygous <italic>Bmal1</italic> KO’s”.</p><p> <italic>10) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, it is unclear what exactly is shown in panels A and B. It seems to be a calculation based on comparison to the corresponding interval during undisturbed sleep for the same genotype or the same animal but could this artificially alter the value since the undisturbed diurnal sleep patterns are quite different for the different genotypes? It might be better to present the &quot;baseline&quot; and the &quot;recovery&quot; data together to get a clear picture of how the genetic changes affect recovery from sleep deprivation, as in Laposky et al., 2005 demonstrating effects of ubiquitous Bmal1 loss on sleep.</italic></p><p>A major problem with interpreting the recovery response to a homeostatic challenge is controlling for the amount of sleep lost. This is especially true when comparing different strains where the amount of sleep lost during sleep deprivation can be different. To control for these differences, normalizing for the amount of lost sleep (by expressing sleep recovered as a percentage of sleep lost) is a standard practice in the sleep field. However, the pattern of sleep recovery does differ between genotypes and we agree that presenting the recovery day, as requested, will allow visualization of these differences.
