and Bak and by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. Bim binds to these proteins via its BH3 domain and to the mitochondrial membrane by a carboxyl-terminal sequence (CTS). In cells killed by Bim, the expression of a Bim mutant in which the CTS was deleted (BimL-dCTS) triggered apoptosis that correlated with inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins being sufficient to permeabilize mitochondria isolated from the same cells. Detailed analysis of the molecular mechanism demonstrated that BimL-dCTS inhibited Bcl-XL but did not activate Bax. Examination of additional point mutants unexpectedly revealed that the CTS of Bim directly interacts with Bax, is required for physiological concentrations of Bim to activate Bax and that different residues in the CTS enable Bax activation and binding to membranes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>primary murine neurons</kwd><kwd>MEF cells</kwd><kwd>BMK cells</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Bcl-2 family proteins</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRN12517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN143312</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM062964</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Jialing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM103640</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Jialing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008569</institution-id><institution>Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HR16-016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Jialing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001298</institution-id><institution>Presbyterian Health Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Jialing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000147</institution-id><institution>Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The C-terminal membrane binding domain of Bim is shown to interact with and activate Bim enabling it to kill cells not dependent on anti-apoptotic proteins for survival.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Apoptosis is a highly conserved form of programmed cell death that can be triggered by extrinsic or intrinsic signals. It plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis by eliminating old, excessive or dysfunctional cells in multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kerr et al., 1972</xref>). Defective regulation of apoptosis has been found in many diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Favaloro et al., 2012</xref>) and is considered one of the hallmarks of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Bcl-2 family proteins play a decisive role in apoptosis initiated by intrinsic signaling by regulating the integrity of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). Commitment to apoptosis is generally regarded as due to MOM permeabilization (MOMP) releasing cytochrome c and pro-apoptotic factors from the intermembrane space into the cytoplasm. These factors activate the executioner caspases that mediate cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chipuk et al., 2006</xref>). Direct interactions between Bcl-2 family proteins govern both initiation and inhibition of MOMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kale and Osterlund, 2017</xref>). The Bcl-2 family of proteins that regulate apoptosis includes the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 that inhibit the process and share four Bcl-2 homology domains. These homology domains, referred to as BH domains, are also shared by the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak that permeabilize the MOM directly. Both pro- and anti-apoptotic multi-domain Bcl-2 family proteins are regulated by direct binding interactions with a group of proteins including Bim, Bid, Puma, Hrk, Bad and Noxa that contain a single region of homology, the Bcl-2 homology domain number 3, and are therefore referred to collectively as BH3-proteins. These proteins promote apoptosis by releasing sequestered activated Bax, Bak and BH3-proteins that activate Bax and Bak from one or more of the anti-apoptotic proteins. The subset of BH3 proteins that bind to and activate Bax or Bak include Bid, Bim and Puma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chi et al., 2014</xref>). Thus far, the biochemical basis for the differences between BH3-proteins that inhibit anti-apoptotic proteins and those that activate Bax and Bak has been attributed entirely to differences in affinities of the BH3-domain for the BH3-peptide binding sites on multi-domain pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. However, static affinities and variations in expression levels permit only coarse regulation of cell death. Changes in the equilibrium binding of Bcl-2 family proteins on the MOM enable finer control. For example, at physiologic concentrations, the BH3-protein Bid only activates Bax after Bid has bound to a membrane and undergone a specific conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lovell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shamas-Din et al., 2013a</xref>). Binding to membranes also enables interaction of Bid with MTCH2 on the MOM to greatly accelerate the Bid conformational change that results in Bax activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shamas-Din et al., 2013a</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether membrane interactions by other BH3-proteins like Bim contribute to Bax activation.</p><p>The BH3-protein Bim is an important mediator of apoptosis initiated by many intracellular stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Concannon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mahajan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Puthalakath et al., 2007</xref>). Three major isoforms of Bim result from alternative mRNA splicing: BimEL, BimL, and BimS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">O'Connor et al., 1998</xref>). All three isoforms include the BH3-domain required for binding other Bcl-2 family proteins, and a C-terminal sequence (CTS) that binds the protein to the MOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilfling et al., 2012</xref>). BimEL and BimL also share a dynein light chain binding motif (LC1) that sequesters these isoforms at the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lei and Davis, 2003</xref>). However, recent evidence also suggests that the LC1 sequence mediates Bim oligomerization by binding to the DLC1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singh et al., 2017</xref>). Isoform BimS does not contain the LC1-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lei and Davis, 2003</xref>), and is rarely present in healthy cells, while BimL and BimEL are present in most tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O'Reilly et al., 2000</xref>). Bim has a particularly important function as a regulator of anti-apoptotic proteins, as it binds and thereby inhibits by mutual sequestration all known anti-apoptotic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shamas-Din et al., 2013b</xref>). Until recently, it was unknown why Bim binds to Bcl-XL with sufficient affinity to resist displacement by small molecule BH3-mimetics, while other BH3-proteins, such as Bad, are displaced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aranovich et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to interactions via the BH3-domain, residues within the Bim CTS bind to Bcl-XL, and thereby increase the affinity of the interaction by ‘double-bolt locking’ providing an explanation for the observations with BH3 mimetic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we investigated whether the CTS of Bim also contributes to the functional and physical interactions between Bim and Bax.</p><p>We demonstrate that both primary cells and cell lines have a range of apoptotic responses to the expression of a truncated BimL protein lacking the CTS (BimL-dCTS), while expression of full-length BimL was sufficient to kill all of these cells. To determine the molecular mechanism that underlies this difference, the two pro-apoptotic functions of Bim; activation of Bax and inhibition of Bcl-XL, were quantified using purified full-length BimL and BimL mutant proteins and cell-free assays. Replacing the CTS of Bim with an alternative tail-anchor that binds the protein to mitochondrial membranes did not fully restore Bax activation function, demonstrating that sequences within the Bim CTS rather than membrane binding contribute to Bax activation. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Bim CTS also revealed residues important for binding to membranes that were not required for Bax activation (e.g. I125). Furthermore, specific residues within the CTS were identified that are required for BimL to efficiently activate Bax, but that are not required for BimL to bind to and inhibit Bcl-XL. Evidence in cell free assays demonstrated that BimL CTS residues L129 and I132 physically interact with Bax in the BH3 binding groove and are required for Bim to activate Bax. Together, our data demonstrates that the unusual sequence of the CTS of Bim separately controls both membrane binding and Bax activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The CTS of Bim variably contributes to the pro-apoptotic activity of Bim in different cell lines</title><p>Removing the CTS from Bim abrogates pro-apoptotic activity in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weber et al., 2007</xref>). While this observation has generally been ascribed to loss of binding of Bim to MOM our observation that the CTS is also involved in binding BimEL to Bcl-XL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) suggested that there may be other explanations for the loss of pro-apoptotic activity for Bim when the CTS is removed. To determine the contribution of the Bim CTS to pro-apoptotic activity, a BimL mutant was generated in which the previously characterized membrane binding domain (carboxyl-terminal residues P121- H140) were deleted (BimL-dCTS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilfling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). This mutant was expressed in cells and the effectiveness of induction of cell death was compared to expression of full-length BimL by confocal microscopy. To detect expression of the constructs in live cells, they included an N-terminally fused Venus fluorescent protein (indicated by a superscripted v in the name). Thus, a construct in which Venus was fused to the amino-terminus of BimL is referred to here as <sup>V</sup>BimL while the mutant lacking the CTS is <sup>V</sup>BimL-dCTS. As an inactive control, we used <sup>V</sup>BimL-4E a mutant in which four conserved hydrophobic residues in the BH3-domain of BimL were replaced with glutamate, thereby preventing binding to all other multi-BH domain Bcl-2 family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To assay pro-apoptotic activity, the constructs were expressed in primary cells and cell lines and both expression and cell death were measured using confocal microscopy. Apoptosis was assessed by detecting externalization of phosphatidylserine by Annexin V staining in cells expressing detectable levels of <sup>V</sup>BimL or the <sup>V</sup>BimL mutants as measured by Venus fluorescence. As a positive control for activation of Bax <sup>V</sup>tBid, the activated form of the BH3-protein Bid fused to the C-terminus of the Venus fluorescent protein was also expressed in cells. As expected, expression of <sup>V</sup>BimL induced apoptosis in all cell types tested, while the negative control protein <sup>V</sup>BimL-4E did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, <sup>V</sup>tBid induced apoptosis in all the cell types except HEK293 cells. As reported previously for Bim-dCTS, the fluorescent version (<sup>V</sup>BimL-dCTS) failed to induce cell death in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weber et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, expression of <sup>V</sup>BimL-dCTS induced apoptosis to levels similar to <sup>V</sup>BimL in HCT116, BMK and MEF cells but may have reduced potency in CAMA-1 cells. Comparing the AnnexinV intensities for individual cells at a variety of equivalent expression levels of the Bim mutants across the different cell types revealed that the CTS of Bim was required for the pro-apoptotic activity of Bim in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell lines demonstrate a range of apoptotic response to BimL-dCTS expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Venus, <sup>V</sup>tBid <sup>V</sup>BimL, <sup>V</sup>BimL-dCTS or <sup>V</sup>Bim-4E were expressed in the indicated cell lines by transient transfection. The cells were stained with the nuclear dye Draq5 and rhodamine labeled Annexin V, and imaged by confocal microscopy to identify cells undergoing apoptosis.

This assay measures loading of anti-apoptotic proteins with BH3-proteins or active Bax/Bak. Unlike BH3-profiling experiments conducted with BH3-peptides, in these experiments purified full-length proteins were used. Thus, purified cBid, BimL, BimL-dCTS, Bad and Noxa proteins were incubated with mitochondria from each of the cell lines and MOMP was measured by separating supernatant and pellet fractions for each reaction, and immunoblotting for cytochrome c released from the intermembrane space as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pogmore et al., 2016</xref>). Immunoblots were quantified and MOMP assessed as % cytochrome c released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected from the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, addition of recombinant BimL was sufficient to induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria from both HEK293 and MEF cells. However, addition of BimL-dCTS induced cytochrome c release only in the MEF mitochondria confirming that resistance to BimL-dCTS in HEK293 cells is manifest at mitochondria. Mitochondria purified from HEK293 cells were more sensitive to BimL protein than to recombinant cBid, a phenomenon that is also seen when <sup>V</sup>tBid is expressed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This result may be due to the inherent differences between Bim and Bid reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sarosiek et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, in HEK293 cells, <sup>V</sup>tBid was more active than BimL-dCTS and functionally equivalent to <sup>V</sup>BimL in every other cell line tested.</p><p>One potential explanation for the difference in response to BimL-dCTS and BimL is that the mitochondria in the cell lines have different dependencies on multi-domain anti-apoptotic proteins for survival, a phenomenon known as priming. If BimL-dCTS has lost one of the functions of Bim such as activating Bax or Bak or inhibiting one of the multi-domain anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 it would be expected to have different activities on mitochondria with different priming. Therefore, to better understand why BimL-dCTS can only permeabilize MEF mitochondria and not mitochondria from HEK293 cells, we compared the sensitivity of mitochondria from the two cell types to addition of BH3-proteins Bad or Noxa that inhibits Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL or Mcl-1, respectively, but that do not activate Bax or Bak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kale and Osterlund, 2017</xref>). Incubation of full-length Bad and/or Noxa with mitochondria from HEK293 cells failed to induce cytochrome c release, while the addition of Noxa or Bad was sufficient to permeabilize MEF mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This data suggests that HEK293 cells not depend on expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL or Mcl-1 sequestering active Bax, Bak or their BH3-activators while mitochondria from MEFs depend on expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL to prevent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lessene et al., 2013</xref>). The results further suggest that removal of the CTS from BimL results in a mutant protein that only kills cells dependent on one or more multi-domain anti-apoptotic proteins for survival. That BimL-dCTS does not kill HEK293 cells further suggests that it does not activate sufficient Bax or Bak to overcome the unoccupied anti-apoptotic proteins in this cell line. In this way, BimL-dCTS functions as a sensitizer similar to proteins like Bad and Noxa. However, unlike other relatively specific sensitizer proteins, the BH3-region of BimL-dCTS binds to and inhibits Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1. Indeed, we have shown that in live cells BimEL-dCTS binds to and inhibits Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL but is more easily displaced than BimEL by small molecule BH3 mimetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Full-length BimL is required to kill cultures of primary cortical neurons</title><p>Our data with cell lines and their respective purified mitochondria suggests that BimL-dCTS does not kill cells that do not depend on anti-apoptotic proteins for survival. To test this in a more biologically relevant system, we cultured primary murine cortical neurons and assayed their response to expression of the BimL mutants. To enable regulated expression in primary cortical neurons the coding regions for <sup>V</sup>BimL, <sup>V</sup>BimL-4E, and <sup>V</sup>BimL-dCTS were cloned into a tetracycline-responsive lentiviral vector, and introduced into primary cortical neuron cultures through lentiviral infection. After culture for 16 days in vitro, BimL expression was induced in the neurons by the addition of doxycycline. Neuronal cell death was assayed using confocal microscopy after staining neurons with TMRE, a dye that only accumulates in active mitochondria. Thus, a lack of TMRE dye accumulation (TMRE negative) indicates loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and in response to expression of a BH3-protein is an early indication of commitment to cell death. Quantification of Venus-expressing neuronal cell bodies revealed that as expected <sup>V</sup>tBid and <sup>V</sup>BimL expression killed cultured primary neurons while <sup>V</sup>BimL-4E did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). However, the expression of <sup>V</sup>BimL-dCTS was largely ineffective to induce cell death in cultured primary cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Our data is consistent with previous reports suggesting that primary murine cultures of hippocampal neurons become resistant to induction of apoptosis by external stimuli over time in culture. This resistance has been reported to be due to a difference in Bcl-2 family protein expression that results in decreased mitochondrial ‘priming’, explaining why our cultures of primary cortical neurons are resistant to <sup>V</sup>BimL-dCTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sarosiek et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Full-length BimL is required to kill cultures of primary cortical neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of primary cortical neurons infected with lentivirus to express <sup>V</sup>tBid, <sup>V</sup>BimL, <sup>V</sup>BimL-dCTS or <sup>V</sup>BimL-4E as indicated above.

Brain mitochondria were used instead of isolating mitochondria from neuronal cultures due to the low yield from primary cultured neurons. Untreated mitochondria from day E15 brain released only low levels of cytochrome c. As expected, addition of 0.1 nM recombinant BimL was sufficient to elicit MOMP as measured by cytochrome c release and detection in the supernatant. In contrast, 100 times more BimL-dCTS (10 nM) failed to induce MOMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Taken together our data suggest that BimL-dCTS kills cells in which the mitochondria are sensitive to inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins by sensitizers such as Bad and Noxa. Thus, BimL-dCTS did not permeabilize mitochondria extracted from HEK293 cells or E15 whole murine brains, and as a result, BimL-dCTS expression did not kill HEK293 cells or primary cultures of cortical neurons. This finding suggests that inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins is not sufficient to kill these cells. Therefore, BimL-dCTS differs mechanistically from BimL as the latter kills both cell types resistant and sensitive to BimL-dCTS. Compared to BimL, BimL-dCTS is missing the membrane-binding domain and therefore is not expected to localize at mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2019</xref>); however, the relationship between Bim binding to membranes and Bim-mediated Bax activation has not been extensively studied. To determine how the molecular mechanism of BimL-dCTS differs from BimL the activities of the proteins were analyzed using cell-free assays.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The Bim CTS mediates BimL binding to both Bax and membranes</title><p>To investigate the pro-apoptotic mechanism of BimL and BimL-dCTS without interference from other cellular components, both were purified as full-length recombinant proteins and assayed using liposomes and/or isolated mitochondria. To measure direct-activation of Bax by Bim, either BimL or BimL-dCTS was incubated with recombinant Bax and liposomes encapsulating the dye and quencher pair: ANTS (8-Aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-Trisulfonic Acid, Disodium Salt) and DPX (p-Xylene-Bis-Pyridinium Bromide). In this well-established assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chi et al., 2014</xref>), increasing amounts of BimL activated Bax results in membrane permeabilization measured as an increase in fluorescence due to the release and separation of encapsulated dye and quencher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This result is consistent with previous observations that picomolar concentrations of BimL induce Bax-mediated membrane permeabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sarosiek et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, three orders of magnitude higher concentrations of BimL-dCTS were required to induce Bax-mediated liposome permeabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that either or both of binding to membranes and the specific CTS of Bim are required for efficient Bax activation. As expected, similar results were obtained for Bax-mediated release of mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For these experiments, MOMP was measured as release of the fluorescent protein mCherry fused to the N-terminal mitochondrial import signal of SMAC (SMAC-mCherry) from the intermembrane space of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shamas-Din et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to the results with liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and mitochondria from cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) BimL but not BimL-dCTS triggered Bax mediated SMAC-mCherry release from mitochondria isolated from Bax - /- Bak-/-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In experiments with liposomes and mitochondria, very small amounts of Bim were sufficient to trigger membrane permeabilization because once activated, Bax recruits and activates additional Bax molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tan et al., 2006</xref>). To assess the impact of the Bim CTS on the interaction between Bim and Bax, binding was measured using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). For these experiments, recombinant BimL proteins were labeled with the donor fluorophore Alexa568, while Bax was labeled with the acceptor fluorophore Alexa647. Unexpectedly, and unlike the BH3-only protein tBid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lovell et al., 2008</xref>), BimL bound to Bax even in the absence of membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), while BimL-dCTS had no relevant Bax binding in the presence or absence of mitochondrial-like liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>).

Nevertheless, this data reflects the situation in cells and further confirms that binding to membranes and Bax are independent functions of the Bim CTS .

For example, while BimL bound to membranes with a Kd of 31 pM, BimL-CTS2A and BimL-I125E bound to membranes with Kds of ~600 and&gt;1000 pM, respectively yet both mutants triggered Bax-mediated membrane permeabilization, demonstrating that specific residues in the CTS rather than binding to membranes enabled BimL to mediate Bax activation. Moreover, BimL binding to Bax was also not sufficient to activate Bax efficiently. BimL-L129E and BimL-I132E are two Bim mutants that do not bind membranes, retain reasonable affinities for Bax in the presence of membranes (Kds ~ 100–200 nM), but were unable to activate Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results indicate that these two residues play a key function in Bax activation. As expected, the negative control BimL-4E mutant does not bind to nor activate Bax even though its CTS is intact and the protein binds membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This result confirms the essential role of the BH3-domain and suggests that the Bim CTS provides a secondary role in Bax binding rather than providing an independent high affinity binding site that is sufficient to activate Bax.</p><p>Both functional and binding assays for the various point mutants suggest that specific residues in the Bim CTS participate in Bim-Bax protein interactions that lead to Bax activation; however, these mutants did not clearly separate the membrane binding function of the CTS of Bim from a potential function in Bax activation. Thus, it remains possible that restoring membrane binding to BimL-dCTS would be sufficient to restore Bax activation function. To address this, we fused the mitochondrial tail-anchor from mono-amine oxidase (MAO residues 490–527, UniProt: P21397-1) to the C-terminus of BimL-dCTS to restore membrane binding with a sequence unlikely to contribute to Bax activation directly. This protein, BimL-dCTS-MAO, and BimL bound to mitochondrial-like liposomes and purified mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref> respectively). As expected, a population of these recombinant Bim proteins remains in solution. To directly assess the Bim CTS contribution to the binding and activation of Bax on the membrane surface, we incubated a defined amount of recombinant Alexa568-labeled BimL or BimL-dCTS-MAO proteins with 0.5 mg/mL ANTS/DPX filled liposomes, then isolated the liposomes using size-exclusion chromatography. Using this procedure, we excluded all recombinant Bim that remained in solution, and obtained the membrane-bound BimL or BimL-dCTS-MAO at a concentration of ~5 nM as calculated based on Alexa568 fluorescence intensity (Precise concentrations labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This equates to 0.6 Bim molecules per liposome. Addition of Bax to these liposomes resulted in ANTS/DPX release for roughly 60% of the liposomes in incubations containing BimL-membrane-bound liposomes, but no significant release from the liposomes in incubations containing BimL-dCTS-MAO-bound liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that the Bim CTS contributes to the activation of Bax even on the membrane surface.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>BimL-dCTS-MAO binds to liposomes and Bax but activates Bax poorly.</title><p>Cartoons at the side indicate the measurements being made with equilibria arrows representing the results obtained.

However, when Alexa568-labeled BimL-dCTS-MAO bound to the liposome membrane was isolated by size-exclusion chromatography as described above, a FRET signal was detected between it and Alexa647-labeled Bax.

To detect this binding interaction, we used a photocrosslinking approach, in which a BimL protein was synthesized with a photoreactive probe attached to a single lysine residue positioned in the CTS using an in vitro translation system containing 5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyl-labled Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> that incorporates the lysine analog (εANB-Lys) into the polypeptide when a lysine codon in the BimL mRNA is encountered by the ribosome. The BimL synthesized in vitro was also labeled by <sup>35</sup>S via methionine residues enabling detection of BimL monomers and photoadducts by phosphor-imaging.</p><p>The radioactive, photoreactive BimL protein was incubated with a recombinant His6-tagged Bax protein in the presence of mitochondria isolated from BAK<sup>-/-</sup> mouse liver lacking endogenous Bax and Bak to prevent competition and increase BimL-Bax protein interactions. Mitochondrial proteins were then separated from the soluble ones by centrifugation. Both soluble and mitochondrial fractions were photolyzed to activate the ANB probe generating a nitrene that can react with atoms in close proximity (<underline>&lt;</underline>12 Å from the Cα of the lysine residue). Thus, for photoadducts to form, the atoms of the bound Bax molecule are likely to be located in or near the binding site for the Bim CTS. The resulting photoadduct between the BimL and the His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Bax was enriched by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-chelating agarose resin and separated from the unreacted BimL and Bax monomers using SDS-PAGE. The <sup>35</sup>S-labeled BimL in the photoadduct with His6-tagged Bax and BimL monomer bound to the Ni<sup>2+</sup>-beads specifically via the His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Bax or nonspecifically were detected by phosphor-imaging. A BimL-Bax-specific photoadduct was detected when the ANB probe was located at four different positions in the Bim CTS on both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces of the potential α-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). These photoadducts have the expected molecular weight for the Bim-Bax dimer, and were not detected or greatly reduced when the ANB probe, the light, or the His6-tagged Bax protein was omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Consistent with the BimL-Bax interaction detected by FRET in both solution and membranes, the BimL-Bax photocrosslinking occurred in both soluble and mitochondrial fractions. Less photocrosslinking occurred in the mitochondrial fraction likely due to the fact that in membranes homo-oligomerization of activated Bax competes with hetero-dimerization between BimL and Bax.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Residues within the Bim CTS interact with Bax.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Interaction of the Bim CTS with Bax in both soluble and mitochondrial fractions detected by photocrosslinking. The [35S]Met-labeled BimL proteins, each with a single εANB-lysine residue located at the position in the CTS indicated at the top of the panels, were synthesized in vitro, and incubated with His6-tagged Bax protein (6H-Bax) in the presence of mitochondria lacking endogenous Bax and Bak.

Furthermore, loss of photocrosslinking for BimL mutants with the BH3-4E mutation that abolished binding to Bax demonstrates that direct binding between the proteins is required for crosslinking to be detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Therefore, the crosslinking data suggests that similar to the BH3-domain, the Bim CTS binds to Bax. To further demonstrate that the CTS of Bim binds to Bax independent of both membrane binding and Bax activation, the experiment was repeated with BimL-L129E, a mutant that binds Bax without activating it and that does not bind membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Unlike the photocrosslinking approach that does not reveal the location of the binding site, the chemical crosslinker bismaleimidohexane (BMH) contains two sulfhydryl reactive moieties separated by a 13 Å spacer, and thus formation of a BMH-crosslinked Bim-Bax dimer requires a cysteine in Bim that is in close proximity with another cysteine in the interacting Bax. Therefore, a successful crosslink indicates a close proximity between the two cysteines, potentially revealing the Bim-binding site in Bax.</p><p>We used a structurally well-defined Bim-Bax interaction to validate this crosslinking approach. According to the crystal structure (PDB ID 4ZIE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Robin et al., 2015</xref>), the BH3-domain of Bim binds to the canonical groove of Bax. Our FRET data shows that BimL and Bax bind in solution and the binding is abolished by the 4E mutation in the Bim BH3-domain that eliminates the nonpolar interactions with the Bax groove. It is therefore expected that this Bim-Bax interaction is mediated by the BH3-domain and the groove, and according to the structure, a BMH molecule would be able to link a cysteine replacing Phe<sup>101</sup> in the BH3-domain of Bim to a cysteine replacing Trp<sup>107</sup> in the canonical groove of Bax. We thus synthesized the [<sup>35</sup>S]Met-labeled single-Cys Bim F101C and Bax W107C proteins in vitro, let them interact in solution, and subjected the sample to BMH crosslinking. When the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphor-imaging two BMH-crosslinked products with molecular weights close to that of a BimL-Bax heterodimer were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lane 4, indicated by open and closed triangles). The lower molecular weight band indicated by a closed triangle is the BMH-linked BimL-Bax heterodimer since it was absent in the control reactions when either the single-cysteine BimL or Bax was replaced by the respective cysteine-null (C0) protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lane 6 or 2). The higher molecular weight band indicated by an open triangle is the BMH-linked Bax homodimer since it was also present in the control reaction containing the single-cysteine Bax and the cysteine-null BimL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lane 6).

To determine whether the Bim CTS binds to the same Bax groove as the Bim BH3-domain, we performed BMH crosslinking using a Bim W137C mutant that has a single cysteine near the C-terminus of the CTS. Like the Bim F101C mutant with the cysteine near the C-terminus of the BH3-domain, Bim W137C crosslinked to Bax W107C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lane 10, indicated by a closed triangle), suggesting that the BH3-binding groove is also a binding site for the Bim CTS.

Since this Bax mutant was also crosslinked to the C-terminus of CTS via W137C, binding of the CTS to the groove seems to occur in either orientation. Additional weak but specific BimL to Bax crosslinking was detected from M123C to E69C and W137C to D98C providing further support for this flexible interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the physical interaction between the Bim CTS or BH3-domain and the Bax groove detected by the crosslinking is functional, we tested the effect of the L129E mutation in the Bim CTS or the 4E mutation in the Bim BH3-domain on the crosslinking because both mutations greatly inhibited the activation of Bax by BimL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We found that the L129E mutation reduced the Bim CTS to Bax interaction with the binding groove detected by the Bim W137C or W123C to Bax W107C crosslinking (compare the closed triangle-indicated band in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, lane 10 or 14 with that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lane 10 or 14). Since we used Bim F101C to detect the BH3-domain interaction with the Bax groove, and the F101 was changed to E in the 4E mutant, we generated Bim F101C/3E mutant to assess the effect of the BH3 mutation. As expected, the 3E mutation abolished Bim F101C crosslinking to Bax W107C, and hence, the BH3-interaction with the groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, the closed triangle indicates the band in lane two that disappeared in lane 4 when the 3E mutant was used). Surprisingly, mutation of the CTS also inhibited the BH3-interaction with the groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, lane four vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lane 4), while the BH3 mutation also abolished the CTS interaction with the groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, lane 12 vs. lane 10), suggesting that the two interactions are not independent. The BH3-domain may contribute more than the CTS to the overall protein-protein interaction based on the severity of the effect of mutations on the crosslinking and FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

In contrast, HEK293 cells were killed by expression of <sup>V</sup>BimL-I125E, albeit to a lesser extent than by <sup>V</sup>BimL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This result is consistent with our findings with purified proteins showing that the EC50 for liposome permeabilization by BimL-I125E was 100 nM compared to ~1 nM for BimL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The activity of <sup>V</sup>BimL-I125E also demonstrates that BimL binding to membranes is not required to kill HEK293 cells as BimL-I125E does not bind membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Together, this data suggests that unlike MEF cells, only mutants of BimL that can efficiently activate Bax kill HEK293 cells.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Bim CTS mutants that cannot activate Bax in vitro cannot kill HEK293 cells.</title><p>The indicated cell lines were transiently transfected with DNA to express <sup>V</sup>BimL, and the indicated <sup>V</sup>BimL mutant proteins.

Unlike any of the known BH3-proteins or small molecule inhibitors, BimL-dCTS inhibits all of the major multi-domain Bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic proteins without activating Bax or Bak. Thus expression of this tool protein in cells enables new insight into the importance of the extent to which a cell depends on the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins for survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Our results strongly suggest that the varying levels of apoptotic response of cell lines to BimL-dCTS reflect the extent to which that particular cell type is primed. Thus, HEK293 cells and mature neurons that are resistant to inhibition of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 but sensitive to activation of Bax, are functionally unprimed. Partial resistance to expression of BimL-dCTS suggests that the flow of Bcl-2 family proteins between different binding partners leads to differential levels of dependency on the activation of Bax to trigger apoptosis. To illustrate this, we have created a schema illustrating protein flow at the two extremes represented by fully unprimed and primed cells and the effects of mutations in the Bim CTS on regulating apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). In the schema, flow is indicated by the different lengths of the equilibria arrows and illustrates the consequences of the various dissociation constants displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. While BimL efficiently recruits Bax to membranes and activates it, BimL-I125E does not bind to membranes and has reduced binding to Bax therefore this mutant activates Bax less efficiently than BimL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). BH3-proteins that do not efficiently activate Bax, such as BimL-L129E or BimL-I132E, do not result in MOMP in unprimed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>) instead they interact primarily with anti-apoptotic proteins (illustrated here as Bcl-XL since it was possible to measure binding with this purified protein). The binding measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> allow prediction of the outcome of more subtle differences in interactions for BimL and its mutants. For example, even though BimL-I125E activates Bax the concentration required is around 100 nM while the dissociation constant for Bcl-XL is less than 3 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) such that in cells BimL-I125E would preferentially bind and inhibit Bcl-XL rather than activate Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). While the CTS is necessary for Bim to activate Bax at physiologically relevant concentrations, membrane binding mediated by the CTS is not a prerequisite for interaction with Bax. Rather, binding to membranes increases subsequent Bax activation possibly through facilitating Bax conformational changes on the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> compare BimL, BimL-CTS2A and BimL-I125E). Thus, it is likely that in cells expressing endogenous Bim, binding to membranes contributes to the efficiency with which the protein kills cells. In addition, a recent publication suggests that membrane-bound Bim is more pro-apoptotic as it can dimerize using the LC1-motif by binding to DLC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singh et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we observed that one reason that BimL-dCTS is less pro-apoptotic is loss of binding to membranes where it can activate Bax more efficiently. Future work will determine the relative importance of the CTS-mediated Bim binding to mitochondrial membranes and direct activation of Bax. In addition, it will be critical to determine the role for the DLC1-mediated Bim complex formation on binding anti-apoptotic proteins in the membranes. A key question is whether the resulting alterations of Bim interactions with other Bcl-2 family proteins that are mediated by BH3-domain, the CTS and LC1 region are regulated differently in different cell types. Nevertheless, restoring membrane binding to BimL-dCTS using a mitochondrial tail-anchor (BimL-dCTS-MAO) did not restore Bax activation, thus indicating that the Bim CTS does more than bind the protein to membranes . Additionally, our work suggests a newly characterized mechanistic distinction between Bim and tBid, as tBid requires membrane binding and a subsequent conformational change in order to bind and efficiently activate Bax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lovell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shamas-Din et al., 2013a</xref>) while BimL can activate Bax in solution via dual interactions with the Bim BH3 domain and CTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Schematic overview for the Bim CTS pro-apoptotic function Interactions between BimL (blue), effector protein Bax (red) and Bcl-XL (green) are shown at mitochondria of unprimed and primed cells as indicated.</title><p>Mutations of the Bim CTS are shown as a red or yellow star. Direction of protein flow into complexes indicated by lengths of the equilibria arrows is based on the Kds measured for the binding interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), using the approximate cellular concentrations of the various proteins and activity assays with liposomes and mitochondria. (A) In unprimed cells the direct activation of Bax is the main function of Bim for inducing apoptosis. Comparison of BimL-I125E with BimL-L129E, BimL-I132E, and BimL-dCTS shows that the CTS, not membrane binding controls the activation of Bax by BimL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). BimL binds membranes and can activate Bax. BimL-I125E (yellow star) has no detectable membrane-binding activity but still binds to and activates Bax, albeit with reduced activity compared to BimL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). At physiologically relevant concentrations BimL-L129E, BimL-I132E, and BimL-dCTS do not activate Bax and do not bind to membranes. However unlike BimL-dCTS. BimL-L129E and BimL-I132E binding to Bax is not reduced enough to account for the loss in Bax activation and membrane permeabilization suggesting these two residues are involved in activating Bax. (B) In primed cells, one or more pro-apoptotic proteins (activated Bax/Bak and/or a Bax/Bak-activating BH3-protein) are sequestered by anti-apoptotic proteins at the MOM. For simplicity only active Bax is shown. Depending on the amount of active pro-apoptotic protein sequestered and the amount of free inactive Bax and or Bak in the cell, BimL may initiate apoptosis primarily by inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins or by activating Bax and inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins. The Bim CTS is not required for binding to and inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins as BimL-L129E, BimL-I132E, and BimL-dCTS bind to anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-XL and release both pro-apoptotic BH3-proteins and Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), thus enabling killing of primed cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44525-fig11-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The activities of the various Bim mutants analyzed here further suggest that specific residues in the Bim CTS enable physiological concentrations of Bim to activate Bax. That BimL-V124E, BimL-I125E and BimL-L129E all bind Bax in solution and in the presence of membranes with similar affinities yet vary functionally to trigger Bax-mediated liposome permeabilization by three orders of magnitude, suggests a specific role for this region in activation of Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) rather than the region simply increasing overall binding affinity. The situation is further complicated by another major role of the CTS of Bim in binding the protein to membranes. BimL-dCTS-MAO binds to mitochondria and liposomes yet is defective in activating Bax to permeabilize these membranes further suggesting a role for specific residues in the CTS binding to and activating Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Such a role is consistent with our crosslinking data suggesting direct binding between the CTS of Bim and Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) that is surprisingly mediated at least in part by the canonical BH3-binding groove in Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Furthermore, these CTS residues particularly L129 (which corresponds to L185 in BimEL) increased the affinity for Bim binding to Bcl-XL such that it conferred resistance to BH3 mimetic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, it remains formally possible that changes in binding affinity coupled with alterations in effective off-rate due to membrane binding may also contribute to the activation of Bax by Bim. In addition to loss of interactions with the membrane BimL-dCTS still retains a greater propensity to activate Bax in comparison to Bim BH3-peptides (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sarosiek et al., 2013</xref>; Figure 4H). While 1 μM of BimL-dCTS was sufficient to activate Bax in our liposome release assay, over 10 μM of Bim BH3-peptide was required to achieve similar Bax activation. This result suggests that in addition to the BH3 domain and the CTS, other regions of Bim contribute to Bim’s pro-apoptotic function as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singh et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, it is unclear to what extent other regions of Bim contribute to the BH3 region and the CTS adopting an optimal structure that can efficiently activate Bax. Similar to Bim, full length Bid cleaved by caspase is nearly 10-fold more active than a Bid-BH3 peptide in activating Bax, suggesting other regions outside the BH3-domain of Bid contribute to the interaction and/or activation of Bax. Thus, future studies of Bim and Bid should address what additional sequences other than the BH3-domains and C-terminal regions participate in Bax activation.</p><p>Currently, BH3-profiling is the technique used to assay the state of apoptotic priming for different tissue types, however, this technique requires the addition of BH3-peptides at high concentrations, and can only be performed on cells/tissues after permeabilization of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Potter and Letai, 2016</xref>). As an alternative, we propose lentiviral delivery and expression of BimL-dCTS be performed on living cells (or tissue samples), with readouts currently being used to assay cell death such as Annexin V staining, condensed nuclei, PI staining of nuclei, etc. Recently, it was reported in adults that most tissues are unprimed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sarosiek et al., 2017</xref>); however, the status of priming for different cell types that make up a single tissue may differ. In contrast, in tissue culture most cells are at least partially primed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We speculate that stress responses that result when fully or partially transformed cell lines are grown under non-physiological conditions (high glucose and oxygen, in the presence of serum and on plastic with abnormal stromal interactions) generally account for the dependence of these cell lines on continued expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. BH3-profiling can only provide an answer at the tissue level or for cell populations that can be isolated in sufficient quantities or easily cultured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sarosiek et al., 2017</xref>). However, lentiviral delivery and expression of <sup>V</sup>BimL-dCTS in cells in co- or organoid-cultures, tissue slices and in vivo can provide a means to assay the level of dependence of individual cells on expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. This information could prove valuable to understanding which cell types may be most affected by small molecule BH3 mimetics as chemotherapeutics and for other drugs to better predict and prevent off-target toxicities that result in cell priming.</p><p>Overall, our data suggests a model in which the unusual CTS of Bim is not only required for binding to membranes but is directly involved in the activation of Bax. This interaction likely occurs via binding of the Bim CTS to the BH3-binding groove on Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). However, the BH3-binding groove may not be the exclusive binding site for the Bim CTS. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, the CTS of Bim photocrosslinks to 6H-Bax even in the presence of the L129E mutation. However, crosslinking is abolished though with the BH3 4E mutation. How Bim binding to the BH3 binding groove by both its BH3 region and CTS enables Bax activation is the subject of ongoing studies. Nevertheless, this function is crucial for BimL to kill unprimed cells. The CTS also increases the affinity of Bim for binding to Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). The very much higher affinity of Bim for Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 compared to Bax ensures that in cells with excess anti-apoptotic proteins Bim is effectively sequestered and neutralized. In previous studies, we demonstrated that the additional affinity of the interaction of Bim with Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 provided by the Bim CTS is sufficient to dramatically reduce displacement of Bim by small molecule BH3 mimetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, regulation of apoptosis by Bcl-2 proteins is more complicated than presented in most current models. Moreover, the mutants and binding affinities described here provide the tools necessary for future studies of the relative importance of activation of Bax compared to inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins in intact cells and in animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">antibody to Cytochrome c</td><td valign="top">In house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Billen et al., 2008</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">(1:2000) Dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Donkey anti-rabbit (polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 711-035-150</td><td valign="top">(1:10000) Dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Donkey anti-mouse (polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 711-035-152</td><td valign="top">(1:10000) Dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Antibody to Bax</td><td valign="top">In house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhu et al., 1996</xref>)</td><td valign="top">Max6</td><td valign="top">(1:1000) dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Antibody to Bim</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: sc-11425</td><td valign="top">(1:50) dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Baby Mouse Kidney(BMK)-DKO (Bax and Bak knockout) cells</td><td valign="top">Other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Degenhardt et al., 2002</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Provided by Dr. Eileen White (Rutgers University) <break/>Mycoplasma free, see Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Cama-1</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1115">CVCL_1115</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Provided by Dr. Linda Penn (University of Toronto).

Thus, each aliquot was adjusted to 250 μL with IP buffer (100 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100), and received Bax antibody (made in house, 1:1000 dilution) or Bim antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, 1:50 dilution). The samples were rotated at 4 °C for overnight, and after receiving 25 μL of Protein G Sepharose (50% suspension in IP buffer), rotated for 2 more hours. After centrifugation at 2000 g for 0.5 min, the beads were washed three times with 400 μL of IP buffer and one time with 400 μL of 100 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 100 mM NaCl. The bound proteins were eluted with reducing SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Measurement of cell death in response to expression of <sup>V</sup>BimL constructs</title><p>HEK293, BMK, MEF, and HCT116 cells were maintained at 37°C (5% v/v CO2) in dMEM complete [dMEM, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 1% essential amino acids (Gibco, Grand Island, NY)]. CAMA-1 were maintained the same environmental conditions but using dMEM/F12 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY). Cell lines were routinely confirmed to be mycoplasma-free using a PCR-based protocol as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hopert et al. (1993)</xref>, and their authenticity was verified by short-tandem repeat (STR) profiling at The Centre for Applied Genomics (Toronto, ON, Canada) for human cells. Murine cell lines have not been authenticated. Cells were seeded in CellCarrier-Ultra 384-well plates (1000 cells/well for BMK and MEF, 2000 cells/well for HEK293 and HCT116, 3000 cells/well for CAMA-1). One day later, cells were transfected using FugeneHD (Promega, Madison, WI) with plasmids encoding Venus, or Venus-fused BimL constructs in an EGFP-C3 backbone. Cell culture medium was added to each reaction (50 µl/0.05 μg DNA) and the whole mix added to each well (50 µl/well) of a pre-aspirated 384-well plate of cells. After 24 hr, cells were stained with Draq5 and Rhodamine-labeled Annexin V and image acquisition was performed using the Opera QEHS confocal microscope (Perkin Elmer, Woodbridge, ON) with a 20x air objective. Untransfected cells and cells treated with 1 µg/mL staurosporine were used as negative and positive controls for Annexin V staining. Cells were identified automatically using software as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shamas-Din et al., 2013a</xref>). Intensity features were extracted using a script (dwalab.ca) written for Acapella high content imaging and analysis software (Perkin Elmer, Woodbridge, ON). Cells were scored as Venus or Annexin V positive if the Venus or Annexin V intensity was greater than the average intensity plus two standard deviations for the Venus or Annexin V channels in images of non-transfected cells. Cell death ascribed to the <sup>V</sup>BimL fusion proteins was quantified as the percentage of Venus-positive cells that were also Annexin V positive. For neuron cultures, cell segmentation using conventional methods could not be achieved due to complex cellular morphologies. Therefore, nuclei were first identified, then a ring region ~10% of nuclear area was drawn around each nucleus. Venus intensity was calculated for this ring region, representing the neuronal cell body, to determine if the neuron was expressing the Venus fluorescent protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Primary neuron cultures</title><p>Primary cortical neuron cultures were prepared from embryonic day 15, C57BL/6J mouse embryos as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mergenthaler et al., 2012</xref>). All animal breeding and handling were performed in accordance with local regulations and after approval by the Animal Care Committee at Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto. Briefly, after separation from hippocampus and subcortical structures, cortices were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, digested with 1x trypsin for 15 min at 37°C, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then resuspended with a flame-treated glass pipette in N-Medium (DMEM, 10% v/v FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Hepes, 45 µM glucose). The dissociated cortices were gently pelleted by centrifugation (200 g for 5 min), N-media was removed, and neurons were resuspended and cultured in Neurobasal-Plus medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with B27-Plus (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 1x Glutamax (ThermoFisher Scientific). Neurons were seeded at 5000 cells per well in a 384 well plate (Greiner µclear) after coating with poly-d-lysine (Cultrex). The medium was partially replaced on day 5 in culture with Neurobasal-Plus supplemented with B27-Plus and 1x Glutamax.</p><p>Lentivirus to express <sup>V</sup>BimL and other BimL mutants were cloned into the pTet-O-Ngn2-Puro construct with the Ngn2 gene cut out. This construct was a kind gift from Dr. Philipp Mergenthaler, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin. Primary neuron cultures were infected with both <sup>V</sup>BimL and rtTA lentiviral particles (~3 μL of each concentrated stock) on the day of seeding. 24 hr later, Neurobasal-Plus medium containing lentiviral particles was removed and replaced with fresh Neurobasal-Plus medium.</p><p>Doxycyline (ThermoFisher scientific) was added to 16 day in vitro old cultures of neurons at a concentration of 2 μg/mL to induce <sup>V</sup>BimL protein expression. 5 hr later, neurons were stained with 5 µM Draq5 (Thermofisher scientific) and 0.1 μM TMRE (Thermofisher scientific), then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Confocal microscopy was performed immediately after.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Lentiviral production</title><p>Each lentivirus was made using the following protocol adhering to biosafety level two procedures. On day 0, lentiviral vectors psPax2 (10 μg) and pMD2.G (1.25 μg) were mixed with 10 μg of desired <sup>V</sup>BimL lentiviral construct in 1000 μL of Opti-MEM media (ThermoFisher Scientific). Next, 42 μL of polyethylenimine (PEI) solution [1 mg/mL] was added, the mixture vortexed, then allowed to settle for 15 min at room temperature. After 15 min, 1.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> of resuspended HEK293 cells and the transfection solution were mixed and seeded onto a 100 mm culture dish with 10 mL of dMEM complete plus 10 μM of the caspase inhibitor Q-VD-Oph (Selleckchem), and left to incubate at 37 °C (5% v/v CO<sub>2</sub>) for 72 hr. On day 3, media containing lentiviral particles was filter sterilized using a 0.45 μm polyethersulfone filter, and mixed with polyethylene glycol (Bioshop) to achieve a final concentration of 10% (w/v). This was left to mix and precipitate the virus overnight at 4 °C. On day 4, the media was centrifuged for 1 hr at 1600 g, supernatant was then removed and the pellet was resuspended with 400 μL of Neurobasal-Plus media (no additives). Resuspended virus was then stored at −80 °C until needed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by CIHR grant FRN 12517 to DWA and BL and CIHR Foundation grant FDN143312 to DWA, US NIH grants R01GM062964, OCAST grant HR16-026 and Presbyterian Health Foundation grant to JL, and by an Institutional Development Award from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of US NIH under grant number P20GM103640.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The authors discover a novel role of the C-terminus of the BH3-only protein Bim. So far, only the BH3-domain of Bim has been considered crucial for its pro-apoptotic activity because this domain binds to the hydrophobic pocket of BCl<sup>-</sup>2, BCl<sup>-</sup>xL and MCl<sup>-</sup>1 and inhibits their survival action. The C-terminus of Bim was also shown to be important for targeting to the mitochondrial membrane. Now the authors find that the C-terminus of Bim (CTS) has a second function and is required for physiological concentrations of Bim to activate Bax. A mutant of Bim lacking the CTS still inhibited BCl<sup>-</sup>xL but was unable to activate Bax. These data add an important new aspect of the regulation of apoptosis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The carboxyl-terminal sequence of Bim enables Bax activation and killing of unprimed cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Volker Dötsch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christoph Borner (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In the reviews and during the discussion, several issues were raised that require further clarification:</p><p>1) A more quantitative analysis of the contributions of the C-terminus and the BH3 domain to Bax is necessary. Currently, the results show that without the C-terminus the BH3 domain alone does not bind to Bax. This is correct for the physiological concentrations used.

From a structural point of view it is difficult to see how just a few amino acids can lead to bax binding (without activation), bax activation and binding to the membrane. There are structural models of the Bim BH3 domain binding to bax and a specific model in which this domain binds to the back side of bax has been proposed. How are these new data consistent with these earlier studies? Where are the binding sites of the CTS on bax? On the hydrophobic groove, also on the back side or somewhere completely different?

As data with partial proteins and peptides generally requires μM concentrations and our assays use nanomolar concentrations similar to the concentrations of the proteins in cells, it is difficult to extend our studies to μM concentrations. To contrast our findings with what’s currently known about Bim BH3-Bax protein interaction, we have altered our Discussion, particularly (third paragraph) and make the direct comparison between our results with full-length BimL to data drawn from literature using the BH3-peptide of this protein. In addition, we have extended the x-axes for Figures 3A, B (Increasing the concentration of BimL-dCTS to 3 μM protein) to better compare the activity between BimL and BimL-dCTS. Figure 3A, B demonstrate that BimL-dCTS can directly activate Bax both in our liposome system and purified mitochondria, however, low μM concentrations are required. While this is still less than reported for a Bim BH3-peptide (Data found in Figure 4H – (Sarosiek et al., 2013)) it is so much more than the 10 nM full length protein that performing experiments with higher concentrations of BimL was not useful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data provide mainly correlations between mutations of individual amino acids and observed changes in binding/function but without a structural / mechanistic interpretation of how these changes are able to orchestrate the different effects. From a structural point of view it is difficult to see how just a few amino acids can lead to bax binding (without activation), bax activation and binding to the membrane.

Unfortunately the cross linking data do not provide any information on the binding site on bax. A mechanistic/structural model, for example using NMR titration data (NMR assignments for bax are online available) is required for better understanding these interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that NMR studies of full length Bim binding to Bax could be informative. However, to date such experiments have not proven interpretable due to peak broadening in the NMR. Similar effects were reported by the Walensky group necessitating the use of a stapled peptide of low affinity to obtain chemical shift data. Therefore, in order to provide a more structural/mechanistic model for how Bim protein uses both BH3-domain and CTS to activate Bax, we conducted chemical crosslinking experiments and identified a binding site for the Bim CTS in Bax. Our detailed description of the new data can be found in the Results section (–subsection “The Bim CTS binds to the BH3-binding pocket on Bax”) and the Figure 9 and Figure 9—figure supplement 1. Briefly, the chemical crosslinker BMH contains two sulfhydryl reactive moieties separated by a short spacer, and the formation of a BMH-crosslinked Bim-Bax dimer requires a cysteine in Bim that is in close proximity with another cysteine in the interacting Bax. Therefore, a successful crosslink indicates a close proximity between the two cysteines, thereby revealing the Bim binding site in Bax. We validated this approach using a pair of single cysteine Bim and Bax proteins designed to detect the structurally defined BH3-domain/canonical groove interaction (Figure 9A).</p><p>Sequence alignment between the Bim BH3 and the CTS revealed that both have the same hydrophobic residues at the h0, h1, h2 and h3 positions, and the same polar or charged residue at the h1+2 or h2+1 positions (Figure 9D). Therefore we investigated binding to the BH3 binding pocket in Bax using Bim with single cysteines in the CTS and Bax with single cysteines in the groove. Indeed, we detected the crosslinked Bim-Bax dimer using these single cysteine proteins (Figure 9A), which suggests that the BH3-binding groove in Bax is also a binding site for the CTS. In addition, we were unsuccessful in attempts at crosslinking the Bim CTS to the back side of Bax. Since these negative data are not interpretable we have not included them in the manuscript.</p><p>To determine whether the physical interaction between the Bim CTS or BH3-domain and the Bax groove we detected is functional, we tested the effect of L129E mutation in the CTS or the 4E mutation in the BH3-domain on the crosslinking. The data from these loss-of-function Bim mutants demonstrate that the CTS and BH3-interactions with the groove detected between the Bim and Bax proteins are functionally important for Bim mediated activation of Bax (Figure 9B, C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) BimL and in particular Bim-dCTS-Mao contain hydrophobic stretches at their C-terminus (in case of the Mao sequence this is a complete transmembrane helix). This can easily result in major problems due to aggregation and for example loss of binding of the Mao modified sequences in the solution experiments (Figure 7D). The concentrations are in general low (although during overexpression and purification the concentrations are actually quite high), but reach the microM range where aggregation of such peptides is to be expected. How have the authors ensured that no aggregation of the peptides occurs during the binding studies?</p></disp-quote><p>Excellent point! Aggregation during the purification of membrane-bound or membrane-binding proteins is always a concern. However, to measure the low concentrations of proteins used in our assays by gel filtration chromatography and western blotting was not feasible. Therefore, we used the Bim proteins labeled with Alexa568. As seen from new Figure 7—figure supplement 2A, at appropriate concentrations the proteins Alexa568 BimL-dCTS and Alexa568 BimL-dCTS-MAO are not aggregating, as they appear as single elution peaks in low molecular weights (Calculated 27 and 17 kDa respectively). Molecular weight calculations from FPLC data can be found in Figure 7—figure supplement 2—source data 1). Indeed BimL-dCTS serves as a control since it does not contain hydrophobic sequences and as an unstructured protein it is difficult to compare its hydrodynamic radius with that of the standard 12 kDa marker cytochrome c. To our surprise Alexa568 BimL eluted as a protein smaller than Alexa568 BimL-dCTS, calculated MW from FPLC: 8 kDa. We speculate that this resulted from some non-specific binding to the chromatography resin as all three proteins are at their correct molecular weights when subjected to SDS-PAGE (Figure 7—figure supplement 2B) or that it is related to the lack of folding of the protein. Consistent with this interpretation, SDS-PAGE demonstrates that all three proteins are not degraded and relatively free of contaminants from purification. This data has been added to the manuscript as Figure 7—figure supplement 2A and B.</p><p>In performing these experiments we realized that the some of the assays in Figure 7 use dye labeled BimL and mutants while others used unlabeled BimL. To remain consistent within the figure and the figure supplements we replaced the data presented in (old) Figure 7B and E which used non-labelled BimL-dCTS-MAO with data for Alexa568 BimL-dCTS-MAO. This protein appears monomeric as shown in Figure 7—figure supplements 2A-B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The interaction between different proteins on membranes are only estimations (or apparent KD as the authors say themselves). These binding measurements include binding of individual proteins to membranes and then with each other. A quantitative analysis of the binding on membranes requires TIRF measurements which take only molecules tethered to membranes into account. The KD should then also have different dimensions (concentration per area).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are absolutely correct, the Kd’s we present when measuring the interactions between Bim and Bax, (or Bim and BCl<sup>-</sup>XL) are “apparent” Kds, since we cannot quantify the fraction of the protein complexes that occur on the membranes versus in solution. In order to understand the contribution of the Bim CTS in the binding interaction with Bax taking place on the membrane, our experiments cannot be done with TIRF for BimL-dCTS as this mutant can no longer bind to membranes. Moreover, having published ourselves methods equivalent to TIRF we are not convinced that the supported bilayer is a good model system due to changes in the fluidity of the supported side and the number of different species that need to be identified and characterized. Even with supported bilayers we see fast moving molecules that are unlikely attached to the membrane (Kurylowicz et al., 2013; DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.11.1251">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.11.1251</ext-link>). Finally curvature is also a factor with Bax preferentially inserting into curved membranes.</p><p>To ensure all Alexa568 labelled Bim proteins were bound to the membrane surface, both BimL and BimL-dCTS-MAO were incubated with mitochondrial-like liposomes, then passed through a size-exclusion column. Thus, the Bim protein that elutes in the same fraction as the liposomes is the membrane-bound Bim protein. Bim protein that remains in solution is collected in later fractions that is excluded from the experiment. Next, to these isolated liposomes (of defined size, 100nm diameter spheres, and therefore defined area) increasing amounts of acceptor labelled Bax protein was added. FRET was measured from the decreasing fluorescence signal from the donor-labelled (membrane bound) Bim. This data has been used to create the new Figure 7B and 7D. The experiments are described in the last two paragraphs of the subsection “Different residues in the Bim CTS regulate membrane binding and Bax activation”.</p><p>Measuring the concentration of both Bim proteins (via Alexa568 fluorescence), and knowing the concentration of liposomes (with a diameter of 100nm), we were able to calculate that there are 0.6 Bim molecules per liposome in our assay. This value corresponds well with the fraction of the liposomes that are permeabilized (Figure 7B). Because our assay contains less than 1-Bim molecule per liposome, this strongly suggests that in the presence of liposomes the BimL-dCTS-MAO protein has not aggregated. This is now described in the aforementioned paragraphs and Materials and methods (subsection “Bim binding to membranes”).</p><p>In these experiments with liposomes isolated with bound Bim we still add soluble Bax therefore, the Bim-liposome complex and Bax are both in solution. That makes calculating 2 dimensional Kd’s very complicated. Moreover, in cells approximately half of the Bax is cytoplasmic with the remainder partitioned between molecules peripherally and integrally bound to the membrane. In our opinion given the compromises inherent in all model systems the liposome/mitochondria systems are the most representative of the interactions taking place in cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should have shown a BH3 mutant that does not bind to BCl<sup>-</sup>2s as control in Figure 1, to show killing is BH3 dependent in responsive cell lines.
