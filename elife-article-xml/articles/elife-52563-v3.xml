that tackle invading pathogens with different effector mechanisms. They acquire this antimicrobial potential during their maturation in the bone marrow, where they differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells in a process called granulopoiesis. Mature neutrophils are terminally differentiated and short-lived with a high turnover rate. Here, we show a critical role for linker histone H1 on the differentiation and function of neutrophils using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen in the human cell line PLB-985. We systematically disrupted expression of somatic H1 subtypes to show that individual H1 subtypes affect PLB-985 maturation in opposite ways. Loss of H1.2 and H1.4 induced an eosinophil-like transcriptional program, thereby negatively regulating the differentiation into the neutrophil lineage. Importantly, H1 subtypes also affect neutrophil differentiation and the eosinophil-directed bias of murine bone marrow stem cells, demonstrating an unexpected subtype-specific role for H1 in granulopoiesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neutrophil</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>lineage determination</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>H1 linker histone</kwd><kwd>cell differentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P300P3_158518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sollberger</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P2EZP3_148748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sollberger</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sollberger</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name><name><surname>Streeck</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Caffrey</surname><given-names>Brian Edward</given-names></name><name><surname>Zychlinsky</surname><given-names>Arturo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM116143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Skoultchi</surname><given-names>Arthur I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Linker histones affect the lineage determination of granulocyte precursor cells via regulation of the transcription factor GATA-2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Because multicellular organisms often face disturbances in their homeostasis, they evolved complex immune responses to deal with sterile and infectious insults. Like elsewhere in the human body, immune cells differentiate from multipotent precursors. In the immune context, precursors are primarily hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. One of these differentiation programs, called granulopoiesis, leads to the development of granulocytes - basophils, eosinophils and neutrophils. Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes in humans. In homeostatic conditions, up to 2 × 10<sup>11</sup> neutrophils enter the blood stream per day and patrol the host’s body until they sense signs of infection, which triggers them to leave the blood stream and migrate to the inflammatory site where they ensure pathogen removal. An efficient neutrophil response is crucial for human antimicrobial defense and, correspondingly, neutropenia is associated with severe infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klein, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The three best described defense mechanisms of neutrophils are phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogenic microorganisms and subsequent destruction in phagosomes), degranulation (the release of antimicrobial proteins from granules to the extracellular space) and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are chromatin structures studded with antimicrobial proteins derived mostly from neutrophil granules, which can trap pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Papayannopoulos, 2018</xref>). Neutrophils release NETs via various mechanisms, which in most cases lead to neutrophil death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kenny et al., 2017</xref>); thus, NETs are an extreme form of antimicrobial defense, as their release also eliminates the cell casting the NET. Under homeostatic conditions, NET formation occurs in mature, circulating neutrophils and therefore we propose that specific cues during neutrophil differentiation shape their ability to form NETs. It is noteworthy that during systemic inflammation, some neutrophils, called low density granulocytes, display signs of immaturity, but enhanced formation of NETs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Denny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Villanueva et al., 2011</xref>). In inflammatory settings the requirement for full differentiation might therefore be less stringent.</p><p>Neutrophils differentiate from granulocyte-macrophage precursors. The first progenitor with a clear neutrophil lineage preference during granulopoiesis is the promyelocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yvan-Charvet and Ng, 2019</xref>). During maturation, neutrophils acquire a lobulated nuclear shape and produce many of their antimicrobial effector proteins, stored in granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borregaard, 2010</xref>). Granulopoiesis requires balanced activity of various transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yvan-Charvet and Ng, 2019</xref>). The C/EBP family, especially C/EBP-α and –ε, are key regulators of neutrophil differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamanaka et al., 1997</xref>). Other transcription factors can antagonize C/EBP-dependent neutrophil development. For example, expression of GATA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yu et al., 2002</xref>) and GATA-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirasawa et al., 2002</xref>) induce eosinophil, basophil or mast cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiedler and Brunner, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Differentiation programs rely both on transcription factor activation and on epigenetic chromatin alterations. DNA wraps around an octamer of core histones forming a nucleosome. The linker histone H1 binds to nucleosomes and further compacts chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bednar et al., 2017</xref>). There are 11 different H1 subtypes in mice and humans. Five of them (H1.1 – H1.5) are somatic replication-dependent subtypes, two (H1.0 and H1X) are somatic and replication-independent and four (H1oo, H1t, H1T2 and HILS1) are germline-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hergeth and Schneider, 2015</xref>). All H1 subtypes consist of a highly conserved globular domain and two more variable regions: the N- and the C-terminal tails. Individual H1 subtypes are more conserved between species than H1 subtypes are within one species, suggesting that the conservation of different subtypes has functional relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hergeth and Schneider, 2015</xref>). Still, some functions of H1, such as global shaping of chromatin structure, are redundant between subtypes. This is reflected by the fact that mice deficient for one or even two H1 subtypes are viable and fertile without striking morphological abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2003</xref>). However, mice lacking three H1 subtypes die in utero, with total H1 levels reduced to about 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2003</xref>). Appropriate H1 expression is therefore essential for development. Despite some redundancy, H1 subtypes have specific functions. H1 subtypes bind to chromatin with different affinities and knock down of specific H1 subtypes affects gene transcription in distinct ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hendzel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Th'ng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sancho et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The role of H1 and H1 subtypes in immunity is poorly understood. H1 contributes to the silencing of pro-inflammatory cytokines after endotoxin challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El Gazzar et al., 2009</xref>), as well as to the silencing of interferon-stimulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kadota and Nagata, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, mice deficient in H1.0 have fewer dendritic cells, but normal numbers of granulocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes, showing a subtype-specific role for H1 in dendritic cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gabrilovich et al., 2002</xref>). However, to date, no studies have systematically addressed H1 subtype involvement in the maturation and function of human immune cells.</p><p>Here we used the human neutrophil-like cell line, PLB-985, to study neutrophil maturation and function. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen using survival to a NET-inducing stimulus, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), as a readout. Surprisingly, we found that depletion of either H1.2 or H1.4 strongly reduced the differentiation of PLB-985 and thereby their ability to form NETs. Notably, deficiency of the other somatic H1 subtypes, H1.1, H1.3 and H1.5, accelerated PLB-985 maturation. RNA-seq analysis showed that H1.2 and H1.4 deficiency leads to an upregulation of eosinophil genes in PLB-985. Mirroring these results, murine bone marrow stem cells from H1.2/H1.4 double deficient mice shifted their differentiation profile from neutrophil towards eosinophil cell fate, whereas neutrophils in vivo displayed disturbances in ageing markers. We further demonstrate that the subtype-specific function of H1 in neutrophil and eosinophil differentiation depends – at least in part – on the transcription factor GATA-2. We uncovered that, unexpectedly, H1 subtypes affect lineage specification during granulopoiesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PLB-985: a model for neutrophil maturation and function</title><p>We used the human promyelocytic cell line PLB-985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tucker et al., 1987</xref>). PLB-985 differentiate into neutrophil-like cells that resemble primary human neutrophils in various ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pedruzzi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pivot-Pajot et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marin-Esteban et al., 2012</xref>). PLB-985 changed their nuclear morphology and developed granules, though fewer than primary neutrophils, throughout the 7 days of differentiation (referred as d0 to d7 in this report) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Once differentiated, PLB-985 also produced ROS in response to the agonist phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>) and upregulated the surface marker CD11b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Furthermore, differentiated PLB-985 phagocytosed <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a process that could be blocked by the phagocytosis inhibitor cytochalasin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Importantly, PMA potently induced cell death in fully differentiated PLB-985, but not in d0 or d3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). PMA-induced cell death was morphologically similar to NETosis; dying PLB-985 expanded their nuclei and a significant fraction released DNA as shown by SYTOX Green staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

These results suggest a slight disturbance of neutrophil ageing upon H1 deficiency. Interestingly, we also found altered expression of cytokines and chemokines.

These experiments show that H1.2 and H1.4 cooperate to determine the neutrophil-eosinophil cell fate decision in hematopoietic progenitor cells.

We chose d4 because we assumed that cells still expressing GATA could outgrow GATA-deficient cells at later time points.

We propose that in neutrophil precursors, H1 subtypes control the expression or activity of GATA-2, which determines cell fate via transcription of neutrophil or eosinophil-specific genes. Enhanced expression of eosinophil genes – or reduced expression of neutrophil-specific genes – disrupts normal maturation, leading to prolonged proliferation and viability and reduced neutrophil function. Consistent with this, genetic ablation or inhibition of GATA-2, but not GATA-1, rescued the differentiation of H1.2 and H1.4-deficient cells. Interestingly, another study found that overexpression of GATA-2 in murine progenitor cells switched their lineage determination from macrophages to a megakaryocyte state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kitajima et al., 2002</xref>). GATA-2 therefore acts as a key molecule for fate determination of immune cells.</p><p>It is noteworthy that we found evidence of enhanced <italic>GATA1</italic> mRNA expression in bone marrow cells of H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice, but not of <italic>GATA2</italic>. The fold change of <italic>GATA1</italic> in the absence of H1.2 and H1.4 was much higher in PLB-985 than the fold change of <italic>GATA2</italic>. Furthermore, in mice <italic>GATA1</italic> mRNA was higher expressed than <italic>GATA2</italic> mRNA. This could explain why we did not see an upregulation of <italic>GATA2</italic> in vivo. Another explanation could be that <italic>GATA2</italic> upregulation does not occur in lineage negative stem cells, but during the promyelocyte to neutrophil differentiation, while the regulation of <italic>GATA1</italic> is more robust. Enforced expression of both GATA-1 and GATA-2 can induce eosinophil differentiation of human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirasawa et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, another study in murine cells showed that the eosinophil-promoting effect of GATA-2 depends strongly on the presence of C/EBP-α. Enforced expression of GATA-2 drove C/EBP-α expressing precursor cells into the eosinophil lineage. However, in the absence of C/EBP-α, overexpression of GATA-2 induced mast cell and basophil development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iwasaki et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, not only the expression levels of hematopoietic transcription factors, but also the order of their expression is crucial for lineage determination. PLB-985 express C/EBP-α in the undifferentiated state, and enhanced expression of GATA-2 can therefore explain the upregulation of eosinophil markers we found in our experiments using this cell line.</p><p>Importantly, we observed a preference for eosinophil development in blood and in hematopoietic stem cells isolated from the bone marrow of H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice. This demonstrates that the bias towards the eosinophilic lineage also exists in vivo. However, adult H1.2/H1.4-deficient animals had normal numbers of circulating neutrophils, indicating that neutrophil differentiation is compensated. Interestingly the turnover rate or the longevity of neutrophils seemed to be affected in these mice, since we found reduced amounts of young neutrophils in H1.2/H1.4-deficient animals. We also found enhanced granularity and longevity of neutrophils isolated from H1.2/H1.4-deficient animals. These two findings, reduced levels of CD62L (a marker of young neutrophils) and enhanced granularity, are not consistent with the paradigm of young neutrophils being more granular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adrover et al., 2020</xref>). Our data therefore point to a dysregulation of neutrophil behavior and/or turnover. Interestingly, however, the protein levels of H1.2 and H1.4 changed in human neutrophils during the time of day, suggesting that linker histone levels might affect neutrophil ageing in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adrover et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Neutropenia in peripheral tissues triggers de novo production of neutrophils in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stark et al., 2005</xref>), demonstrating that granulopoiesis in vivo is regulated by feedback loops. This suggests that initial neutrophil deficiency in adult H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice is compensated by a different cytokine milieu. In line with this, we found altered expression of various cytokines and chemokines, thus suggesting a dysregulated turnover or production of neutrophils in H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice. It is noteworthy that we did not detect differences in the major cytokine driving neutrophil differentiation, G-CSF. Casein-induced peritonitis upregulated G-CSF in both wt and H1.2/H1.4-deficient animals. The serum levels of G-CSF during homeostasis were very low and probably under the detection limit of our ELISA, and, if there are minor differences in G-CSF levels, we were not able to measure them. We did, however, detect differences in the neutrophil-recruiting chemokine CXCL1 and in the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17, which could both also affect neutrophil turnover and behavior.</p><p>Interestingly, in human breast cancer cells, combined loss of H1.2 and H1.4 leads to an upregulation of an interferon signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Izquierdo-Bouldstridge et al., 2017</xref>). Although we did not observe an obvious interferon signature in H1.2 or H1.4-deficient PLB-985, it is possible that in H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice some cell types contribute to immune cell differentiation via interferon-stimulated genes.</p><p>H1 can act in redundant and subtype-specific ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hergeth and Schneider, 2015</xref>). Mice lacking one or two H1 subtypes are viable and fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2003</xref>). Analogously, PLB-985 deficient in any of the five H1 subtypes that we disrupted were viable and did not show growth defects. This is in contrast to another study, where shRNA-mediated knock down of H1.2 and H1.4 reduced cell growth and viability in various non-immune cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sancho et al., 2008</xref>). We found that loss of H1.2 and H1.4, in the context of neutrophil differentiation, enhanced viability, demonstrating cell type specific effects of H1 subtypes.</p><p>H1 has long been considered a general repressor of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schlissel and Brown, 1984</xref>). Accordingly, a study in human cells found that genomic regions associated with active transcription were devoid of H1 subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Izzo et al., 2013</xref>). However, murine embryonic stem cells that are triple-deficient in H1.2, H1.3 and H1.4 show a surprisingly low number of only 38 differentially expressed genes when compared to wild type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2005</xref>). Our data show that loss of H1 subtypes in more differentiated cells affects the expression of many genes with clear functional consequences. We postulate that only a fraction of differentially expressed genes in PLB-985 is directly regulated by H1 subtypes. The enhanced expression of lineage-determining transcription factors, such as GATA-2, leads to further changes in the transcriptome and affects cell differentiation.</p><p>An important open question is: how do H1 subtypes control expression of GATA-2? It is possible that H1 subtypes directly occupy the promoter or enhancer elements of <italic>GATA2</italic> and silence its expression. H1 subtype-specific binding to genomic regions has, for example, been shown for human H1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, H1.5 targeted over 20-fold more regions in differentiated human lung fibroblasts than in embryonic stem cells and H1.5 binding led to chromatin compaction and gene silencing. It is therefore tempting to speculate that similar mechanisms are at play during neutrophil development. In addition to a direct repressive effect of H1.5, its binding to chromatin was also associated with an enrichment of demethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2012</xref>). H3K9me2 is a posttranslational modification of a core histone that is associated with a repressive chromatin state. H1 subtypes are therefore likely to regulate transcription via epigenetic marks on core histones. Furthermore, H1 subtypes themselves are posttranslationally modified in a subtype-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hergeth and Schneider, 2015</xref>). Although less is known about H1 modifications than about core histones, it is likely that such modifications can determine subtype-specific protein-protein interactions, chromatin binding properties or other features that subsequently cause transcriptional changes.</p><p>It is puzzling that vertebrates express so many different H1 subtypes. Although they are able to compensate each other in ‘extreme’ situations, such as the loss of one or even two subtypes in a whole organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2003</xref>), they may also have more subtle and specific functions. This study contributes to our understanding of how different H1 subtypes initiate distinct transcriptional programs. Importantly, these programs appear to be evolutionarily conserved, since we found similar responses in human and murine cells.</p><p>Our observations in the human cell line PLB-985 and murine stem cells ex vivo correlate with an increase in the number of circulating eosinophils in H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice in vivo. We also detected a disturbed cytokine milieu and a dysregulation of neutrophil ageing markers, granularity and longevity in H1.2/H1.4-deficient animals, suggesting altered neutrophil turnover. This would be in line with altered expression levels of H1.4 and H1.2 during human neutrophil ageing in circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adrover et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the number of neutrophils in the bone marrow and in circulation in H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice was normal. Moreover, eosinophil numbers in bone marrow were the same between genotypes. Taking all these observations and limitations together, we propose that H1 subtype regulation in vivo is subject to compensatory mechanisms that eventually adjust the levels of neutrophils. Indeed, it is expected that deletion of 2 out of 5 H1 subtypes, that probably affect the epigenetic regulation of development, are subject to systemic adjustments. Further in vivo work, ideally also aimed at investigating possible species differences between human and mouse, will likely elucidate the relevance of H1 deficiency on granulopoiesis and neutrophil turnover in vivo during homeostasis and inflammation.</p><p>In summary, we identified novel and opposing functions for specific H1 subtypes in granulopoiesis. H1 subtypes affect the lineage determination between neutrophils and eosinophils. We speculate that inappropriate expression of H1 subtypes in the hematopoietic compartment shapes pathologies with neutrophil or eosinophil involvement, such as asthma. Our findings suggest that linker histones represent another layer of complexity to the fascinating process of immune cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>PLB-985 were kindly provided by Prof. Mary Dinauer, Washington University School of Medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhen et al., 1993</xref>).

They found that deletion of linker histones H1.2 and/or H1.4 reduced the differentiation of the cells towards a neutrophilic phenotype. Further experiments revealed that the absence of H1.2/H1.4 led to skewing of the cells towards GATA2-mediated differentiation to eosinophilic/basophilic lineages. Analysis of H1.2/H1.4 double knockout hematopoietic stem cells revealed that their in vitro differentiation was skewed towards eosinophils rather than neutrophils.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers recognized interest and novelty in this study, describing a novel role for histone H1 subtypes in regulating neutrophil-lineage specification and differentiation in an in vitro differentiation setting. However, a major concern raised both at the first review and post-review by both reviewers as well as a major concern for the editor lies in the translation into a in vivo setting in mouse models or human cells. Indeed, no reduction in the circulating neutrophil counts in H1.2/H1.4 double knockout mice was observed, reducing the biological significance of the work beyond its technical novelty and could even suggest artifactual findings of the in vitro setting developed by the authors. The authors should perform an in depth analysis of bone marrow and blood levels (not percentage) of neutrophils in steady state and inflammation (for example repopulation after bone marrow transplant or marrow proliferating cell ablation or in a model of emergency granulopoiesis).</p><p>As previously mentioned, neutrophil lineage specification is determined by transcription factors such as CEBP-α or – ε. How H1.2 and H1.4 function? Are CEBP-α or – ε levels also altered in cells deficient for H1.2 and H1.4 or is it only dependent of GATA-2? Do cells deficient for H1.2 and H1.4 exhibit phenotypic and functional characteristics similar to eosinophils? Are these proteins expressed at low levels in primary eosinophils? Is GATA-2 upregulated in the bone marrow of mice deficient for H1.2 and H1.4?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Linker histone H1.2 and H1.4 affect the neutrophil lineage determination&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The essential point of discussion was the need to revise the analysis of age-young neutrophils based on CD62L expression (second question) to potentially support your hypothesis, plus additional major textual revisions. About the major textual revisions, we all recognized the value of the CRISPR screen in cell from the neutrophil-lineage which is a substantial achievement and the attempt to have made effort to add more in vivo relevance. However, the reviewers made the point that those experiments do not fit as logically into the manuscript as the original results and that the in vivo results are still confusing. Hence, we would also request to clarify the presentation and interpretation of the new data, with a more thorough and objective discussion on the fact that the major observation was made on a neutrophil cell line, that the in vivo confirmation needs further work and more discussion for the discrepancies found in this study (increase in circulating eosinophils but not with changes in neutrophil numbers, no differences in G-CSF level, lower amount of young neutrophils in the bone marrow…).</p><p>Please see below the comments that were raised in more details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this revision, Sollberger and colleagues provide new data to address the in vivo importance of histone H1 during neutrophil-lineage specification and differentiation by analyzing in depth granulopoiesis in H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice during homeostasis and inflammation. Interestingly, in homeostasis -not during casein-induced peritonitis- absolute numbers of eosinophils are increased in blood of mutant mice, which is agreement with the in vitro data. However, as observed in the initial manuscript, neutrophil absolute numbers are not affected (or even increased) both under steady state and during inflammation. The authors claim that altered cytokine profile involved in granulopoiesis (IL-17a) and neutrophil mobilization (CXCL1) and changes in neutrophil maturation (reduced number of young neutrophils and increased granularity) may explain these results observed in the H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice.</p><p>For the reviewer these statements are not clear:</p><p>- First, no changes in G-CSF are found which could be associated to increase granulopoiesis that could compensate neutrophil numbers.</p><p>- Second, a lack of neutrophils due to altered granulopoiesis in H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice should generate de novo production of neutrophils, hence observing increased levels of young neutrophils in the bone marrow, not decreasing.</p><p>Maybe I misunderstood but it is not clear to me how Figure 5—figure supplement 2B and 2C can be possible. If absolute numbers of neutrophils (2A) are not altered and the percentage of CD62l+ is not affected either, how in 2C are decreased. This concern also applies to graphs 2D-F. How CD62L percentage was calculated? The authors should show the plots of these results (not only the gating strategy).</p><p>- According to Casanova-Acebes et al., (2013), aged neutrophils exhibit low granularity and size. If lower numbers of young neutrophils are found and hence more aged are present, a decreased in SSC and FSC should be seen. Not an increase.</p><p>- How are the numbers of eosinophils in the bone marrow? This result is of key importance and it is not shown.</p><p>- How are the levels of eosinophils in blood and bone marrow after casein treatment?</p><p>I agree with the authors that many confounding factors can influence the results in the mutant mice but still such results are key for the message of the paper. Based on the observed results, no strong effect of H1 subtypes is observed on neutrophil differentiation in homeostasis and during inflammation. Maybe such difference could have been seen during marrow regeneration (i.e. after 5-fluorouracil treatment).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting work on a CRISPR screen on neutrophil-like cell lines identifying a role for linker histones on neutrophil differentiation.</p><p>The authors have appropriately addressed the reviewers' and the editor's questions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52563.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers recognized interest and novelty in this study, describing a novel role for histone H1 subtypes in regulating neutrophil-lineage specification and differentiation in an in vitro differentiation setting.

We analysed wild type and H1.2/H1.4-deficient animals during steady state and after Casein injection into the peritoneal cavity, which induces a peritonitis and leads to the influx of neutrophils (Amulic et al., 2017). In the new version of the manuscript, as suggested, we include counts of leukocytes rather than percentage (new Figure 5B,C, new Figure 5—figure supplement 2, Figure 5—figure supplement 3, Figure 5—figure supplement 4). We showed, as detailed below, two main changes in mice deficient in H1.2/H1.4; the dysregulation of cytokine/chemokine and a change in neutrophil ageing markers and granularity.</p><p>Importantly, we also found an increased number of circulating eosinophils at steady state in H1.2/H1.4-deficient animals (new Figure 5C). This is in line with our findings in human cells and shows that the loss of H1.2 and H1.4 affects the neutrophil/eosinophil lineage determination in vivo.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that both during steady state and upon casein injection, H1.2/H1/4-deficient mice produced altered amounts of cytokines and chemokines compared to wild type animals (new Figure 5—figure supplement 4H-L). Most prominently, H1.2/H1.4-deficient bone marrow cells transcribed less IL-6 and more CXCL1, the latter is an important neutrophil chemokine (new Figure 5 —figure supplement 4H,I). We also found this upregulation of CXCL1 on the protein level in serum (new Figure 5—figure supplement 4J) and we further found enhanced production of IL-17 in the serum of casein-injected H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice compared to wild type animals (new Figure 5—figure supplement 4K). IL-17 is part of a feed forward loop leading to granulopoiesis (Stark et al., 2005) via the production of G-CSF, though we did not detect altered G-CSF levels in H1.2/H1.4-deficient animals (new Figure 5—figure supplement 4L). Taken together, our results indicate that granulopoiesis in H1-deficient animals is altered due to changes in cytokines and chemokines.</p><p>We further analysed the neutrophil population in H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice using a second panel of surface marker antibodies by flow cytometry (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). The combined use of CD62L and CXCR4 allows the analysis of young vs aged neutrophils (Adrover et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2015) and we found reduced numbers of young neutrophils in the bone marrow of H1.2/H1.4-deficient animals (new Figure 5—figure supplement 4A-C) suggesting compensatory effects regulating neutrophil turnover in these mice.</p><p>Lastly, when we incubated bone marrow cells overnight in the presence or absence of G-CSF, we found that G-CSF induced increased survival in H1.2/H1.4-deficient cells compared to wild type cells (new Figure 5—figure supplement 5A). The H1-deficient bone marrow cells also were more granular than wild type cells after overnight incubation (new Figure 5—figure supplement 5B), indicating that the spontaneous degranulation is affected. Indeed, we also found H1.2/H1.4-deficient bone marrow neutrophils to be more granular than wild type cells (new Figure 5—figure supplement 5C,D). This would again be in line with a different ageing phenotype, since a recent publication showed spontaneous degranulation of neutrophils upon ageing (Adrover et al., 2020).</p><p>Taken together, we provide evidence of cytokine/chemokine dysregulation in H1-deficient mice, as well as a change in neutrophil ageing markers and granularity. We therefore think that our analysis of lineage negative stem cells isolated from bone marrow is an appropriate way of analysing the intrinsic differentiation capacity of H1-deficient cells in the absence of confounding factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As previously mentioned, neutrophil lineage specification is determined by transcription factors such as CEBP-α or – ε. How H1.2 and H1.4 function? Are CEBP-α or – ε levels also altered in cells deficient for H1.2 and H1.4 or is it only dependent of GATA-2? Do cells deficient for H1.2 and H1.4 exhibit phenotypic and functional characteristics similar to eosinophils? Are these proteins expressed at low levels in primary eosinophils? Is GATA-2 upregulated in the bone marrow of mice deficient for H1.2 and H1.4?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers point that other transcription factors might also affect neutrophil vs eosinophil differentiation in our system, is, of course, interesting. Indeed, we found in our RNA-seq experiment that C/EBP-α levels are downregulated in PLB-985 deficient for H1.2 or H1.4 at the onset of differentiation (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2). In cells deficient for H1.1, H1.3 and H1.5 expression of C/EBP-α was enhanced at the onset of differentiation, which is in line with the fact that these cells showed accelerated maturation (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We subsequently analysed the expression of other C/EBP family transcription factors. C/EBP-α expression was enhanced in H1.2- and H1.4-deficient cells at later time points of differentiation, but not at early time points. We also found enhanced expression of other C/EBP family members, most prominently an upregulation of C/EBP-α and C/EBP-α in clones deficient for H1.1, H1.3 and H1.5 (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We therefore conclude that, besides GATA-1 and GATA-2, other transcription factors are differentially regulated.</p><p>To assess the expression levels of H1 subtypes in human primary eosinophils, we isolated RNA from these cells and performed qRT-PCR experiments. Surprisingly, expression levels of H1.2 and H1.4 were very high in primary eosinophils, much higher than in any other cell type we studied (new Figure 4—figure supplement 3E). This indicates that H1.2 and H1.4 levels are indeed crucial for adequate eosinophil differentiation. We assume that too high as well as too low expression of these subtypes affect the lineage determination of neutrophils and eosinophils.</p><p>When we analysed GATA expression in the bone marrow of H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice, we found that these animals showed enhanced expression of GATA-1, in line with what we found in PLB-985 (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). GATA-2 expression was neither changed in RNA isolated from total bone marrow nor in lineage negative stem cell RNA isolations (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1d), which could be due to the altered cytokine milieu in vivo. We also noted that in mice expression of GATA-1 was higher than of GATA-2 (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D), opposite to what we had found in human cells. It could therefore be that the loss of H1.2 and H1.4 in mice more readily affects the higher expressed GATA-1.</p><p>Taken together, we provide evidence that, besides GATA transcription factors, C/EBP family transcription factors are also dysregulated in H1-deficient cells in human (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2) and mouse (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1E) and we show an effect of H1.2 and H1.4 deficiency on GATA-1 in vivo.</p><p>Regarding the question whether PLB-985 become eosinophils in the absence of H1.2 or H1.4, we believe that in PLB-985 cells, the loss of H1.2 or H1.4 affects eosinophil markers primarily on a transcriptional level, since H1.2- and H1.4-deficient clones remained viable and the cells divided at late stages of differentiation (Figure 3C-F). We did, however, analyse the morphology and function of PLB-985 to assess whether they became functional eosinophils. We did not observe specific eosinophil morphology of H1.2- or H1.4-deficient PLB-985 cells by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (new Figure 4—figure supplement 3A). However, when we looked at eosinophil markers on the protein level, we did observe an increase in the expression of Siglec-8 on the surface of (new Figure 4—figure supplement 3B) H1.2- or H1.4-deficient cells and we also found enhanced expression of the eosinophil protein galectin-10/CLC (new Figure 4—figure supplement 3C,D). We therefore conclude that deficiency of H1.2 or H1.4 also induces upregulation of eosinophil proteins, without affecting the overall morphology of PLB-985.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The essential point of discussion was the need to revise the analysis of age-young neutrophils based on CD62L expression (second question) to potentially support your hypothesis, plus additional major textual revisions. About the major textual revisions, we all recognized the value of the CRISPR screen in cell from the neutrophil-lineage which is a substantial achievement and the attempt to have made effort to add more in vivo relevance. However, the reviewers made the point that those experiments do not fit as logically into the manuscript as the original results and that the in vivo results are still confusing. Hence, we would also request to clarify the presentation and interpretation of the new data, with a more thorough and objective discussion on the fact that the major observation was made on a neutrophil cell line, that the in vivo confirmation needs further work and more discussion for the discrepancies found in this study (increase in circulating eosinophils but not with changes in neutrophil numbers, no differences in G-CSF level, lower amount of young neutrophils in the bone marrow…).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the apparent lack of clarity. We present our in vivo data in a more understandable way. Specifically, we rearranged Figure 5—figure supplement 4, Figure 5—figure supplement 5 to more figure panels with a better panel structure (new Figure 5—figure supplement 4, Figure 5—figure supplement 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 6, Figure 5—figure supplement 7). Moreover, we discuss the limitations of our study (Discussion section) and clearly state that more work will have to be done regarding the in vivo relevance of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please see below the comments that were raised in more details.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this revision, Sollberger and colleagues provide new data to address the in vivo importance of histone H1 during neutrophil-lineage specification and differentiation by analyzing in depth granulopoiesis in H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice during homeostasis and inflammation. Interestingly, in homeostasis -not during casein-induced peritonitis- absolute numbers of eosinophils are increased in blood of mutant mice, which is agreement with the in vitro data. However, as observed in the initial manuscript, neutrophil absolute numbers are not affected (or even increased) both under steady state and during inflammation. The authors claim that altered cytokine profile involved in granulopoiesis (IL-17a) and neutrophil mobilization (CXCL1) and changes in neutrophil maturation (reduced number of young neutrophils and increased granularity) may explain these results observed in the H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice.</p><p>For the reviewer these statements are not clear:</p><p>- First, no changes in G-CSF are found which could be associated to increase granulopoiesis that could compensate neutrophil numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging our new in vivo work. As the reviewer correctly points out, we did not detect changes in G-CSF (new Figure 5—figure supplement 6E) in homeostatic conditions or after injection of casein.</p><p>The levels of G-CSF in homeostatic conditions were very low. This means that, in homeostatic conditions, we are probably at the detection limit of the ELISA and cannot detect subtle differences if they exist. Upon an inflammatory stimulus, Casein, we detected G-CSF in circulation, but there were no differences between wild type and H1.2/H1.4 null mice.</p><p>It is relevant to point out that, while G-CSF is a major inducer of granulopoieses, this process is likely affected by other cytokines. Indeed, we observed changes in CXCL1 and IL17. We discuss the levels of G-CSF in H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice more critically in our revised manuscript on Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Second, a lack of neutrophils due to altered granulopoiesis in H1.2/H1.4-deficient mice should generate de novo production of neutrophils, hence observing increased levels of young neutrophils in the bone marrow, not decreasing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. However, we did see decreased levels of young (CD62L positive, CXCR4 negative) neutrophils (Figure 5—figure supplement 4C, new Figure 5—figure supplement 5). We discuss these findings (subsection “Enhanced eosinophil differentiation of H1.2/H1.4-deficient hematopoietic stem cells”, Discussion section) and acknowledge that they do not fit with the expected paradigm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Maybe I misunderstood but it is not clear to me how Figure 5—figure supplement 2B and 2C can be possible. If absolute numbers of neutrophils (2A) are not altered and the percentage of CD62l+ is not affected either, how in 2C are decreased. This concern also applies to graphs 2D-F. How CD62L percentage was calculated? The authors should show the plots of these results (not only the gating strategy).</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the reviewer refers to Figure 5—figure supplement 4B and 4C. We apologize for the unclear plotting, 4B shows CD62L positive cells, whereas 4c shows CD62L positive and CXCR4 negative cells. We strongly believe that an inclusion of all individual flow cytometry plots to a supplementary figure (with 48 plots for Figure 5—figure supplement 4A-F alone) will make it impossible to understand the figure panels. Therefore, we rearranged our plots and we now include histograms of CD62L and CXCR4 expression where we overlay all animals as shown in our new Figure 5—figure supplement 5B,C,E,F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- According to Casanova-Acebes et al., (2013), aged neutrophils exhibit low granularity and size. If lower numbers of young neutrophils are found and hence more aged are present, a decreased in SSC and FSC should be seen. Not an increase.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right to point out that ageing of neutrophils leads to reduces granularity, as also shown in 2020 by the same group (Adrover et al.,). Interestingly, the 2020 study by Adrover et al., also found changes of H1.2 and H1.4 on protein level as neutrophils aged. We cite this recent study and rephrase our wording in the manuscript (Discussion section). The fact that we find more neutrophils with ageing markers, but an enhanced survival and granularity after overnight incubation (new Figure 5—figure supplement 7) does not point towards an increase in ageing, but to a dysregulation of neutrophil behaviour, which we discuss in subsection “Enhanced eosinophil differentiation of H1.2/H1.4-deficient hematopoietic stem cells” and the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How are the numbers of eosinophils in the bone marrow? This result is of key importance and it is not shown.</p><p>- How are the levels of eosinophils in blood and bone marrow after casein treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>We include eosinophil numbers in blood and bone marrow, during homeostasis and upon casein injection in our revised manuscript (new Figure 5—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I agree with the authors that many confounding factors can influence the results in the mutant mice but still such results are key for the message of the paper. Based on the observed results, no strong effect of H1 subtypes is observed on neutrophil differentiation in homeostasis and during inflammation. Maybe such difference could have been seen during marrow regeneration (i.e. after 5-fluorouracil treatment).</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss our in vivo results more critically in the new version of the manuscript (Discussion section). The phenotypes we observed, as expected, are not strong. This is probably due to two reasons: first, we used animals deficient for, most likely, epigenetic modifiers rather than key transcription factors and, second, granulopoiesis is an important process that is regulated by feedback loops and via different cytokines. Another, third, reason could be that the compensatory effects are different or stronger upon deletion of two H1 subtypes in mouse versus the PLB-985, which are deficient for only one H1 subtype.</p></body></sub-article></article>
