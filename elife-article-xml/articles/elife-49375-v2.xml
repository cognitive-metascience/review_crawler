proteins that regulate transcription initiation by binding directly to RNA polymerase (RNAP) rather than to promoter DNA. Effects of TraR mimic the combined effects of DksA and its cofactor ppGpp, but the structural basis for regulation by these factors remains unclear. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNAP, with or without TraR, and of an RNAP-promoter complex. TraR binding induced RNAP conformational changes not seen in previous crystallographic analyses, and a quantitative analysis revealed TraR-induced changes in RNAP conformational heterogeneity. These changes involve mobile regions of RNAP affecting promoter DNA interactions, including the βlobe, the clamp, the bridge helix, and several lineage-specific insertions. Using mutational approaches, we show that these structural changes, as well as effects on σ<sup>70</sup> region 1.1, are critical for transcription activation or inhibition, depending on the kinetic features of regulated promoters.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells need to make proteins in order to survive. To make a protein, a cell first needs to take the information from a gene coded in its DNA and copy it into a template made of a different molecule called RNA via a process called transcription. Not all genes are transcribed or expressed at the same time or the same rate, because a cell needs different proteins depending on its environment. The molecules that regulate when each gene is transcribed are called transcription factors.</p><p>When the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is starved for the building blocks it needs to make proteins, it changes the expression of almost one quarter of its genes within 5 minutes. This broad response requires two transcription factors, ppGpp and DksA. Unlike most transcription factors, these two molecules bind directly to the enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA, the RNA polymerase, but they do not bind to DNA.</p><p>Another transcription factor called TraR can mimic the combined effects of ppGpp and DksA on transcription, changing the conformation of RNA polymerase in the same way. Now, Chen et al. have used a high-resolution imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the details of how the structure of RNA polymerase changes in response to TraR binding, and by analogy, in response to ppGpp and DksA.</p><p>The experiments showed that TraR interacts with regions of RNA polymerase that move when the protein binds DNA. These interactions can either help or hinder the start of transcription depending on which DNA sequence the RNA polymerase binds. Using the structures obtained via cryo-electron microscopy as guides, Chen et al. mutated each of the mobile parts of RNA polymerase individually to determine which interactions with TraR were necessary to change gene expression.</p><p>These results shed light on a fundamental process in all living cells, the initiation of transcription, and how it changes in response to the cell's nutritional environment. This may help explain how different cells regulate gene expression and may also lead to the development of new antibiotics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>transcription initiation</kwd><kwd>TraR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM114450</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM37048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gourse</surname><given-names>Richard L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM118130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darst</surname><given-names>Seth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-electron microscopy structures, combined with biochemical experiments, show how the <italic>E. coli</italic> F element-encoded TraR protein regulates transcription initiation by altering RNA polymerase conformation and conformational heterogeneity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription initiation is a major control point for gene expression. In bacteria, a single RNA polymerase (RNAP) performs all transcription. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>Eco</italic>), the essential primary σ factor, σ<sup>70</sup>, binds to RNAP to form the σ<sup>70</sup>-holoenzyme (Eσ<sup>70</sup>) that is capable of recognizing and initiating at promoters for most genes. Upon locating the promoter, Eσ<sup>70</sup> melts a ~ 13 bp segment of DNA to form the open promoter complex (RPo) in which the DNA template strand (t-strand) is loaded into the RNAP active site, exposing the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zuo and Steitz, 2015</xref>). A key feature of the RPo formation pathway is that it is a multi-step process, with the RNAP-promoter complex passing through multiple intermediates before the final, transcription competent RPo is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hubin et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ruff et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saecker et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>A variety of transcription factors bind to the promoter DNA and/or to RNAP directly to regulate initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Browning and Busby, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haugen et al., 2008</xref>). Bacterial RNAP-binding factors, encoded by the chromosome or by bacteriophage or extrachromosomal elements, interact with different regions of the enzyme to regulate its functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haugen et al., 2008</xref>). One such factor is ppGpp, a modified nucleotide that functions together with the RNAP-binding protein DksA in <italic>Eco</italic> to reprogram bacterial metabolism in response to nutritional stresses during the so-called stringent response. Following amino acid starvation, ppGpp is synthesized by the RelA factor in response to uncharged tRNAs in the ribosomal A site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cashel and Gallant, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ryals et al., 1982</xref>). Together, ppGpp and DksA alter the expression of as many as 750 genes within 5 min of ppGpp induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paul et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sanchez-Vazquez et al., 2019</xref>), inhibiting, for example, promoters responsible for ribosome biogenesis and activating promoters responsible for amino acid synthesis.</p><p>The overall RNAP structure is reminiscent of a crab claw, with one pincer comprising primarily the β’ subunit, and the other primarily the β subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). Between the two pincers is a large cleft that contains the active site. In Eσ<sup>70</sup> without nucleic acids, this channel is occupied by the σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> domain which is ejected upon entry of the downstream duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mekler et al., 2002</xref>). The Bridge Helix (BH) bridges the two pincers across the cleft, separating the cleft into the main channel, where σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> or nucleic acids reside, and the secondary channel, where NTPs enter the RNAP active site.</p><p>DksA binds in the RNAP secondary channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lennon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molodtsov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perederina et al., 2004</xref>). ppGpp binds directly to RNAP at two binding sites: site 1, located at the interface of the β′ and ω subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ross et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zuo et al., 2013</xref>), and site 2, located at the interface of β′ and DksA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molodtsov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ross et al., 2016</xref>). The ppGpp bound at site one inhibits transcription ~2 fold under conditions where the effects of ppGpp bound at both sites together with DksA are as much as 20-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paul et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ross et al., 2016</xref>). By contrast, ppGpp/DksA at site two has a larger effect on inhibition and is necessary and sufficient for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ross et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>TraR is a distant homolog of DksA. Although only half the length of DksA, TraR regulates <italic>Eco</italic> transcription by binding to the RNAP secondary channel and mimicking the combined effects of ppGpp and DksA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017</xref>). TraR is encoded by the conjugative F plasmid and is expressed from the pY promoter as part of the major <italic>tra</italic> operon transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frost et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maneewannakul and Ippen-Ihler, 1993</xref>). Like DksA, TraR inhibits Eσ<sup>70</sup>-dependent transcription from ribosomal RNA promoters (e.g. <italic>rrnB</italic> P1) and ribosomal protein promoters (e.g. <italic>rpsT</italic> P2, expressing S20), and activates amino acid biosynthesis and transport promoters (e.g. p<italic>thrABC,</italic> p<italic>hisG,</italic> p<italic>argI,</italic> p<italic>livJ</italic>) in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017</xref>). The affinity of TraR for RNAP is only slightly higher than that of DksA, yet its effects on promoters negatively regulated by ppGpp/DksA in vitro are as large or larger than those of ppGpp/DksA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017</xref>). The effects of TraR on promoters positively regulated by ppGpp/DksA are also independent of ppGpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Models for ppGpp/DksA and TraR binding to RNAP have been proposed based on biochemical and genetic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parshin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ross et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ross et al., 2016</xref>). Crystal structures of ppGpp/DksA/RNAP and TraR/RNAP confirmed the general features of these models and provided additional detail about their interactions with RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molodtsov et al., 2018</xref>), but did not reveal the mechanism of inhibition or activation, in large part because of crystal packing constraints on the movement of mobile regions of the complex. Thus, the structural basis for the effects of ppGpp/DksA or TraR on transcription has remained elusive.</p><p>To help understand TraR regulation and principles of the regulation of transcription initiation in general, we used single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to examine structures of Eσ<sup>70</sup> alone, Eσ<sup>70</sup> bound to TraR (TraR-Eσ<sup>70</sup>), and Eσ<sup>70</sup> bound to a promoter inhibited by TraR [<italic>rpsT</italic> P2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017</xref>]. Cryo-EM allows the visualization of multiple discrete conformational states populated in solution and in the absence of crystal packing constraints. Furthermore, new software tools allow for the analysis of continuous distributions of conformational heterogeneity in the cryo-EM data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakane et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The TraR-Eσ<sup>70</sup> structures show TraR binding in the secondary channel of the RNAP, consistent with the TraR-Eσ<sup>70</sup> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017</xref>) and crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molodtsov et al., 2018</xref>). However, the cryo-EM structures reveal major TraR-induced changes to the RNAP conformation that were not evident in the crystal structure due to crystal packing constraints. Structural analyses generated mechanistic hypotheses for TraR function in both activation and inhibition of transcription that were then tested biochemically. Based on the combined structural and functional analyses, we propose a model in which TraR accelerates multiple steps along the RPo formation pathway and at the same time modulates the relative stability of intermediates in the pathway. Whether a promoter is activated or inhibited by TraR is determined by the intrinsic kinetic properties of the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galburt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haugen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paul et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cryo-EM structures of TraR-Eσ<sup>70</sup>, Eσ<sup>70</sup>, and <italic>rpsT</italic> P2 RPo</title><p>We used single-particle cryo-EM to examine the structure of the <italic>Eco</italic> TraR-Eσ<sup>70</sup> complex in the absence of crystal packing interactions that could restrict conformational states of the complex.

To test this hypothesis, we investigated TraR function on an inhibited (<italic>rrnB</italic> P1) and an activated (<italic>thrABC</italic>) promoter with holoenzyme lacking σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> (EΔ1.1σ<sup>70</sup>).</p><p>Eσ<sup>70</sup> exhibited weak transcription from the <italic>thrABC</italic> promoter in the absence of TraR (referred to here as basal transcription), and transcription from this promoter was stimulated about ~4 fold in the presence of TraR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). EΔ1.1σ<sup>70</sup> exhibited a striking increase in basal transcription activity from this promoter (~32 fold) compared to WT-Eσ<sup>70</sup> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Only a small further increase in transcription was observed upon the addition of TraR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results suggest that σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> is an obstacle to promoter DNA entering the RNAP channel and that TraR partially overcomes this barrier. In contrast to deletion of region σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub>, which almost entirely bypassed the requirement for TraR, rotation of the βlobe-Si1 did not weaken σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub>-RNAP contacts sufficiently to release σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Rather, we propose that βlobe-Si1 rotation facilitated the competition between promoter DNA and σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> during RPo formation. Our results suggest that TraR-activated promoters are defined, in part, by being limited at the σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> ejection step, but that the system has evolved to allow activation of WT-RNAP to a level appropriate for the biological need for the gene products, not the maximum level that could be achieved by full ejection of σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub>.</p><p>βSi1 was also required for inhibition of <italic>rpsT</italic> P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and <italic>rrnB</italic> P1 transcription by TraR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017</xref>). However, in contrast to the effect of EΔ1.1σ<sup>70</sup> on activated promoters, deletion of σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> had little effect on basal transcription from the TraR-inhibited <italic>rrnB</italic> P1 promoter; inhibition of <italic>rrnB</italic> P1 by TraR with EΔ1.1σ<sup>70</sup> was only slightly defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Thus, in contrast to the effects of Si1 on activation by TraR, we suggest that the effect of TraR on inhibition of transcription involves the βlobe-Si1 domains but this is not mediated by σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> (see Discussion). We propose that TraR-mediated stimulation of σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> release still occurs at inhibited promoters like <italic>rrnB</italic> P1 and <italic>rpsT</italic> P2, but this has little effect on transcription because these promoters are limited by their unstable RPo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barker et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In summary, deletion of σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> has a major effect on basal transcription of an activated promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) but only a minor effect on an inhibited promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

Previous data showed that TraR or its homolog DksA (in conjunction with ppGpp) enhance the transcription output from activated promoters relative to that with RNAP alone (i.e., in the absence of factor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, kinetic analyses demonstrated that the TraR homolog ppGpp/DksA enhances the rate and amount of RPo formation at an activated promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paul et al., 2005</xref>) primarily by increasing the rates of step(s) subsequent to RNAP binding to the promoter.</p><p>Here we show that in the absence of TraR, RNAP with a deletion of σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> displayed greatly increased promoter activity on the <italic>thrABC</italic> promoter relative to the activity with WT RNAP (32-fold increase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that the presence of σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> in the RNAP channel presents a major barrier to the formation of RPo on activated promoters. This large effect on promoter activity was not observed with <italic>rrnB</italic> P1, an inhibited promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results are consistent with previous reports that deletion of σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> had different effects on different promoters, increasing RPo at some promoters but not at others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ruff et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hook-Barnard and Hinton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vuthoori et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>We suggest that σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> poses the most significant barrier to RPo formation at activated promoters, but not the only one, since addition of TraR to RNAP lacking σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> resulted in a small TraR-dependent increase in transcription of the <italic>thrABC</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We suggest that this small increase could result from the restriction of clamp motion by TraR (described in the Results section) at a step prior to σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> ejection, perhaps transcription bubble nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feklistov et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We propose that TraR binding allosterically alters and weakens σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> interactions in the RNAP channel by causing a large (~18°) rotation of the βlobe-Si1 module that forms one wall of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In addition, the interaction of TraR<sub>G</sub> with the SBHMa motif of Si3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) may also contribute to weakening of σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> interactions with the main channel, because Si3 is inserted within the trigger loop (TL) and its interactions with TraR could perturb interactions of the TL/BH/Switch one region with σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1.</sub> Deletion of β’Si3 has been shown to reduce the lifetime of open complexes by 3–10 fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ruff et al., 2015b</xref>), suggesting the possibility that the reduced activation observed with the Si3 deletion RNAP could also result from effects on RPo stability.</p><p>The TraR-induced conformational changes that alter and weaken σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> interactions in the main channel are proposed to facilitate displacement of σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> by promoter DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). However, effects of TraR on clamp conformation may also contribute to the increase in RPo by increasing bubble nucleation, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feklistov et al. (2017)</xref>. Together, these effects could be sufficient to account for the TraR-dependent increase in the amount of RPo formed at an activated promoter.</p><p>Since the structural data indicate that TraR bound to the RNAP complex would sterically block initial NTP access to the active site, along with t-strand positioning and catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molodtsov et al., 2018</xref>), TraR must dissociate from the complex in order to allow initiation from the activated promoter. The proposal that TraR dissociates from the complex at an activated promoter prior to the dissociation of RNAP from the promoter is supported by previous data on the lifetimes of these complexes. The lifetime of RPo at activated promoters (measured in hours; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barker et al., 2001</xref>) is much longer than the lifetime of the transcription factors on RNAP (GreB, DksA and by extension TraR; measured in seconds; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stumper et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The kinetics of transcription initiation are illustrated by a schematic energy landscape in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, where specific structural effects of TraR are correlated with changes in free energy at positively and negatively regulated promoters. The TraR-dependent changes in RNAP conformation and the resulting effects on σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> would lower the kinetic barrier to RPo formation. At an activated promoter, the free energy of the transition state between RP2 and RPo is rate-limiting, and it is reduced by the TraR-induced weakening of σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> interactions in the main channel, leading to an increase in transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Structural mechanism for TraR-mediated inhibition</title><p>TraR (and ppGpp/DksA)-inhibited promoters form RPo rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rao et al., 1994</xref>) but their intrinsically unstable RPo results in significant population of earlier intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rutherford et al., 2009</xref>). Although TraR likely accelerates bubble nucleation and σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> ejection at inhibited promoters, these steps are already rapid and transcription output is not affected. In contrast to its effects on an activated promoter, deletion of σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> had much smaller effects on basal transcription and inhibition by TraR on an inhibited promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>However, TraR binding induces two distinct conformational changes in RNAP that we propose disfavor RPo formation, accounting for inhibition. Most prominent is a direct interaction of TraR with βSi1 that leads to the 18 Å displacement of the βlobe that alters the shape of the main channel and may stabilize DNA contacts in an intermediate prior to RPo (such as RP2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Stabilization of an intermediate compared to RPo at inhibited promoters would have a dramatic effect on transcription output by further shifting occupancy by RNAP to earlier intermediates in the RPo formation pathway. Consistent with these hypotheses, ΔSi1-RNAP has reduced TraR-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and footprints with RNAP on negatively regulated promoters like <italic>rrnB</italic> P1 and <italic>rpsT</italic> P2 have a shortened downstream boundary of DNase I protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition by TraR is multipartite. In addition to causing rotation of the βlobe-Si1, TraR binding also induces a kinked BH that sterically clashes with proper positioning of the t-strand DNA near the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molodtsov et al., 2018</xref>). Precise positioning of the t-strand DNA at the active site is critical for efficient catalysis of phosphodiester bond formation by RNAP in the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yee et al., 1979</xref>). Occupancy of the secondary channel by TraR would be expected to block catalysis by sterically blocking TL folding required for catalysis and preventing access of initiating NTPs to the active site, ensuring that any complexes containing TraR that proceeded to RPo could not initiate transcription.</p><p>Why not attribute inhibition entirely to this ability of TraR to block iNTP access to the active site? Recent single molecule fluorescence studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stumper et al., 2019</xref>) indicated that secondary channel binding factors (GreB, DksA and by extension TraR) formed an RNAP-factor complex prior to binding to promoter DNA, and dissociated together with RNAP from an inhibited promoter complex (<italic>rrnB</italic> P1) because the lifetime of RNAP on <italic>rrnB</italic> P1 is shorter than the lifetime of the factors on RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stumper et al., 2019</xref>). Since the affinity of TraR for RNAP is similar to that of DksA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017</xref>), it is likely that TraR exhibits similar properties. Binding of the factors to preformed RPo was not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stumper et al., 2019</xref>), consistent with the ten-fold reduced affinity of DksA for RPo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lennon et al., 2009</xref>). These data are consistent with our model for inhibition, suggesting that TraR would bind together with RNAP to an inhibited promoter and severely reduce RPo formation by stabilizing an intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). TraR would remain associated with the complex until RNAP dissociated. TraR's presence in the complex for the entire time of RNAP occupancy of the promoter would leave little opportunity for RPo to form and would also prevent catalysis by any RPo that did form.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>TraR manipulates <italic>Eco</italic> RNAP lineage-specific insertions to modulate transcription initiation</title><p>The β and β' subunits of the bacterial RNAP are conserved throughout evolution, containing 16 and 11 sequence regions, respectively, common to all bacterial RNAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lane and Darst, 2010a</xref>). These shared sequence regions are separated by relatively nonconserved spacer regions in which large LSIs can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lane and Darst, 2010a</xref>). The LSIs are typically independently-folded, highly mobile domains, ranging in size from 50 to 500 amino acids on the RNAP surface. A key feature of the mechanism of TraR function is modulation of <italic>Eco</italic> RNAP transcription initiation through conformational changes brought about by interactions with two of the <italic>Eco</italic> RNAP LSIs, βSi1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and β'Si3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>).</p><p><italic>Eco</italic> βSi1 was originally designated dispensible region 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Severinov et al., 1994</xref>), but its deletion reduced growth at 30 °C and prevented growth at 42°, suggesting that it might serve as a binding determinant for regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artsimovitch et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, TraR interacts with βSi1 as well as with the nearby βlobe to distort the RNAP channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), effecting both inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) by TraR.</p><p><italic>Eco</italic> β'Si3 is an unusual LSI as it is inserted in the middle of the TL, a key structural element in the RNAP nucleotide addition cycle that is conserved in all multi-subunit RNAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lane and Darst, 2010a</xref>). As a consequence, Si3 plays a central role in <italic>Eco</italic> RNAP function, and cells deleted for Si3 are not viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artsimovitch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zakharova et al., 1998</xref>). Si3 is highly mobile, rotating about 33° to accommodate folding and unfolding of the TL at each RNAP nucleotide addition cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Malinen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zuo and Steitz, 2015</xref>). Si3 was often disordered in <italic>Eco</italic> RNAP crystal structures [for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molodtsov et al., 2018</xref>]. In our cryo-EM analysis, TraR engages with Si3, stabilizing a previously undetected conformation of Si3 affecting activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Si3 has been implicated previously in RPo formation since the Δβ'Si3-RNAP forms an unstable RPo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artsimovitch et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>TraR-like proteins are widespread in proteobacteria, related bacteriophage, and plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gourse et al., 2018</xref>). While TraR function in vivo is incompletely understood, TraR engages with RNAP in much the same way as ppGpp/DksA and regulates transcription similarly. The structural and functional analyses described here identify the RNAP conformational changes responsible for the effects of TraR on transcription, deconvoluting the complicated, multifaceted mechanism that distinguishes activation from inhibition. The complex interplay between TraR binding and RNAP conformation and conformational heterogeneity allows TraR to modulate multiple features of the energy landscape of RPo formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), which is key to allowing TraR to effect differential regulation across promoter space without directly interacting with DNA. The very similar effects of ppGpp/DksA and TraR on RNAP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gourse et al., 2018</xref>)

presents a structural analysis of the transcription factor TraR bound to <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP holoenzyme. TraR regulates transcription initiation in bacteria by binding directly to RNA polymerase (RNAP) as opposed to promoter DNA. The binding of TraR is shown to lead to significant and novel conformational changes in RNAP, which were not evident in prior crystallographic studies, that now account for TraR's function. The structural data, combined with biochemical analyses, provide a mechanism for how TraR binding alters the RNAP conformation and conformational dynamics to modulate the energy landscape of RNAP/promoter formation and transcription initiation. The findings represent a significant step toward enhancing our understanding of the molecular mechanism of how TraR and its homologs, such as DksA, regulate transcription.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>E. coli</italic> TraR allosterically regulates transcription initiation by altering RNA polymerase conformation and dynamics&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dong Wang (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the present manuscript, Darst and colleagues use cryo-electron microscopy to determine how TraR, a bacterial transcription factor related to the ppGpp-response factor DksA, regulates RNA polymerase function. Structures of <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP and σ-70, with or without TraR, and of RNAP•σ-70 bound to a TraR-repressed promoter are presented. The authors find that upon binding of TraR, substantial conformational changes occur in RNAP that account for TraR's function. These changes are not seen in previous crystallographic analysis, which may have been limited by crystal packing constraints, and indicate that TraR modulates RNAP transcription initiation by binding and altering the conformation and dynamics of the polymerase. TraR-induced transitions are further shown by biochemical analyses to be critical for transcription activation or inhibition, depending on the kinetic features of regulated promoters. Taken together, a detailed mechanism is presented for how binding of TraR alters RNAP conformation and dynamics and to modulate the energy landscape of polymerase-promoter formation and transcription initiation.</p><p>The structural work is of significant interest, as the physical mechanisms through which TraR factor (and other transcription factors which bind directly to RNAP) regulate the kinetics of transcription initiation are poorly understood. The manuscript is clearly written and represents a nice example of the growing power of cryo-EM for the analysis of transcription complexes and their regulation. The work should be of general interest to scientists who work in transcription field; however, several issues need to be addressed before a decision on publication can be made.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One issue is that no structure of TraR bound to an initiation complex is provided. The authors mention in the Materials and methods that they were unable to obtain a DNA-bound complex of TraR-RNAP in the cryo-EM. This is unfortunate, as the conformational changes that occur in the presence of DNA will be important for fully defining the structural mechanism of TraR. The lack of a structure is puzzling, since it is shown that TraR is active under the cryo-EM conditions (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). This raises some concerns that the cryo-EM conditions allow TraR-RNAP interactions and subsequent conformational changes, but that these changes are not congruent with those that are required to support DNA binding. In addition, there is a degree of speculation on this issue in the Discussion that does not seem fully substantied in lieu of a DNA-bound TraR-RNAP complex. Some commentary on this point is needed. It is also recommended that the authors tone down some of the language on this point.</p><p>2) Based on its blocking of the NTP-entry channel, a TraR-bound complex would be, by definition, a repressed complex for initiation. It is less clear how this fact impacts the interpretation of the kinked bridge helix as a mechanism of repression. A simpler model (related to the one laid out in the last paragraph of the Discussion) may be that activation/repression is dictated solely by the lifetime of RPo in the absence of NTPs. In a potentially interesting synthesis, could it be that the BH clash results in a very low affinity between TraR and RPo, which might also explain the inability to obtain TraR RPo structures? If so, it may be that forming TraR-RPc complexes with DNA at low temperature (4C) prior to freezing for cryo-EM would reveal closed complexes with TraR bound. Here, formation of RPo would have a large negative linkage with TraR binding and formation of RPo would eject TraR in much the way as it ejects σ1.1. This hypothesis could also directly tested by comparing the affinity of TraR to RNAP alone and preformed RNAP RPo with mismatched DNA.</p><p>3) In multiple instances, the manuscript suggests links between structural observations and kinetics or dynamics. However, these links are hypothetical, as no time-dependent data are presented; the observed conformational heterogeneity (which is well-characterized here) may not necessarily be truly dynamic. This mis-conception is strengthened by wording throughout the paper, exemplified by the following in the Introduction, &quot;…new software tools allow for the analysis of molecular motions in the cryo-EM data…&quot; and from the Abstract, &quot;that quantitative analysis of RNAP conformational heterogeneity revealed TraR-induced changes in RNAP dynamics.&quot; While it is accepted that motions are implied by the heterogeneity, the language connecting these two phenomena should be more nuanced.</p><p>4) The authors state that, &quot;dampening of motion extent is proposed to facilitate the &quot;nucleation of strand opening&quot;. But the referenced manuscript (Feklistov, 2017) proposes that motions between cRNAP and oRNAP are important for strand opening, stating: &quot;Thus, −11 base-pair perturbations obviate the requirement for cRNAP, confirming that transient clamp closure nucleates melting,&quot; and &quot;−10 element recognition by cRNAP nucleates melting, followed by transition into oRNAP form, allowing DNA loading and unwinding in the cleft; the final closure seals the promoter complex.&quot; Based on the model presented in Figure 4 of Feklistov, 2017, it would seem that restricting the ability to form oRNAP may activate or inhibit strand separation depending on the kinetics of RP1-RP2-RPo. Please comment.</p><p>5) There is not a clear synthesis of the variety of inferred structural effects on initiation. How are the effects on the clamp, the bridge helix, and the SLIs integrated to produce activation or inhibition? A kinetic model/schematic that concretely summarizes the kinetic and structural hypotheses for the reader in the context of transitions between different intermediate structures would go a long way to clarifying and synthesizing the proposed TraR model.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>E. coli</italic> TraR allosterically regulates transcription initiation by altering RNA polymerase conformation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors mention in the Materials and methods that they were unable to obtain a DNA-bound complex of TraR-RNAP in the cryo-EM. This is unfortunate, as the conformational changes that occur in the presence of DNA will be important for fully defining the structural mechanism of TraR. The lack of a structure is puzzling, since it is shown that TraR is active under the cryo-EM conditions (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). This raises some concerns that the cryo-EM conditions allow TraR-RNAP interactions and subsequent conformational changes, but that these changes are not congruent with those that are required to support DNA binding. In addition, there is a degree of speculation on this issue in the Discussion that does not seem fully substantied in lieu of a DNA-bound TraR-RNAP complex. Some commentary on this point is needed. It is also recommended that the authors tone down some of the language on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We were unable to form a TraR-RNAP-promoter DNA complex with an <italic>rrnB</italic> P1 promoter fragment, as mentioned in the Materials and methods. We have subsequently obtained cryo-EM structures of TraR-RNAP-promoter DNA complexes using the <italic>rpsT</italic> P2 promoter fragment (Figure 2A). Both <italic>rrnB</italic> P1 and <italic>rpsT</italic> P2 are inhibited by TraR. The <italic>rrnB</italic> P1 promoter is known to form a very unstable complex with RNAP with a very short half-life, which is further inhibited by TraR. The <italic>rpsT</italic> P2 promoter also forms relatively unstable complexes but more stable than <italic>rrnB</italic> P1 (Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017, Gourse et al., 2018), consistent with our results. Our study of the TraR-RNAP-<italic>rpsT</italic> P2 complexes has revealed 7 new structures that represent intermediates along the pathway of RPo formation – adequately addressing this work here is way beyond the scope of this manuscript and is the subject of a separate manuscript submitted elsewhere. Nevertheless, the cryo-EM conditions and subsequent conformational changes support DNA binding. Here we focus on conformational changes that TraR induces by binding to RNAP, which provide structure-based hypotheses for the differential effects of TraR on transcription initiation (activation of some promoters, inhibition of others). These hypotheses are then tested with biochemical experiments.</p><p>In response to this and other reviewer comments, we have completely re-written and re-organized the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Based on its blocking of the NTP-entry channel, a TraR-bound complex would be, by definition, a repressed complex for initiation.

We revised the Discussion, especially the sections entitled “Structural Mechanisms of Activation by TraR” and “Structural Mechanisms of Inhibition by TraR”, to address these questions and to describe our model more comprehensively. We also address these issues by pointing out specific data presented here, as well as in previous publications, that support our model, and we added a new figure (Figure 8) to summarize features of the model.</p><p>Specifically, we address the questions raised as follows:</p><p>2a) <italic>‘Based on its blocking of the NTP-entry channel, a TraR-bound complex would be, by definition, a repressed complex for initiation.'</italic></p><p>Yes, we agree that a TraR-bound complex would be repressed for initiation, and this would be true whether the promoter is a negatively or positively regulated one. Thus, this cannot be the mechanism for activation. For the following reasons (also outlined in the Discussion) we do not think that blocking of NTP entry is the primary mechanism for inhibition.</p><p>Due to the TraR- induced conformational changes in RNAP (detailed in our paper) that severely reduce RPo formation by stabilizing an earlier intermediate on the pathway and by weakening duplex DNA interactions at inhibited promoters, transcription initiation is blocked before the stage of NTP entry and catalysis. Footprints of negatively-regulated promoter complexes containing TraR display protection from DNaseI characteristic of earlier intermediates rather than RPo, consistent with this interpretation.</p><p>Our earlier data (Lennon et al., 2009) showed that DksA (and by extension, its homolog TraR) has 10-fold reduced binding affinity for RPo relative to RNAP holoenzyme. Consistent with these data, recent single molecule fluorescence data from Gelles and colleagues (Stumper et al., 2019) showed that secondary channel binding factors (specifically GreB and DksA) bind to RNAP to form an RNAP-factor complex, before RNAP binds to the promoter, and the factors remain bound to RNAP on the promoter until RNAP dissociates. On negatively-regulated promoters like <italic>rrnB</italic> P1, which form extraordinarily short-lived promoter complexes with RNAP, the lifetime of the factor with RNAP is longer than the lifetime of RNAP with the promoter.</p><p>Due to differences in the rate-determining steps at inhibited vs. activated promoters, again described in the Discussion, TraR facilitates rather than inhibits RPo formation at activated promoters.

We propose that kinking of the bridge helix (BH) plays a role in the mechanism of inhibition by reducing the stability and occupancy of RPo by preventing a template strand interaction with the BH. In addition, the template strand-BH interaction correctly positions the template strand in the active site, and a BH kink would therefore inhibit catalysis. We suggest while most RNAP-TraR complexes at an inhibited promoter would not proceed to forming an open complex, the small fraction that do would be inhibited by the BH kink and restriction of NTP access, thus ensuring efficient inhibition.</p><p>2c) <italic>‘In a potentially interesting synthesis, could it be that the BH clash results in a very low affinity between TraR and RPo, which might also explain the inability to obtain TraR RPo structures?'</italic></p><p>Yes, this idea is supported by our previous observation of a 10-fold reduced affinity of DksA, a TraR homolog, for a pre-formed RPo (Lennon et al., 2009). Since TraR has a similar affinity for RNAP (Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017), we propose that TraR also has a reduced affinity for pre-formed RPo. We suggest that RPo formation can occur in a small fraction of complexes in the presence of bound TraR, and that blocking catalysis would be part of a multipartite mechanism that would ensure efficient inhibition of this small fraction of complexes.</p><p>2d) <italic>'If so, it may be that forming TraR-RPc complexes with DNA at low temperature (4C) prior to freezing for cryo-EM would reveal closed complexes with TraR bound.

Although both types of conformational heterogeneity are almost certainly dynamic on some time scale, the reviewers comments appear to relate to the 'analog' conformational heterogeneity observed for the RNAP clamp. It seems that the reviewer is suggesting that the continuous ~Gaussian distributions of RNAP clamp positions observed here in the frozen cryo-EM samples do not represent dynamic motions in solution that were trapped during the freezing process, but instead represent static conformational states; this seems inconceivable to us. This is supported by the finding of dynamic clamp behavior by single-molecule FRET (Duchi et al., 2018), which we have noted now in the manuscript (subsection “TraR binding restricts the range of clamp positions in Eσ<sup>70</sup>”, first paragraph). Nevertheless, we have removed mentions of clamp 'dynamics' or 'motions' and replaced these with 'conformational heterogeneity' or other wording, including in the Title, in the Abstract, as well as in the Results, and in the (rewritten) Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors state that, &quot;dampening of motion extent is proposed to facilitate the &quot;nucleation of strand opening&quot;.

Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>By 'nucleation of strand opening', we mean initial melting of the -10 element (as detected by the RNAP beacon assay used in Feklistov et al., 2017). This paper showed that reagents that close the clamp (i.e. switch region antibiotics such as myxopyronin or T7 Gp2) significantly increase the rate of transcription bubble nucleation. We propose here that restricting the range of clamp opening by TraR could also have this effect (facilitate the very initial steps of -10 element melting). We have tried to clarify this statement (subsection “Conclusion”).</p><p>The reviewer is correct that Feklistov et al., 2017, also suggested that later steps of RPo formation would require clamp opening, so TraR restriction of clamp opening would be expected to hinder later steps, but this would not be inconsistent with our model – it would depend on the importance of the later steps to the overall kinetics of RPo formation. Note also that potential hindrance by TraR of later steps due to restrictions in clamp opening would be layered on top of the activation of later steps due to TraR's effect on facilitating σ<sup>70</sup><sub>1.1</sub> release (Figure 4D).</p><p>Also please note that modulation of clamp conformations is only a small part of the multipartite TraR mechanism (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There is not a clear synthesis of the variety of inferred structural effects on initiation.

It is unclear how the landscapes relate to the hypothesis for activation. Please clarify these points in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have further revised the Discussion section on “Structural mechanism for TraR-mediated activation” to clarify the model and address the questions raised by the reviewer. The first question concerned how dissociation of TraR from the open complex (RPo) could activate transcription. Confusion about this subject could have arisen because we previously addressed it at the end of the Discussion section on “Structural Mechanism of TraR-mediated inhibition” instead of in the section on “Structural mechanism of activation”. We have now moved the explanation to the activation section so that all features of the proposed model for activation are now presented together in one section.</p><p>In summary, we have previously published data showing that TraR and its homolog DksA enhance the transcription output from activated promoters relative to that with RNAP alone (Paul et al., 2005; Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017), and that RPo at activated promoters is very stable to competitor challenge (Barker et al., 2001). In addition, kinetic analyses showed that the presence of DksA enhanced the rate of formation and the amount of competitor stable RPo formed at an activated promoter relative to that formed with RNAP alone (Paul et al., 2005). In the present paper we present structural and biochemical evidence that these effects occur primarily because TraR-induces conformational changes in the β subunit that allosterically alter the position of σ<sub>1.1</sub> in the main DNA binding channel (Figures 1, 4; Video 1), thereby increasing the ability of promoter DNA to displace σ<sub>1.1</sub> from this channel. TraR also alters the position of β’Si3, contributing to activation (Figure 3). Contrary to what is implied in the comment, these enhancements to the overall rate occur while TraR is still present in the complex – the increase in the rate and amount of RPo formed while TraR was present leads to the increase in transcription once TraR dissociates.</p><p>Since the structural data shown here indicate that TraR bound to the complex would sterically block iNTP access to the active site, t-strand positioning and catalysis (Figure 5; see also Molodtsov et al., 2018), TraR must therefore dissociate from the complex in order for transcription to initiate from the activated promoter. The proposal that TraR dissociates from RPo at an activated promoter prior to dissociation of RNAP from the promoter is consistent with previously published data. The lifetimes of RPo at activated promoters (measured in hours; Barker et al., 2001) are much longer than that of the transcription factors on RNAP (GreB, DksA and by extension TraR; measured in seconds; Stumper et al., 2019).</p><p>A second part of the reviewer’s comments concerns whether TraR “de-represses basal activity” rather than really activates transcription. We refer to “basal” activity as the activity observed with RNAP alone in the absence of TraR. We have shown previously that TraR increases transcription 4-6 fold over the amount observed without TraR, i.e. it really activates (Gopalkrishnan et al., 2017; also see Figures 3E, 3G, Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C, E, G, Figure 4C, D). We have revised a paragraph (subsection “A TraR-induced ~18° rotation of βlobe-Si1 plays a major role in transcription regulation”, fourth paragraph; re Figure 4D) to clarify what is meant by basal transcription.</p><p>We have also included a description in the revised Discussion section about how the energy landscape shows the activation step. We have also modified the kinetic scheme at the top of Figure 8 to reflect TraR (T) dissociation that is required for initiation of RNA chain synthesis and transition of RPo to RPitc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The description of the mechanism via the use of energy landscapes has the potential to greatly clarify the hypotheses made and is a strong addition to the paper. The kinetic/thermodynamic features of the activated and repressed promoters are important should be described in the paper. It seems that one critical component may be the rate of escape. In addition, please provide details on how the flux calculator from Galburt et al. was adapted to a four-state scheme. The on-line calculator appears to only have three states.</p></disp-quote><p>The general kinetic/thermodynamic features of inhibited vs. activated promoters are discussed in the Discussion. When the energy diagrams are first introduced (subsection “A TraR-induced ~18° rotation of βlobe-Si1 plays a major role in transcription regulation”, last paragraph), we have added a note that the features of inhibited vs. activated promoters are described later in the Discussion. We have also added new references establishing the 3-step minimal linear mechanism for RPo formation (or 4-step mechanism if one includes promoter escape). Basically, complexes at inhibited promoters pass through the pathway rapidly but the final RPo is relatively unstable; in the absence of high NTP concentrations, RPo exists in equilibrium with earlier intermediates. By contrast, activated promoters form RPo slowly, but the RPo that is formed is very stable. In terms of the basic features of the energy diagram, inhibited promoters have low kinetic barriers (low peaks between the valleys) but the valleys going from left to right are generally uphill. Activated promoters have high kinetic barriers (high peaks between the valleys) but the valleys going from left to right are generally downhill. We have tried to capture these basic features in the basal energy diagrams (the black lines) in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and Figure 8 (these figures have been revised to better illustrate these points).</p><p>Regarding the rate of escape, there is no evidence that promoter escape is rate-limiting or that TraR alters the rate of escape from either the activated or inhibited promoters used here. Our models for activation and inhibition propose that TraR would not be associated with the final RPo at the activated promoters (see above response to comment 2), so would not affect the escape rate. For inhibited promoters, TraR depopulates RPo by stabilizing an earlier intermediate complex, thereby preventing initiation. Thus, it is unlikely that TraR remains bound to RPo except in a small fraction of the population in which TraR binding would be expected to sterically occlude catalysis (Figure 5; Molodtsov et al., 2018).</p><p>The details of how we used the flux calculator of Galburt, 2018, are now described in Materials and methods ('Details of flux calculator calculations').

Could the effect of promoter escape rate revealed by the landscapes be the determinant for TraR-based activation/repression? The landscapes need to be described quantitatively so as to allow others to recapitulate the results.

We have included a sentence (subsection “Structural mechanism for TraR-mediated activation”, second paragraph) describing conclusions from previous work from the Record and Hinton labs on effects of the deletion of σ<sub>1.1</sub> on promoter complex formation and stability. Their results, specifically that deletion of σ<sub>1.1</sub> increases RPo formation at some promoters and decreases it at others, are consistent with effects of the σ<sub>1.1</sub> deletion on transcription observed here at activated or inhibited promoters (Figure 4; Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Work from the Record lab also showed a role for Si3 in stabilization of RPo (Ruff et al., 2015b). This is consistent with our finding that Si3 plays a role in promoter activation by TraR (Figure 3) and suggests that Si3 could affect activation by altering complex stability. This is now mentioned in our revised Discussion section (see the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned subsection).</p></body></sub-article></article>
