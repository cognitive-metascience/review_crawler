represents a decisive cytoplasmic step in the biogenesis of 40S ribosomal subunits. This involves final 18S rRNA processing and release of residual biogenesis factors, including the protein kinase RIOK1. To identify novel proteins promoting the final maturation of human 40S subunits, we characterized pre-ribosomal subunits trapped on RIOK1 by mass spectrometry, and identified the deubiquitinase USP16 among the captured factors. We demonstrate that USP16 constitutes a component of late cytoplasmic pre-40S subunits that promotes the removal of ubiquitin from an internal lysine of ribosomal protein RPS27a/eS31. <italic>USP16</italic> deletion leads to late 40S subunit maturation defects, manifesting in incomplete processing of 18S rRNA and retarded recycling of late-acting ribosome biogenesis factors, revealing an unexpected contribution of USP16 to the ultimate step of 40S synthesis.

Since translation is key to cellular growth and proliferation, the production of ribosomes is tightly regulated. Ribosome biogenesis encompasses the action of more than 200 non-ribosomal proteins, so-called assembly or trans-acting factors that collectively ensure that the two ribosomal subunits, a small 40S and a large 60S subunit in eukaryotes, are correctly assembled.</p><p>While the initial steps of eukaryotic ribosome synthesis leading to the formation of immature pre-ribosomal subunits occur in the nucleolus, ribosomal subunits gain competence for protein translation only during their ultimate maturation in the cytoplasm. This involves structural rearrangements of the subunits, incorporation of late-assembling ribosomal proteins, final ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing steps, and the eventual release of all ribosome assembly factors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerezo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaker-Margot, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nerurkar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Peña et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Woolford and Baserga, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zemp and Kutay, 2007</xref>). Early cytoplasmic pre-40S particles contain a similar set of at least eight trans-acting factors in both yeast and human cells, namely ENP1, LTV1, casein kinase 1/Hrr25, RRP12, TSR1, the protein kinase and ATPase RIOK2, the endonuclease NOB1, and DIM2/PNO1 (partner of NOB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameismeier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferreira-Cerca et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghalei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Granneman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hector et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heuer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Larburu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Merl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mitterer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oeffinger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scaiola et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schäfer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schäfer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Strunk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wyler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zemp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zemp et al., 2009</xref>). The release of these factors is mechanistically linked to defined steps of subunit maturation during which ribosomal proteins and some RNA segments gain their final position. Only few trans-acting factors have been found associated with pre-ribosomal subunits just prior to the final processing of the 3’ end of 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fatica et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pertschy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Preti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sloan et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to the endonuclease NOB1, these include DIM2 and the protein kinase RIOK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameismeier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hector et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Turowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Widmann et al., 2012</xref>). The ATPase activity of RIOK1 is required for rRNA cleavage and the eventual dissociation of NOB1 and DIM2 from the subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferreira-Cerca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Turowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vanrobays et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Widmann et al., 2012</xref>). Based on recent structural studies, release or repositioning of DIM2 has been suggested to be necessary for both rRNA cleavage and formation of the 40S subunit decoding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameismeier et al., 2018</xref>). How exactly these steps are mechanistically linked remains, however, ill-defined.</p><p>These final stages of the ribosome assembly pathway take place in the cytoplasm in presence of the entire translation machinery including mRNAs, tRNAs, the mature partner subunits and translation factors. In light of this fact, trans-acting factors may not only promote subunit maturation but also prevent an untimely engagement of pre-ribosomal subunits in translation. Although it is generally assumed that immature 40S subunits cannot engage in translation initiation, several studies have shown that pre-40S subunits can be detected in polysome fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belhabich-Baumas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferreira-Cerca et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Gómez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Granneman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lacombe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pertschy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Soudet et al., 2010</xref>). Whether these pre-40S particles are aberrant and therefore retain 40S biogenesis factors and/or whether entering the translating ribosome pool serves a surveillance function remains unclear. Final cytoplasmic pre-40S subunit maturation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has been suggested to involve proofreading of functional sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karbstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lebaron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>). In a so-called ‘translation-like cycle’, pre-40S particles have been shown to associate with mature 60S subunits generating a so-called 80S-like particle, which might be part of a final proofreading mechanism for 40S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferreira-Cerca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Gómez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ghalei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Turowski et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, it remains unclear whether 60S subunit association presents an obligatory step in final 40S subunit maturation or if only a subset of 40S precursors undergoes this quality control process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerezo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lebaron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Strunk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Turowski et al., 2014</xref>). While cytoplasmic events of 40S subunit maturation in human and yeast are presumed to be highly similar with few functional differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badertscher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wild et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wyler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zorbas et al., 2015</xref>), the existence of an 80S-like particle involved in pre-40S proofreading has not been described in human cells. It therefore remains unclear whether the transition from a pre-40S particle to a mature 40S subunit is assisted by additional, so far unidentified factors besides mature 60S subunits or only requires the well-described set of 40S trans-acting factors involved in cytoplasmic pre-40S maturation. Such additional factors might have been missed so far due to a sub-stoichiometric or transient mode of action.</p><p>To discover novel factors involved in the last stages of pre-40S subunit maturation, we isolated late 40S precursors from human cells and identified associated proteins by mass spectrometry. This led to the identification of the deubiquitinase USP16, previously shown to be involved in the deubiquitination of histone H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Joo et al., 2007</xref>). Our analysis revealed that USP16 is a cytoplasmic protein that possesses a novel, ribosome-associated function. We demonstrate that USP16 is a component of late cytoplasmic pre-40S particles and that its deletion affects the last stages of 40S maturation. Further, we show that loss of USP16 leads to the accumulation of mono-ubiquitinated 40S ribosomal protein RPS27a/eS31. Finally, our data suggest that RPS27a ubiquitination depends on active translation, hinting at a potential link between the final stages of 40S maturation and translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of USP16 as a pre-40S-associated factor</title><p>During the final step of 40S ribosomal subunit maturation in the cytoplasm, the 18S-E pre-rRNA is processed to its mature form by the endonuclease NOB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Preti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sloan et al., 2013</xref>). At this stage, pre-40S particles are known to contain only a few additional trans-acting factors including the NOB1 binding partner DIM2 and the atypical kinase RIOK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameismeier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hector et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Turowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Widmann et al., 2012</xref>). While DIM2 and NOB1 are associated with pre-40S subunits already during earlier nuclear and cytoplasmic 40S subunit maturation steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameismeier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Larburu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Montellese et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wyler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zemp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zemp et al., 2009</xref>), RIOK1 associates with pre-40S particles only in the course of their final maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameismeier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Widmann et al., 2012</xref>). However, additional as of yet unknown factors might be needed to control or support the final 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis step.</p><p>To identify human 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis factors associated with late cytoplasmic 40S subunit precursors, we isolated pre-40S particles by StrepTactin affinity purification of the C-terminally Strep-HA (StHA)-tagged kinase RIOK1 that we expressed from a tetracycline-inducible transgene in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As the kinase-dead (kd) D324A mutant of RIOK1 has been demonstrated to be more strongly associated with pre-40S particles than the wild-type (WT) kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Widmann et al., 2012</xref>), we also used RIOK1(kd)-StHA as bait. Affinity purifications were performed in biological triplicates and the respective eluates were analyzed by mass spectrometry using data-dependent acquisition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). As RIOK1 is also part of the methylosome that methylates Sm proteins during snRNP biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guderian et al., 2011</xref>), the methylosome components PRMT5 and MEP50 were strongly enriched on RIOK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Widmann et al., 2012</xref>). While the methylosome complex was enriched on WT and mutant RIOK1 to a similar extent, 40S ribosomal proteins (RPs) and the known 40S trans-acting factors DIM2, NOB1 and TSR1 were preferentially isolated with RIOK1(kd) particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). TSR1 is a GTPase-like protein that binds to the subunit interface of pre-40S particles, where it is suggested to impede binding of certain translation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameismeier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McCaughan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mitterer et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to ribosomal proteins and known 40S trans-acting factors, a number of proteins not previously linked to 40S subunit maturation were found to be strongly enriched on the kinase-dead version of RIOK1, with OTUD6B, G3BP1, and USP16 being the most significant among the top scorers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). OTUD6B is a deubiquitinase (DUB) suggested to associate with and deubiquitinate components of the 48S translation pre-initiation complex, thereby regulating protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sobol et al., 2017</xref>). G3BP1 is a core component of stress granules and has been linked to diverse aspects of mRNA metabolism (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam and Kennedy, 2019</xref>). Lastly, USP16 has originally been described as a DUB of histone H2A and subsequently been implicated in the regulation of gene expression, cell cycle progression, differentiation, and the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Joo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).

Interestingly, among the main hits we identified many 40S RPs along with characterized 40S trans-acting factors known to be associated with cytoplasmic pre-40S subunits such as ENP1, LTV1, TSR1, DIM2, and NOB1. In contrast, only few 40S trans-acting factors known to associate with nuclear pre-40S particles (e.g. NOC4L, NOP14) or 60S trans-acting factors (e.g. PES1, NOG2) were identified and these were co-purified much less efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These data confirm that USP16 is specifically associated with a cytoplasmic pool of pre-40S subunits.</p><p>To verify the data obtained from mass spectrometry, we performed tandem affinity purification (TAP) of WT and mutant USP16-StHA and analyzed the eluate by silver staining and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). This confirmed that pre-40S subunits were co-purified with both WT and mutant USP16-StHA as indicated by the presence of the late 40S trans-acting factor NOB1 and the 40S RP RPS3/uS3, whereas the early, nuclear 40S trans-acting factor NOC4L was not detected. The mutant form of USP16 was retrieved slightly less efficiently, which could explain the lower levels of 40S-associated proteins. The absence of the 60S trans-acting factor RLP24 and the ribosomal protein RPL23a/uL23 further confirmed that USP16 specifically binds to 40S precursors. Notably, the small ribosomal subunit protein RPS10/eS10 was also detected in the eluate. RPS10 has previously been suggested to stably join pre-40S subunits at a very late cytoplasmic step of 40S maturation, since it is not detected in earlier pre-40S particles purified by TAP of LTV1 or C21ORF70, a nuclear 40S assembly factor, or by Rio2 TAP from yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Larburu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Strunk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zemp et al., 2014</xref>). The presence of RPS10 in USP16-associated 40S particles thus indicates that USP16 is associated with particles corresponding to pre-40S subunits at a very late stage of cytoplasmic maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pre-40S association of USP16 depends on its ZnF-UBP domain and a USP16-specific helix in the USP domain</title><p>USP16 is a DUB of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family, which comprises 54 members in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mevissen and Komander, 2017</xref>). All USPs are characterized by a USP domain, which contains two highly conserved cysteine and histidine boxes that confer catalytic activity. The USP domain can differ considerably in length due to the insertion of polypeptide stretches (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonnet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Komander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nijman et al., 2005</xref>). Further, USP-containing DUBs can have additional domains which contribute to ubiquitin (Ub) recognition or are involved in the regulation of DUB activity. USP16, in addition to its USP domain, contains an N-terminal zinc-finger ubiquitin binding domain (ZnF-UBP) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The USP domain itself contains an insertion of approximately 200 amino acids (aa), which is not found in other members of the USP family except for USP45, the most closely related DUB of USP16 in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clague et al., 2013</xref>).

Additionally, we deleted the basic helix in either full length USP16 (ΔH: aa 1-822Δ436–460) or in the isolated USP domain (USPΔH: aa 193-822Δ436–460) to examine a potential contribution of the helix to 40S binding. First, we analyzed the localization of these truncated constructs after transient transfection into HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The USP, ΔH and USPΔH fragments all localized to the cytoplasm like WT USP16-StHA. The ZnF domain was predominantly found in the cytoplasm but was also present in the nucleus, possibly due to its small size (28 kDa) allowing free diffusion between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.</p><p>To directly address which parts of USP16 contribute to 40S binding, we performed TAP from HEK293 cells inducibly expressing the mutant constructs and analyzed the co-purified proteins by silver staining and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). The isolated ZnF domain associated with pre-40S particles, although their enrichment was slightly diminished compared to the WT, especially considering the higher expression levels of the ZnF domain. In contrast, binding of pre-40S subunits to the USP domain was strongly compromised and only very low levels were detectable both by silver staining and immunoblotting. Further, deletion of the USP16-specific basic helix (ΔH) did not alter binding to pre-40S subunits compared to full-length USP16. However, the weak 40S association of the isolated USP domain was completely lost upon deletion of the basic helix. Taken together, we conclude that mainly the ZnF domain but also the positively charged helix within the USP domain contribute to pre-40S binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Loss of USP16 leads to accumulation of modified RPS27a</title><p>Having established that USP16 is bound to pre-40S subunits, we sought to gain insights into a potential ribosome-associated function, which could entail deubiquitination of an unidentified USP16 substrate. Several RPs of the 40S subunit have been linked to ubiquitination and are thus candidate USP16 substrates. For instance, RPS2/uS5, RPS3/uS3, RPS3a/eS1, RPS10/eS10, and RPS20/uS10 contain sites for regulatory mono-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garzia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Higgins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Juszkiewicz and Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsuo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, the ribosomal protein RPS27a/eS31 is produced as a linear fusion with ubiquitin (Ub), which is cleaved off before the ribosome reaches translation competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rabl et al., 2011</xref>). To assess whether USP16 might be involved in the removal of Ub from these candidate RPs, we assessed their modification by immunoblotting upon depletion of USP16 by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Interestingly, knockdown of USP16 with two different siRNAs led to the appearance of a higher molecular weight band of RPS27a, but not of the other ribosomal proteins tested. To verify the specificity of the USP16 knockdown, we performed RNAi rescue experiments in HEK293 cell lines inducibly expressing WT or catalytically inactive USP16-StHA using an siRNA targeting the 3'UTR of the USP16 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As observed before, depletion of USP16 in either parental HEK293 cells or in uninduced USP16 cell lines led to the appearance of a higher molecular weight band of RPS27a. Importantly, this could be rescued by tetracycline-induced expression of tagged WT but not mutant USP16, indicating that the catalytic activity of USP16 is required for removal of the RPS27a modification. Interestingly, StrepTactin affinity purification of mutant USP16 co-purified modified RPS27a even in presence of endogenous USP16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that catalytically inactive USP16 acts in a dominant-negative manner on removal of the RPS27a modification.

Therefore, we mutated these amino acids to arginine (Arg, R) to test whether this would abolish RPS27a ubiquitination upon USP16 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Indeed, when we depleted USP16 in cell lines expressing a C-terminally StHA-tagged RPS27a construct harboring these mutations (RPS27a(7R)-StHA), ubiquitination was no longer observed, whereas the WT construct was still modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). To pinpoint the exact modification site, we individually reverted the mutated residues to Lys and observed that ubiquitination was reestablished when Lys113 was re-introduced (RPS27a(6R(K113))-StHA). We confirmed Lys113 as the sole modification site by its mutation to Arg (Rps27a(K113R)-StHA), which indeed abolished RPS27a ubiquitination upon USP16 depletion. This is not explained by a failure of ribosome incorporation of the RPS27a(K113R)-StHA construct, which co-sediments like the WT construct in sucrose gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, Supporting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

ENP1 and DIM2 are nucle(ol)ar at steady state, but both factors accompany pre-40S subunits to the cytoplasm where they are released from maturing subunits and recycled back to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wild et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wyler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zemp et al., 2009</xref>). While ENP1 localization was not affected in HeLa <italic>USP16</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, upper panel), DIM2 partially relocalized to the cytoplasm, suggesting a cytoplasmic 40S maturation defect that does not affect the release of ENP1 but that of DIM2 from 40S subunits in the cytoplasm. Importantly, the expression of transiently transfected WT but not mutant USP16-StHA rescued the late 40S biogenesis defect and restored nuclear localization of DIM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Although both ENP1 and DIM2 accompany pre-40S subunits to the cytoplasm, DIM2, but not ENP1, has been shown to be part of very late 40S pre-ribosomes isolated by affinity purification of RIOK1(kd) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Widmann et al., 2012</xref>).

Consequently, we also examined whether loss of USP16 affects NOB1 and RIOK1 localization in <italic>USP16</italic> KO cells. As NOB1 and RIOK1 are cytoplasmic at steady state, we analyzed their localization after treatment of cells with LMB, which induces their accumulation in the nucleus.

In addition, polysome levels were slightly decreased while the 80S peak was substantially larger, which is reminiscent of changes in polysome profiles due to a translation initiation defect or different stress conditions leading to polysome disassembly and a concomitant increase of 80S monosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coudert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kressler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lacombe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu et al., 2013</xref>).

Whether these pre-40S particles are aberrant, enter the translation process prematurely or undergo an obligatory translation initiation-dependent quality control check remains elusive. In light of our observation that RIOK1(kd)-StHA also co-purifies several mRNA-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and that the deletion of <italic>USP16</italic> affects both late 40S maturation and likely protein translation (based on the changes observed in the polysome profiles), we were wondering whether RPS27a ubiquitination also depends on translation. Therefore, we investigated whether the inhibition of translation leads to changes in the ubiquitination of RPS27a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). WT and <italic>USP16</italic> KO cells were treated with the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), the translation initiation inhibitor silvestrol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bordeleau et al., 2008</xref>), or DTT, which leads to induction of the unfolded protein response and thereby to a general attenuation of translation initiation via phosphorylation of eIF2α, and were then analyzed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Whereas no changes were observed after treatment of WT cells, the levels of ubiquitinated RPS27a in <italic>USP16</italic> KO cells were significantly decreased after treatment with CHX or upon inhibition of translation initiation by silvestrol or DTT, suggesting that RPS27a ubiquitination is dependent on active translation. In these experiments, we also tested the aminoglycoside geneticin/G418. G418 binds to the decoding center of the ribosome and induces A-site miscoding thereby decreasing translational fidelity and promoting missense errors during protein synthesis including premature termination codon readthrough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garreau de Loubresse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Howard et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Manuvakhova et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prokhorova et al., 2017</xref>).

This suggests that binding of G418 to the decoding site either induces a translational state of the ribosome that is prone for ubiquitination of RPS27a or that it stabilizes an already ubiquitinated (pre-)40S subunit. Further studies will be required to elucidate the mechanism behind this observation.</p><p>In summary, our data show that <italic>USP16</italic> KO and RPS27a ubiquitination not only affect late stages of 40S maturation but also translation.

Here, we advanced this approach and performed a comprehensive characterization of the interactome of a late pre-40S particle isolated by affinity purification of a kinase-dead version of RIOK1 followed by shotgun mass spectrometry. We thereby identified a suite of novel interaction partners of RIOK1 including the deubiquitinase USP16, which we show to present a novel component of late cytoplasmic pre-40S particles. Originally, USP16 (also called Ubp-M) was identified as a DUB for histone H2A by biochemical fractionation of HeLa cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Joo et al., 2007</xref>). Mono-ubiquitination of H2A can serve as a repressive histone mark when deposited on chromatin by the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) through its E3 ubiquitin ligase component RNF2, or it can promote DNA damage response pathways after ubiquitination by BRCA1/BARD1 during homologous recombination or RNF168 during non-homologous end joining (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Higashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Uckelmann and Sixma, 2017</xref>). H2A ubiquitination is highly dynamic and known to be counteracted by several other DUBs in addition to USP16, indicating a high level of redundancy (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belle and Nijnik, 2014</xref>). Notably though, <italic>Usp16</italic> is essential for embryonic development of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yang et al., 2014</xref>).

In support of USP16 acting primarily in the cytoplasm, we found USP16 to co-purify late pre-40S particles.

When searching for ribosome-associated ubiquitination events that are reverted by USP16, we discovered that USP16 drives the deubiquitination of the 40S ribosomal protein RPS27a. RNAi-mediated depletion of USP16 or its CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO in different cell lines led to RPS27a mono-ubiquitination on Lys113, supporting a ribosome-associated function of this DUB. Based on our current data, we can, however, not formally exclude that USP16 might also deubiquitinate other RPs or ribosome-bound factors. Our further analyses suggest that USP16-mediated RPS27a deubiquitination might play a role in the last stages of cytoplasmic pre-40S maturation. <italic>USP16</italic> KO cell lines display late 40S biogenesis defects associated with defective 18S-E pre-rRNA processing as well as mislocalization of DIM2, NOB1 and RIOK1 but not ENP1.

This suggests that if there were a crosstalk between the ribosome maturation machinery and the ubiquitination site, it would be indirect, either by a bridging factor or a conformational determinant.</p><p>It is currently unclear what triggers RPS27a ubiquitination and which is the responsible enzyme. One candidate is the E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNF598 which has been shown to be responsible for mono-ubiquitination of several RPs of the small subunit in the course of ribosome-associated quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garzia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Higgins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Juszkiewicz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Juszkiewicz and Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsuo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, in contrast to most of the other described regulatory mono-ubiquitination sites on the 40S subunit that reside in protruding flexible tails of ribosomal proteins, Lys113 resides in a part of RPS27a that is closely annealed to the surface of the 40S subunit. In fact, co-depletion of ZNF598 with USP16 did not induce changes in the ubiquitination levels of RPS27a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, Supporting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that ZNF598 may not be the responsible E3 ligase. The involvement of further E3 ligases will therefore need to be assessed in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>RPS27a ubiquitination – part of a quality control step of final 40S maturation?</title><p>It remains to be deciphered whether ubiquitination of RPS27a is an obligate step in 40S subunit biogenesis or part of a quality control mechanism that only affects a certain pool of subunits. The fact that only about a fifth of the RPS27a pool is mono-ubiquitinated in <italic>USP16</italic> KO cells could indicate that the modification is restricted to a subset of (pre-)40S particles. In turn, we currently assume that RPS27a ubiquitination must not be a prerequisite for 40S subunit maturation. Our preliminary data indeed suggest that expression of an RPS27a(K113R)-StHA construct does not induce defects in late 40S maturation (data not shown). Interestingly, while we do not observe mono-ubiquitinated RPS27a in WT cells by immunoblotting, analysis of the ubiquitin-modified proteome has identified Lys113 of RPS27a as a ubiquitination site in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). This could indicate that there always exists a small population of (pre-)40S subunits ubiquitinated on RPS27a. We speculate that this pool of ubiquitinated subunits might correspond to aberrant particles failing a quality control step, resulting in their ubiquitination. If USP16 is de(p)leted, such aberrant and ubiquitinated 40S precursors containing a set of 40S assembly factors would accumulate, manifesting as a late 40S biogenesis defect. RPS27a(K113R)-containing pre-40S particles might escape the quality control system and expression of this construct would therefore not lead to observable defects in 40S maturation.</p><p>Lys113 will not be obscured by binding of the 60S subunit and should not interfere with ongoing translation as no translation factors have so far been mapped to this area of the ribosome. Mono-ubiquitinated RPS27a is indeed found in fractions of sucrose gradients containing (pre-)40S subunits, 80S ribosomes and polysomes, whereas USP16 is only enriched in the (pre-)40S peak. Thus, USP16 might only be able to bind and deubiquitinate free (pre-)40S subunits while ubiquitinated (pre-)40S particles can enter the pool of translating ribosomes. As we have speculated that the ubiquitinated 40S pool could correspond to aberrant (pre-)40S particles, it is possible that these subunits can start translation initiation but fail to complete it or cannot engage in translation elongation leading to their sequestration into an inactive 80S ribosome. In support of such a hypothesis, deletion of <italic>USP16</italic> leads to a slight decrease in polysome levels and a striking increase of the 80S peak, which is commonly interpreted as a translation initiation defect (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coudert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kressler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lacombe et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>RPS27a mono-ubiquitination is strongly and rapidly diminished upon inhibition of translation in <italic>USP16</italic> knockout cells. This observation reveals that the modification of RPS27a is highly dynamic and can even be swiftly eliminated in the absence of USP16, suggesting either the existence of DUBs acting redundantly to USP16 or degradation of modified RPS27a, for example by ribophagy of marked subunits. The loss of RPS27a mono-ubiquitination upon inhibition of translation initiation also suggests that the modification may occur only after mRNA association. We therefore propose that a fraction of pre-40S particles that are either aberrant, delayed in their maturation, or stochastically chosen from the 40S pool undergo pre-mature translation initiation, but do so inefficiently due to the presence of some late 40S trans-acting factors like DIM2, NOB1, and RIOK1. This would then initiate a quality control step leading to their mono-ubiquitination on RPS27a and possibly their dissociation from mRNAs. In the presence of USP16, these pre-40S subunits will undergo deubiquitination and final maturation or eventually degradation. In the absence of USP16, however, lack of deubiquitination would lead to an accumulation of aberrant and ubiquitinated pre-40S particles in the cytoplasm. Clearly, such a quality control step could also affect ‘mature’ subunits that have lost all trans-acting factors but fail to complete initiation, for instance at the start codon during formation of the first peptide bond.</p><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, a quality control step involving the formation of an 80S-like particle to proofread pre-40S particles has already been postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karbstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lebaron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>), but such a surveillance step has not been described in human cells. Interestingly, while Lys113 of RPS27a is conserved in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> but not <italic>S. pombe</italic>, USP16 and also its most closely related DUB USP45 are not conserved in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clague et al., 2019</xref>). Higher eukaryotes might therefore have evolved other or additional means to control the transition from 40S precursors to mature subunits. RPS27a ubiquitination and its USP16-mediated deubiquitination could provide a system to surveil the entry of maturing pre-40S particles into the pool of translating ribosomes. Further studies will, however, be required to elucidate the molecular mechanism and consequences of RPS27a ubiquitination. On that way, it will be instrumental to identify the factors that induce as well as recognize the modification and relay the signal to downstream events. Given the essential function of USP16 at the organismal level and its various links to human diseases, we anticipate that its newly discovered role in ribosome biology will inform new hypotheses as to how the enzyme contributes to organismal homeostasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A list of materials is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> (Key Resources Table).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular cloning</title><p>The coding sequence of USP16 was amplified from the human ORFeome collection (hORFeome V5.1, CCSB) and cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO/cStHA vector encoding for a C-terminal StHA tag (St, Strep-tag II; HA, hemagglutinin epitope; described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wyler et al., 2011</xref>) using the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites.

The authors identified by mass spectrometry several proteins that were not previously known to be involved in ribosome maturation. One of these proteins is USP16. Although USP16 was first discovered as a deubiquitinase (DUB) that acts on histone H2A to regulate chromatin and cell cycle progression, the authors convincingly demonstrate that USP16 deubiquitinates RPS27A in a translation-dependent manner. They identified the domain that recruits it to the 40S pre-ribosomal particles, and the ubiquitination site that persists on Rps27a in the absence of USP16. It is not immediately clear by which mechanism mono-ubiquitination of RPS27a is reverted upon translational inhibition in USP16 knockout cells. Future studies should reveal this mechanism and the mechanistic role of Rsp27a ubiquitination and de-ubiquitination in 40S ribosomal subunit maturation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;USP16 counteracts mono-ubiquitination of RPS27a and promotes maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors used mass spectrometry to identify USP16 as a new late 40S assembly factor critical for 40S maturation. They present strong evidence to support this conclusion. They demonstrate that USP16 deubiquitinates RPS27A in a translation-dependent manner. They showed that USP16 is associated with 40S pre-ribosomal particles, and identify the domain that recruits it. They also describe the ubiquitination site on Rps27a, which is the target of USP16.

The approach was to affinity purify late maturation intermediate(s) via RIOK1. Mass spectrometry revealed several enriched proteins that were not previously known to be involved in ribosome maturation. Of these, the authors followed up on USP16. They show convincingly that USP16 is indeed associated with 40S pre-ribosomal particles, identify the domain that recruits it, identify the ubiquitination site that persists on Rps27a in the absence of USP16, and show that 40S biogenesis is impaired in the absence of USP16. In the final figure, the authors show that ubiquitination of Rps27a is influenced by translation.</p><p>The findings convincingly assign a new role for USP16 and point to a new player in 40S biogenesis. Although the mechanistic role of Rsp27a ubiquitination and de-ubiquitination in maturation remains unclear, this study provides a solid foundation from which to examine these issues. I therefore support publication of this study and have the following suggestions for improvement.</p><p>1) I'm not really sure the authors can claim that RPS27a modification is translation dependent. The observation is that they don't see the modification in USP16 knockout cells when translation is impaired. However, there might be other DUBs that act on this site under these conditions. Our knowledge of regulatory ubiquitination on the ribosome is very poor at this time, so one does not really know the range of ligases and DUBs and their relative relationships. In general, the relationship to translation is rather muddled. I wonder whether the paper would be simpler and more straightforward if it ended after Figure 6, leaving the translation aspect for a future study.</p><p>2) I feel the authors should better use the available structural information in their Discussion. I think readers will want to know, perhaps using a cartoon model, where the actual modification on RPS27a is and how this position relates to a number of important biological processes. Some important points a reader might want to know: (i) the site is solvent exposed and not obscured by the 60S or any translation factors; (ii) it is near the entrance to the mRNA channel, but does not line the channel; (iii) it is part of a structured region of RPS27a, which is different than the other regulatory modifications (e.g., by ZNF598) which are typically in unstructured tails that are not seen in ribosome structures. In addition to the above, the authors should certainly comment on where the modification is relative to the specific 18S processing reaction that seems to be impaired, or the 40S biogenesis factors that seem to be affected. This would make the paper more accessible to readers not directly in the ribosome biogenesis field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic>To date, several late pre-40S (small) ribosomal subunit processing factors have been shown to be crucial for the final cytoplasmic pre-rRNA cleavages and maturation transitioning that generates mature 40S subunits. In this work the authors use proteomics to identify USP16 as a novel late 40S assembly factor critical for 40S maturation. Although USP16 was first discovered as a deubiquitinase (DUB) that acts on histone H2A to regulate chromatin and cell cycle progression, the authors convincingly demonstrate that USP16 deubiquitinates RPS27A in a translation-dependent manner, enabling important final steps in 40S maturation in human tissue culture cells.</p><p>First, USP16 is shown to strongly coimmunoprecipitate with late pre-40S particles containing tagged RIOK1 as a marker. Mutational analysis reveals that (1) the zinc-finger domain and a basic helix in the USP domain are major and minor contributors to pre-40S incorporation, respectively, and (2) Lys 113 is trans-ubiquitinated in vivo. RNAi and CRISPR depletion of USP16 augments levels of Ub-RPS27A, which can be rescued by expression of WT but not catalytically-dead USP16. USP16 depletion also causes a defect in late cytoplasmic pre-18S rRNA precursor processing and in proper localization of other known 40S assembly factors. On one hand, USP16 depletion causes retention of Ub-RPS27A modification and polysome degeneration, indicative of translational interruption. However, direct small molecule inhibition of translation in a USP16 KO background causes a loss of Ub-RPS27A, suggesting a subtle interplay between RPS27A modification and translational health.</p><p>Overall, these results highlight an important new role for USP16 in small ribosomal subunit biogenesis. The figures in the paper are easy to follow, and support the authors' interpretation of USP16's novel functions, on the whole. It will be interesting to see follow-up work on USP16 and the other late pre-40S MS/MS hits found in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54435.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:The paper presents novel and very convincing data.

Still, we have taken the editorial and reviewer's suggestion into account in that we have toned down our conclusions as well as revised the respective part of the Discussion based on the considerations of reviewer #1 (please see response to point 1 of reviewer #1).

I wonder whether the paper would be simpler and more straightforward if it ended after Figure 6, leaving the translation aspect for a future study.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer indeed points at a very puzzling aspect of our translation inhibition experiments as it remains unresolved by which mechanism mono-ubiquitination of RPS27a is reverted upon translational inhibition in USP16 knockout cells. There exist several possibilities. Firstly, as indicated by the reviewer, there could be a redundant, homologous DUB that contributes to recycling of the affected subunits. Candidates include USP45, the closest homolog of USP16, which we, however, excluded as it seems not to be expressed in HeLa cells (Itzhak et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2016). Secondly, deubiquitination could be linked to a rescue of 40S subunits from degradation via USP10-mediated deubiquitination of RPS2, RPS3 and RPS10, as recently suggested by the Tuschl lab (Meyer et al., Mol. Cell, 2020). Thirdly, another recent study from the Bennett lab identified USP21 and OTUD3 as DUBs that counteract RP monoubiquitination linked to ribosome-associated quality control initiated by the E3 ligase ZNF598 (Garshott et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2020). While we exclude ZNF598 to act on RPS27a, a redundant function of the other identified DUBs remains to be tested. Thus, as commented by the reviewer, the relation of various DUBs to the ligases that they counteract is only beginning to emerge. Finally, it is also possible that subunits marked by mono-ubiquitination of RPS27a are turned over upon inhibition of translation, e.g. by ribophagy.</p><p>However, we think that our data clearly demonstrate that inhibition of translation leads to a loss of mono-ubiquitination of RPS27a. This also entails, as proposed by us, the possibility that the modification is posited on the 40S subunit by a translation-dependent mechanism in first place. As discussed above, we consider our data to be very solid and of high interest to the field, and therefore prefer keeping them in the manuscript. However, we have toned down our conclusions on the translation dependence of RPS27a throughout the manuscript, and we now also point at other options in the revised Discussion, to read:</p><p>&quot;RPS27a mono-ubiquitination is strongly and rapidly diminished upon inhibition of translation in USP16 knockout cells. [...] The loss of RPS27a mono-ubiquitination upon inhibition of translation initiation also suggests that the modification may occur only after mRNA association&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I feel the authors should better use the available structural information in their Discussion. I think readers will want to know, perhaps using a cartoon model, where the actual modification on RPS27a is and how this position relates to a number of important biological processes.

We have <bold>revised Figures 4 and 5</bold> to provide the reader with structural models of where RPS27a and other RPSs known to undergo regulatory mono-ubiquitination reside on the 40S subunit. Furthermore, as suggested, we have extended the Discussion, now providing some considerations regarding these structural aspects, to read:</p><p>&quot;Lys113 is situated at the ridge of the 40S beak (Figure 4) and is thus highly accessible. It lies at a considerable distance to the final endonucleolytic processing site of the 18S-E pre-rRNA as well as to DIM2, NOB1 and RIOK1 that are positioned at the 40S platform and the future decoding center, respectively (Ameismeier et al., 2018, Heuer et al., 2017b, Larburu et al., 2016, Mitterer et al., 2019, Scaiola et al., 2018). This suggests that a potential crosstalk between the ribosome maturation machinery and the ubiquitination site might be indirect, either by a bridging factor or a conformational determinant&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Notably, in contrast to most of the other described regulatory mono-ubiquitination sites on the 40S subunit that reside in protruding flexible tails of ribosomal proteins, Lys113 resides in a part of RPS27a that is closely annealed to the surface of the 40S subunit. In fact, co-depletion of ZNF598...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lys113 will not be obscured by binding of the 60S subunit and, to our knowledge, should not interfere with ongoing translation as no translation factors have so far been mapped to this area of the ribosome. Mono-ubiquitinated RPS27a is indeed found...&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
