Rap1-binding protein, are both essential for cardiovascular development. Here we performed a proteomic screen for novel HEG1 interactors and report that HEG1 binds directly to Rasip1. Rasip1 localizes to forming endothelial cell (EC) cell-cell junctions and silencing HEG1 prevents this localization. Conversely, mitochondria-targeted HEG1 relocalizes Rasip1 to mitochondria in cells. The Rasip1-binding site in HEG1 contains a 9 residue sequence, deletion of which abrogates HEG1’s ability to recruit Rasip1. HEG1 binds to a central region of Rasip1 and deletion of this domain eliminates Rasip1’s ability to bind HEG1, to translocate to EC junctions, to inhibit ROCK activity, and to maintain EC junctional integrity. These studies establish that the binding of HEG1 to Rasip1 mediates Rap1-dependent recruitment of Rasip1 to and stabilization of EC cell-cell junctions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11394.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11394.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11394.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Blood vessels are lined with cells known as vascular endothelial cells. These cells are connected to each other at junctions that consist of several different proteins. The junctions help to control how the blood vessel develops and provide a barrier that controls the movement of water and certain other molecules through the vessel wall. This barrier becomes weakened in diseases like sepsis and atherosclerosis.</p><p>Two proteins that are essential for the heart and blood vessels to develop correctly are called “Heart of Glass” (HEG1) and Rasip1. Although a protein has been identified that binds to HEG1 at the cell junctions, this binding only involves a small region of HEG1. This led de Kreuk, Gingras et al. to look for other proteins that interact with HEG1 and that might be important for controlling the development of the blood vessels. This revealed that HEG1 binds directly to Rasip1.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that HEG1 is essential for targeting Rasip1 to the junctions between the endothelial cells, and that this helps to stabilize the cell junctions. Mutant forms of Rasip1 that lacked a particular sequence in the middle of the protein were unable to bind to HEG1 and did not localize to the cell junctions. These studies open the door to future work to define how the interaction of Rasip1 and HEG1 is controlled and how Rasip1 stabilizes blood vessels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11394.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11394.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Rasip1</kwd><kwd>Heart of Glass</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>Rho Kinase</kwd><kwd>Rap1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL078784,HL 106489, HL 117807, NS 092521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ginsberg</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-123433</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gingras</surname><given-names>Anne-Claude</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14POST18180010, 12SDG11610043, 14SDG17870007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dekreuk</surname><given-names>Bart-Jan</given-names></name><name><surname>Gingras</surname><given-names>Alexandre R</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jian J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The proteins Heart of Glass (HEG1) and Rasip1 are both essential for cardiovascular development; and directly bind to each other to guide Rasip1 to endothelial cell junctions to support vascular integrity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Precisely regulated cell-cell adhesion is crucial for the development and functioning of multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nelson, 2008</xref>). In vascular endothelial cells (EC), cell-cell contacts formed by adherens and tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bazzoni, 2004</xref>), control vascular patterning and provide a barrier to the passage of water and solutes. Weakening of this endothelial barrier contributes to diseases such as sepsis, atherosclerosis, and multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bazzoni, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dejana et al., 2009</xref>). The actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mège et al., 2006</xref>) and its regulatory Rho GTPases have profound roles in the assembly and disassembly of cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beckers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yamada and Nelson, 2007</xref>). Rap1, a small GTPase, regulates epithelial and EC cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pannekoek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kooistra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Knox, 2002</xref>). In EC, binding of activated Rap1 to KRIT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gingras et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2012</xref>), a scaffold that regulates RhoA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Whitehead et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stockton et al., 2010</xref>), targets KRIT1 to cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Glading et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Béraud-Dufour et al., 2007</xref>) where it directly interacts with Heart of Glass (HEG1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gingras et al., 2012</xref>), a transmembrane receptor essential for cardiovascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mably et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kleaveland et al., 2009</xref>). The 111 amino acid HEG1 cytoplasmic domain is highly conserved (e.g. 76% identity between human and zebrafish) whereas KRIT1 binding requires only the C-terminal 10% of HEG1 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gingras et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we suspected that other interactors of HEG1 might contribute to vascular function. Here, we report an unbiased proteomic screen for HEG1-binding endothelial-specific proteins that revealed that Rasip1, a second Rap1 binding protein essential for vascular integrity and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Post et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>), directly interacts with the HEG1 cytoplasmic domain independent of KRIT1. Rasip1 recruitment to cell-cell junctions requires the presence of HEG1 and integrity of its HEG1 binding site. Moreover, targeting of HEG1 tail to mitochondria recruits Rasip1 to these organelles through the direct interaction of the proteins. We designed a structure-based Rasip1 RA-domain mutant (R182E) that failed to bind to Rap1 and did not associate with HEG1 in cells or maintain EC barrier integrity. Finally, the central region of Rasip1 interacts with HEG1 and deletion of this domain eliminates Rasip1’s ability to translocate to EC junctions, to inhibit Rho Kinase (ROCK) activity, and to maintain EC junctional integrity. These studies reveal that HEG1 interacts with two different Rap1 effectors important in EC, indicating that this transmembrane receptor serves as a physical nexus for Rap1 signaling in vascular integrity and development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Unbiased proteomic screen identified interaction of Rasip1 with HEG1</title><p>To test the idea that interactors besides KRIT1 might be important for HEG1 function, we used wild-type (WT) HEG1 cytoplasmic tail and HEG1 lacking the C-terminal Tyr-Phe (∆YF) required for KRIT1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gingras et al., 2012</xref>) as an affinity matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To discern potential endothelial-specific interactors, we analyzed the proteins bound to these matrices from lysates of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) or HeLa cells by mass spectrometry (MS; Raw data is deposited in the MassIVE repository housed at the Center for Computational Mass Spectrometry at UCSD. See Materials and methods section for more information). This analysis identified a Rap1 effector, Rasip1, among the proteins isolated from endothelial cells but not from HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), a result consistent with the endothelial-specific expression of Rasip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mitin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mitin et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast KRIT1, and the known KRIT1 interactors CCM2 and ITGB1BP1 (ICAP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zawistowski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zawistowski, 2002</xref>) were isolated from both lysates. All of these interactions were specific in that these proteins were detected at 35–125 fold less abundance in a control affinity matrix generated from the αIIb integrin. These proteins were also statistically significant according to SAINTexpress, a method for scoring protein-protein interaction data from affinity purification MS experiments. Moreover, deletion of the last 2 residues of the HEG1 tail abolished binding of KRIT1 as expected, and of the KRIT1-binding proteins CCM2 and ITGB1P1. In sharp contrast, Rasip1 binding was not reduced by the absence of the YF motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Immunoblotting confirmed that endogenous Rasip1 interacts with both the HEG1 cytoplasmic tail and HEG1 ∆YF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To ask whether Rasip1 and HEG1 can interact in living cells, we transfected HUVEC with mCherry-HEG1 cytoplasmic tail, containing a mitochondrial-targeting sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and analyzed endogenous Rasip1 distribution. Targeting of mito-mCherry-HEG1, but not mito-mCherry alone, to mitochondria recruited Rasip1, demonstrating the interaction of HEG1 and Rasip1 in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition, Rasip1 co-immunoprecipitated with full-length HEG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Consistent with the mass spectrometry results, immunoblotting confirmed that Rasip1 bound to HEG1 ∆YF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), suggesting that the HEG1-Rasip1 interaction does not require KRIT1 binding to HEG1. To further test the KRIT1-dependence of the HEG1-Rasip interaction, we silenced KRIT1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; 70% reduction in expression was achieved) and found that it did not affect binding of GFP-Rasip1 to the HEG1 cytoplasmic tail affinity matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or Rasip1 recruitment to mito-mCherry-HEG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Conversely, Rasip1 did not interact with the C-terminal 19 residues of HEG1, which are sufficient to bind KRIT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, we report that Rasip1 interacts with HEG1 independently of KRIT1.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11394.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rap1 effector Rasip1 interacts with the transmembrane protein Heart-of-Glass 1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the Heart-of-Glass 1 cytoplasmic tail (aa1274-1381) peptide coupled to NeutrAvidin beads.

To exclude off-target effects, silencing HEG1 expression with a second shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or an siRNA specific for HEG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) also prevented Rasip1 recruitment to EC contacts. Previous studies have shown that loss of HEG1-KRIT1 interaction increases Rho-Kinase (ROCK) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gingras et al., 2012</xref>), however, a ROCK inhibitor, H-1152, did not restore Rasip1 recruitment in HEG1-silenced EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).

To investigate whether HEG1 is involved in regulating β1 integrin activation as well, we silenced HEG1 or Rasip1 expression in HUVEC and measured the binding of 9EG7 monoclonal antibody as a reporter of β1 integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lenter et al., 1993</xref>). As expected, silencing Rasip1 expression in HUVEC decreased 9EG7 binding. In contrast, silencing HEG1 expression did not affect levels of activated β1 integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) suggesting that the effect of Rasip1 on β1 integrin activation is independent of HEG1. Previous studies show that Rasip1 mediates Rap1 inhibition of RhoA activity and of the RhoA effector Rho kinase (ROCK). As a result, silencing Rasip1 expression in endothelial cells can increase phosphorylation of a ROCK substrate, myosin light chain 2 (MLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), resulting in increased actin stress fibers and reduced cortical actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Post et al., 2013</xref>). To test whether HEG1 is also involved in suppressing ROCK signaling we silenced HEG1 or Rasip1 expression in HUVEC and analyzed MLC phosphorylation. Similar to silencing Rasip1, silencing HEG1 expression in HUVEC by siRNA or shRNA increased phosphorylation of MLC and formation of stress fibers indicating increased ROCK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). As both HEG1 and Rasip1 silencing resulted in increased MLC phosphorylation, we tested whether the interaction between HEG1 and Rasip1 is important for the regulation of RhoA/ROCK signaling. Silencing HEG1 expression in HUVEC increased MLC phosphorylation and formation of actin stress fibers, which was rescued by expressing shRNA-resistant murine HEG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, expression of Rasip1-binding deficient murine HEG1(∆1283-1291) (corresponding to aa 1327-1335 in human HEG1) failed to rescue the increase in MLC phosphorylation and actin stress fiber formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

To test whether Rap1 binding to Rasip1 is required for Rasip1 function and to assess the role of Rap1 in regulating the interaction of Rasip1 with HEG1, we analyzed the Rasip1 Ras-association (RA) domain. Comparison of the Rasip1 RA domain sequence showed that it was similar to those found in RalGDS, Afadin6, and Radil. Sequence alignment of Rasip1 RA domain with Radil shows a highly conserved sequence (31% identical, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). A preliminary homology model of the Rasip1 RA domain closely resembles the structure of Radil RA domain (PDB ID 3EC8) (backbone rmsd 1.02Å for 126 a.a., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The Radil crystal structure shows a dimer that is stabilized by an extensive interface burying 30% (2,324 Å<sup>2</sup>) of the total surface area of each monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, highlighted in blue). Analysis of our model shows that the dimer interface is conserved in Rasip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, magenta and yellow), suggesting that it could also form a dimer similar to Radil RA domain and therefore could bind two Rap1 molecules per dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

SEC revealed that Rasip1(R182E) exhibited a markedly reduced affinity for Rap1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>; black). Moreover, SEC showed that the Rasip1(R182E) mutant was well folded and exhibited the same elution pattern in SEC as the wild-type protein. Thus, we conclude that Rasip1 RA domain (R182E) remains well folded as a multimer but binds Rap1 with drastically reduced affinity. We examined the capacity of Rasip1(R182E) to localize with HEG1 in cells and found that this mutant was not targeted to mito-mCherry-HEG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Thus, in living cells, Rasip1 recruitment to HEG1 is lost when a point mutant disrupts its capacity to bind Rap1.

Here, we report that Rasip1, a Rap1 binding protein required for vascular development, binds directly to the cytoplasmic domain (tail) of HEG1, independent of KRIT1. Silencing HEG1 prevented Rasip1 targeting to EC junctions, furthermore the HEG1 cytoplasmic domain could re-localize Rasip1 in living cells. We mapped the Rasip1 binding site in HEG1 to a 9 residue peptide that is highly conserved in vertebrates and found that deletion of this sequence blocks the capacity of HEG1 to bind to Rasip1 and to recruit Rasip1 in cells. Similarly, we mapped the HEG1 binding site in Rasip1 to its central region, containing an FHA domain, and found that deletion of this domain abolished the capacity of Rasip1 to translocate to cell-cell contacts, to inhibit ROCK activity, and to maintain EC junctional integrity. Rap1 activity regulates the function and localization of Rasip1; using molecular modeling we designed and validated a well-folded mutant, Rasip1(R182E), that failed to bind Rap1. Rasip1(R182E) also failed to associate with the HEG1 tail in cells and lost the capacity to inhibit ROCK and maintain EC junctional integrity. These studies establish that the interaction of HEG1 and Rasip1, two proteins involved in vascular development, is regulated by Rap1 binding to Rasip1 and enables Rasip1 to localize to EC cell-cell junctions and to maintain vascular integrity.</p><p>The binding of a Rasip1 FHA domain to a 9 amino acid (TDVYYSPTS) region in HEG1 mediates Rasip1 localization and function in EC. Rasip1 is recruited to assembling EC cell-cell junctions and we observed that HEG1 silencing blocked this recruitment and that targeting mito-mCherry-HEG1 to mitochondria re-localized endogenous Rasip1 to these organelles. Mapping studies identified HEG1(1327-1335) as the critical region and deleting this site abrogated the capacity of HEG1 to bind Rasip1 and to recruit it to mito-mCherry-HEG1(1327-1335). Rasip(266-550), which contains an FHA domain, was necessary and sufficient for the interaction with the HEG1 tail. In sum, our studies show that the direct physical interaction of a HEG1 with Rasip1 targets Rasip1 to assembling EC junctions.</p><p>Rasip1 regulation of ROCK activity and vascular permeability is dependent on the interaction with HEG1. In contrast to wild-type Rasip1, HEG1-binding deficient Rasip1(∆334-539) was not recruited to endothelial cell-cell contacts during junction formation/remodeling. Groundbreaking studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xu et al., 2011</xref>) revealed that Rasip1 interacted with a RhoGAP (ARHGAP29) regulating RhoA and its effector ROCK1, the latter assayed by increased phospho-myosin light chain. More recent studies established that the Rasip1-ARHGAP29 axis also regulates endothelial permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Post et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>) in cooperation with Radil, which binds directly to the RhoGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Post et al., 2015</xref>). Our finding that HEG1-binding defective Rasip1(∆334-539), which did not reach EC junctions, failed to rescue both increased phospho-myosin and vascular permeability caused by Rasip1 silencing, supports the idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Post et al., 2015</xref>) that the junctional localization of Rasip1 is important for regulation of RhoA/ROCK and vascular permeability. We noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) that Rasip1(∆334-539) appears to accumulate on vesicles, suggesting that Rasip1(∆334-539) transport to the cell periphery is intact but that incorporation into cell-cell contacts depends on HEG1. In sum, our data show that Rasip1-HEG1 interaction is important for Rasip1 junctional localization and Rasip1-mediated regulation of ROCK signaling and endothelial barrier integrity.</p><p>The studies reported here establish HEG1 as a physical nexus for Rap1 signaling in the vasculature. We found that Rasip1 and KRIT1 bound to HEG1 at distinct binding sites. Rap1 binding regulates the capacity of both proteins to target to HEG1-containing junctions, inhibit ROCK activity, and maintain junctional integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Importantly, the <italic>Rasip1</italic> murine null phenotype is lethal by day E9.5 with much more profound vascular collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>) than is seen in the <italic>Heg1</italic> null (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kleaveland et al., 2009</xref>) suggesting that Rasip1 has functions that do not depend on HEG1 binding or recruitment to EC junctions. One compelling possibility is that Rasip1 null mice exhibit profound detachment of EC from their basement membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), perhaps due to inhibition of integrin activation. Indeed we observed that silencing HEG1 did not impair β1 integrin activation, whereas silencing Rasip1 did so. Thus, the Rap1-regulated interaction of HEG1 with Rasip1 localizes Rasip1 to those junctions and stabilizes them. Remarkably, Rap1 regulated association of KRIT1 with a second site in HEG1 also contributes to vascular development and integrity. Thus, HEG1 serves as physical nexus of Rap effectors that control both RhoA/ROCK signaling and vascular development.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11394.018</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>HEG1 supports vascular integrity by binding multiple Rap1 effectors.</title><p>In endothelial cells, Rap1 activation targets Rasip1 and KRIT1 to cell-cell junctions through a direct interaction with the transmembrane receptor HEG1.

In brief, His6-tagged tail proteins, containing an in vivo biotinylation peptide tag at the N-terminus, were expressed and purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. To perform pull-down assay using cell lysates, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) and HEK293T, transfected as indicated, were lysed in cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1%NP40, and 10% glycerol) plus protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). A total of 10 µg of immobilized bead-bound proteins was added to 350 µg of clarified lysates. Reactions were kept at 4°C for 4 hours while rotating. After washing the beads with lysis buffer, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE.

Recombinant His-tagged Rasip1 RA domain (residues 134-285), wild-type and R182E polypeptides were purified by nickel-affinity chromatography following standard procedures. The His-tag was removed by cleavage with tobacco etch virus protease overnight, and the protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex-75. The protein concentration for RA domain monomers was assessed using the A280 extinction coefficient of 24,980 M<sup>−1</sup>. Recombinant His-MBP-fusion Rasip1 central domain (residues 266-550) was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography following standard procedures and dialyzed into PBS. The protein concentration for the His-MBP-Rasip1 central domain was assessed using the A280 extinction coefficient of 26,930 M<sup>−1</sup>.

In brief, membrane filter inserts (pore size 0.4 µm, diameter 12 mm, Corning) were coated with fibronectin (10 µg/ml) for 1 hour at 37°C and placed in a 12-wells plate. Subsequently, fibronectin solution was removed and 1.2x10<sup>5</sup> Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) were seeded in each insert. When 80% confluent, cells were infected as indicated and grown for 72 hours. Lower chamber medium was replaced with transport buffer (phenol-free DMEM, 2%FBS). Medium in upper chamber was replaced with transport buffer containing 2 mg/ml 70kD-FITC-Dextran (Sigma). Inserts were then incubated at 37°C and transported sequentially to new plates containing transport buffer at 5 minute intervals for 30 min. FITC in lower chamber medium was measured for each timepoint as well as a 1:1000 dilution of the remaining solution in the upper chamber. Permeability coefficient was calculated for each condition and then normalized as fold change in permeability compared to control HUVEC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF and 1x Sigma protease inhibitors) was added at a 1:4 ratio (pellet weight:volume) to a frozen cell pellet (approximately 300mg) of either HeLa or HUVEC cells. The pellet was resuspended by pipetting up and down. 1 μl of benzonase was added per sample and the samples were sonicated for 30secs at amplitude 0.37 (10s pulse, 2s off). The samples were then nutated for 30min at 4°C and subsequently centrifuged at 18K G for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was then passed through a 20 μm filter and transferred to a fresh tube. 20 μl of pre-bound streptavidin beads (bound with either HEG1, HEG1ΔYF or ITGA2B) were added to the filtered lysates and incubated for 2 hours at 4°C with gentle agitation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation (1000g for 1 min), and the supernatant discarded. The beads were washed 1x with 500 μl of cold Lysis Buffer and 2x with 500 μl of cold Wash Buffer (50 mM Hepes-NaOH pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP40, 10% glycerol). The beads were then transferred to a new tube in 500 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, and washed again in 500 μl of Tris-HCl. The beads were resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, containing 500 ng of trypsin, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C with agitation overnight (~15 hours). In the morning, another 500 ng of trypsin was added (in 20 μL of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8), and the sample incubated at 37°C for an additional 4 hours. Finally, the supernatant was collected, and the beads washed twice in 40 μl of water. These washes were pooled with the collected supernatant. Formic acid was added to 2% to stop the digestion. The sample was subsequently vacuum-centrifuged to dryness and resuspended in 5 μl of 5% formic acid for LC/MS-MS. LC-MS/MS was performed using an Eksigent nano Ultra HPLC and a ThermoFisher Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer. Samples were loaded using an autosampler directly onto a home-made 75 μm ID x 10cm packed tip column filled with C18 particles (3 μm, Reprosil, Dr. Maish). Digested peptides were separated over a 90min acetonitrile gradient (2-–35% buffer B over 90 min, 35-80% buffer B over 7 min, hold buffer B at 80% 8 min, and 80-2% B in 2 min) at 200 nl/min. Buffer A was water with 0.1% formic acid; buffer B was 100% ACN with 0.1% formic acid. A data dependent mode was used to acquire an MS scan (60,000 resolution) followed by 10 MS/MS CID scans at low resolution. Peptides were dynamically excluded for 15 sec after being selected for MS/MS. MS/MS spectra were queried against the RefSeq human database (version 53) using Mascot version 2.3.02 (Matrix Science). Methionine residues were searched with a variable modification of +15.9949 Da, and asparagine and glutamine with a variable modification of + 0.984016. Peptides were queried using tryptic cleavage constraints with a maximum of two missed cleavages sites. The mass tolerances were 12 ppm for parent masses and 0.6 Da for fragment masses.

The model with the highest confidence score was based on the Radil RA domain structure (PDB 3EC8, 100% confidence, 51% sequence identity). PISA (Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies) software suggested that the biological assembly of the Radil RA domain structure is a dimer. The Radil dimer model was generated using the symmetry related molecule from the crystal structure and the Rasip1 RA domain dimer generated using those coordinates. The KRIT1 FERM F1 subdomain in complex with Rap1 (PDB 4HDO) was superimposed with the Rasip1 RA domain (RMSD 1.84 Å2 for 74 amino acids) to generate the Rasip1 RA domain complex with Rap1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>HUVEC were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with PBS, and subsequently fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor (Kari Alitalo), and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript reports novel, interesting and important findings that add to our understanding of endothelial cell function. The paper is very clearly written and the study is very systematic and thorough and of a high conceptional and technical level.

In response to this comment, we tested if HEG1 could regulate the interaction between Rap1 and Rasip1. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>, we tested the interaction of Rap1-V12 with Rasip1 in HEG1-silenced cells or by addition of the HEG1 cytoplasmic domain (5uM) peptide and show that neither of these conditions affects the interaction between Rasip1 and Rap1-V12. Thus, HEG1 does not regulate the Rasip1-Rap1 interaction, but does enable Rap1-bound Rasip1 to localize to cell-cell junctions..</p><p><italic>Or does KRIT1 feed RAP1 to RASIP1 to enable interaction with HEG1 even if their binding to HEG is independent per structure-function studies?</italic> </p><p>We were unable to discern a role for KRIT1 in regulating the HEG1-Rasip1 interaction <italic>in vitro,</italic> furthermore, in cells, Rasip1 can interact with HEG1 independent of KRIT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Thus, it seems unlikely that KRIT1’s role is to feed Rap to Rasip1 to allow its interaction with HEG1.

We have performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A-C</xref>) and tested the binding of Rasip1 with either ARHGAP29 or Radil. As shown in this figure, silencing HEG1 expression does not alter the co-immunoprecipitation of Radil or ARHGAP29 with Rasip1.

We rescued these phenotypes by expressing shRNA-resistant murine HEG1.
