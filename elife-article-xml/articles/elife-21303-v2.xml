This tissue is highly organized and comprises a variety of different nerve cells, including amacrine cells. Together, these cells process incoming light and then trigger electrical signals that travel to the brain, where they are translated into an image. Changes in the nerve cell composition of the retina, or in how the cells connect to each other, can alter the visual information that travels to the brain.</p><p>The nerve cells of the retina are formed before a young animal opens its eyes for the first time. Proteins called transcription factors – which regulate the expression of genes – tightly control how the retina develops. For example, a transcription factor called Pax6 drives the development of amacrine cells. Several other transcription factors control the production of Pax6 by binding to a section of DNA known as the “α-enhancer”. However, it is not clear how regulating Pax6 production influences the development of specific sets of amacrine cells.</p><p>Kim et al. reveal that a protein known as Tgfb1i1 interacts with two transcription factors to form a “complex” that binds to the α-enhancer and blocks the production of a particular form of Pax6. In experiments performed in mice, the loss of Tgfb1i1 led to increased production of this form of Pax6, which resulted in the retina containing more of a certain type of amacrine cell that produce a molecule called GABA. Mice lacking Tgfb1i1 show a stronger response to light and are therefore comparable to people who are too sensitive to light. On the other hand, mice with a missing a section of the α-enhancer DNA have fewer amacrine cells releasing GABA and become less sensitive to light and are comparable to people who have difficulty detecting weaker light signals.</p><p>The findings of Kim et al. suggest that an individual’s sensitivity to light is related, at least in part, to the mixture of amacrine cells found in their retina, which is determined by certain transcription factors that target the α-enhancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21303.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21303.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Pax6</kwd><kwd>LIM domain protein</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>cell fate determination</kwd><kwd>visual adaptation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2009-00424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jin Woo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001321</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2006-2004289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Kyung Hwa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01-EY013760</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levine</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2013-056566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jin Woo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2014R1A2A2A01003069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jin Woo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Regulation of Pax6 expression through the α-enhancer fine-tunes amacrine cell subtype number, and consequently, the visual output of the retina.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The retina is a primary sensory tissue that receives light stimulus and converts it into electrical signals, which are then sent to the brain for further processing. After light detection by rod and cone photoreceptors, the first step in visual processing occurs in bipolar cells that are either stimulated or inhibited by light-absorbed photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Masland, 2012</xref>). The activities of bipolar cells are then tuned by horizontal cells while they receive visual input from the photoreceptors and by amacrine cells while they deliver the signals to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Masland, 2012</xref>). The amacrine cells do not simply convey the signals from bipolar cells, but they also invert the signals by releasing inhibitory neurotransmitters such as <bold>γ</bold>-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine. Therefore, even subtle changes in the composition and connectivity of amacrine cell subsets might alter the output of the retina, modifying the visual information sent to the brain.</p><p>The neurons of the vertebrate retina develop in an ordered fashion from multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cepko, 2014</xref>). A number of transcription factors with precise temporal and spatial expression patterns control the composition of retinal neurons via the hierarchical and reciprocal regulation of other transcription factor expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zagozewski et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the alterations of transcription factors that specify retinal neuron subtypes should modify visual output of mature retina. Those transcription factors include Pax6 in amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marquardt et al., 2001</xref>), Vsx2 in bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 1994</xref>), Otx2 in bipolar cells and photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koike et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishida et al., 2003</xref>), and Lhx2 and Sox2 in Müller glia and certain amacrine subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Melo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). These transcription factors are not only expressed in the earlier optic structures to play critical roles in the eye and brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Danno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glaser et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yun et al., 2009</xref>), but also in the mature retinal neurons to support the survival and functions of the neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Melo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying the recurrent expression of transcription factors in the retinal lineage are still largely unknown.</p><p>Pax6 is one of the earliest transcription factors expressed in the eye field, and as such, it is considered as a master regulator of eye development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashery-Padan and Gruss, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson and Van Heyningen, 1995</xref>). Pax6 contains two DNA-binding domains—a paired domain (PD) and a homeodomain (HD)—linked via a glycine-rich domain, and activates target gene transcription through its C-terminal proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich (PST) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Epstein et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 1999a</xref>). Multiple <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements govern <italic>Pax6</italic> expression in various mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kammandel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 1999b</xref>). The ‘α-enhancer’, located within intron 4 of the <italic>Pax6</italic> gene, is active in the retina from embryo to adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kammandel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marquardt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Plaza et al., 1995</xref>). This retina-specific enhancer activity sustains in RPCs in the peripheral retina of the embryos and regulates neuronal differentiation in a context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marquardt et al., 2001</xref>). In the mature eye, the α-enhancer is active in cells of the ciliary body and amacrine cells of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marquardt et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The α-enhancer contains multiple binding sites for transcription factors, including the auto-stimulatory Pax6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kammandel et al., 1999</xref>), the stimulatory Msx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kammandel et al., 1999</xref>) and Pou4f2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plaza et al., 1999</xref>), and the inhibitory Pax2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kammandel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schwarz et al., 2000</xref>) and Vax1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mui et al., 2005</xref>). Although the inhibition of α-enhancer activity by Vax1 has been shown to be crucial for the development of the retina-optic stalk border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mui et al., 2005</xref>), the roles the other transcription factors that bind the α-enhancer in the retina remain unclear. In this study, we show that regulation of <italic>Pax6</italic> expression through the α-enhancer fine tunes amacrine cell subtype composition, and consequently, the visual output of the retina.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Lhx3 and Tgfb1i1 as Pax6 α-enhancer binding proteins in mouse retina</title><p>According to DNase footprinting (DF) results, the <italic>Pax6</italic> α-enhancer contains four retina-specific transcription factor-binding sites called DF1–4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Plaza et al., 1995</xref>).

This inhibition of the α-enhancer is even more significant when Tgfb1i1 is co-expressed with both Lhx3 and Isl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). We hypothesized that multiple LIM domains of Tgfb1i1 allow it to form a multi-protein complex that blocks α-enhancer-dependent gene expression. To assess this, we co-expressed these LIM domain transcription factors with Lmo4 (LIM-domain-only 4), which prevents Isl1 and Lhx3 from interacting with one another or with other LIM domain-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thaler et al., 2002</xref>).

We further tested whether Tgfb1i1 binds Lhx3 and Isl1 separately or whether they form a complex of Lhx3-Tgfb1i1-Isl1.

Lmo4, in contrast, induces a dose-dependent decrease in the association between Isl1 and Lhx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest Tgfb1i1 links Isl1 and Lhx3 to form a hetero-tetrameric (or larger) complex while Lmo4 interferes with the complex formation.</p><p>It is possible Pax6 interacts with the homeodomains of Isl1 and Lhx3 to form a Pax6-LIM protein complex, since Pax6 reportedly interacts with various homeodomain-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Granger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mikkola et al., 2001</xref>).

Both the HD and LIM domains of Isl1 participated to interact with Pax6, thus Pax6 might compete with Tgfb1i1 and Lhx3 to bind Isl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, top; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>The DF3 and DF4, which are separated by an auto-regulatory PBS, are respective targets of Isl1 and Lhx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). Thus, Pax6 binding to the PBS may hinder the binding of Isl1-Tgfb1i1-Lhx3 complex to the DF3 and DF4 sequences, and vice versa. Using ChIP analyses in the cultured cells, we found Isl1, Lhx3, and Tgfb1i1 reduce the binding of Pax6 to the α-enhancer when all three are co-expressed but not when expressed individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, three right graphs).

Considering the GABAergic identity of P6α amacrine cells and the increase of the cells in the <italic>Tgfb1i1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), it suggests this specific amacrine cell subset might disinhibit ON response by acting to other inhibitory retinal neurons in light-ON pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chávez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demb and Singer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eggers et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The low visual acuity and sustained light response of <italic>Tgfb1i1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse retinas suggest that the hypersensitivity of the mice to light interferes with their detection of dark objects on brighter backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, predicted views). To test this hypothesis, we presented the mice with two different types of visual stimuli. First, we trained dark-adapted mice to associate a water reward with a flashing light stimulus. Then, we counted correct water-licking events in response to various intensities of flash light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). <italic>Tgfb1i1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice not only learn this task faster than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>), but they also show more sensitive detection of the light stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). However, in a second visual task requiring mice to detect a drifting grate stimulus after a light stimulus, <italic>Tgfb1i1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice perform worse than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). This suggests <italic>Tgfb1i1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> retinas are more slowly re-sensitized after light exposure than WT retinas. Conversely, the re-sensitization of <italic>Pax6<sup>ΔPBS/ΔPBS</sup></italic> retinas is significantly faster than WT retinas, despite being less sensitive to light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results are consistent with our MEA recordings, which showed sustained and transient light responses in <italic>Tgfb1i1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Pax6<sup>ΔPBS/ΔPBS</sup></italic> RGCs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, the results suggest that P6α amacrine cells control the tone of light-ON retinal pathway. The overall tone of light-ON pathway was increased in <italic>Tgfb1i1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse retinas, which have extra P6α amacrine cells, whereas it is decreased in <italic>Pax6<sup>ΔPBS/ΔPBS</sup></italic> mouse retinas having reduced P6α amacrine cell number. Consequently, the light-ON pathway is augmented in <italic>Tgfb1i1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse retinas and attenuated in <italic>Pax6<sup>ΔPBS/ΔPBS</sup></italic> mouse retinas to make the retinas hypersensitive and hyposensitive to light stimulus, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–E</xref>). On the other hand, the <italic>Tgfb1i1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse retinas cannot be re-sensitized as fast as WT retinas, while the <italic>Pax6<sup>ΔPBS/ΔPBS</sup></italic> mouse retinas can be re-sensitized more quickly than WT retinas after a light stimulus. Given the GABAergic identity of the cells, the P6α amacrine cells may inhibit the activity of post-synaptic partners, which are not identified yet but can be predicted as an inhibitory neuron in light-ON pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).

Lhx3, for example, specifies motor neuron cell fate in the spinal cord by forming a hetero-hexameric complex with Isl1 and nuclear LIM interactor (NLI) for the binding to the promoter of the <italic>Mnx1/Hb9</italic> gene, whereas it specifies V2 interneuron cell fate by forming a hetero-tetrameric complex with NLI at the promoter of the <italic>Vsx2/Chx10</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thaler et al., 2002</xref>). Given that the various LIM homeodomain transcription factors, including Lhx2, Lhx3, Lhx4, and Lhx9, share a consensus target sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gehring et al., 1994</xref>), we speculate Isl1 partners with different LIM homeodomain transcription factors in a cell-context-dependent manner. In contrast to its relationship with Lhx3, Isl1 cooperates with Lhx2 to activate the α-enhancer in cultured cell lines (data not shown). However, this is unlikely to occur in vivo, because Lhx2 and Isl1 are expressed mutually exclusively in RPCs (Lhx2) and post-mitotic RGCs (Isl1) of the embryonic mouse retina, in GABAergic (Lhx2) and cholinergic amacrine cells (Isl1) in the mature retina, as well as in Müller glia (Lhx2) and ON bipolar cells (Isl1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balasubramanian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elshatory et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Lhx2<sup>flox/flox</sup>;P6α-Cre</italic> retinas, which lack Lhx2 expression in the Cre-active lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon et al., 2013</xref>), show no change in the number of <italic>Pax6</italic> α-enhancer-active cells (data not shown). This suggests Lhx2 may be dispensable for the activation of the <italic>Pax6</italic> α-enhancer in the mouse retina.</p><p>We propose that a Tgfb1i1 dimer links Isl1 and Lhx3 to form a hetero-tetrameric complex that represses the <italic>Pax6</italic> α-enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). The effects of Tgfb1i1 on the α-enhancer could be achieved by blocking Pax6’s access the PBS sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). Alternatively, Tgfb1i1 may also recruit transcriptional co-repressors, such as NCoR (nuclear receptor co-repressor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heitzer and DeFranco, 2006</xref>), to the <italic>Pax6</italic> α-enhancer. These negative effects of Tgfb1i1 on the <italic>Pax6</italic> α-enhancer can be antagonized by Lmo4, which is persistently co-expressed with Pax6 in the retina and interferes with the interactions between Tgfb1i1 and Lhx3 and/or Isl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duquette et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>). Retinas lacking <italic>Lmo4</italic> have fewer GABAergic amacrine cells than controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duquette et al., 2010</xref>), which suggests Lmo4 may positively affect <italic>Pax6</italic> α-enhancer-dependent GABAergic amacrine cell fate determination by inhibiting the formation of the LIM complex. However, the antagonistic regulation of the LIM complex by Tgfb1i1 and Lmo4 could not be applied to OFF bipolar cell fate determination, since OFF bipolar cell numbers are decreased commonly in <italic>Tgfb1i1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and Lmo4-cko mouse retinas. Our results suggest that Tgfb1i1 and Lmo4 might involve in the development of different OFF bipolar cell subsets. The numbers of Bhlhb5-positive OFF bipolar cell subsets were not altered significantly in <italic>Tgfb1i1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>), in contrast to a significant decrease in Lmo4-cko mouse retinas.</p><p>In addition to its canonical form, two alternative forms of Pax6, Pax6(5a) and Pax6ΔPD, are produced by alternative splicing and internal transcription initiation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Epstein et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mishra et al., 2002</xref>). Pax6ΔPD does not affect Pax6 target gene expression via the conserved PBS (data not shown). Instead, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mikkola et al., 2001</xref>), Pax6ΔPD may potentiate the expression of Pax6 target genes by interacting with full-length Pax6. This facilitation of Pax6-induced gene transcription by Pax6ΔPD may also occur with the <italic>Pax6</italic> α-enhancer, resulting in a feed-forward activation of the α-enhancer. Alternatively, it may bind another promoter element containing the Pax6 homeodomain target DNA sequence (TAATT(/C)NA(/C)ATTA). Therefore, future studies will be needed to identify the targets of Pax6ΔPD in RPCs and post-mitotic retinal neurons. This will provide a full understanding of the distinctive roles Pax6 and Pax6ΔPD play in the retina.</p><p>Although the mechanisms of light adaptation and re-sensitization in the photoreceptors are fairly well-understood, how the inner retina contributes to these mechanisms is less clear. Acting downstream of rod bipolar cells that deliver visual signals from rod photoreceptors, A17 GABAergic amacrine cells provide a direct feedback inhibition to the rod bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chávez et al., 2010</xref>). In parallel, an unidentified subset of GABAergic amacrine cells is also proposed to inhibit rod bipolar cells at the downstream of ON-cone bipolar cells, which can be activated by AII amacrine cells in the rod pathway as well as by daylight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demb and Singer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eggers et al., 2013</xref>). GABAergic inhibition to the rod bipolar cells could be reduced in <italic>Tgfb1i1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse retinas, leading to sustained ON responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Conversely, the ON pathway in <italic>Pax6<sup>ΔPBS/ΔPBS</sup></italic> mouse retinas is activated more transiently and is also more readily re-activated by subsequent visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Therefore, the P6α amacrine cells might attenuate those GABAergic inhibitions to rod bipolar cells and prevent premature inactivation of rod pathway. However, future studies should identify molecular and electrophysiological identities of the P6α amacrine cells and their pre- and post-synaptic partners to fully understand this visual adaptive circuits in the inner retina.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructs and mouse lines</title><p>cDNA clones were generous gifts from Dr. Motoko Shibanuma (Hic-5/Tgfb1i1) and Dr. Seth Blackshaw (Lhx2 and Lhx9).

Custom-designed head plates were attached to the skull with small screws (Small Parts) and dental cement (Lang Dental).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-2"><title>B.behavior test</title><sec id="s26"><title>Visual detection task</title><p>In this task, head plate-implanted mice (P45-P80) were trained to lick a water nozzle when they detected a visual stimulus (114 Lux). All mice used for this task were water-deprived for 1 day before beginning the training protocol. For the visual stimulus, we presented a full-field flashing light five times (10 Hz for 500 ms) through a gamma-corrected LCD monitor placed 10 cm from the left eye. Each stimulus trial began with a visual stimulus (500 ms in duration) and ended with a 2 s inter-trial period. Non-stimulus trials were randomly interleaved with stimulus trials using custom code (Presentation). We detected each lick through a custom-made lickport (4.0 mm ID) using a transistor-based lickometer system. Licks detected during the final 2 s of stimulus trials (i.e., in the response window) were rewarded with 4 µl of water (on). We delivered water rewards by gravity into the lickport under the control of a solenoid valve. Licks detected during the response window of non-stimulus trials were punished with a mild air puff (300 ms) and a longer inter-trial interval (8 s, timeout) (off). We delivered compressed air puff punishments (10 psi) through a plastic tip (1.0 mm ID) located 2 cm from the face and controlled by a solenoid valve. Mice whose spontaneous lick rate during non-stimulus trials fell below 0.4 were advanced to the next phase. In the next phase, we measured lick rates in response to nine different intensities of visual stimuli presented randomly with equal probability.</p></sec><sec id="s27"><title>Visual adaptation task</title><p>We trained mice to discriminate a continuous light from a drifting grate stimulus presented after continuous light under a simple go/no-go protocol. Training proceeded in two steps: conditioning and discrimination. For conditioning (2–8 days), we trained each mouse to lick in response to continuous light. Each trial began with a continuous light (go stimulus, 2 s duration) and ended with an inter-trial period of 2 s. Licks detected in the final 2 s of the trial (i.e., in the response window) were rewarded with 10 µl of water for 2 s. During the conditioning phase, water rewards were still given after continuous light even if the animal failed to lick during the response window. Mice exceeding 300 licks within 1 hr were advanced to the discrimination phase. For discrimination (15 days), we trained mice to lick only when continuous light (2 s) was presented (go trial) and not to lick when a drifting horizontal grate stimulus (1 s) was presented after a continuous light stimulus (1 s) (no-go trial). All visual stimuli used for training were fixed at 57 Lux. We never presented the same type of stimulus more than three consecutive times. Licks within the response window of go trials were rewarded with water (4 µl) for 2 s, and licks within the response window of no-go trials were punished with mild air puffs (300 ms) and a longer inter-trial interval (8 s, timeout). Mice were neither rewarded nor punished for misses (i.e., no lick in a go trial) or correct rejections (i.e., no lick in a no-go trial). Training ended when the mouse stopped licking for 10 consecutive go trials.</p><p>Mice that reached threshold performance (lick rates in no-go trials &lt; 0.4) were advanced to the next phase. In the next phase, we presented five different intensities of a continuous light higher or equal to 57 lux before a drifting grate stimulus fixed at 57 lux. We presented all stimuli randomly with equal probability.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

This manuscript reports the identification of a new LIM domain protein Tgfb1i1 that forms a LIM protein complex with Lhx3 and Isl1 to inhibit the activity of the Pax6 α-enhancer and its auto-binding by Pax6. Site-directed mutagenesis of the α-enhancer, which transcribes the Pax6 isoform Pax6∆PD, leads to loss of GABAergic amacrine cells, whereas both Pax6∆PD overexpression and Tgfb1i1 inactivation, which augments the α-enhancer activity and overproduces Pax6∆PD, results in increased GABAergic amacrine cells in mice. Tgfb1i1 knockout and the α-enhancer mutant mice also display opposite physiological properties: sustained light responses versus more transient ones. This work is a comprehensive in-depth study of the α-enhancer machinery which has revealed a novel function of the little known Pax6∆PD isoform in the specification of a physiological amacrine cell subtype, thus representing a major extension of previous studies on an essential transcriptional regulator of retinal development.</p><p>1) The proposed model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> is inconsistent with previous reports of the <italic>Lmo4</italic> function and questionable. <italic>Lmo4</italic> is reported to extensively colocalize with Pax6, and its conditional ablation impairs development of both GABAergic and OFF cone bipolar cells whereas its overexpression promotes their differentiation (Duquette et al., PLoS One. 2010 Oct 7;5:e13232; Jin et al., Dev Neurobiol. 2016 Aug;76:900-915). <italic>Lmo4</italic> is thus required for OFF cone bipolar cell specification but the proposed model implies that <italic>Lmo4</italic> is not involved or even has an inhibitory effect on OFF cone bipolar development.</p><p>2) There are data that are inconsistent with each other and/or conclusions. For instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> shows Isl1 has no synergistic effect with Pax6 on α-enhancer activation but Figure 1—figure supplement 4B shows a strong effect. Tgfb1i1 is concluded to induce a dose-dependent increase in the association between Lhx3 and Isl1 but the top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> shows that the interaction between Lhx3 and Isl1 in the absence of Tgfb1i1 is just as strong as in the presence of Tgfb1i1. Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, why did Western blot using anti-flag detect a weak band in all lanes on one panel but not at all on the other two panels? Western with anti-HA had a similar phenomenon. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref> also show inconsistent Vsx2 cell number – the mutant retina has a much thicker layer of Vsx2 cells than that of the control (or are these images in different magnification?). All these raise concerns about data consistency and interpretation.</p><p>3) Figure 2—figure supplement 4: Except for some cells co-labeled by Pax6 and GFP, hardly any cells can be seen that are co-stained by other markers and GFP in images shown in A and B. The lack of any examples of convincing colabeled cells raises concerns about the validity of the quantification data in D which show significant increase of Pax6+, Gad67+, calretinin+, and Bhlhb5+(AC) cells and decrease of Vsx2+, G0α+, recoverin+(BP) and Bhlhb5+(BP) cells. Examples of colabeled cells should be displayed at a higher magnification to convince readers their existence. This applies also to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> where examples of cells colabeled by GABA and GFP should be shown. Another issue is that the authors claim that Pax6 overexpression increased ChAT cells but panel D indicates this is not statistically significant. In addition, what is the scale on images? Is the second image of panel A shown at a higher magnification than others? The ONL, INL and GCL labels on images are too small to be seen and please spell out these abbreviations in the figure legend.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: No statistical significance is given in panels C and D, which makes it difficult to understand and interpret the data. Also, what does the arrowhead in panel B indicate? Please spell it out in the legend.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper examines the transcriptional regulation of Pax6 α-enhancer by Lhx3 and Tgfb1i1, and their involvement in the development of the GABAergic amacrine cells in the mouse retina. Pax6 plays a critic role in eye development from the establishment of eye field to the formation of retina and lens. In the retina, Pax6 is expressed throughout retinogenesis and its expression remains in the amacrine and ganglion cells post-development. Prior work in the field has shown that multiple Pax6 transcripts arise from alternative transcriptional initiation and/or alternative splicing. In addition, studies have identified Pax6 α-enhancer, a regulatory region in the intron of Pax6 gene, which contains multiple binding sites for transcription factors including the auto-stimulatory PAX6 binding sites. Nevertheless, how the expression of different Pax6 transcripts is regulated and what are the roles of Pax6 in amacrine subtypes remains unclear.</p><p>Earlier work has shown that several additional transcription factors, notably the LIM-homeodomain transcription factors and their negative regulators LMO proteins, are expressed by retinal bipolar, horizontal, amacrine, and ganglion cells. Genetic inactivation of these factors was shown to affect the diversification of retinal neuronal population. Here, Kim et al. report that α-enhancer is specifically activated in GABAergic amacrine cells. By using a proteomic screen, ChIP and in vitro assays, they show that LHX3 and TGFB1I1 interact, bind to the α-enhancer, and inhibit α-enhancer activity in vitro. Tgfb1i1-null retinas display higher α-enhancer activity and generate more GABAergic amacrine cells and fewer OFF bipolar cells. In contrast, removal of Pax6 auto-stimulatory sequences in the α-enhancer in vivo leads to a reduction in Pax6ΔPD and in fewer GABAergic amacrine cells but more OFF bipolar cells. Furthermore, these mutant mice exhibit altered visual acuity and adaptation. Overall, this is a well-performed study and results presented in the paper make a case for the model in which Lhx3 and Tgfb1i1 negatively regulate α-enhancer and the development of GABAergic amacrine cells. However, there are some unresolved issues:</p><p>1) This title and manuscript emphasize the involvement of LIM protein, LHX3 in particular, in regulating α-enhancer. There is insufficient data in vivo to support it. The main problem is that GABAergic amacrine cells are mostly born during embryogenesis and peak at E14 (Voinescu et al., 2009, J. Comp. Neurol.). Giving the late-onset of Lhx3 expression at P7 (Elshatory et al., 2007, J. Neurosci.), it is unlikely that Lhx3 regulates the development of GABAergic amacrine cells by regulating α-enhancer. The binding of LHX3 to α-enhancer in vivo (ChIP-PCR results) and LHX3-TGFB1I1 interaction could occur in the bipolar cells, which may or may not be of any functional significance. Experiments such as knocking out or knocking down Lhx3 during amacrine development are desirable to address the role of Lhx3 directly. Also, the authors did a nice CRISPR/Cas9 experiment to demonstrate the necessity of PBS, has a similar experiment done on the LHX3 binding site in DF4?</p><p>2) When are the increased GABAergic amacrine cells generated in Tgfb1i1-nulls? This is an important question especially in the light of the late expression of Lhx3. Analysis of GABAergic amacrine cells before Lhx3 expression onset, such as anti-GAD65/67 labeling at P3-5, is needed to determine Tgfb1i1's precise role, and to indirectly support the involvement of Lhx3 in suppressing α-enhancer in bipolar cells – a possible cell fate conversion from bipolar to amacrine cells in Tgfb1i1-nulls.</p><p>3) The negative role of LHX3 and TGFB1I1 in the development of GABAergic amacrine cells is an interesting finding. However, their placement in the genetic TF GABAergic amacrine cascade is left to imagination. The story would benefit from trying to analyze how Lhx3 and Tgfb1i1 are related to other known genes of GABAergic amacrine cells such as whether Ptf1 and Bhlhb5 expression is affected in Tgfb1i1-null retinas during amacrine development.</p><p>4) The novel finding of GAD67 and P6α-GFP colabeling (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) shows that α-enhancer activity is specific to GABAergic amacrine cells. Interestingly, only a subgroup of GAD67+ cells express P6α-GFP. It is possible that P6α-GFP+ cells represent a unique amacrine subtype. If so, what is the subtype(s) and how is related to the change in visual function seen in Tgfb1i1-nulls? Similarly, is the increase of amacrine cells specific to the INL or GCL or both? It seems like more specific to the INL but it is difficult to tell from the figures unless separate quantification of each layer is done.</p><p>5) The visual function tests are done at P60, however, the changes in retinal neurons are assessed at earlier stages. It is somewhat uncertain if there is any additional change in the later stage retinas.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Kim et al. investigate the role of the Pax6 α enhancer in retinal neuron fate determination. They find that LIM proteins form a complex (consisting of Isl1, Lhx3, and Tgfb1i1) that inhibits transcription from this enhancer and thereby inhibits amacrine cell fate. The mechanism appears to involve preventing Pax6 itself from binding the α enhancer. Analysis of Tgfb1i1 and Pax6 binding site (deltaPBS) mutant mice suggest that the two proteins may regulate a cell fate choice between GABAergic amacrine and OFF bipolar cell. Behavior and physiology studies demonstrate that amacrine cell number influences sensitivity to light flashes, both in the context of low-threshold detection and light adaptation. I very much like the authors' approach of linking developmental mechanisms to visual function. The molecular studies are thorough and potentially very interesting. However, there are some significant issues with the manuscript in its present form that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) The clarity of the manuscript is not sufficient for the reader to understand how the data support the authors' assertions. The major problem here is the structure of the manuscript. Considering the complexity of the voluminous molecular data, there is nowhere near enough explanation. Take for example the panel labeled &quot;Figure 1—figure supplement 6.&quot; This is a remarkable amount of work, but the authors do not make it easy for the reader to understand. The figure legend says simply &quot;293T cells were transfected with constructs encoding the indicated protein fragments.&quot; Then, in panel L, there is a model figure. Why do the authors feel justified in drawing the model figure this way? I studied the figure for about half an hour, and eventually figured it out. I agree with the authors about their model. But given the format of the e<italic>Life</italic> journal there is no good reason to make the reader do this amount of work for him or herself.</p><p>Moreover, this figure is not an isolated case. Another example (one of many I could have selected): In the subsection “Pax6 and LIM protein complex linked by Tgfb1i1 regulate the α-enhancer antagonisticall” the authors write: &quot;Supporting this hypothesis, Lhx3 and Tgfb1i1 antagonized the activation of the α-enhancer in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>; Figure 1—figure supplement 4A-C).&quot; The reader is thereby directed to examine 5 bar graphs that together contain over 70 experiments. These experiments involve not only Lhx3 and Tgfb1i1, but a handful of other molecules (<italic>Lmo4</italic>, Isl1, other Lhx proteins) Which of these many graphs are the ones that support the assertion in the text? The figure legends are again no help. I eventually came to the conclusion that I agree with this particular assertion. But again, given the <italic>ELife</italic> format there is no reason to make things this difficult. I think a reasonable reader might easily decide (at least for the molecular part) that the data do not support the conclusions of this paper – not because the data are incorrect, but because they are not presented in a way that allows the reader to see why the authors came to their conclusion.</p><p>To improve clarity the authors could:</p><p>A) Use more than four main-text figures, which would allow each figure to have a more focused theme, and would allow incorporation of certain key supplemental data into those figures.</p><p>B) Pare away unnecessary data, especially from summary graphs that the authors rely on to make key points highlighted in the text.</p><p>C) Write figure legends that highlight key points in complex figures, rather than simply describing what was done.</p><p>D) Provide more rationale for why certain experiments were undertaken, both in the Introduction and as the topic sentence in each section of the Results.</p><p>2) It's a very compelling idea that a LIM complex comprising Isl1/Lhx3/Tgfb1i1 can regulate a cell fate switch between OFF bipolars and GABAergic amacrine cells. However, I'm unclear on the cellular context in which this is supposed to act. All of these proteins are expressed by postmitotic neurons, mainly in the first postnatal week. So the complex can only exist in neurons. But cell fate decisions are typically made at the progenitor stage, upon cell cycle exit. And GABAergic amacrine cells are typically born before P0 (Cherry et al., 2009, PNAS; Voinescu et al., 2009, J. Comp. Neurol.). So how does the cell fate switch actually work? Is there a transdifferentiation of bipolar cells into amacrines in Tgfb1i1 mutants? Or does the window of GABAergic amacrine cell genesis extend longer, such that they keep getting born when it's supposed to be time for OFF bipolar genesis? Or could the authors have missed the existence of the complex in progenitors? Without a plausible cellular mechanism I remain somewhat skeptical of the notion that this is a simple cell fate switch.</p><p>3) In the subsection “Positive correlation between Pax6 α-enhancer-driven Pax6ΔPD expression and GABAergic amacrine cell development” the authors conclude that: &quot;Pax6deltaPD selectively supports GABAergic amacrine cell development but inhibits OFF bipolar cell development.&quot; This seems an oversimplification given the data. Full-length Pax6 also increases GABA amacrine cell fate, and suppresses Vsx1 bipolar cell fate. So these features are not selective to the deltaPD version of Pax6. It may not even be true that deltaPD is more efficient than full-length Pax6 at inducing the GABAergic fate, as suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref> (using anti-GABA as a marker), since when Gad67 is used as a marker they appear equally efficient (Figure 2—figure supplement 4).</p><p>Also, if the authors wish to claim a selective effect on GABAergic amacrine cells, they should show that glycinergic amacrines are not affected in their Pax6 gain-of-function experiments, and/or in the deltaPBS mutant.</p><p>4) In the physiology/behavior section, the model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and much of the Results/Discussion focuses on the idea of feedback inhibition to ON or rod bipolar cells. I'm not convinced that these are ON pathway or rod pathway-specific phenotypes. All of the MEA and behavior experiments were done in a light regime where the test stimulus was a brief light stimulus presented in the dark. We don't know what would happen with the inverse paradigm. Even if we did, it is still pretty speculative to get into circuit mechanisms here. The two mutant mice manipulate amacrine cell number in opposite directions. A conservative hypothesis about the physiological effects of these manipulations is that they affect overall inhibitory tone. The interpretations of physiology and behavior experiments probably shouldn't go beyond this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21303.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Reviewer #1: […] 1) The proposed model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> is inconsistent with previous reports of the Lmo4 function and questionable. Lmo4 is reported to extensively colocalize with Pax6, and its conditional ablation impairs development of both GABAergic and OFF cone bipolar cells whereas its overexpression promotes their differentiation (Duquette et al., PLoS One. 2010 Oct 7;5:e13232; Jin et al., Dev Neurobiol. 2016 Aug;76:900-915). Lmo4 is thus required for OFF cone bipolar cell specification but the proposed model implies that Lmo4 is not involved or even has an inhibitory effect on OFF cone bipolar development.</italic> </p><p>As the reviewer indicated, <italic>Lmo4</italic> was suggested to support not only the development of GABAergic amacrine cells but also that of OFF bipolar cells in previous reports. Here, we show Tgfb1i1 inhibits GABAergic amacrine cell fate, although it also supports OFF bipolar cell fate like <italic>Lmo4</italic>. The supportive role of <italic>Lmo4</italic> in the development of both retinal subtypes was proposed based on the reduced numbers of Bhlhb5-positive cells in <italic>Lmo4</italic>-cko mouse retinas (Duquette et al., 2010). Interestingly, the numbers of Bhlhb5-positive type-2 OFF bipolar cell subsets are not significantly changed in Tgfb1i1-KO and Pax6(ΔPBS/ΔPBS) mouse retinas in comparison to WT littermates, whereas Vsx1-positive OFF bipolar cell numbers were significantly altered in those mutant retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref>). The results are also contrary to the changes of Bhlhb5-positive GABAergic amacrine cell subsets, which are increased in Tgfb1i1-ko retinas but are decreased in Pax6(ΔPBS/ΔPBS) retinas. The results therefore suggest that Tgfb1i1 and <italic>Lmo4</italic> might be involved in the development of different OFF bipolar cell subsets, thus the loss of Tgfb1i1 causes the defects in the development of OFF bipolar cell subsets different from those affected in <italic>Lmo4</italic>-cko mice.To avoid the confusion that can be imposed by these complicated relationships (and also to follow the suggestion of other reviewer), we removed the diagram from the revised paper but still wrote in the text (subsection “Tgfb1i1<sup>-/-</sup> retinas have excessive Pax6 α-enhancer-active GABAergic amacrine cells”, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) There are data that are inconsistent with each other and/or conclusions.

Thus, it interferes with the interaction between Isl1 and Lhx3. On the contrary, dimeric (or oligomeric) Tgfb1i1 might be prevalent and forms a heterotetramer with Isl1 and Lhx3, once Tgfb1i1 become abundant (please see Author response image 1).

There is insufficient data</italic> in vivo <italic>to support it. The main problem is that GABAergic amacrine cells are mostly born during embryogenesis and peak at E14 (Voinescu et al., 2009, J. Comp. Neurol.). Giving the late-onset of Lhx3 expression at P7 (Elshatory et al., 2007, J. Neurosci.), it is unlikely that Lhx3 regulates the development of GABAergic amacrine cells by regulating α-enhancer. The binding of LHX3 to α-enhancer in vivo (ChIP-PCR results) and LHX3-TGFB1I1 interaction could occur in the bipolar cells, which may or may not be of any functional significance.</italic> </p><p>We agree to the reviewer’s opinion that Lhx3 unlikely regulates the development of GABAergic amacrine cells, which are mainly born in the embryonic mouse retina. Here, we propose a model that Lhx3 specifies OFF bipolar cell fate from the post-mitotic neurons, which were born in the embryonic mouse retina and might have default GABAergic amacrine cell fates, in a Tgfb1i1 sensitive manner.</p><p>Our subretinal electroporation results show that Pax6ΔPD could support GABAergic amacrine cell fate autonomously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). It implicates Pax6ΔPD plays a role in generating or maintaining GABAergic amacrine cells in the post-natal mouse retina. Given the lack of newborn GABAergic amacrine cells in the post-natal mouse retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C,E</xref>; Voinescu et al., (2009) J. Comp. Neurol. 517, 737–750), the electroporation results suggest that Pax6-ΔPD might not support the birth of the cells in the post-natal mouse retina. The Pax6ΔPD might not be important for the development of GABAergic amacrine cells in the embryo either, because the numbers of GABAergic amacrine cells in P4 Pax6(ΔPBS/ΔPBS) mouse retinas are not greatly different from those in WT and Tgfb1i1-KO mouse retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Therefore, the results suggest that Pax6ΔPD supports the maintenance of the GABAergic amacrine cell fate in the post-natal mouse retina.</p><p>On the other hand, Lhx3 and Tgfb1i1 likely contribute to specifying OFF bipolar cell fate, which might be achieved by overcoming default GABAergic amacrine cell fate, via the inhibition of Pax6 α-enhancer-driven Pax6ΔPD expression. In support of this idea, the numbers of OFF bipolar cells, which had incorporated BrdU and exited cell cycle during embryogenesis, were increased in P7 Pax6(ΔPBS/ΔPBS) mouse retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D,F</xref>), in which the Pax6ΔPD is decreased by a half of normal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Conversely, the chance for the fate transition to the OFF bipolar cells was decreased in Tgfb1i1-KO mouse retinas, which express excessive Pax6ΔPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Based on the opposite changes of GABAergic amacrine and OFF bipolar cell numbers in those two mutant mouse retinas, our results suggest that the BrdU-labeled OFF bipolar cells might be originated from GABAergic amacrine cells, which are not fully differentiated, via transdifferentiation during post-natal days.</p><p>Indirect evidence for the transdifferentiation of amacrine cell to bipolar cell has been given by a study traced the fates of Ptf1a-Cre-affected amacrine cells (please see the presence of Chx10;R26R double-positive bipolar cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> of Fujitani et al. (2006) Development 133, 4439-50). However, it is unclear whether those bipolar cells derived from Ptf1a-Cre-active embryonic amacrine cells are OFF types. The direct conversion of GABAergic amacrine cells to OFF bipolar cells and the inactivation of Pax6 α-enhancer in this process should be confirmed in future study by tracing fates of individual cell in the post-natal mouse retina.</p><p><italic>Experiments such as knocking out or knocking down Lhx3 during amacrine development are desirable to address the role of Lhx3 directly.</italic> </p><p>Lhx3-KO mice are perinatally lethal (Sheng et al. (1996) Science 272, 1004-7), thus we could not have a chance to analyze the post-natal retinal phenotypes. Lhx3-flox mice, which can be useful for deleting Lhx3 gene in the embryonic retina where amacrine cells develop, are not available, yet. We, thus, knocked Lhx3 gene out by CRISPR/Cas9 using subretinal electroporation of two independent sgRNAs against Lhx3 to P0 mouse retinas.</p><p>We found that cells expressing Lhx3 sgRNA and Cas9 (indirectly labeled by GFP expressed from co-electroporated pCAGIG construct) were strongly enriched in the bottom half of INL where amacrine cells are enriched, whereas the cells express only Cas9 were enriched in the top half of INL where bipolar and Muller glial cells are enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Moreover, significant numbers of those Lhx3 sgRNA-expressing (i.e., GFP-positive) cells are positive to GABAergic amacrine cell markers (Gad67, GABA, and Bhlhb5), whereas only few of Cas9-only control cells express those markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B,D</xref>). On the contrary, almost none of Lhx3 sgRNA-expressing cell expresses OFF bipolar cell marker Vsx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B,D</xref>). Overall, the results are consistent with those of Tgfb1i1-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, as we explain in the above, the results implicate that Lhx3 and Tgfb1i1 might specify OFF bipolar cell fate by suppressing default GABAergic amacrine cell fate, which is supported by Pax6ΔPD, in the post-natal mouse retina.</p><p><italic>Also, the authors did a nice CRISPR/Cas9 experiment to demonstrate the necessity of PBS, has a similar experiment done on the LHX3 binding site in DF4?</italic> </p><p>We had also tried to delete DF3 and DF4 by CRISPR/Cas9 system, but we failed to obtain the mice with deletions in those sequences. We think deletion(s) of off-target genes by those DF3 and DF4 sgRNAs might cause the lethality, as their off-target probabilities were higher than those for the PBS sgRNAs.</p><p><italic>2) When are the increased GABAergic amacrine cells generated in Tgfb1i1-nulls? This is an important question especially in the light of the late expression of Lhx3. Analysis of GABAergic amacrine cells before Lhx3 expression onset, such as anti-GAD65/67 labeling at P3-5, is needed to determine Tgfb1i1's precise role, and to indirectly support the involvement of Lhx3 in suppressing α-enhancer in bipolar cells – a possible cell fate conversion from bipolar to amacrine cells in Tgfb1i1-nulls.</italic> </p><p>By following the reviewer’s suggestion, we analyzed with P4 Tgfb1i1-KO and Pax6(ΔPBS/ΔPBS) mouse retinas, and found the numbers of GABAergic amacrine cell are not changed significantly in comparison to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). The results, together with other results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C-F</xref>, implicate that Tgfb1i1 may not suppress the production of GABAergic amacrine cells but may negatively affect the maintenance of the cells (please see our first answer to the reviewer’s comment 1).</p><p><italic>3) The negative role of LHX3 and TGFB1I1 in the development of GABAergic amacrine cells is an interesting finding. However, their placement in the genetic TF GABAergic amacrine cascade is left to imagination. The story would benefit from trying to analyze how Lhx3 and Tgfb1i1 are related to other known genes of GABAergic amacrine cells such as whether Ptf1 and Bhlhb5 expression is affected in Tgfb1i1-null retinas during amacrine development.</italic> </p><p>Ptf1a is not expressed in mature mouse retina, but it is expressed in the embryonic mouse retina and play important role in the development of amacrine cells (Fujitani et al. (2006) Development 133, 4439-50). Thus, we examined the distribution of Bhlhb5-positive cells in the mature retinas. We found the numbers of Bhlhb5-positive GABAergic amacrine cell subsets were increased in P14 Tgfb1i1-KO mouse retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Moreover, those include Pax6 α-enhancer active cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, it is unclear whether Lhx3 and Tgfb1i1 regulate Bhlhb5 expression directly or indirectly via Pax6 α-enhancer inhibition. The mechanism should be studied separately.</p><p><italic>4) The novel finding of GAD67 and P6α-GFP colabeling (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) shows that α-enhancer activity is specific to GABAergic amacrine cells. Interestingly, only a subgroup of GAD67+ cells express P6α-GFP. It is possible that P6α-GFP+ cells represent a unique amacrine subtype. If so, what is the subtype(s) and how is related to the change in visual function seen in Tgfb1i1-nulls?</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, we currently have no clear idea about the molecular and electrophysiological identities of Pax6 α-GFP-positive GABAergic amacrine cells. The molecular and electrophysiological identifications of P6α GABAergic amacrine cells should be left for our future study.</p><p><italic>Similarly, is the increase of amacrine cells specific to the INL or GCL or both? It seems like more specific to the INL but it is difficult to tell from the figures unless separate quantification of each layer is done.</italic> </p><p>We counted the numbers of Pax6 α-GFP-positive cells in INL and GCL separately, and provide the results for the reviewers’ inspection only due to the limited space in the figure (please see Author response image 2). The results indicate that the changes are observed mainly in INL of the mouse retinas.</p><p><italic>5) The visual function tests are done at P60, however, the changes in retinal neurons are assessed at earlier stages. It is somewhat uncertain if there is any additional change in the later stage retinas.</italic> </p><p>We provide the retinal phenotypes of P60 mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>. Overall, the results are not significantly different from those at P14.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] 1) The clarity of the manuscript is not sufficient for the reader to understand how the data support the authors' assertions. The major problem here is the structure of the manuscript. Considering the complexity of the voluminous molecular data, there is nowhere near enough explanation. Take for example the panel labeled &quot;Figure 1—figure supplement 6.&quot; This is a remarkable amount of work, but the authors do not make it easy for the reader to understand. The figure legend says simply &quot;293T cells were transfected with constructs encoding the indicated protein fragments.&quot; Then, in panel L, there is a model figure. Why do the authors feel justified in drawing the model figure this way? I studied the figure for about half an hour, and eventually figured it out. I agree with the authors about their model.

Another example (one of many I could have selected): In the subsection “Pax6 and LIM protein complex linked by Tgfb1i1 regulate the α-enhancer antagonisticall” the authors write: &quot;Supporting this hypothesis, Lhx3 and Tgfb1i1 antagonized the activation of the α-enhancer in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>; Figure 1—figure supplement 4A-C).&quot; The reader is thereby directed to examine 5 bar graphs that together contain over 70 experiments. These experiments involve not only Lhx3 and Tgfb1i1, but a handful of other molecules (Lmo4, Isl1, other Lhx proteins) Which of these many graphs are the ones that support the assertion in the text? The figure legends are again no help. I eventually came to the conclusion that I agree with this particular assertion. But again, given the eLife format there is no reason to make things this difficult. I think a reasonable reader might easily decide (at least for the molecular part) that the data do not support the conclusions of this paper – not because the data are incorrect, but because they are not presented in a way that allows the reader to see why the authors came to their conclusion.</italic> </p><p><italic>To improve clarity the authors could:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) Use more than four main-text figures, which would allow each figure to have a more focused theme, and would allow incorporation of certain key supplemental data into those figures.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience by making our paper too compressed.

The ratio in pCAGIG-electroporated retinas was also not quite different (15% (Gad67;EGFP) vs. 27% (Syntaxin;EGFP)) from that. In those two groups, Gad67;EGFP double-positive GABAergic amacrine cell population are also not greatly different from GlyT1;EGFP double-positive glycinergic amacrine cell population. In contrast, Gad67;EGFP double-positive GABAergic amacrine cell population (46% ± 7.33%) is as big as Syntaxin;GFP double-positive amacrine cell population (54% ± 7.56%) in pCAGIG-Pax6ΔPD-electroporated retinas. Those GABAergic amacrine cell population is over 5-folds of GlyT1;EGFP double-positive cell population (8% ± 1.6%). Therefore, the results could support the idea that GABAergic amacrine cell subtypes were produced preferentially by Pax6ΔPD overexpression.</p><p>To help our readers’ understanding, we rewrote as “Moreover, by showing insignificantly different marker positivity with EGFP;Syntaxin double-positive INL cells (54% ± 7.56%(Syntaxin) vs. 46% ± 7.33%(Gad67)), majority of EGFP-positive amacrine cells in the pCAGIG-Pax6ΔPD-electroporated retinas are predicted as GABAergic amacrine cells, which are approximately half of the EGFP;Syntaxin double-positive amacrine cell population in pCAGIG-Pax6-electroporated mouse retinas (85% ± 7.2%(Syntaxin) vs. 44% ± 9.17%(Gad67)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5 —figure supplement 2A</xref> [second row], D)”. We also rewrote the conclusion sentence as “…Pax6ΔPD preferentially supports GABAergic amacrine cell fate, while full-length Pax6 induces all amacrine cell types in a similar ratio observed in normal mouse retina”.</p><p><italic>Also, if the authors wish to claim a selective effect on GABAergic amacrine cells, they should show that glycinergic amacrines are not affected in their Pax6 gain-of-function experiments, and/or in the deltaPBS mutant.</italic> </p><p>We added GlyT1 immunostaining results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>. The results suggest that Pax6ΔPD did not increase the number of GlyT1-positive cells significantly.</p><p><italic>4) In the physiology/behavior section, the model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and much of the Results/Discussion focuses on the idea of feedback inhibition to ON or rod bipolar cells. I'm not convinced that these are ON pathway or rod pathway-specific phenotypes. All of the MEA and behavior experiments were done in a light regime where the test stimulus was a brief light stimulus presented in the dark. We don't know what would happen with the inverse paradigm. Even if we did, it is still pretty speculative to get into circuit mechanisms here. The two mutant mice manipulate amacrine cell number in opposite directions. A conservative hypothesis about the physiological effects of these manipulations is that they affect overall inhibitory tone. The interpretations of physiology and behavior experiments probably shouldn't go beyond this.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the experiments in this paper are not enough to get into circuit information and additional measurements in various light conditions should be done to reach more accurate conclusion. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we modified the text and diagram by removing the feedback component and simply emphasizing the alteration of inhibitory tone in light-ON pathway in those two mutant mouse retinas.</p></body></sub-article></article>
