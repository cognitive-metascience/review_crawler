However, learning specificity diminishes with additional exposure of the transfer orientation or location via irrelevant tasks, suggesting that the specificity is related to untrained conditions, likely because neurons representing untrained conditions are neither bottom-up stimulated nor top-down attended during training. To demonstrate these top-down and bottom-up contributions, we applied a “continuous flash suppression” technique to suppress the exposure stimulus into sub-consciousness, and with additional manipulations to achieve pure bottom-up stimulation or top-down attention with the transfer condition. We found that either bottom-up or top-down influences enabled significant transfer of orientation and Vernier discrimination learning. These results suggest that learning specificity may result from under-activations of untrained visual neurons due to insufficient bottom-up stimulation and/or top-down attention during training. High-level perceptual learning thus may not functionally connect to these neurons for learning transfer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14614.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14614.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14614.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>People can become more sensitive to small changes in what they are seeing – such as detecting a slight change in the angle of a particular line – with practice. This process is called perceptual learning, but the improvement is often specific such that it is typically lost if the line moves to a new place, or a different line angle is used. Previous work does show that it is possible to transfer the learning to a new location or angle if the individual also practices another, seemingly irrelevant, task at the same or a later time – such as judging how bright the line is.</p><p>To understand what might be happening to produce these seemingly conflicting results, Xiong et al. used a technique called “continuous flash suppression” with human volunteers. This approach meant that the volunteers were shown an object (such as an angled line) in one eye, while their other eye viewed white noise similar to the “snowflakes” seen on an old-fashioned un-tuned television screen. The flashing snowflakes in one eye meant that the volunteers were not consciously aware of the presence of the angled line in the other eye.</p><p>The experiments revealed that perceptual learning at the new location or line angle happened when a subconsciously-observed object was shown in the new location or angle, or when the volunteers were asked to pay attention to the “subconscious object” when no object was actually there. This suggests that perceptual learning can happen in new conditions both through ‘bottom-up’ processes, which rely entirely on information coming in from the senses, and ‘top-down’ processes, which are influenced by what a person is aware of and paying attetion to. What is more, the results suggest that the classical observations of specificity in perceptual learning are likely to be a result of the lack of bottom-up and top-down influences in the untrained condition, when the volunteers work hard to improve their performance with the trained condition.</p><p>Future studies could directly look at what is going on in the brain when perceptual learning becomes less specific, for example by using a technique like functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14614.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14614.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>perceptual learning</kwd><kwd>specificity</kwd><kwd>bottom up</kwd><kwd>top-down</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31230030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Cong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Perceptual learning is specific because of the absence of bottom-up stimulation and top-down modulation at the untrained conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Visual perceptual learning is the process in which the observers improve their discrimination of fine differences of basic visual features, such as contrast, orientation, motion direction, etc., through practice. For several decades visual perceptual learning has been regarded as a distinct format of learning because it is specific to the orientation and retinal location of the trained stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Schoups et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahissar and Hochstein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Shiu and Pashler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosher and Lu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Poggio et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fiorentini and Berardi, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yu et al., 2004</xref>). Such learning specificity has inspired theories that interpret visual perceptual learning as a result of training induced neural plasticity in the early visual areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Schoups et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Karni and Sagi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Teich and Qian, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bejjanki et al., 2011</xref>). For example, it has been proposed that training could sharpen neuronal orientation tuning in the primary visual cortex (V1), so that neurons become more sensitive to the fine changes of orientation differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Teich and Qian, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Schoups et al., 2001</xref>). The learning specificity has also constrained alternative reweighting theories of visual perceptual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosher and Lu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Poggio et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mollon and Danilova, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Petrov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Law and Gold, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2009</xref>). These theories propose that training may not change the tuning properties of sensory neurons. Rather, the inputs from activated neurons are reweighted through training to improve readout at a later decision stage. Reweighting theories are supported by neurophysiological evidence. For example, motion direction learning in monkeys is correlated with changes in motion-driven responses of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) that is related to the transformation of motion information into decisions (saccadic choices), but not with changes of neurons in the medial temporal area (MT) that represents motion direction signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Law and Gold, 2008</xref>).</p><p>However, in a series of 'double training' studies we demonstrated that visual perceptual learning of various tasks can transfer significantly, and often completely, to new orientations or locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xiao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2014</xref>). In a double training experimental design the observers are additionally exposed to the new orientation or location via practicing an irrelevant task besides the primary learning task. For example, perceptual learning of foveal orientation discrimination (e.g., which of two consecutively presented gratings is more clockwise-tilted?) initially shows little transfer to an orthogonal orientation. However, if the observers are exposed to an orthogonal orientation via an irrelevant contrast discrimination task (e.g., which of two gratings has higher contrast?), learning transfers completely to the orthogonal orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, perceptual learning of Vernier discrimination (e.g., whether a lower grating is placed to the left or right of an upper grating) can also transfer significantly and often completely to a new retinal location when the observers are additionally exposed to the transfer location via an irrelevant contrast or orientation discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2014</xref>). These results suggest two important insights regarding visual perceptual learning. First, visual perceptual learning is mainly a high-level rule-based learning process that occurs beyond the retinotopic and orientation selective visual areas, so that learning is in principle transferrable to untrained conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Second, learning specificity may be related to the untrained conditions, rather than the trained conditions as the field has been assuming (i.e., plasticity with the trained early visual cortical neurons or reweighting of the inputs from these neurons). The second insight, which stands completely different from the interpretations of specificity by the field, forms the basis of the current study.</p><p>During training at a specific orientation or location in a typical visual perceptual learning experiment, most mental resources are devoted to the trained stimuli. For example, an observer has to focus the attention on the near-threshold difference between the reference orientation and the target orientation at a specific location. As a result the untrained orientations and locations, and thus the visual neurons representing these orientations and locations, are neither bottom-up stimulated nor top-down attended during training. We thus suspect that this insufficient bottom-up stimulation of, and/or top-down attention to, the untrained conditions are responsible for the orientation and location specificity. In other words, because visual neurons representing untrained conditions are not properly activated as a result, high-level perceptual learning may not be able to functionally connect to these neurons for learning transfer.</p><p>Our previous double training experiments are unable to separately identify the potential bottom-up and/or top-down contributions because suprathreshold stimuli are used in the secondary exposure task. In the current study we applied a continuous flash suppression (CFS) technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tsuchiya and Koch, 2005</xref>) to suppress the exposure stimulus into sub-consciousness (see Materials and methods). We further manipulated the subconscious stimulus conditions to make the exposure task to be bottom-up only or top-down only. The results show that either bottom-up stimulation of the untrained condition, or top-down attention to it, is sufficient to enable substantial and often complete transfer of learning. These results provide a solution to the mystery of learning specificity that has dominated the history of perceptual learning research. With learning specificity considered as a by-product of training, the field should move on to study the brain mechanisms of perceptual learning without much of specificity-related constraints. Moreover, more efficient training paradigms can be designed to generate perceptual learning without the unwanted specificity in practical settings.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Orientation specificity and transfer: The effects of bottom-up or top-down influences at the untrained orientations</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Baseline: Orientation specificity</title><p>We first established the baseline for orientation specificity in an orientation discrimination learning task.

To separate the potential bottom-up and top-down contributions of the secondary task, we applied a continuous flashing suppression (CFS) technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tsuchiya and Koch, 2005</xref>) to render the exposure stimulus (a Gabor orthogonal to the trained orientation) subconscious. This was achieved by presenting the flashing noise to the dominant eye, which suppressed the perception of the orthogonal Gabor in the non-dominant eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>We further manipulated the CFS stimulus configuration to achieve bottom-up stimulation of the orthogonal transfer orientation. Before the experiment, we instructed ten new observers to report the color (red/green) of a dot that was centered on the noise pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> instruction stimuli; the mean correct rate was 96.6 ± 0.3%) in the dominant eye while showing a blank screen to the non-dominant eye. But in the actual experiment an orthogonal Gabor was present in the non-dominant eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> actual stimuli). Since the observers were neither told, nor aware of, the existence of the orthogonal Gabor, and their attention was directed to the dot-color report task, the subconsciously presented orthogonal Gabor bottom-up stimulated the visual cortical neurons at the transfer orientation without attracting top-down attention.</p><p>The observers received orientation training and bottom-up stimulation of the orthogonal transfer orientation in separate blocks of trials in the same session. Five sessions of practice reduced the orientation discrimination thresholds at the trained orientation significantly by 50.6 ± 6.0% (t<sub>9</sub> = 8.87, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI = 35.9% to 60.5%, Cohen’s d = 2.80), as well as at the untrained but bottom-up stimulated orthogonal orientation by 33.7 ± 4.6% (t<sub>9</sub> = 7.33, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI = 23.3% to 44.1%, Cohen’s d = 2.32) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and g</xref>). There was still a significant difference between the two improvements (t<sub>9</sub> = 3.84, p = 0.004, 95% CI = 5.9% to 23.0%, Cohen’s d = 1.21), and the transfer index TI = 0.72 ± 0.08 (t<sub>9</sub> = 9.09, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI = 0.54 to 0.90, Cohen's d = 2.87; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), indicating substantial but incomplete learning transfer.</p><p>A control experiment indicated that the improvement at the untrained orthogonal orientation did not result from the bottom-up stimulation alone. Eight new observers received equal amount of bottom-up stimulation of the orthogonal transfer orientation without practicing the orientation discrimination task. The bottom-up stimulation changed the orientation discrimination thresholds at the stimulated orientation insignificantly by 9.7 ± 4.3% (t<sub>7</sub> = 2.25, p = 0.06, 95% CI = -0.05% to 19.9%, Cohen’s d = 0.85, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and g</xref>).</p><p>A second control experiment ruled out the possibility that the dynamic white noise, which would activate visual neurons tuned to all orientations, was sufficient to enable the same amount of learning transfer. The experimental design was the same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, except that no orthogonal Gabor was present in the actual stimuli. Again training reduced orientation thresholds significantly by 46.7 ± 3.4% (t<sub>9</sub> = 13.92, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI = 39.1% to 54.3%, Cohen’s d = 4.40) in ten observers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and g</xref>). However, no significant threshold improvement was evident at the orthogonal transfer orientation (13.4 ± 8.8%, t<sub>9</sub> = 1.53, p = 0.16, 95% CI = -6.5% to 33.2%, Cohen’s d = 0.51), which was significantly lower than the improvement at the trained orientation (t<sub>9</sub> = 4.13, p = 0.003, 95% CI = 15.1% to 51.6%, Cohen’s d = 1.44). The TI = 0.24 ± 0.24 in this condition (t<sub>9</sub> = 0.99, p = 0.35, 95% CI = -0.31 to 0.79, Cohen's d = 0.31; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). The error bar of the transfer index was large because one observer actually showed complete learning transfer.</p><p>An independent-samples Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant differences among the transfer indices of the baseline condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), the training plus bottom-up stimulation condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), and the training plus noise-only condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) (p = 0.009). Post-hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison indicated that the training plus bottom-up stimulation condition had significantly more transfer than the baseline condition (p = 0.004 without correction; p = 0.011 with correction) and the training plus noise-only condition (p = 0.022 without correction or 0.067 with correction). There was no significant difference of the transfer effects between the training plus noise-only condition and the baseline condition (p = 0.54 without correction or 1.00 with correction).</p><p>There results together suggest that bottom-up stimulation of the transfer orientation can enable substantial but partial transfer of orientation learning.

Specifically, the observers practiced the Vernier task in one visual quadrant of the dominant eye, while the opposite visual hemifield across the horizontal meridian was covered by flashing noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> instruction stimuli). In the actual experiment a horizontal Gabor was simultaneously presented at the diagonal location in the non-dominant eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> actual stimuli). Because of the near-threshold Vernier discrimination at the trained location and the noise suppression, this horizontal Gabor bottom-up stimulated the transfer location without the observers’ awareness.</p><p>Eight observers received five sessions of Vernier training and simultaneous subconscious bottom-up stimulation of the diagonal transfer location. This procedure reduced Vernier thresholds by 32.4% ± 4.3% (t<sub>7</sub> = 7.54, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI = 22.2% to 42.5%, Cohen’s d = 2.32) at the trained location, as well as by 35.3% ± 6.4% (t<sub>7</sub> = 5.53, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI = 20.2% to 50.4%, Cohen’s d = 1.95) at the transfer location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The two improvements were comparable (t<sub>7</sub> = 0.54, p = 0.60, 95% CI = −15.6% to 9.8%, Cohen’s d = 0.19).

This learning transfer was not caused by the bottom-up stimulation alone. Without Vernier training (eight observers in a control condition instead reported the red/green color of a peripheral dot at the original Vernier stimulus location), mere bottom-up stimulation of the diagonal location produced insignificant change of Vernier performance at the stimulated location (4.1 ± 9.1%, t<sub>7</sub> = 0.45, p = 0.67, 95% CI = −17.5% to 25.7%, Cohen’s d = 0.16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p><p>We also tested whether the bottom-up location stimulation by the Gabor stimulus was necessary for the learning transfer to the untrained location, since a large noise field covering two visual quadrants also included the untrained location.

We show that for orientation and location specificity, the absence of bottom-up stimulation of neurons representing the untrained conditions, as well as top-down attention to these neurons, prevent perceptual learning from transferring to untrained conditions.</p><p>In one ERP study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), we discovered that Vernier learning and its transfer to an untrained hemisphere accompanies significant occipital P1-N1 changes when the Vernier task is performed at either the trained or the untrained location after training. However, if learning does not transfer, as shown in about half the observers, the P1-N1 changes are limited to the trained location. We interpret P1-N1 changes as possible indications of top-down connections between high-level Vernier learning and visual neurons at the trained location, as well as at untrained locations when learning transfers. We also interpret learning specificity as a result of absent functional connections. Our current data suggest that both bottom-up stimulation of, and top-down attention to, untrained conditions may activate visual neurons representing the untrained conditions, so as to foster the connections to enable learning transfer.</p><p>In another ERP study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), we also found that orientation discrimination learning and its transfer to an untrained hemisphere accompanies significant occipital C1 changes when the orientation discrimination task is performed at the trained and untrained locations, respectively, after training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Such C1 changes are not evident with an untrained shape-discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) or with passive viewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2010</xref>). These results further indicate that the functional connections are task specific, consistent with the observations that perceptual learning is task specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Shiu and Pashler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahissar and Hochstein, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cong et al., 2016</xref>). The task-specific functional connections associated with learning and its transfer are also supported by fMRI evidence, in that the generalized orientation discrimination learning is accompanied with task-specific enhancement of orientation-selective responses in the early visual areas including V1, V2 and V3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byers and Serences, 2014</xref>). These results together may also explain fMRI results that orientation specificity is accompanied with refined representation of the trained orientation in early visual areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jehee et al., 2012</xref>). This is because top-down modulation by high-level orientation learning may not reach the early cortical representations of untrained orientations as a result of absent functional connections.</p><p>As we pointed out earlier, when a near-threshold task is practiced, most brain resources are devoted to the training orientation and retinal location. The untrained orientations and retinal locations, and thus the relevant visual neurons, are neither bottom-up stimulated nor top-down attended. At least in the case of location specificity, there is evidence that spatial attention could suppress other unattended locations even with no presence of competing stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Smith et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shmuel et al., 2006</xref>), as is typical in a perceptual learning study. We suspect that some or all of these factors could contribute to under-activations of neurons at untrained conditions, which in turn could lead to missing functional connections of these neurons to high-level learning to prevent learning transfer.</p><p>Our previous double training studies have revealed significant and often complete learning transfer to untrained conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xiao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). These transfer results prompted us to propose a rule-based perceptual learning theory. Specifically, we suggest that visual perceptual learning is a high-level process. The brain learns the rules of reweighting visual inputs to achieve better visual performance, and these rules are potentially applicable to new orientations and retinal locations. More recent evidence also suggests that these rules are conceptual, in that learning can transfer between physically distinct stimuli that are initially encoded by different neural mechanisms (e.g., between local and global orientations defined by gratings and symmetric dot patterns, or between first- and second-order motion directions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The current findings add to this theory by elucidating why perceptual learning, if high-level and rule-based, can be specific in the first place. These results also suggest that double training schemes function by providing bottom-up and top-down forces to activate untrained neurons, which in turn initiate functional connections for learning transfer. A recent computational model explains how such functional connections can be built with double training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Solgi et al., 2013</xref>). In the model, the secondary training task activates the untrained neurons, which could be recalled when the brain is off-task, so that high-level 'concept neurons' that have learned the task can connect to these untrained neurons in an off-task self-organization manner for learning transfer. Apparently the activations of untrained neurons due to unconsciousness stimulation, or top-down attention without actual stimulation, can also be recalled off-task in the context of this computational account.</p><p>We once had observers practice a peripheral Vernier task identical to the current one, while flashing a Gabor simultaneously at a diagonal location (without noise suppression) for the purpose of stimulating neurons at this latter location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). However, we found no evidence for learning transfer. A more recent psychophysical study also replicated the null-transfer results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mastropasqua et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, an earlier monkey-recording study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Schoups et al., 2001</xref>) reported that orientation discrimination learning does not transfer to a different location where a same grating stimulus is simultaneously presented. These null-transfer effects may be caused by attentional competition, in that concentrated attention to the training location would suppress the high-contrast stimuli at a different location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Watanabe et al., 2001</xref>). The attentional suppression effect is avoided in double training when the primary training and the secondary training that stimulates the untrained location are performed in alternating blocks of trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xiao et al., 2008</xref>), or when the stimulation of the untrained locations is below awareness as in our current study. In the latter case the bottom-up stimulation of transfer location through one eye may create an input contrast in the eye-of-origin feature, and this contrast, although invisible perceptually, has been shown to be very salient because it more strongly activates V1 neurons than the surrounding stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhaoping, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Perceptual learning can also be task irrelevant. Watanabe and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Watanabe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Seitz and Watanabe, 2003</xref>) reported that training improves discrimination of a nearby feature that is task irrelevant and sub-threshold (to avoid attentional suppression), and that the learning occurs only when the irrelevant feature is temporally paired with rewards with the trained task. They explained this task irrelevant perceptual learning (TIPL) as a result of interactions between spatially diffusive rewards and bottom-up exposure of the task irrelevant feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Seitz and Watanabe, 2005</xref>). Note that our double-training enabled learning transfer are distinct from TIPL in two important ways. First, unlike TIPL, the training and exposure do not require temporal pairing and spatial proximity of two stimuli. Indeed the training phase can precede the exposure phase with a time gap of up to 8 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), and the training and exposure locations can be at diagonal quadrants of the visual field separated by 10 degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), while double training is still effective. In the current study, the training and sub-threshold exposure are performed in separate blocks of trials, rather than paired, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and are spatially separated by 10 degrees in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Second, our recent evidence suggests that double-training enabled learning transfer is still task specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cong et al., 2016</xref>). We found that orientation discrimination learning cannot transfer to a contrast discrimination task using the same Gabor stimulus, even after the observers receive additional exposure of the transfer task through easy trials in separate blocks of trials. The same is true at a reverse direction when the observers learn contrast discrimination and receive exposure of orientation discrimination, the transfer task, through easy trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Observers and apparatus</title><p>One hundred and thirteen (113) undergraduate students with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated in this study.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David Van Essen as the Senior Editor.

What criteria were used to determine how many subjects were run in each study and when data collection in each study should be stopped?</p><p>3) There are a number of issues with the statistical methods that should be addressed, including: a) specifying the meaning of error bars in the figures and reported measurement/sampling variability in the text (SEM? STD? Confidence intervals?); b) the transfer index is used in the text but not in the figures to summarize the findings, and a significance test of the value of the transfer index is reported only for the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and not the other Figures, and no transfer index is reported for the spatial experiments; c) many non-pairwise t-tests were performed (non-parametric tests would probably be more appropriate) without correction for multiple comparisons – most were highly significant, but this procedure should still be implemented; and d) Do any of the statistical tests take into account the uncertainty in the estimates of the various values measured per subject (e.g., the error bars apparent in the dim points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, d, f</xref>, etc.)?</p><p>4) In the CSF experiments, the authors mention that the subjects were 'neither told nor aware of' the untrained stimuli in the non-dominant eye (NDE).

The continuous flash suppression (CFS) technique was used to present subconscious bottom-up or top-down stimuli to the transfer orientation or location. They found that either bottom-up stimulation or top-down attention is sufficient to enable significant learning transfer, and conclude that learning specificity may result from under activation of untrained visual neurons due to insufficient bottom-up stimulation and/or top-down attention.</p><p>The topic of the study is quite interesting and could potentially advance our understanding of specificity and transfer in perceptual learning. However, it seems to me that the study may have missed a critical control condition – how much learning was induced by the bottom-up and top-down stimulation of the transfer orientation or location? Although the results are presented as transfer of learning from the trained condition, stimulation of the transfer condition could by itself lead to improved performance.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, Xiong et al. show that both bottom-up and top-down factors can amplify transfer effects to untrained stimulus orientations and locations. Their results provide one possible explanation regarding why transfer effects have been inconsistently reported in the past. I think the experiments are generally well designed and well controlled. However, I have several concerns that I would like to see addressed. Moreover, the authors’ previous work has already shown that some activity is needed to induce transfer. So the novelty of the present demonstration that either bottom-up or top-down activation is sufficient should be clarified for a general audience journal.</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>1) Number of subjects: Across the experiments, the number of subjects is quite variable, with E1 having double the subjects as some other studies (N=10 vs N=8 vs N=5, etc.). This is an important issue, especially since transfer effects are compared across subject groups and the number of subjects for individual groups is relatively low to begin with. This left me wondering what criteria were used to determine how many subjects were going to be run in each study and when data collection in each study should be stopped.</p><p>2) Statistical methods. The authors used a transfer index for the baseline experiment to compare the transfer effects between experimental conditions (which is fine). The authors then provide statistical results for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>. But for other comparisons, statistical results comparing transfer indexes between the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) experimental conditions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> were not reported. Also many non-pairwise t-tests were performed without correction for multiple comparisons – true most were highly significant, but this procedure should still be implemented. For the spatial experiments, no formal transfer indexes were established.</p><p>3) In the CSF experiments, the authors mention that the subjects were 'neither told nor aware of' the untrained stimuli in the non-dominant eye (NDE). Were any queries made of the subjects to confirm that the stimulus presented to the NDE was actually 'subconsciously' perceived?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Bottom-up and top-down influences at untrained conditions determine perceptual learning specificity and transfer&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by David Van Essen (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been much improved, but there are some remaining minor issues that should be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> appear to be mislabeled. The last panel should be (d) not (e) – so in the summary figures I think it would be better to indicate in all bar graphs which figures they derive from. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> – the label should be (4b) (4c) and (4d) instead of (b) (c) and (e). Another example is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> – the label could be (3b) (1a) and (1f) instead of (b) (1a) (1f).</p><p>2) The authors should consider discussing the Jehee J. Neuro and Byers J. Neurophys papers given the relevance of top down attention during training. Another potentially relevant paper is Szpiro and Carrasco (2015) in Psych Sci, which is seemingly both consistent and inconsistent with the present findings – they showed that exogenous attention induces transfer in spatial frequency but not an orientation task.</p><p>3) All raw source data should be uploaded. Currently it appears that only a summary file is provided in. xls format.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14614.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Although the reviewers and the Reviewing Editor were in general agreement that the topic of the study is quite interesting and could potentially advance our understanding of specificity and transfer in perceptual learning, they also felt that the study lacked critical controls that are needed to validate the main findings.

With learning specificity considered as a by-product of training, the field should move on to study the brain mechanisms of perceptual learning without much of specificity-related constraints. Moreover, more efficient training paradigms can be designed to generate perceptual learning without the unwanted specificity in practical settings.”</p><p><italic>2) Across the experiments, the number of subjects is quite variable, with E1 having double the subjects as some other studies (N=10 vs N=8 vs N=5, etc.).

What criteria were used to determine how many subjects were run in each study and when data collection in each study should be stopped?</italic></p><p>We did a power analysis in a recent JOV paper (Cong et al., 2016) and found that if only the pre- and post-training thresholds are compared with a t-test, 5-6 subjects is sufficient to obtain high statistical power in a perceptual learning experiment. However, this number is inadequate when multiple comparisons are performed. We thus increased the number of subjects in each experiment to 8-10 to deal with the power issue.</p><p> <italic>3) There are a number of issues with the statistical methods that should be addressed, including: a) specifying the meaning of error bars in the figures and reported measurement/sampling variability in the text (SEM?

These tests are described in two occasions of the text:</p><p>“In Figure 3b-c the Gabor/C judgments were near chance (0.80), suggesting effective suppression of the perception of the orthogonal Gabor by the continuous flashing noise. We further confirmed this CFS effect with 18 observers (10 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, 3 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, and 5 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) after they completed their experiments. Each observer was presented a sub-conscious Gabor at the transfer orientation in half the trials with flashing noise presented to the other eye (60 trials per block for 4 blocks). In the other half trials a blank screen was presented. The result showed a chance-level accuracy at 0.51 ± 0.01. Therefore, the transfer results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> were not contaminated by the leakage of the Gabor perception.”</p><p>“Finally, we checked the effectiveness of flashing noise suppression on Gabor perception at the transfer location. We tested observers (13 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, 4 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, and 6 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) for 4 blocks, 50 trials per block, after they completed their training experiments. They were asked to report whether a sub-conscious Gabor (50% of the trials) was presented at the transfer location with flashing noise suppression. The Gabor stimulus was absent in the other 50% of the trials. The mean report rate was 0.49 ± 0.01. Therefore, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were not contaminated by the observers’ likely perception of the Gabor stimulus at the transfer location.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p> <italic>In this study, the authors investigated effects of bottom-up and top-down stimulation of the untrained condition in determining specificity and transfer in perceptual learning. The continuous flash suppression (CFS) technique was used to present subconscious bottom-up or top-down stimuli to the transfer orientation or location. They found that either bottom-up stimulation or top-down attention is sufficient to enable significant learning transfer, and conclude that learning specificity may result from under activation of untrained visual neurons due to insufficient bottom-up stimulation and/or top-down attention.</italic> </p><p><italic>The topic of the study is quite interesting and could potentially advance our understanding of specificity and transfer in perceptual learning. However, it seems to me that the study may have missed a critical control condition – how much learning was induced by the bottom-up and top-down stimulation of the transfer orientation or location? Although the results are presented as transfer of learning from the trained condition, stimulation of the transfer condition could by itself lead to improved performance.</italic></p><p>These control data are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1e</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5c</xref>. Among these control conditions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1e</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5c</xref> show no significant effects of the bottom-up or top-down conditions on learning at the transfer condition when no training is carried out. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> shows a small learning effect that is significantly lower than the improvement with the training sequence (14.6% vs. 45.1%, p = 0.001). These control results thus validate the main findings in this study.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>In this paper, Xiong et al. show that both bottom-up and top-down factors can amplify transfer effects to untrained stimulus orientations and locations. Their results provide one possible explanation regarding why transfer effects have been inconsistently reported in the past. I think the experiments are generally well designed and well controlled. However, I have several concerns that I would like to see addressed. Moreover, the authors’ previous work has already shown that some activity is needed to induce transfer. So the novelty of the present demonstration that either bottom-up or top-down activation is sufficient should be clarified for a general audience journal.</italic> </p><p>This issue is addressed in the revision.

The authors used a transfer index for the baseline experiment to compare the transfer effects between experimental conditions (which is fine). The authors then provide statistical results for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>. But for other comparisons, statistical results comparing transfer indexes between the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) experimental conditions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> were not reported. Also many non-pairwise t-tests were performed without correction for multiple comparisons – true most were highly significant, but this procedure should still be implemented. For the spatial experiments, no formal transfer indexes were established.</italic> </p><p>These issues are addressed in the revision.

See our responses above.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been much improved, but there are some remaining minor issues that should be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> appear to be mislabeled. The last panel should be (d) not (e) – so in the summary figures I think it would be better to indicate in all bar graphs which figures they derive from. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> – the label should be (4b) (4c) and (4d) instead of (b) (c) and (e). Another example is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> – the label could be (3b) (1a) and (1f) instead of (b) (1a) (1f).</italic></p><p>Thanks a lot for pointing out the mistakes. The labels have been updated as suggested.</p><p><italic>2) The authors should consider discussing the Jehee J. Neuro and Byers J. Neurophys papers given the relevance of top down attention during training. Another potentially relevant paper is Szpiro and Carrasco (2015) in Psych Sci, which is seemingly both consistent and inconsistent with the present findings – they showed that exogenous attention induces transfer in spatial frequency but not an orientation task.</italic></p><p>We added the following sentences to an existing paragraph in the Discussion section to discuss the Jehee paper (Jehhe et al., 2012) and the Byers paper (Byers and Serences, 2014):</p><p>“In another ERP study (Zhang et al., 2015), we also found that orientation discrimination learning and its transfer to an untrained hemisphere accompanies significant occipital C1 changes when the orientation discrimination task is performed at the trained and untrained locations, respectively, after training (Zhang et al., 2015). Such C1 changes are not evident with an untrained shape-discrimination task (Zhang et al., 2015) or with passive viewing (Bao et al., 2010). These results further indicate that the functional connections are task specific, consistent with the observations that perceptual learning is task specific (Shiu and Pashler, 1992; Ahissar and Hochstein, 1993; Cong et al., 2016). The task-specific functional connections associated with learning and its transfer are also supported by fMRI evidence, in that the generalized orientation discrimination learning is accompanied with task-specific enhancement of orientation-selective responses in the early visual areas including V1, V2 and V3 (Byers and Serences, 2014). These results together may also explain fMRI results that orientation specificity is accompanied with refined representation of the trained orientation in early visual areas (Jehee et al., 2012). This is because top-down modulation by high-level orientation learning may not reach the early cortical representations of untrained orientations as a result of absent functional connections.”</p><p>Szpiro and Carrasco (2015, Psych Sci) reported that three days of training (800 trials per day) failed to improve the performance of an orientation comparison task, unless exogenous attention was added. However, 2400 trials in 3 days is a lot of trials for perceptual learning to occur in many tasks. So we double-checked their non-learning baseline results with nearly identical procedures. All observers we trained showed consistent and significant orientation learning, as much as when exogenous attention was introduced. We showed the data to Carrasco recently when she was visiting us in Beijing. It would be better that we solve the discrepancies with Carrasco in a different occasion.</p><p> <italic>3) All raw source data should be uploaded. Currently it appears that only a summary file is provided in. xls format.</italic></p><p>Now we upload five Excel files, each containing data for one figure. Each data sheet in an Excel file contains data for one specific subpanel of the figure.
