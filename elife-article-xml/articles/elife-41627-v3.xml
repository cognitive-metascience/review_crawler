pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with variable efficiency. To better understand the heterogeneity of these processes, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to follow the transdifferentation of murine pre-B cells into macrophages as well as their reprogramming into iPSCs. Even in these highly efficient systems, there was substantial variation in the speed and path of fate conversion. We predicted and validated that these differences are inversely coupled and arise in the starting cell population, with Myc<sup>high</sup> large pre-BII cells transdifferentiating slowly but reprogramming efficiently and Myc<sup>low</sup> small pre-BII cells transdifferentiating rapidly but failing to reprogram. Strikingly, differences in Myc activity predict the efficiency of reprogramming across a wide range of somatic cell types. These results illustrate how single cell expression and computational analyses can identify the origins of heterogeneity in cell fate conversion processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single cell</kwd><kwd>reprogramming</kwd><kwd>transdifferentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Synergy Grant (4D-Genome)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003030</institution-id><institution>Agency for Management of University and Research Grants</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SGR-1136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name><name><surname>Graf</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Consolidator grant (616434)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2011-26206</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001961</institution-id><institution>AXA Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007492</institution-id><institution>Fondation Bettencourt Schueller</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003030</institution-id><institution>Agency for Management of University and Research Grants</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SGR-831</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Variation in efficiency, speed and path during transdifferentiation and reprogramming originates from two pre-B cell subpopulations with reciprocal propensity towards each fate conversion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Elucidating the transcriptional programs that determine cell identity during development and regeneration is one of the major goals of current stem cell research. In the past decade, several groups have demonstrated cell plasticity, meaning that a variety of somatic cells can be converted into either pluripotent cells or into other specialised cells by overexpression of specific transcription factors (TFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graf and Enver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jopling et al., 2011</xref>). For example, the Yamanaka factors <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Klf4</italic> and <italic>Myc</italic> (OSKM) can reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>), while lineage-instructive TFs can prompt the transdifferentiation of mouse and human cells into other specialised cell types such as muscle, neural or hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davis et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Graf, 2011</xref>). In all cases one gene expression program is erased and a new one established. Typically only a small fraction of cells successfully acquire a new fate after TF-overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hochedlinger and Plath, 2009</xref>). For instance, the efficiency of conversion into iPSCs in response to OSKM of diverse primary adult cells such as fibroblasts, keratinocytes, liver cells, neural precursor cells, pancreatic β cells and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs) varies widely, ranging between 0.01% for T-lymphocytes and 25% for GMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eminli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stadtfeld et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aoi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aasen et al., 2008</xref>) for unclear reasons. Identifying the transcriptional signature that render a somatic cell type more amenable to transdifferentiation or reprogramming would teach us about the general mechanisms that control cell fate.</p><p>Mechanistic studies of transdifferentiation and reprogramming have established that these are complex processes, where multiple players synergistically establish new transcriptional networks, disrupt old ones and remove epigenetic barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buganim et al., 2013</xref>). Among the factors that have been shown to affect the efficiency and kinetics of reprogramming are proteins involved in cell cycle progression, chromatin remodelling, and posttranscriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di Stefano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krizhanovsky and Lowe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doege et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheloufi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brumbaugh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Oevelen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>). Despite these insights, many details about cell fate conversion processes remain unclear. Do cells convert fates as homogeneous populations or through a diversity of paths? Do all cells convert with the same speed? And what are the determinants of variation in the speed and path of cell fate conversion? More fundamentally, if an individual cell is more susceptible for conversion into one fate, is it also more susceptible to conversion into alternative fates? Major obstacles to tackling these questions are the use of bulk samples for analysis, which obscures transcriptional variability in both the starting cell population and during fate conversion, as well as the typically small proportion of responding cells.</p><p>To overcome these bottlenecks we employed high-throughput single cell RNA-sequencing (MARS-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jaitin et al., 2014</xref>)) to analyse two highly efficient cell conversion protocols applied to the same starting cell population: i) the transdifferentiation of pre-B cells into macrophages induced by the TF C/EBPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2004</xref>) and, ii) the reprogramming of pre-B cells into iPSCs, based on the transient expression of C/EBPα followed by the induction of OSKM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Stefano et al., 2014</xref>). This revealed that both processes, despite their very high efficiency, show heterogeneity for the speed and path of cell fate conversion: cells do not all convert at the same rate and along the same path to the two terminal fates. We computationally predicted and experimentally validated that this heterogeneity arises in the starting cell population. Cells with low Myc activity transdifferentiate into macrophages efficiently and directly but fail to reprogram. In contrast, cells with high Myc activity reprogram at a very high efficiency but have a lower propensity to transdifferentiate and do so by a more indirect path. Strikingly, Myc levels correlate with the reprogramming efficiency of diverse hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types. These results illustrate how single cell analysis can characterise heterogeneity in cell fate conversion processes and identify its underlying causes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single cell analysis of highly efficient transdifferentiation and reprogramming from the same cell population</title><p>We isolated CD19<sup>+</sup> pre-B cells from the bone marrow of reprogrammable mice carrying a drug-inducible reverse tetracycline trans-activator (M2rtTA; hereafter abbreviated as rtTA) in the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus, a polycistronic expression cassette in the collagen type I (<italic>Col1a1</italic>) locus, which contains four mouse derived cell reprogramming genes (<italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Klf4</italic> and <italic>Myc</italic>, OSKM) separated by three sequences encoding 2A self-cleaving peptides, and the POU5F1<italic>-GFP</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Stefano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carey et al., 2010</xref>). Pre-B cells were then infected with a C/EBPaER-hCD4 retrovirus, sorted for hCD4 expression and induced to either transdifferentiate into macrophages or reprogram into iPSCs. To induce the macrophage fate, we treated the cells with beta-estradiol (E2), which activates C/EBPα. To induce the iPSC fate, we first incubated them with E2 for 18 hr to transiently activate C/EBPa, generating a ‘poised state’, washed out the compound and then added doxycycline to induce OSKM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di Stefano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Stefano et al., 2014</xref>). For transdifferentiation, we collected cells before (0 hr) and after 6 hr, 18 hr, 42 hr, 66 hr and 114 hr of C/EBPα induction; for reprogramming, samples were prepared at days 2, 4, 6 and 8 after OSKM induction of 18 h C/EBPa-pulsed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), to be consistent with our previous bulk studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di Stefano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Stefano et al., 2014</xref>).

As mentioned before, D6 cells are more similar to early embryonic stages than D8 cells.

Visualising transcriptomes of uninduced pre-B cells using t-SNE indeed revealed sub-structure associated with the Myc component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In addition, the Myc component in our single pre-B cells scales with the total mRNA content of each cell which varies over a three-fold range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This suggests a Myc-associated heterogeneity in cell size in the starting cell population.

Intracellular staining of Myc monitored by flow cytometry confirmed that the large cells express abundant levels of the transcription factor while the smaller cells are essentially Myc negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2a</xref>).

In response to a continuous exposure to C/EBPa the small pre-BII cells upregulated the macrophage marker Mac-1 faster and downregulated CD19 slightly more rapidly than large pre-BII cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f–g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Similarly, the small cells acquired higher granularity and a slightly increased volume compared to the large cells, both markers of mature myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>).

Longer exposures, driving the cells into a macrophage-like state, decreased the efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Stefano et al., 2014</xref>), raising the possibility that an accelerated transdifferentiation of the small cells towards macrophages moves them out of the time window required for high responsiveness. If this was the case, a shorter pulse of C/EBPa should increase the reprogramming responsiveness of the small cells. However, when testing the effect of a 6 h C/EBPa pulse we found that the small cells remained highly resistant to reprogramming, exhibiting fewer iPSC colonies than with the 18 hr pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1g</xref>).

We therefore asked whether Myc activity also correlates with the reprogramming efficiency of other somatic cells, examining existing datasets of 9 hematopoietic and 11 non-hematopoietic cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eminli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stadtfeld et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aasen et al., 2008</xref>).

Furthermore, Myc component levels also correlate with the reprogramming efficiency of various non-hematopoietic cell types (R = 0.66, p=0.0016).

The observed high frequencies of both cell type conversions are consistent with deterministic processes. However, our experiments also revealed unexpected heterogeneity among cells in the speed and paths by which transcription factors induce transdifferentiation and reprogramming. Our computational analyses made non-trivial predictions about the origins and the consequence of this heterogeneity, predicting an inverse relationship between the ability of cells to either transdifferentiate or to reprogram. These predictions could be experimentally validated, showing the presence of two distinct cell subsets in the starting pre-B cell population, corresponding to previously described large pre-BII cells and small pre-BII cells, into which they normally differentiate. Surprisingly, we found that these two cell types differ in their cell conversion plasticities: while large pre-BII cells efficiently reprogram into iPSCs through a GMP-like cell state but transdifferentiate more slowly into macrophages, small pre-BII cells reprogram much less efficiently into iPSCs but transdifferentiate more rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41627.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Summary of the main findings.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41627-fig4-v3.tif"/></fig><p>The finding that cell propensity for transdifferentiation and reprogramming are inversely coupled suggests that the two types of plasticity are intrinsically different. Moreover, the Myc component correlates with both types of plasticity and in a reciprocal manner. Strikingly, high Myc levels correlate with high reprogramming efficiencies not only in hematopoietic progenitors but also in a wide range of other somatic cell types. Consistent with our findings, it has been reported that expression of endogenous <italic>Myc</italic> is essential for efficient reprogramming of MEFs into pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirsch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zviran et al., 2019</xref>). Together, our observations suggest an important role of Myc for the plasticity of both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. We also discovered that a subset of low Myc component cells at D8 of reprogramming resembles extra-embryonic cell types, reminiscent of an earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parenti et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The Myc effect could be mediated at least in part by one of the different activities reported for the factor, or a combination thereof. These include its ability to induce cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dang, 2012</xref>), its association with global chromatin changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knoepfler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kieffer-Kwon et al., 2017</xref>), its capacity to transcriptionally activate and amplify genes, including those essential for proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2012</xref>) and its induction of metabolic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dang, 2012</xref>). The unique features of Myc are also likely central for its capacity to act as a major driver of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dang, 2012</xref>) and for its role in early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scognamiglio et al., 2016</xref>). However, high Myc expression in somatic cells is not sufficient to enable their efficient OSKM-induced reprogramming, as we found that large pre-BII cells must still be primed by the transient expression of C/EBPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Stefano et al., 2014</xref>). This might be related to C/EBPa’s multiple functions including its ability to act as a pioneer transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Oevelen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>), to activate key pluripotency TFs such as Klf4, to recruit chromatin related factors including LSD1/Kdm1a, Hdac1, Brd4 and Tet2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di Stefano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sardina et al., 2018</xref>) and/or to induce changes in genome topology preceding pluripotent transcription factor expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stadhouders et al., 2018</xref>). A similar scenario may also play out during OSKM-induced MEF to iPSC reprogramming: here pluripotency factors first target and inactivate enhancers of specific somatic TFs, including <italic>Cebpa, Cebpb</italic>, <italic>Fra1</italic> and <italic>Runx1</italic>, before engaging pluripotency gene enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chronis et al., 2017</xref>). It therefore appears that efficient reprogramming of somatic into pluripotent stem cells requires three waves of transcription factor activity: i) Expression of high Myc levels in the starting cells, ii) transient expression of specific lineage regulators and iii) activation of key pluripotency transcription factors. It is tempting to speculate that similar transcriptional waves are also required for some of the earliest developmental decisions such as for the formation of pluripotent and extraembryonic cells during pre-implantation embryo development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>cebpa</td><td>NA</td><td>Ensembl: <break/>ENSG00000245848</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Pou5f1GFP transgenic <break/>mouse</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boiani et al., 2002</xref></td><td>NA</td><td>Strain: C57Bl <break/>/6 × DBA/2</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1 <break/>(rtTA*M2)Jae Col1a1tm3 <break/>(tetO-Pou5f1,-Sox2,- <break/>Klf4,-Myc)Jae/J</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Cat# 011004; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:011004">IMSR_JAX:011004</ext-link></td><td>Strain: <break/>(C57BL/6 × 129S4/ <break/>SvJae)F1</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">Pou5f1-GFP <break/>OSKM-reprogrammable</td><td valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jaitin et al.

(2017)</xref>. Single cells were FACS isolated into 384-well plates with lysis buffer and reverse-transcription primers containing the single-cell barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Each library consisted of two 192 single-cell pools per time point (pool a and pool b). Multiplexed pools were sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 system. Primary data analysis was carried out with the standard Illumina pipeline following the manufacturer's protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data pre-processing</title><p>Quality check of sequenced reads was performed with the FastQC quality control tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews, 2010</xref>). Samples that reached the quality standards were then processed to deconvolute the reads to cell level by de-multiplexing according to the pool and the cell barcodes, wherein the first read contains the transcript sequence and the second read the cell barcode and the UMI.</p><p>Samples were mapped and gene expression was quantified with default parameters using the RNA pipeline of the GEMTools 1.7.0 suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marco-Sola et al., 2012</xref>) on the mouse genome assembly GRCm38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cunningham et al., 2015</xref>) and Gencode annotations M8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mudge and Harrow, 2015</xref>). We took advantage of the UMI information to correct for amplification biases during the library preparation, collapsing read counts for reads mapping on a gene with the same UMI and considering unambiguously mapped reads only.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Cells with a library size &lt;1800 were excluded from further analysis. Genes detected in less than 50 cells or less than 15 cells per group were also excluded from further analysis, resulting in expression data for 17183 genes in 3152 cells. Size factor normalisation was applied by dividing the expression of each gene in each cell by the total number of detected mRNA molecules and multiplying by the median number of molecules across cells. An inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (log (x + sqrt(x<sup>2</sup>+1)), where x is the mRNA count) was then applied and the data were subsequently centred.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Dimensionality reduction, batch correction and gene expression reconstruction</title><p>We performed principal component analysis (PCA) by computing partial singular value decomposition (SVD) on the data matrix extracting the first 100 largest singular values and corresponding vectors using the method implemented in R in the ‘irlba’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baglama and Reichel, 2005</xref>). Examining singular vectors highlights the presence of batch effects between the two pools at each time point starting from component 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We therefore applied a batch correction method based on finding mutual nearest neighbours between batches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haghverdi et al., 2017</xref>). We used the R implementation (function ‘mnn’ in the ‘scran’ package) with k = 15 nearest neighbours, and computing the nearest neighbours on the first 2 PCA dimensions which only capture biological variation. This method corrects batch effects shared across all samples. However, partial SVD on batch corrected data shows that among the first 35 components that retain signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>) batch effects between the two pools are still present <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). We therefore applied independent component analysis (ICA) to decompose expression into 35 mutually independent components and estimate the relative mixing matrix that, when multiplied by the independent components, results in the observed data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>). ICA separates well sample-specific batch effects from biological signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>). We filtered out components when the interquartile ranges of the distributions of component scores of the two pools do not overlap at any time point (components 3, 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26, 27,32, 35). A component correlated with cell position in the plate (Component 33, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>) was also filtered out. We then reconstructed gene expression by multiplying filtered gene loadings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) by the filtered samples scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) including only the selected 20 components (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e</xref> for a schematic description). The resulting gene expression matrix was then normalised using quantile normalisation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Computation of similarity index of our single cell RNA-seq data with reference cell types</title><p>We compared our data to a comprehensive atlas of murine cell types from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hutchins et al. (2017)</xref> that consists of uniformly re-analysed bulk and single cell RNA-seq data from 113 publications including 921 biological samples consisting of 272 distinct cell types.</p><p>We calculated a similarity score for each single cell transcriptome to each atlas cell type transcriptome as follows: we first calculated the genome wide correlation between each single cell and all cell types from the atlas. The correlation coefficient was then transformed using Fisher’s z transformation: 1/2 *ln((1 + r)/(1 r)). The vector of z-transformed correlations for each single cell was then scaled across reference cell types. In the same manner, we also compared our starting population single cell data to reference bulk expression data from different stages of B cell development from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoffmann et al. (2002)</xref> and from the immunological genome project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Painter et al., 2011</xref>). Myc component increases in expression with time during reprogramming. This may fully account for the prediction of the extent of reprogramming in each cell. We therefore regress out Myc component before the computation of similarity score to derive a corrected similarity index. This was done by reconstructing both the atlas and single cell expression without the Myc component. This shows that Myc component is still well correlated with progression towards pluripotency at least at D4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>). This holds true when both Myc and cell cycle components are regressed out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Characterisation of the components: Gene set enrichment analysis</title><p>We clustered genes according to the loadings on the components from ICA, assigning each gene to the component with highest or lowest loading. Each component therefore defines one cluster of negatively correlated genes and one of positively correlated genes. We then calculated the enrichment of each cluster for Gene Ontology categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>), restricting the analysis to categories including more than 10 and less than 200 genes, and hallmark signatures from the Molecular Signature database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>). The hallmark gene set collection consists of 50 refined gene sets derived from over 6700 gene sets of the Molecular Signature Database, which are obtained from a variety of experimental approaches including gene expression profiling and binding location experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liberzon et al., 2011</xref>). Refinement was obtained by a combination of automated approaches and expert curation, aimed at reducing redundancy among gene sets and expression variation within gene sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We tested significance of gene set enrichment its significance using Fisher’s test.

We applied ICA to decompose expression of the atlas of cell types into 120 mutually independent components, and we correlated these to the components extracted from our single cell data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), to determine cell type specificity of single cell components. To this end, we correlate gene loadings of single cell components with the gene loadings of atlas components. We then defined the cell type specificity of a single cell component as follows: we associate single cell components and atlas components based on the highest absolute value of Pearson’s correlation between the gene loadings of the single cell components and of the atlas components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). For example, the single cell component one gene loadings best correlates with atlas component 12 gene loadings (positive correlation). We next characterise cell type specificity of each atlas component based on the dynamics of the single cell components scores (the single cells’ projection onto the components) and on atlas cell type scores (projection of atlas cell type on the atlas component). For example, single cell component one negatively correlates with genes that monotonically increase during transdifferentiation. The correspondent atlas component 12 is characterised by highly negative scores of macrophage and dendritic cells. We therefore define component 12 of the atlas, and by extension also the single cell component 1, as ‘a macrophage’ component.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Diffusion map and diffusion pseudotime</title><p>To visualise data in low dimensional space we used diffusion maps. Diffusion maps are a method for non-linear dimension reduction that learn the non-linear data manifold by computing the transition probability of each data point to its neighbours (diffusion distances).

Clusters are displayed the with heatmaps (function ‘heatplot’ in ‘made4’ library). We performed gene set enrichment analyses on these sets of genes and clusters using Fisher’s test as explained above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Correlation between reprogramming efficiency and myc activity</title><p>Reprogramming efficiency data for different hematopoietic cell types as well as from mouse tail fibroblasts are from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eminli et al.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Chris P Ponting as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michel Nussenzweig as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Francesconi et al. have undertaken a time series experiment to compare pre-B cell transdifferentiation into macrophages, with reprogramming into iPSCs. Using single cell RNA sequencing they identify the sequential loss of B cell specific factors and the engagement of myeloid gene expression patterns during transdifferentiation. Concordantly they show that reprogramming leads to a loss of B cell identity and a gain of ESC-like transcriptional state 8 days after reprogramming. Further, they correlate these changes with a number of different factors and ultimately show that expression of Myc, and its downstream target genes, in the starting population are predictive of transdifferentiation and reprogramming efficiency. This difference is predicted by Myc expression but Myc was not demonstrated unequivocally to be causal. This model is consistent with functional experiments, which reveal that the initial starting population was heterogeneous, and consisted of 2 distinct B cell developmental stages, each with reciprocal efficiencies for transdifferentiation and reprogramming.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Some decisions made in how the single cell data are processed to be poorly motivated and somewhat arbitrary. Additionally, it is not clear how the approach and experimental design taken by the authors address their specific problem, and why a simpler approach could not be taken. In particular, and rather surprisingly, the authors do not check for heterogeneity in the starting population, for instance, is there any indication of structure in the pre-stimulated cells? This could be interrogated very simplistically, particularly as the authors make pains to point out bi- and tri-modality in hard to read violin plots for latter stages post-stimulation. Subsection “Large and small pre-B cells differ reciprocally in their propensity to transdifferentiate or reprogram”, last paragraph, could the small and large pre-B cells be in fundamentally different states?</p><p>In the Discussion it is said that &quot;a cell's propensity for transdifferentiation or reprogramming can be disassociated, indicating that these two types of plasticity are fundamentally different&quot;. This is overstating the evidence because this statement discusses &quot;a cell&quot; whereas the propensity differences are evident for two different cell types (albeit one differentiation step apart). The authors appear not to show, using highly purified populations of these 2 cell types, that &quot;these two types of plasticity are fundamentally different.&quot;</p><p>OSKM includes MYC. Why does input MYC matter? Is it merely a marker for the two different cell types that differ in some other way? This needs to be clarified.</p><p>The conclusion that MYC level inhibits lineage conversion is based on a single model, which only uses one transcription factor. A general statement should not be made based only on a single model.</p><p>Analysis of open chromatin across the time points could be helpful. Does CEBPa open new chromatin or only bind to existing open chromatin sites?</p><p>2) The reviewers agree that it is plausible that MYC expression level affects reprogramming. The evidence for this is, however, correlative: the mechanism by which MYC elicits its effects is not determined. To be definitive, the authors could demonstrate that low levels of endogenous Myc (via CRISPRi and/or knockdown) are associated with inefficient reprogramming in one (or preferably more) cell types. It may also be true that cycling cells are easier to reprogram. This may not represent a novel discovery (Tsubouchi et al., Cell 2013). Proliferating cells dilute out existing proteins when transcription rates drop, this may be needed for loss of the starting fate. More generally, at several points the authors state that &quot;X predicts Y&quot;. It would be more accurate to state that &quot;X is correlated with Y&quot; since prediction implies a causality that is not proved.</p><p>3) The Results section is hard-going at times, particularly when the reader is expected to rederive the conclusions of the text simultaneously using many different figures and panels. Examples are:a) &quot;We found that a signature enriched in Myc target genes (component 5, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Supplementary file 4) best predicts speed of cell conversion and negatively correlates with the progression of cells at intermediate time points of transdifferentiation (Figure 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 1).&quot; Here, the reader is requested to compare 3 figures (and 1 table) whilst figuring out what is meant by &quot;speed of cell conversion&quot;. We request that you take your time to explain these observations so that the reader better appreciates this important sentence. re: Figure 2D. &quot;low expression of Myc targets is more strongly associated with a rapid gain of the macrophage state than with a rapid loss of the B cell state&quot;. Again there is a need to lead the reader through this plot.</p><p>4) The authors will need to introduce the experimental system in more detail, in particular the dox-inducible cassette encoding the 4 Yanamaka factors. Additionally, they should provide some justification for the different time points and resolution between the transdifferentiation and reprogramming experiments.</p><p>5) When describing the results of the single cell experiments, there needs to be more specific examples of genes and their relevance. Simply describing a 'B cell program' is uninformative. To that end, the presentation of the top 50% of expressed cells feels a little like cherry picking; the authors should present the distribution of expression for all cells, not just the top 50%.</p><p>6) Related to the above, the last paragraph of the subsection “Single cell analysis of highly efficient transdifferentiation and reprogramming from the same cell population”, should be split into 2 separate sections, and expanded to include more details as above.</p><p>7) The subsection “Rapid transdifferentiation into macrophages is associated with low expression of Myc targets” could potentially be explained by differences in resolution of the time series experiments. The authors need to demonstrate quantitatively that there are differences in the rates of transdifferentiation versus reprogramming, and what are the potential explanations. This is not aided by the difficulty in reading many of the plots, i.e. violin plots, then stating something is evident when it has not been demonstrated. The presentation of these data needs to be clearer. It is better to provide several clear examples that illustrate the authors' point, than to try to squeeze too many plots into a single figure panel.</p><p>8) Subsection “The rapid transdifferentiation of cells with low Myc activity is more direct” – it is not clear that higher Myc target expression is associated with a more persistent induction of a GMP-like state, as there is no indication of a relative time difference between Myc-high and Myc-low cells.</p><p>9) Unsurprisingly the monocyte and macrophage components are highly correlated – given this Figure 2F is arguably redundant.</p><p>10) Subsection “Efficient reprogramming is associated with high expression of Myc targets” – please confirm that the ICM component is not driven by Myc target genes; include a reference to Figure 2—figure supplement 3 for this.</p><p>11) Would any population of cycling unsynchronized cells also show considerable variation in Myc target gene expression? A proper comparison to control populations that are synchronized or unsynchronized, e.g. ESCs, would give some indication of where these pre-B cells sit in this respect.</p><p>12) Subsection “Variation in Myc activity reflects pre-existing variation in the starting cell population”, last sentence. This statement is too strong. Specifically, at no point have the authors presented evidence about speeds or rates of transdifferentiation and/or reprogramming.</p><p>13) Figure 3D – can you justify the thresholds used for the FSC and SSC? In particular, in later figure panels it seems like there is a strong overlap between the &quot;large&quot; cells and &quot;small&quot; cells.</p><p>14) a) From a more technical perspective, what is the motivation of using an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation, when a scaling factor would achieve the same result? If it does not, then demonstrate why.</p><p>b) Additionally, correction with MNN removes batch effects that are orthogonal to the biological signal. Using only first 2 PCs will likely miss genuine MNNs, and thus will not appropriately correct batch effects embedded in deeper reduced dimensions.</p><p>c) Subsection “Computation of similarity index of our single cell RNA-seq data with reference cell types”. Was this regressed out of the similarity index, or were the Myc target genes just removed before re-computing the scores? This needs clarification. More generally, a gene is expressed, not a signature, i.e. talking about the expression of a Myc signature/component does not make biological sense – it is an artificial construction. Say score, or loading, instead of expression.</p><p>d) Subsection “Characterization of the components: comparison to the mouse cell atlas” – what correlation coefficient was used here? Pearson's, Spearman's, Kendall's, etc.?</p><p>e) Subsection “Diffusion map and diffusion pseudotime” – why use a sigma of 0.12, this seems very specific?</p><p>f) Subsection “Differential expression analysis, clustering and heatmaps” – when describing a differential expression analysis it is standard practise to indicate the false discovery rate. Also, why use a fold change of 1.3? Again, this is a strangely arbitrary value that needs some justification.</p><p>15) Other issues:</p><p>a) Figure 1—figure supplement 3 caption is not complete – sub panel indicators are missing.</p><p>b) Abstract. Make it clearer that the two cell types are categorically different (&quot;only a single differentiation step apart&quot;, Discussion, also shown in Figure 4).</p><p>c) Figure 1I. Clarify why the 6h data were not included.</p><p>d) Figure 1—figure supplement 2A. Justify the selections of components and cell types. Explain &quot;Scheme of ICA decomposition the&quot;</p><p>e) Figure 1—figure supplement 4 (subsection “Rapid transdifferentiation into macrophages is associated with low expression of Myc targets”) &quot;This is also evident from the bi- or trimodal distribution of key marker genes at intermediate time-points of reprogramming and transdifferentiation&quot;. The bi/trimodality is not immediately evident from these violin plots so I suggest that you show the raw data for an exemplar marker gene and cell type (e.g. Nanog). In the text this is described as &quot;asynchronous behaviour&quot; yet formally this is an interpretation and at this stage in the manuscript no data supporting this has been provided.</p><p>f) Figure 2B. Explain that the start/end point data are not shown, and say why in the legend.</p><p>g) Explain at greater length the &quot;time window of highest responsiveness&quot;.</p><p>h) Introduction, &quot;homogeneous&quot;.</p><p>i) Subsection “Efficient reprogramming is associated with high expression of Myc targets”, change &quot;can&quot; to &quot;could&quot;.</p><p>j) Explain (re: 0.01% to 25%) that the conversion processes remain unclear.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41627.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Some decisions made in how the single cell data are processed to be poorly motivated and somewhat arbitrary.

The aim was to address how heterogeneous these ‘efficient’ transdifferentiation and reprogramming systems really are. Single cell RNA sequencing is the obvious unbiased approach to address this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In particular, and rather surprisingly, the authors do not check for heterogeneity in the starting population, for instance, is there any indication of structure in the pre-stimulated cells? This could be interrogated very simplistically, particularly as the authors make pains to point out bi- and tri-modality in hard to read violin plots for latter stages post-stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>When we initiated our experiments, we had no indication that the isolated pre-B cells are heterogeneous. Rather, this was a bold prediction that we made based on computational analyses of the single cell RNA-seq time series. We could clearly see that there was heterogeneity in the trans-differentiating and reprogramming cells. A major part of this heterogeneity related to expression of Myc target genes and this also related to variation in the total RNA content of each single cell. This could either have been heterogeneity induced by the TF pulse or heterogeneity that pre-existed in the starting cell population such that cells responded differently to the pulse. We tested this hypothesis and found that indeed the starting cell population consists of two discrete populations of cells with different sizes and cell cycle states. We show that these two populations differ substantially and reciprocally in their efficiency of trans-differentiation and reprogramming. In short, we think this study represents a great example of how unbiased single cell expression profiling can lead to completely unexpected (to us) and fundamental insights into a system that we have been studying for a very long time.</p><p>We have now included a two-dimensional t-SNE plot (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A) to show that the structure in the starting pre-B cell population largely overlaps with variation in the Myc component.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Large and small pre-B cells differ reciprocally in their propensity to transdifferentiate or reprogram”, last paragraph, could the small and large pre-B cells be in fundamentally different states?</p></disp-quote><p>Small and large pre-BII cells indeed represent different cell states: large pre-BII cells have higher Myc expression and activity and are proliferating. In contrast, small pre-BII cells are Myc low and quiescent. This is shown in Figure 3A-E, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-D, and described in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Discussion it is said that &quot;a cell's propensity for transdifferentiation or reprogramming can be disassociated, indicating that these two types of plasticity are fundamentally different&quot;.

The authors appear not to show, using highly purified populations of these 2 cell types, that &quot;these two types of plasticity are fundamentally different.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We show that purified small pre-BII cells trans-differentiate faster to become macrophages (Figure 3F, G) and are almost refractory to reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells. In contrast, large pre-BII cells (Figure 3H, I) trans-differentiate more slowly (and via a different path) but reprogram very efficiently. It is the comparison between these two very related cell types that we are making. Naively one might think that a more ‘plastic’ cell would respond more efficiently to both transitions. In contrast, what we see is that the cell type that reprograms better trans-differentiates worse and vice versa. We have tried to explain this better in the revised manuscript and have removed the term ‘fundamentally’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>OSKM includes MYC. Why does input MYC matter? Is it merely a marker for the two different cell types that differ in some other way? This needs to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>At the moment we cannot distinguish whether Myc activity is a marker that predicts the ability to reprogram from whether Myc is causally important in driving these differences between cell types. However, the fact that Myc levels predict the ability to reprogram across many different cell types (Figures 3J and K) and the known role of Myc in reprogramming make it a parsimonious explanation that Myc activity is causal. Based on the literature the effect of Myc expression in the starting cells could be mediated by at least three different scenarios as we now discuss in more detail:</p><p>“The Myc effect could be mediated by either one of different activities reported for the factor, or a combination of them. These include its ability to induce cell proliferation (Dang, 2012), its association with global chromatin changes (Knoepfler et al., 2006; Kieffer-Kwon et al., 2017), its capacity to transcriptionally amplify a large number of genes, including those essential for proliferation (Lin et al., 2012) and its induction of metabolic changes (Dang, 2012).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusion that MYC level inhibits lineage conversion is based on a single model, which only uses one transcription factor. A general statement should not be made based only on a single model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have modified the text appropriately (subsection “Variation in Myc activity reflects pre-existing variation in the starting cell population”, first paragraph). Myc levels predict reprogramming efficiency across a very wide range of cell types. However, we have only shown that Myc levels inhibit the ability to trans-differentiate for a single cell fate change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Analysis of open chromatin across the time points could be helpful. Does CEBPa open new chromatin or only bind to existing open chromatin sites?</p></disp-quote><p>As we have described earlier<sup>6,7</sup>, C/EBPa can bind not only to sites primed by other transcription factors, but also to closed chromatin, acting as a pioneer factor. For example, during iPS reprogramming C/EBPa primes pluripotency-associated enhancer regions for subsequent binding of the transcription factor Klf4<sup>7</sup>. Recent work by the Taipale lab has extended these observations<sup>8</sup>. This is now mentioned in the text (subsection “Large and small pre-B cells differ reciprocally in their propensity to transdifferentiate or reprogramrespective transdifferentiation and reprogramming propensities”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers agree that it is plausible that MYC expression level affects reprogramming.

This paper is now cited in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It may also be true that cycling cells are easier to reprogram.

Those for transdifferentiation are essentially as described earlier<sup>11-13</sup>, except that we added the 18hrs time point to permit a comparison with the reprogramming protocol. Thus, the time-points described in Figure 1A permit a direct comparison with the studies on bulk populations performed earlier. This has now been explained in the subsection “Single cell analysis of highly efficient transdifferentiation and reprogramming from the same cell population”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) When describing the results of the single cell experiments, there needs to be more specific examples of genes and their relevance.

We also performed a functional gene set analysis of each cluster highlighted in the heatmaps and presented this analysis in Supplementary file 6 and 7. These tables also presents the genes in each cluster that are also included in each gene set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Related to the above, the last paragraph of the subsection “Single cell analysis of highly efficient transdifferentiation and reprogramming from the same cell population”, should be split into 2 separate sections, and expanded to include more details as above.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now introduced a new subheading entitled:</p><p>“Cell conversion trajectories suggest deterministic nature of transcription factor induced transdifferentiation and reprogramming”.</p><p>We have now stated: “Our findings therefore support the notion that both transcription factor-induced transdifferentiation and reprogramming represent deterministic processes”.</p><p>We have now introduced a new subheading entitled:</p><p>“C/EBPa expression silences the B cell program and induces a progenitor state followed by a monocyte/macrophage program”.</p><p>We have now introduced a new subheading entitled:</p><p>“OSKM expression in C/EBPa-pulsed cells further accelerates B cell silencing and leads to the sequential upregulation of the pluripotency program”.</p><p>These last two sections were also expanded to include the description of relevant genes whose expression changes plus a short conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The subsection “Rapid transdifferentiation into macrophages is associated with low expression of Myc targets” could potentially be explained by differences in resolution of the time series experiments. The authors need to demonstrate quantitatively that there are differences in the rates of transdifferentiation versus reprogramming, and what are the potential explanations. This is not aided by the difficulty in reading many of the plots, i.e. violin plots, then stating something is evident when it has not been demonstrated. The presentation of these data needs to be clearer. It is better to provide several clear examples that illustrate the authors' point, than to try to squeeze too many plots into a single figure panel.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer might have misunderstood that we were trying to compare the rate/speed of reprogramming and transdifferentiation. However, what we were interested in was whether there are differences in timing among single cells within each cell fate transition. Indeed, the diffusion map in Figure 1B and even more clearly, the projection of single cells onto the B cell-, monocyte- and macrophage- specific components in Figure 1H, show that cells at 42 hours after C/EBPa induction are spread into three different clusters along the transdifferentiation trajectory: some cells are similar to those at earlier time points, others are similar to later time points and some are at an intermediate stage. This variability at intermediate time points is also visible in Figure 2A which shows the similarity of single cell transcriptome to reference macrophage transcriptome, and in Figure 1—figure supplement 4 where we substituted violin plots of single markers with dot plots, as suggested. This heterogeneity indicates that cells do not undergo transdifferentiation at the same speed but rather exhibit an asynchronous behaviour. Similar observations were made for the reprogramming trajectory (subsections “Heterogeneity at intermediate time pointssuggests asynchrony in transdifferentiation timing”, “Rapid transdifferentiation into macrophages is associated with low expression of Myc targets” and “Efficient reprogramming correlates with high Myc targets expression”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “The rapid transdifferentiation of cells with low Myc activity is more direct” – it is not clear that higher Myc target expression is associated with a more persistent induction of a GMP-like state, as there is no indication of a relative time difference between Myc-high and Myc-low cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree. From Figure 2E it is evident that the high Myc cells (green/blue) resemble GMPs up to 42hrs after C/EBPa induction, whereas the low Myc cells (yellow/orange) only show some similarity to GMPs at 18hrs after induction. In the subsection “Cells with high Myc activity transdifferentiate via a pronounced GMP-like cell state”, we have now reworded the text to make this clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Unsurprisingly the monocyte and macrophage components are highly correlated – given this Figure 2F is arguably redundant.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed Figure 2F and substituted it with the former Supplementary Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsection “Efficient reprogramming is associated with high expression of Myc targets” – please confirm that the ICM component is not driven by Myc target genes; include a reference to Figure 2—figure supplement 3 for this.</p></disp-quote><p>The conclusions about similarity to ICM hold even when the Myc component is regressed out of both our single cell and the cell atlas gene expression data before calculating the similarity score. This is shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3. We have now also added the corresponding reference relevant for this figure in the second paragraph of the subsection “Efficient reprogramming correlates with high Myc targets expression”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Would any population of cycling unsynchronized cells also show considerable variation in Myc target gene expression? A proper comparison to control populations that are synchronized or unsynchronized, e.g. ESCs, would give some indication of where these pre-B cells sit in this respect.</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t fully understand this point. If the reviewer suspects that the Myc component simply captures variations in cell cycle in our single cell data, we can assert that although correlated, Myc activity and cell cycle are at least partially independent. Thus, our ICA analysis distinguishes Myc targets from G2/M and S phase components (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Further, applying ICA to the cell atlas, which is based on bulk data obtained from unsynchronized cells, also reveals a Myc component distinct from the cell cycle component, which here includes both G2/M and S components.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41627-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig><p>Moreover, the effect of Myc expression on protein synthesis and cells size has also been experimentally shown to be independent of the cell cycle at all stages of B lymphocyte development<sup>14</sup>. In short, the Myc and cell cycle components are separable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Subsection “Variation in Myc activity reflects pre-existing variation in the starting cell population”, last sentence. This statement is too strong. Specifically, at no point have the authors presented evidence about speeds or rates of transdifferentiation and/or reprogramming.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have now changed the sentence into the following:</p><p>“Taken together, our analyses suggest a pre-existing heterogeneity in the starting cell population, corresponding to large and small pre-BII cells. Moreover, they suggest that small pre-BII cells should transdifferentiate faster but reprogram more slowly, while large pre-BII cells should transdifferentiate more slowly but reprogram faster”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Figure 3D – can you justify the thresholds used for the FSC and SSC? In particular, in later figure panels it seems like there is a strong overlap between the &quot;large&quot; cells and &quot;small&quot; cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that the reviewer refers to former Supplementary Figure 9 (current Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We agree that in these experiments the distinction between large and small cells is not entirely clear. For this reason we have introduced three gates: one for small cells with low granularity, one for large, granular cells and one for intermediate sized cells serving as a ‘buffer’. The results obtained for Myc expression justify this admittedly somewhat arbitrary separation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) a) From a more technical perspective, what is the motivation of using an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation, when a scaling factor would achieve the same result? If it does not, then demonstrate why.</p></disp-quote><p>Inverse hyperbolic sine transformation, defined as log(x+(χ2+1)<sup>1/2</sup>), is a log-like transformation commonly used in RNA-seq analyses. It has the advantage over logarithmic transformation that it is defined for 0 counts. It tends to log(2x) for large x and to log(1) = 0 for small x. It is therefore equivalent to log (x +1), which is also a commonly used transformation for RNA-seq data. This transformation makes the distribution of counts closer to a normal distribution although distributions among single cells are not comparable. The scaling factor on the other hand serves the purpose of making the distribution of expression values comparable among cells despite different number of total reads. Therefore, applying a scaling factor (which we also do) and transforming the data using inverse hyperbolic sine transformation are two distinct but not mutually exclusive procedures that serve different purposes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Additionally, correction with MNN removes batch effects that are orthogonal to the biological signal. Using only first 2 PCs will likely miss genuine MNNs, and thus will not appropriately correct batch effects embedded in deeper reduced dimensions.</p></disp-quote><p>Some batch effects embedded in reduced dimensions might be missed at this step but we further removed any residual batch effects by applying ICA extracting 35 components (which capture all the meaningful variance in the data) and filtering out 15 independent components showing residual batch effects, in particular time point specific batch effects which were not captured by MNN. This is explained in Materials and methods (subsection “Dimensionality reduction, batch correction and gene expression reconstruction”) and illustrated in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Moreover, we have tried to use MNN batch correction using the first 35 PCs but after applying ICA and extracting 35 independent components we still find components capturing batch effects, including time point-specific batch effects (see for example component 9 and component 24 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41627-resp-fig2-v3"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Subsection “Computation of similarity index of our single cell RNA-seq data with reference cell types”. Was this regressed out of the similarity index, or were the Myc target genes just removed before re-computing the scores? This needs clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>The Myc component was regressed out of the expression data before re-computing the similarity scores. This is now explained better in the Materials and methods section and reads as follows.</p><p>“We therefore regress out the Myc component before computation of the similarity index to derive a corrected similarity index. This was done by reconstructing both the cell atlas and our single cell expression data without the Myc component”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More generally, a gene is expressed, not a signature, i.e. talking about the expression of a Myc signature/component does not make biological sense – it is an artificial construction. Say score, or loading, instead of expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We now changed this into Myc target gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Subsection “Characterization of the components: comparison to the mouse cell atlas” – what correlation coefficient was used here? Pearson's, Spearman's, Kendall's, etc.?</p></disp-quote><p>It’s a Pearson’s correlation. This is now specified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Subsection “Diffusion map and diffusion pseudotime” – why use a sigma of 0.12, this seems very specific?</p></disp-quote><p>The diffusion map is just for visualization purposes. We used the ‘find_sigmas’ function in the R library ‘destiny’ to automatically select the sigma of the Gaussian kernel. This function suggested a sigma of 0.1. With this value however, the trajectories look very compressed and difficult to visualize. That is the only reason we chose a slightly larger sigma of 0.12. We have now included the sigma 0.1 and sigma 0.15 versions to show the effect of varying sigma in Figure 1—figure supplement 2F. As can be appreciated, the main message of the figure does not change if we use sigma = 0.1, 0.12 or 0.15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41627-resp-fig3-v3"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) Subsection “Differential expression analysis, clustering and heatmaps” – when describing a differential expression analysis it is standard practise to indicate the false discovery rate. Also, why use a fold change of 1.3? Again, this is a strangely arbitrary value that needs some justification.</p></disp-quote><p>All genes presented in the heatmaps are differentially expressed at 5% FDR. However, with so many cells even small changes in gene expression are significant at 5% FDR. Thus, we added an additional fold change cut off to reduce the number of genes visualized in the heatmaps. We agree this cut off is arbitrary, however it is as arbitrary as any other cut off on fold change or FDR. We based our conclusions on gene set enrichment analysis, which is robust against the inclusion or exclusion of single genes close to the threshold. Repeating the analysis with more or less stringent cut off on the fold change does not alter the conclusions on the processes that are regulated during transdifferentiation and reprogramming. For example, 126 genes are upregulated with a fold change of 1.3 between 6h and 18h after C/EBPa induction. If we further restrict the cut off to 1.4, the number of genes is reduced to 67 and if we use a cut off of 1.2 it increases to 288. However, the gene set enriched categories that are over represented among these genes are basically the same (innate immune response, cytokine production, inflammation, see attached excel table), showing that our analysis is robust even when changing thresholds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Other issues:</p><p>a) Figure 1—figure supplement 3 caption is not complete – sub panel indicators are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Abstract.

The bi/trimodality is not immediately evident from these violin plots so I suggest that you show the raw data for an exemplar marker gene and cell type (e.g. Nanog).</p></disp-quote><p>We now better explain the selection of components and cell types in the Materials and methods section. It now reads as follows:</p><p>“Characterization of the components: comparison to the mouse cell atlas. We compared our data to a comprehensive atlas of murine cell types (Hutchins et al., 2017). […] We then defined the cell type specificity of a single cell component based on the cells that have the most extreme distribution in the sample scores of the atlas component(s) with the highest absolute Pearson’s correlation values with the single cell component.” We also now show dot plots instead of violin plots in Figure 1—figure supplement 4.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the text this is described as &quot;asynchronous behaviour&quot; yet formally this is an interpretation and at this stage in the manuscript no data supporting this has been provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified this into: “apparent asynchronous behaviour”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) Figure 2B.
