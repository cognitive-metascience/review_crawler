How the ability of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment to bind self- and foreign-pMHC changes over the lifespan remains a fundamental aspect of T-cell biology that is largely unexplored. We report that, while old mice (18–22 months) contain fewer CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells compared with adults (8–12 weeks), those that remain have a higher intrinsic affinity for self-pMHC, as measured by CD5 expression. Old mice also have more cells that bind individual or multiple distinct foreign-pMHCs, and the fold increase in pMHC-binding populations is directly related to their CD5 levels. These data demonstrate that the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment preferentially accumulates promiscuous constituents with age as a consequence of higher affinity T-cell receptor interactions with self-pMHC.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05949.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05949.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05949.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system's T cells help the body to recognize and destroy harmful pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. T cells ‘remember’ immunity-inducing fragments, called antigens, from the pathogens they have encountered. This memory then allows the immune system to quickly fend off infections if those pathogens, or even related pathogens, invade again. Vaccines exploit the ability to form immunological memory by exposing the body to harmless forms of the pathogen, or even just particular antigens from it. This allows the T cells to learn how to identify the pathogen without any risk of illness.</p><p>Vaccines have been extremely successful and have helped to virtually eliminate some diseases. However, for reasons that are unclear, the immune systems of older adults become less functional, so vaccines often lose their effectiveness. Paradoxically, as people age T cells become more likely to attack the body's cells, causing autoimmune diseases like arthritis. Understanding what happens to aging T cells to cause these immune changes may help scientists design vaccines that remain effective as people age.</p><p>Little is known about what happens to a particular type of T cell—the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells—as people age, even though this population plays a critical role in providing other immune cells with detailed instructions on when and how to fight a pathogen. Now, Deshpande et al. show that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells undergo a remarkable set of changes in aging mice. Mice that are nearing the end of their natural lifespan have fewer CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than younger mice. However, those CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that remain are more likely than CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from younger mice to be able to recognize multiple antigens. This increase in the proportion of multitasking CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells corresponds with an increased tendency of these cells to bind to the body's own cells. If similar changes occur in older people, this may help explain some age-related autoimmune diseases. Yet, the relationship between the increase in multitasking CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the decrease in immune function with aging remains to be fully explored.</p><p>The challenge for scientists now is to determine how these age-related changes in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells affect immune responses to vaccines or pathogens in older individuals. One implication of this work is that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses may be too robust and out of balance with other arms of the immune system. This could even lead to conditions such as autoimmunity. Alternatively, while there may be more CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that can multitask by recognizing multiple antigens, their ability to respond appropriately to infections or vaccinations may be diminished. What is clear from the work of Deshpande et al. is that the rules that have been defined for immunity in adults change with aging. The rules that govern immunity in the elderly must be more clearly defined to realize the goal of designing immunotherapies, such as vaccines, that provide protection throughout the lifespan.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05949.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05949.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>CD4</kwd><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>repertoire</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>class II MHC</kwd><kwd>CD5</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BAA-NIAID-DAIT-NIHAI2010085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuhns</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuhns</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Higher affinity for self-pMHC complexes and broader promiscuity for foreign-pMHC complexes imparts a fitness advantage within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment in older mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Each T-cell expresses a T-cell receptor (TCR) encoded by rearranged gene segments and non-germline nucleotides.

Yet, this potential cannot be realized. Thymic development limits clonal representation to T-cells bearing TCRs within an affinity window for self-pMHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Savage and Davis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klein et al., 2014</xref>), while peripheral space physically constrains the number of T-cells present to recognize foreign-pMHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mason, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vrisekoop et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, time—with its age-associated changes in thymic expression of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs), thymic architecture, antigen experience, and homeostasis—imposes an overarching pressure that limits the binding capacity of a repertoire for self- and foreign-pMHC to each constituent's prior history of TCR–pMHC interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nikolich-Zugich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Surh and Sprent, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chinn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Griffith et al., 2012</xref>).

This indicates that the increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells binding E641:I-A<sup>b</sup> is not unique. Rather, since CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells decline with aging, those that are left appear to bind foreign pMHC more promiscuously. Consistent with this interpretation, the number of naive cells binding OVA+MCC was higher in old mice compared with adults, as were the number of memory cells binding E641+OVA or OVA+MCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7 fig2s8 fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplements 7–9</xref>). Altogether, these data provide evidence that the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment becomes polyspecific over time.</p><p>Such results could reflect age-related changes in thymic selection, homeostatic signals, or both. To evaluate the former, we enriched thymocytes from adult and old mice with E641:I-A<sup>b</sup>, OVA:I-A<sup>b</sup>, and MCC:I-E<sup>k</sup> tetramers. The frequency of E641-bound CD4 single positive (SP) cells was higher for old thymocytes compared with the adults, while the frequency of OVA and MCC-bound CD4SPs did not differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). CD4SPs binding two distinct tetramers were not detected amongst the small number of tetramer-enriched samples. This is not surprising given that dual binders average &lt;10% of a peripheral population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). Since thymic output remains constant as a function of size over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hale et al., 2006</xref>), the higher frequency of E641-bound CD4SP thymocytes in old mice suggests that more E641-binders leave the thymus of old mice than adults on a daily basis. However, mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells re-entering the thymus increase from ∼10% in adult mice to ∼20% in old mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hale et al., 2006</xref>). Our analysis cannot resolve CD4SPs from mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, so the impact of recirculation on our analysis is unclear. Nevertheless, the data suggest that age-related changes in thymic selection impact the clonal representation and binding capacity of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05949.014</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Evidence for changes in selection of E641-binding CD4SP thymocytes with aging.</title><p>Frequencies of (<bold>A</bold>) E641:I-A<sup>b+</sup>, (<bold>B</bold>) OVA:I-A<sup>b+</sup>, and (<bold>C</bold>) MCC:I-E<sup>k+</sup> CD4 single positive (SP) thymocytes per 10<sup>7</sup> CD4SP thymocytes are shown.

While most studies focus on adult mouse or human T-cells, when immunity is at its peak, there is a growing appreciation that the pressures imposed by time on thymic selection and peripheral space result in a repertoire that continuously evolves in each individual. Here, we contribute to our basic understanding of T-cell biology by reporting that the size of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment contracts with aging but, unlike CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, the capacity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells to bind foreign-pMHC increases over the lifespan.</p><p>Thymic involution could contribute to these changes in multiple ways. A decrease in cortical thymic epithelial cells and changes in antigen processing could increase competition for positively selecting pMHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chinn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klein et al., 2014</xref>), favoring higher TCR affinity for self-pMHC. In addition, decreased expression of TRAs on fewer medullary TECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chinn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Griffith et al., 2012</xref>) could lead to competition for negatively selecting pMHC with aging. Experimentally limiting thymic selection differentially impacts the CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartments, with CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells becoming more polyspecific and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells becoming more pMHC focused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huseby et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yin et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, age-related changes in the thymus would be expected to restrict negative selection and result in a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment with a broader binding capacity, as observed here. It is also noteworthy that T-cells can productively rearrange two TCRα subunits and express two TCRs that increase reactivity to self- and allo-pMHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ni et al., 2014</xref>). Whether T-cells expressing two TCRs increase over time remains unexplored.</p><p>Changes in peripheral space are also likely to contribute to the results reported here. A link between higher affinity for self-pMHC and residence within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell memory pool of adult mice was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mandl et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we extended this observation to naive and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells in old mice, indicating that affinity for self-pMHC influences clonal fitness over time. This would be akin to the affinity of TCR–pMHC interactions influencing clonal fitness within a polyclonal response to cognate antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lanzavecchia and Sallusto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gett et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Malherbe et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, CD5 levels on adult tetramer-binding memory subsets directly correlated with their fold expansion over the lifespan showing that CD5 levels have a clear predictive value when identifying populations with a long-term advantage for clonal representation within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment.</p><p>Altogether, the data presented here suggest a more complex relationship between CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and immune senescence than has been reported for the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. While an increase in binding capacity may compensate for a decrease in total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers, the consequences of this increase remain unclear. Certainly, a population with a higher affinity for self-pMHC and broader binding capacity poses obvious risks that could explain the increase in age-related autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and giant cell arteritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weyand et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mohan et al., 2011</xref>).

The tetramer-enriched ‘bound’ fraction and an aliquot of flow-thru, or ‘unbound’ fraction, were stained with a cocktail of flourochrome-labeled antibodies for 30 min at 4°C (anti-CD19 [eBiosciences], anti-CD8α [eBiosciences], anti-CD11c [eBiosciences], anti-F4/80 [Biolegend], anti-CD3 [eBiosciences], anti-CD4 [eBiosciences], anti-CD44 [eBiosciences], anti-CD5 [BD Pharmingen]). Cells were washed, and the samples were analyzed with a LSRII cytometer (Beckton Dickinson Franklin Lakes, NJ). Analysis was performed using FlowJo software (Treestar Ashland, OR). Gating was performed as shown in figure supplements.</p><p>Tetramers are composed of pMHC monomers and streptavidin (SA) conjugated to a fluorescent protein (FP). Two-color tetramer enrichment and gating for a single pMHC specificity was performed as a method for reducing false-positives in tetramer analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stetson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Obar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>). The operating principle followed here is that cells which bind to tetramers via TCR–pMHC interactions will fall on a diagonal, since binding should be proportional for each, while those that bind to the FP in a TCR-independent manner should fall off the diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 1, 3</xref>). The dump tetramer approach was used for samples in which E641:I-A<sup>b</sup>, OVA:I-A<sup>b</sup>, and MCC:I-E<sup>k</sup> tetramers were used in a single sample for enrichment with anti-His beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Savage et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Newell et al., 2009</xref>). Here, cells bound to a tetramer of interest (e.g., E641:I-A<sup>b</sup>) were gated and then those that also bound the other two tetramers (e.g., OVA:I-A<sup>b</sup> and MCC:I-E<sup>k</sup>) were excluded as a ‘dump’ to enumerate cells bound to one tetramer species only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). The dumped cells could be false-positives binding SA, MHC, or the dump tetramer-associated FP nonspecifically; however, they could be bound via TCR–pMHC interactions. Importantly, the operating principles of both the dump and two-color methods were employed to enumerate cells binding two tetramers at once. Specifically, to enumerate cells bound to a specific combination (e.g., E641:I-A<sup>b</sup> + OVA:I-A<sup>b</sup>), those also binding the third tetramer (e.g., MCC:I-E<sup>k</sup>) were dumped prior to enumerating cells bound to both tetramers of interest by two-color analysis. Combining the two approaches should enumerate cells binding tetramers via TCR–pMHC interactions and exclude dumped cells that bind SA, MHC, or the dump-associated FP and those excluded by two-color analysis that bind the FP associated with the tetramers of interest in a non-specific manner. Combining both approaches by sequential gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>) yielded the numbers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–L</xref>. The same overall results were achieved if quadrant gating was used for two-color analysis after applying the dump gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7 fig2s8 fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplements 7–9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Thymocyte preparation</title><p>Thymi from old and adult mice were harvested in 1 ml of un-supplemented RPMI. Thymi from 4–5 old mice were pooled in order to take into account the drop in the total number of thymocytes in old mice due to thymic involution and to increase the total number of cells for the tetramer enrichment processing. Thymi were incubated with 3 ml of Accutase (eBiosciences) at 37°C for 30 min to achieve optimal cell detachment. Single cell suspension of thymocytes was depleted of red blood cells with ACK lysis buffer. The total number of thymocytes in old mice was 10-fold lower (∼2 × 10<sup>7</sup>) than adults (∼2 × 10<sup>8</sup>) due to thymic involution. The adult samples were then normalized for comparison by pooling 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> thymocytes from 4 to 5 adult mice. Thymocytes were Fc blocked on ice for 20 min. Cells were stained with E641:I-A<sup>b</sup>–PerCP-Cy5.5, OVA:I-A<sup>b</sup>–PE-Cy7, MCC:I-E<sup>k</sup>–PE and each of these tetramers in a common FP (APC). Each tetramer was added at a final concentration of 25 nM. Tetramer enrichment was carried out as described above. The tetramer enriched ‘bound’ fraction and an aliquot of flow-thru, or ‘unbound’ fraction were stained with cocktail of flourochrome-labeled antibodies for 30 min at 4°C (anti-CD19, anti-CD8α, anti-CD11c, anti-F4/80, anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD5). Cells were washed and the samples were analyzed with a LSRII cytometer (Beckton Dickinson). Analysis was performed using FlowJo software (Treestar) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. The single color specificities of two of the tetramers (e.g., OVA and MCC) were used as dump tetramers prior to two-color analysis of the third tetramer (e.g., E641).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Hybridoma cell lines</title><p>TCR negative 58α<sup>−</sup>β<sup>−</sup> hybridomas cells were transduced with retroviral vectors encoding the OT II, 5c.c7 or 2B4 TCR, full-length CD3 subunits, and CD4 according to previously described protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kuhns and Davis, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo proliferation assay</title><p>BrdU was administered to mice through drinking water at the concentration of 1 mg/ml + 1% glucose.

While the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are reasonably convincing in this regard, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are not. Without double staining with the same tetramer labeled with two different fluorochromes, it is harder to assess the validity of the staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Except for 4B, the tetramer-binding cells are poorly resolved from the background. A control to show that no events are in the CD3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> gate is absent. The data suggest that, for any antigenic peptide, equal numbers of precursors are available in the naive and the memory CD4 T cell compartments. These issues raise the concern that the detected cells are not binding the tetramers by their TCRs. About one third of the E641:I-A<sup>b</sup>-specific cells also bind to OVA323-339:I-A<sup>b</sup> in young adults, not to mention old mice. This is an extraordinarily high number since peptides that bind to the same MHCII molecule need to share at least a couple of TCR contact amino acids to cross-react on the same TCR (Birnbaum et al., 2014). Since core nonamer sequences are not defined for either E641 or OVA323-339, it is not clear if they share any such TCR contact amino acids. The specificity concern is exacerbated by the fact that the cells that bind E641:I-A<sup>b</sup> and OVA323-339:I-A<sup>b</sup> do not undergo clonal expansion after immunization with E641. It is therefore essential to perform additional experiments with the resolving power of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to provide convincing evidence that the tetramer binding being detected, particularly by ‘polyspecific’ CD4 T cells, is indeed via their TCRs.</p><p>3) It would be important to address directly the contribution of differences created during thymic selection versus those created during peripheral residence to the distinctions of naive CD4 T cell repertories between young and aged mice, such as data on repertoires of maturing thymocytes between young and aged mice, for example.</p><p>4) CD5 levels are interpreted throughout as indicators of self-pMHC affinity of TCRs. It would be important to have at least some data providing independent indications supporting this interpretation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Affinity for self drives the preferential accumulation of promiscuous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells over the lifespan” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised manuscript was further evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors (BRE). Please find below the comments, which were assembled by the BRE member, and the offer we can make at this stage.</p><p>While the reviewers all find your work interesting, the revised manuscript does not substantively address all the four major concerns raised in the first review. Therefore, it does not cross the enthusiasm threshold for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> as a full article.</p><p>The first concern is that it would be useful to have some indication of the mechanisms by which TCR repertoire modifications during aging differ between CD4 and CD8 compartments. While the difficulty of providing this is acknowledged, it remains the case that the revised manuscript does not provide any additional data addressing such mechanistic possibilities, reducing cross-disciplinary impact of the manuscript. The second concern is that the seemingly high frequencies of polyreactivity the authors obtain in their analysis of CD4 T cell repertoires necessitate a stringent-ER identification of target-specific TCRs and/or some independent evidence (if not explanation) for high-frequency polyspecificity. This issue has been addressed, albeit mostly via plausible arguments rather than additional data. The third concern is regarding the thymic and/or peripheral origin of the reported repertoire differences. The authors have indeed provided very interesting data for this issue, and have directly and substantively addressed the concern, improving the significance of the findings in the manuscript. The fourth concern is regarding the use of CD5 levels as a surrogate marker for self pMHC-affinity of TCRs. While the revised manuscript makes a case for this by plausible arguments, the relationship still remains a hypothesis, albeit a reasonable one.</p><p>Under these circumstances, particularly in light of the lack of mechanistic insights, the scope of the impact of the manuscript is limited for its publication as a full <italic>eLife</italic> research article.</p><p>However, the findings in the manuscript concerning the re-shaping of the CD4 T cell repertoire in aging mice are novel and of great interest and, therefore, deserve rapid publication.</p><p>Under these circumstances, it is recommended that the manuscript be re-written as a ‘Short Report’. This is no doubt a challenge, since limits for a short report involve a 2000-word text limit and a four-item main display limit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/category/short-report">http://elifesciences.org/category/short-report</ext-link>). Nonetheless, we hope that you will undertake this to get these interesting and provocative findings published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05949.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The manuscript demonstrates that the specificity (and perhaps self-pMHC affinity) landscape of the TCR repertoire shows interesting aging-related changes in the CD4 T cell compartment that are distinct from those reported for the CD8 T cell compartment (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"><italic>Decman et al., 2012</italic></xref><italic>).

Indeed, several studies have described a decrease in the numbers of CD8 T cells specific for foreign class I pMHC with aging. These include a decline in CD8 T cells specific for peptide epitopes from ovalbumin, vaccinia virus, influenza, HSV-1, LCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Decman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rudd et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smithey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yager et al., 2008</xref>), and WNV (Janko Nikolich-Zugich, personal communication). In contrast, age-related changes in the capacity of the CD4 T cell compartment to bind foreign-pMHC have been largely unexplored. Our results show a significant increase in CD4 T cells that bind foreign-pMHC over time, even though the absolute number of CD4 T cells declines. Aging thus inversely impacts the CD4 and CD8 T cell compartments. We consider this to represent an important advance in our fundamental understanding of T cell biology. Although the mechanistic basis for these changes will benefit from further elaboration in future studies, here we establish a mechanistic link between tonic TCR interactions with self-pMHC, steady state proliferation in vivo (Figure 6 and 7), and the increase in binding capacity observed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figure 3 and 4</xref>). We have also now added analysis of thymocytes in response to major point #3 (Figure 5). These data support the notion that both thymic and peripheral pressures contribute to age-related changes in the binding capacity of the CD4 T cell compartment.</p><p><italic>2) The TCR specificity of the tetramer binding, the assay upon which all the results depend, must be established with greater rigor than at present.

With this in mind, our experiments were conducted with an extensive panel of dump antibodies as well as the two main published protocols for stringency in tetramer-based analysis: (i) dump tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Newell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Savage et al., 1999</xref>), or (ii) two-color tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Obar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stetson et al., 2002</xref>). Each strategy has pros and cons. Dump tetramers gate out false-positive cells bound to some component of a tetramer – be it streptavidin (SA), the MHC, or the fluorescent protein (FP) used for the dump tetramer– in a TCR-independent manner. This method also excludes cells bound to two different tetramers (the dump and subject tetramers) in a TCR-specific manner, either because they express one TCR that binds both pMHC, or two TCRs that individually bind two distinct pMHC. The two-color approach selectively analyzes cells binding the same tetramer made with two different FPs on a diagonal, since tetramer binding is proportional to the affinity of TCR-pMHC interactions and the differently colored tetramers should bind a specific cell equivalently. This approach lowers the limit of detection for low affinity cells, since tetramers of both colors are competing for limited TCR space on a T cell, but it excludes from analysis those cells that bind exclusively to one of the two FPs as false-positives. Cells bound to SA, the MHC, or shared motifs between FPs (as could occur with the structurally related phycobiliproteins PE and APC) in a TCR-independent manner are included in the analysis as false-positives.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-4I</xref> we applied a sequential gating scheme (now Figure 4–figure supplement 5) to enumerate those cells that bind one tetramer exclusively (e.g. E641-only) after dumping out those cells that also bind the other tetramers (e.g. OVA and MCC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-4I</xref>). Figure 4–figure supplement 6 has now been added to show how sequential gating impacts enumeration of the tetramer-bound populations under consideration. Theoretically, for the reasons outlined above, using two dump tetramers to enumerate the tetramer-only populations should be at least as stringent as the two-color approach.</p><p>A key point of emphasis is that we employed both the dump and two-color tetramer protocols to enumerate the ‘polyspecific’ CD4 T cells in question (e.g. E641+OVA). We realize from the Reviewer’s comments that our sequential gating scheme may not illustrate this point as well as a quadrant gate, and thus may cause confusion, even though it operationally achieves the same goal. Figure 4–figure supplements 8-10 have now been added to better illustrate the application of two-color staining, using quadrant gates, before and after the use of a dump tetramer (e.g. MCC) to identify cells binding strictly to two tetramers (e.g. E641+OVA). The numbers of ‘polyspecifc’ cells enumerated by two-color staining pre- and post-dump are also shown in these figure supplements. The derived numbers differ slightly from those obtained with our sequential gating scheme, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J-4L</xref>, but the overall results and conclusions remain the same. We have also revised the text to better describe the logic behind our tetramer analysis (subsections “WNV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells increase over time”, “Enumeration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells binding multiple pMHC from the same mice” and “The CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment becomes more promiscuous for foreign pMHC over time”). Importantly, since the two-color approach is inherent within our analysis of the polyspecific cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J-4L</xref>, and applied after a dump tetramer, we consider the resolving power of these experiments to be at least equal to that of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>We are also providing data to the reviewers from additional control experiments, which we performed with TCR negative hybridomas, in order to ensure that the stringency employed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> provides resolving power equal to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Here we used TCR negative 58α<sup>-</sup>β<sup>-</sup> cells to model the two-color approach used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the dump approach used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-4I</xref>, and the use of both for polyspecific cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J-4L</xref>.</p><p>TCR negative 58α<sup>-</sup>β<sup>-</sup> cells were incubated with E641 tetramers made with PE and APC, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, to model false-positive cells binding to both tetramers versus one or the other. A large number of events were collected since our tetramers are not generally “sticky” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1A and 1B</xref>). We enumerated 222 false positive cells on the diagonal (of a total of 464 false-positives) per 500,000 cells collected. In the same experiment, 58α<sup>-</sup>β<sup>-</sup> cells were incubated with E641-APC, OVA-PerCP-Cy5.5, and MCC-PE tetramers as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We enumerated 225 per 500,000 E641-bound cells without excluding cells binding OVA or MCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1C</xref>) and 126 per 500,000 E641-bound cells after excluded cells bound to OVA and MCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1D</xref>) as per the dump approach applied to E641-only cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>. Both approaches reduce the number of false-positive cells enumerated in these experiments by a similar magnitude, suggesting to us that the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3B and 4G-4I</xref> are at least comparable in stringency.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05949.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Exclusion of false-positive cells by two-color and dump tetramer analysis modeled with TCR negative T cell hybridoma.

These could bind both pMHC with a single TCR. Or, this percentage is within the range of cells expressing two TCR alpha chains that could bind to two distinct tetramers via two distinct TCRs. Also, particularly without the dump tetramer, some of these cells are likely to be non-specific binders.</p><p>B) “A control to show that no events are in the CD3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> gate is absent.”</p><p>Our anti-CD8 mAb was included in our panel of dump mAbs, as in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Obar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Savage et al., 1999</xref>), so it is difficult to confidently resolve CD8 T cells from the remainder of the cell populations we are dumping from our analysis. These were dumped since the literature suggests there should be some CD8 T cells binding class II pMHC, particularly the allo-pMHC, and we have no idea how age-associated changes in homeostatic or thymic pressures might impact MHC restriction (Hansen et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huseby et al., 2005</xref>; Robey et al., 1991). We have added specificity data, shown in Figure 4–figure supplement 1, to complement the specificity controls already shown in the manuscript in order to further validate our reagents.</p><p>C) “…the same MHCII molecule need to share at least a couple of TCR contact amino acids to cross-react on the same TCR (Birnbaum et al., 2014).”</p><p>The reviewers make an important point that we have considered. Table 1 has now been added to show the E641 and OVA peptides with the predicted core nonamer sequences and putative TCR contact residues (P2, P5, and P8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>). Both peptides contain small hydrophobic side chains at P2 (Val and Ala, respectively) and polar residues at P5 (Asn and Glu, respectively). This suggests some weak similarities between TCR contact residues of the two peptides that may hint at a mechanistic basis for the cross reactivity we observe.</p><p>The study cited above does not rule out the possibility of polyspecific cells that bind two distinct, or at least more distantly related pMHC in a TCR-dependent manner. Indeed, they pointed out that examples exist in the literature for TCRs recognizing non-homologous peptides (Birnbaum et al., 2014). Furthermore, TCRs have been described that focus more on the MHC than the peptide and even cross-react with class I MHC after selection with a single class II pMHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huseby et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, Jenkins and colleagues showed CD4 SP thymocytes binding both 2W:I-A<sup>b</sup> and IgM:I-A<sup>b</sup> or 2W:I-A<sup>b</sup> and FliC:I-A<sup>b</sup> tetramers under conditions of limiting negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2010</xref>). By our assessment (not shown), the putative core nonamers of the former share hydrophobic residues at P2 (Trp and Val) and P5 (Leu and Ala) that vary in size, as do the latter at P5 (Leu and Ile) and P8 (Trp and Leu). We think it is therefore possible that exceptions to the requirement of shared TCR contacts for cross reactivity become more frequent under conditions of limiting negative selection with aging. Also, since ∼10% of peripheral T cells express dual TCRs (which represent &gt; 40% of alloreactive cells), the possibility exists that our polyspecific cells may be recognizing multiple pMHC via dual TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ni et al., 2014</xref>). We think this is an important and exciting future direction that extends beyond what can be reasonably explored in one study.</p><p><italic>3) It would be important to address directly the contribution of differences created during thymic selection versus those created during peripheral residence to the distinctions of naive CD4 T cell repertories between young and aged mice, such as data on repertoires of maturing thymocytes between young and aged mice, for example</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this line of inquiry is important for a deeper mechanistic understanding of our findings. To address this comment, we first analyzed the relationship between CD5 expression on adult and old peripheral T cells versus CD4 SP thymocytes (now shown in Figure 1–figure supplement 1). CD5 levels are higher on both adult and old CD4 SP thymocytes than on total adult CD4 T cells, but not different from each other. No clear connection can be made with these data and our previous results.</p><p>We also performed anti-His tag-based tetramer enrichment of adult and old thymocytes with E641, OVA, and MCC tetramers (now shown in Figure 5 and Figure 5–figure supplement 1). In consideration of the Reviewers’ comments, each tetramer had a unique color (E641 = PerCpCy5.5; OVA = PE-Cy7; MCC = PE) and all tetramers also had a common color (APC). Here we dumped the unique colors of two of the tetramers (e.g. OVA and MCC) and then enumerated those cells that bind the remaining tetramer in two colors (e.g. E641). Since old mice had ten-fold fewer (∼2X10<sup>7</sup>) total thymocytes than adult mice (∼2X10<sup>8</sup>), thymocytes from 4-5 old mice were pooled for tetramer enrichment. This was repeated with two data sets representing 4 mice/group and one representing 5/group from a total of three experiments. For the adults in each experiment, an aliquot of 2X10<sup>7</sup> cells from individual mice were pooled to equalize our tetramer enrichment samples between the adult and old populations.</p><p>More E641-binding CD4 SP thymocytes were enumerated from equivalent numbers of thymocytes from old mice compared to adults, indicating that the percentage of E641-bound CD4 SP is higher in old mice. The number of tetramer bound cells for OVA and MCC were not significantly different between adult and old in our sample size. The numbers of tetramer bound cells were so low that we are not surprised we did not detect cells binding two distinct tetramers, given their relatively low frequency in the periphery. Since Fink and colleagues have reported that thymic output is consistent over time relative to thymic size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hale et al., 2006</xref>), the implication is that on a daily basis a higher number of E641 binders leave the thymus in old mice compared with the adult to take up residence in the periphery. Clearly, this is an important direction for further elaboration in future studies.</p><p><italic>4) CD5 levels are interpreted throughout as indicators of self-pMHC affinity of TCRs. It would be important to have at least some data providing independent indications supporting this interpretation</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers on this point as this was the motivation for the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. First we assessed relative TCR levels, since TCR down regulation occurs upon TCR engagement, and demonstrated that they are inversely correlated with relative CD5 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We also assessed BrdU incorporation, which is dependent on TCR engagement, and showed higher BrdU incorporation occurred in cells with higher CD5 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The data in these figures were presented to complement the studies we referenced in the text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mandl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mandl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Persaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2001</xref>). Such work is also consistent with a recent study from Jameson and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fulton et al., 2015</xref>). We think the sum of the data in these bodies of work provide sufficient justification for our use of CD5 expression as a surrogate measure of tonic TCR interactions for self-pMHC.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[…] While the reviewers all find your work interesting, the revised manuscript does not substantively address all the four major concerns raised in the first review.
