the biological nitrogen cycle is catalyzed by nitrogenase, a two-component metalloenzyme. Understanding of the transformation of the inert resting state of the active site FeMo-cofactor into an activated state capable of reducing dinitrogen remains elusive. Here we report the catalysis dependent, site-selective incorporation of selenium into the FeMo-cofactor from selenocyanate as a newly identified substrate and inhibitor. The 1.60 Å resolution structure reveals selenium occupying the S2B site of FeMo-cofactor in the <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> MoFe-protein, a position that was recently identified as the CO-binding site. The Se2B-labeled enzyme retains substrate reduction activity and marks the starting point for a crystallographic pulse-chase experiment of the active site during turnover. Through a series of crystal structures obtained at resolutions of 1.32–1.66 Å, including the CO-inhibited form of Av1-Se2B, the exchangeability of all three belt-sulfur sites is demonstrated, providing direct insights into unforeseen rearrangements of the metal center during catalysis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11620.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11620.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11620.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The element nitrogen is required for all forms of life, and is an essential component of important biological molecules such as DNA and proteins. The most abundant form of nitrogen is dinitrogen, which comprises 78% of the Earth’s atmosphere. However, dinitrogen is highly unreactive, and so the nitrogen must be converted into a more reactive form before it can be used biologically. The only known enzyme capable of carrying out this reaction is called nitrogenase, but how this enzyme performs this difficult task is still not understood.</p> <p>Enzymes contain a region known as the active site, to which substrates – the molecules that the enzyme acts upon – bind. The active site of nitrogenase contains a region called the FeMo-cofactor, which must transform from an inactive to an active state to catalyze the conversion of dinitrogen to ammonia.</p> <p>Another substrate of the nitrogenase enzyme is a molecule called selenocyanate, which is made up of atoms of selenium, carbon and nitrogen. Spatzal, Perez et al. examined the structure of the active site of nitrogenase taken from the bacteria species <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> while the enzyme transformed selenocyanate. This revealed unexpected structural changes of the FeMo-cofactor that significantly challenge previous assumptions about how the active site works. For example, a single selenium atom from selenocyanate can be incorporated into a specific position of the FeMo-cofactor, which highlights the importance of this position for the enzyme’s initial interaction with substrates.</p> <p>Spatzal, Perez et al. then used the inserted selenium atom as a probe to investigate the changes in the active site structure that occur when either reacting with a substrate called acetylene or being inhibited by carbon monoxide. This revealed that selenium can migrate into the positions taken up by three of the FeMo-cofactor’s nine sulfur atoms (the three “belt-sulfurs”) during these interactions. The active site was not previously thought to be active in this way: this will need to be taken into account in all future models that describe how dinitrogen is converted into a biologically useful form.</p> <p>In the future, Spatzal, Perez et al. will investigate in detail how these “belt-sulfur” atoms exchange with atoms from the substrate, where the removed sulfur is stored, and the pathway by which it returns. Further experiments will also characterize the active site during the transformation of dinitrogen.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11620.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11620.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>nitrogen fixation</kwd><kwd>metalloproteins</kwd><kwd>Azotobacter vinelandii</kwd><kwd>iron sulfur proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM045162</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rees</surname><given-names>Douglas C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rees</surname><given-names>Douglas C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unanticipated rearrangements in the nitrogenase active site establish the dynamic nature of the FeMo-cofactor during catalysis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The reduction of substrates by nitrogenase entails multiple cycles of association and dissociation between two component proteins for sequential transfer of electrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burgess and Lowe, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Howard and Rees, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hoffman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hageman and Burris, 1978</xref>).

The characterization of bound species including reaction intermediates has proven to be experimentally challenging due to the transitory nature of these states, inevitably leading to a recovery of the FeMo-cofactor resting state. While a number of studies have investigated substrate and inhibitor interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">George et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pickett et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Seefeldt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davis et al., 1979</xref>), only the recent crystal structure of <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> MoFe-protein (Av1) with the inhibitor CO (Av1-CO) has provided high resolution details of a bound ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Spatzal et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the high symmetry and complex electronic structure of the FeMo-cofactor complicate spectroscopic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Spatzal, 2015</xref>). Thus, an atomically explicit description of the catalytic mechanism remains obscure.</p><p>In this study, we have undertaken an alternative approach to follow events during catalysis by site-specifically introducing a reporter in the FeMo-cofactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B, C</xref>). Because the S2B position of the active site can be reversibly replaced with CO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Spatzal et al., 2014</xref>), it represents a potential site for other substitutions by substrates and inhibitors.

Based upon the previous recognition, that thiocyanate (SCN<sup>-</sup>) is both a substrate and an inhibitor of nitrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rasche and Seefeldt, 1997</xref>), we evaluated the kinetic properties of selenocyanate (SeCN<sup>-</sup>).

These structures (designated Av1-Se-fq-2 to Av1-Se-fq-5360), at resolutions of 1.32–1.66 Å, represent the first example of time-dependent structural snapshots of the nitrogenase active site during turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>).

Consequently all belt-S atoms of FeMo-cofactor, separated by 5.7 Å in the resting state, can interchange during substrate (acetylene) reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). The Se migration from S2B favors S5A over S3A at the earliest time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), but whether this reflects an ordered sequence or a more complex mechanism cannot be established from these data. Remarkably, with a sufficient number of catalytic turnovers (several thousand, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the total Se is lost and apparently replaced by S, leading to a recovery of the original FeMo-cofactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Neither the source of this S, nor the pathway(s) by which Se exits the MoFe-protein, have been identified. The observation that Se2B can migrate to S5A and S3A and is ultimately chased from the cofactor, clearly implies that all three belt-positions are labilized during the reduction of acetylene. In contrast, little or no migration of Se2B was observed during proton reduction.</p><p>Our previous study of CO inhibited Av1 found replacement of S2B by CO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Spatzal et al., 2014</xref>). The CO inhibition of Av1-Se2B during catalytic turnover has the potential to evaluate both the reactivity at the Se2B site and the location of the displaced chalcogen. The Av1-Se-CO structure at a resolution of 1.53 Å revealed that Se2B was ca. 90% replaced by a bridging CO with a geometry nearly identical to that observed for Av1-CO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Spatzal et al., 2014</xref>). Unexpectedly, Se was not expelled from the FeMo-cofactor but migrated to the other two belt positions with ca. 88% overall retention (Se occupancy: 10% (x2B; where x reflects a mixture of S and Se), 35% (x3A) and 44% (x5A)). This result augments our findings from acetylene turnover, namely that the catalytic state of the cofactor capable of interacting with CO is similar to that which reacts with substrates. In contrast to the simple model of CO displacement and loss of S from S2B previously envisioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Spatzal et al., 2014</xref>), the path of net loss of sulfur from the cofactor is through either one or both of the other belt positions.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11620.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Se-migration upon CO-binding to Av1-Se2B.</title><p>Structure of Av1-Se-CO at a resolution of 1.53 Å, highlighting the Se2B replacement by CO and migration of Se to the remaining belt-S sites.

The lability of the S2B position towards ligand exchange in non-resting states of the FeMo-cofactor highlights the likely role for the Fe2-Fe6 edge as a primary interaction site for substrates and inhibitors. Both CO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Spatzal et al., 2014</xref>) and Se from SeCN<sup>-</sup>, with different chemical properties, are incorporated at this site. Significantly, the side-chain residues flanking this position were previously identified to be catalytically important as demonstrated by mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benton et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The lack of substrate or inhibitor binding to the FeMo-cofactor resting state could be the result of the sulfurs serving as protecting groups that shield the iron core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Howard and Rees, 2006</xref>). The displacement of belt S in the catalytically active reduced states would effectively de-protect these Fe sites, thereby activating them for reaction with substrates. The interchange of all belt-S atoms is suggestive that substrates may also migrate to different sites of the trigonal six-iron prism during catalysis. While the underlying mechanism(s) are not known, one can speculate this may involve a twist-type mechanism interconverting trigonal prism and octahedral forms of the six-iron core, where swapping Fe-S bonding partners in the latter would result in interchange of the belt-S.</p><p>Our results indicate that the resting state structure of FeMo-cofactor does not capture key features of the catalytic state, and a detailed understanding of how nitrogenase reduces dinitrogen must include the role of cofactor rearrangements during turnover. Furthermore, the incorporation of selenium into FeMo-cofactor opens a novel route to probe the substrate reduction mechanism of nitrogenase by using its unique crystallographic and spectroscopic properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell growth and protein purification</title><p>Cell growth and protein purification were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Spatzal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2014</xref>).

Quantification of Se/Fe/S anomalous electron densities at 12,662 eV (f’’ (Se) = 3.84 e; f’’ (Fe) = 1.50 e; f’’ (S) = 0.24 e) based on the refined structural models was performed using a MAPMAN-dependent script, allowing a free choice of radius of integration and B-factor cut-off, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Einsle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Spatzal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2014</xref>). The quantification of Se-occupancies was carried out by determining relative anomalous densities arising from Se within an integration sphere radius of 1.0 Å at the respective position based on the anomalous difference Fourier maps. This strategy was shown to be the most robust approach for density quantification within the FeMo-cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Spatzal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Spatzal, 2015</xref>). Comparison of the integrated Se-density values to the average anomalous density values for a full occupancy iron atom, taking into account the differences in f” for Fe and Se at 12,662 eV, yielded Se occupancy values. A total of 30 iron atoms (2x7 Fe from the two copies of FeMo-cofactor, and 2x8 Fe from the two copies of P-cluster per Av1 heterotetramer) were used for averaging and yielded the internal reference for anomalous scattering at 12,662 eV. The standard deviation between anomalous density values for the Fe-atoms was ≤ 4%. No adjustments were made for variation in B factors since the Fe and S components of both metalloclusters have similar values (average and standard deviation = 9.3 ± 1 Å<sup>2</sup> for isotropically refined B-factors in the Av1-Se2B structure). For Fe and S in the FeMo-cofactor, the corresponding B values are 9.0 ± 0.4 Å<sup>2</sup>, with the B for Se2B = 9.9 ± 0.5 Å<sup>2</sup> and the average B for the entire protein structure = 13.8 Å<sup>2</sup>. Quantification of Se-occupancies was further improved by including the contribution of the residual anomalous density of sulfur, with the anomalous scattering of S being 6.3% that of Se (f’’(S)/f’’(Se)) at an energy of 12,662 eV. The largest deviation between Se-anomalous densities observed for the two crystallographically independent copies of FeMo-cofactor was found to be ~5%, which provides an estimate of the uncertainty in the occupancy values. The root mean square value of the anomalous electron density map is ~2% of the Se peak value, which sets a lower threshold on the minimum occupancy that can be detected at this site.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank J Rittle, JC Peters, B Wenke, H Segal, C Morrison and O Einsle for informative discussions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor), Wilfred van der Donk (Reviewing editor), and three reviewers, one of whom, Catherine Drennan, has agreed to share her identity.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>The MoFe cluster of nitrogenase is one of Nature's most impressive and most enigmatic metallocenters, and its reaction mechanism has been notoriously refractory to experimental attempts to capture reaction intermediates. This study shows that the MoFe cluster is far less rigid than generally anticipated. The authors solved a series of structures of the nitrogenase MoFe protein at high resolution and use a creative application of anomalous scattering to demonstrate the migration of sulfur ligands among three sites that bridge the Fe and Mo-Fe ends of the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-cofactor). The structures show that multiple sulfur positions on the MoFe cluster can exchange with selenium in a turn-over dependent manner, with the Se first entering into the S2B site, the same position that CO was previously shown to occupy. The high resolution data show that Se can rotate around the cluster, occupying different S belt positions, before it is finally displaced by S after multiple turnovers with acetylene. Other substrates do not cause Se migration. For a long time, scientists have investigated the potential positions on the MoFe cluster that represent the binding site(s) for substrates, and this work suggests that the 'resting state' of the cluster, with its sulfur belt intact, may not be the form of the cluster to which substrates bind. As such, this study should cause the re-examination of all mechanistic proposals for nitrogenase, and complex metalloclusters in general.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>1) Based on the partial occupancy of Se in the S2B site, a large number of turnovers was required to chase the Se from the site (between 1000 and 2000). What does this mean in terms of the &quot;average&quot; reaction? Is the protecting ligand at S2B displaced by the substrate in every turnover, as the authors hint? If so where does it go? Is the migration of the S2B ligand a rare or common event?</p> <p>2) The comment in the fourth paragraph of the Main text about Se occupancy of a &quot;low occupancy site (ranging from 0-20% under different conditions) adjacent to the previously identified potential sulfur-binding site (SBS)&quot; needs an explanation and perhaps also a citation. Where is this site?</p> <p>3) The paper needs an improved statement of error estimates for the partial occupancies at the Se2B, Se3A and Se5A sites. What were the limits of detection of Se partial occupancy in the anomalous difference maps?

What does this mean in terms of the &quot;average&quot; reaction? Is the protecting ligand at S2B displaced by the substrate in every turnover, as the authors hint? If so where does it go? Is the migration of the S2B ligand a rare or common event?</italic> </p> <p>These are critical questions for understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of our observations and we do not know the answers. We are presenting a study detailing our unexpected findings that serve as the basis for future work, but not a final report on all the new directions implied by the results to date. We do not pretend to know the answers to the many intriguing possibilities but are presenting the unexpected observation that provides these new directions.</p> <p>Although we feel this is too speculative to include in the manuscript, in the spirit of responding to the issues raised by these important questions, we present for the reviewers some musings about the mechanistic implications of this work. Substrate binding (excluding protons) appears to be accompanied by rearrangements of the FeMo-cofactor (these may be reflected in the essentially stoichiometric migration of Se2B to the x3A and x5A belt positions upon a single CO-binding event in the Av1-Se-CO structure). It is important to emphasize that during turnover, we have no evidence that the S2B ligand completely dissociates from the cofactor (as it is in the CO-inhibited structure), but speculate it most likely remains bonded to at least one Fe. At the completion of a catalytic cycle, the FeMo-cofactor returns to the original arrangement with a high probability; however, with a small, but non-zero probability, this hypothetical intermediate can rearrange effectively resulting in net migration of the belt ligands. We have tried to develop kinetic models for the migration based on the data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, but these are not sufficiently accurate to be useful in a quantitatively predictive fashion.</p> <p><italic>2) The comment in the fourth paragraph of the Main text about Se occupancy of a &quot;low occupancy site (ranging from 0-20% under different conditions) adjacent to the previously identified potential sulfur-binding site (SBS)&quot; needs an explanation and perhaps also a citation. Where is this site?</italic> </p> <p>We inadvertently omitted the reference to our 2014 CO paper defining the potential SBS, which has now been added, along with a brief description (Main text, fourth paragraph).</p> <p><italic>3) The paper needs an improved statement of error estimates for the partial occupancies at the Se2B, Se3A and Se5A sites. What were the limits of detection of Se partial occupancy in the anomalous difference maps? Are the 1-2% occupancy values at sites Se3A and Se5A in the &quot;Av1-Se2B&quot; sample really different from the 0.3-0.8% values for &quot;Av1-Se-fq-5361&quot; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>)? The statement that &quot;density errors were estimated to be 5%&quot; doesn't suffice when density values are not associated with the difference map sigma levels in the figures or with the% occupancies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.</italic> </p> <p>We have added a section to the Methods on “Quantification of Se occupancies” clarifying this analysis. The 5% error is based on the largest deviation between Se-anomalous densities observed between the two crystallographically independent copies of the FeMo- cofactor, and is likely the most realistic estimate of the occupancy errors. The limit of detection (~2% ) reflects the root mean square density of the anomalous Fourier map relative to the peak height of the fully occupied Se2B site. Occupancies of 0.3-0.8% and 1-2% are not statistically different. We have rounded the occupancies in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref> to the nearest integer percent.</p></body> </sub-article></article>
