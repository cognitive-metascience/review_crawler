variety of mild stresses. Here, we investigated how heat stress promotes longevity in yeast. We show that upon growth at higher temperature, yeast cells relax the retention of DNA circles, which act as aging factors in the mother cell. The enhanced frequency at which circles redistribute to daughter cells was not due to changes of anaphase duration or nuclear shape but solely to the downregulation of the diffusion barrier in the nuclear envelope. This effect depended on the PKA and Tor1 pathways, downstream of stress-response kinase Pkc1. Inhibition of these responses restored barrier function and circle retention and abrogated the effect of heat stress on longevity. Our data indicate that redistribution of aging factors from aged cells to their progeny can be a mechanism for modulating longevity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28329.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Aging is often an inevitable part of life. Yet, it seems like the aging process can be sped up or slowed down in organisms as distinct as fruit flies, mice and budding yeast in response to changes in the environment. Yeast, for example, lives 40% longer when grown at the elevated – and mildly stressful – temperature of 37°C instead of 30°C. But how can yeast, or any other organism, change its lifespan in response to stressful conditions?</p><p>Budding yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>), as its name suggests, divides by budding small daughter cells from its surface. The mother cell gets older with each division, whereas the age of each daughter cell is reset to zero. The mother cell protects the daughters by keeping some harmful aging factors for itself. Many aging factors – like toxic DNA circles – are anchored to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (the compartment in the cell where many proteins are made) and the nucleus (the compartment where the cell's genetic information is stored). Before the cells divide, a diffusion barrier keeps molecules in the membranes of the mother cell, preventing them from entering the membranes of the daughter cell.</p><p>The aging factors only leak into the daughter cells if they detach from the membrane in the mother or if the diffusion barrier becomes permeable. The loss of aging factors causes the mother cell to live much longer than normal. Baldi, Bolognesi, Meinema et al. asked if something similar occurred when cells experience stress, which could explain why stressed yeast cells live longer.</p><p>Indeed, mother cells did redistribute toxic DNA circles to their daughters when grown at a higher temperature. This did not happen because the DNA circles detached from the membrane. Instead the diffusion barrier became more permeable. Baldi et al. then went on to show that it was not just the heat that weakened the barrier. Rather the diffusion barrier was specifically down-regulated by one of the yeast’s normal responses to stress. Lastly, when Baldi et al. took steps to make the diffusion barrier in mildly stressed cells less permeable again, the cells largely resumed aging like unstressed cells.</p><p>Together these data suggest that yeast cells undergoing mild stress might not repair damage or clear out the aging factors but rather dispose of the factors by passing them on to their offspring. It is possible that this helps the population to cope with the stress, by sharing the burden of age – or, as Baldi et al. also discuss, the wisdom of age – with the other individuals.</p><p>Stress-response pathways are conserved among many other organisms, and similar diffusion barriers occur in worms and mammals too. Thus, this newly discovered process might also happen in other cells that divide asymmetrically, including human stem cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heat stress</kwd><kwd>longevity</kwd><kwd>age confinement</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003006</institution-id><institution>Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barral</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BarrAge</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barral</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>To promote longevity under heat stress shares yeast aging factors with progeny through a down-regulation of the diffusion barrier in the membranes between the mitotic cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many cell types divide asymmetrically to generate a naive daughter cell that renews the division potential of the lineage, and a committed daughter cell that progresses toward differentiation and generally shows a limited division potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Knoblich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ouellet and Barral, 2012</xref>). This is the case for many stem cells, which have the dual function of maintaining an eternal division potential and of generating differentiating daughters that eventually integrate themselves both structurally and functionally into organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fisher and Sozzani, 2016</xref>). Accordingly, while the stem cell remains young during most of the lifespan of the individual, differentiating daughters age and need to be replaced over time. Current knowledge indicates that aging in metazoans follows a progressive loss of stem cells proliferation, and hence a loss in the regeneration potential of the organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van Zant and Liang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beerman and Rossi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2017</xref>). However, how aging takes place at the cellular level is not well understood. Particularly, we do not yet understand how asymmetric division generates both one naive but rejuvenated and one committed but aging daughter cell.</p><p>The unicellular fungus <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is an excellent model for studying this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Higuchi-Sanabria et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, these cells proliferate through budding small, rejuvenated daughter cells from the surface of the larger, mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mortimer and Johnston, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hartwell and Unger, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kennedy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Henderson and Gottschling, 2008</xref>). Strikingly, with each daughter produced, the mother cell ages and progressively loses its division potential until it eventually stops proliferating and dies. This process is called replicative aging and the replicative lifespan, that is, the number of daughters a mother cell generates before dying, is limited, reaching about 25 generations in average for haploid wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Henderson and Gottschling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>). Beyond limiting the lifespan, yeast aging also manifests itself through a number of additional traits, such as the formation of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilaniu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saarikangas and Barral, 2015</xref>), the neutralization of the vacuolar pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Henderson et al., 2014</xref>), the fractionation of mitochondrial organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>) and the decreased sensitivity of the cell to signaling pheromone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smeal et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caudron and Barral, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schlissel et al., 2017</xref>) reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denoth Lippuner et al. (2014</xref>). In contrast, the daughter cells reset their vacuolar pH, mitochondrial organization, pheromone response and division potential. They then become mother cells themselves; they start budding-off daughters and aging.</p><p>The progressive decline of cellular fitness with age is thought to be driven by the retention and accumulation of so-called aging factors in the mother cell. Three types of aging factors have been described. First, plasma-membrane proteins such as the proton-exporter Pma1 and several multi-drug transporters remain in the mother cell as it divides and contribute to its fitness decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eldakak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Henderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thayer et al., 2014</xref>). Second, aging yeast mother cells also form a deposit that accumulates protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilaniu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saarikangas and Barral, 2015</xref>). Cells that fail to form this aggregate are long-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saarikangas and Barral, 2015</xref>). Third, intra-chromosomal recombination between repeated rDNA units excise extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) that segregate to and accumulate in the mother cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Szostak and Wu, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>). Except for the endogenous two micron plasmid, ERCs and actually all DNA circles tested so far accumulate in the mother cell with age and accelerate aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murray and Szostak, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Falcón and Aris, 2003</xref>). Old mother cells contain up to thousand ERCs and this load, which increases exponentially with successive divisions, might be what ultimately kills the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>). High-fidelity retention in the mother cell of the DNA circles and of the precursors of protein aggregation is facilitated by the formation of lateral diffusion barriers in the ER membrane and the outer nuclear membrane at the bud neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Luedeke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saarikangas et al., 2017</xref>). These barriers limit exchange of membrane-proteins between mother and bud. Therefore, retention of aging factors in the mother cell relies on their anchorage into the ER-membrane. Retention of the aggregation precursors relies on their membrane attachment through the farnesylated chaperone Ydj1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saarikangas et al., 2017</xref>). DNA circles attach to the nuclear envelope through the SAGA complex and nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, yeast cells show an extended life span when subjected to mild stresses such as calorie restriction and growth at 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shama et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shama et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Swieciło et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kapahi et al., 2017</xref>). Similar effects take place in organisms as distinct as nematodes, flies and mice, indicating that the regulation of longevity involves similar regulatory pathways in all these organisms, at least upon calorie restriction, namely the TOR and PKA pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Steinkraus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kapahi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wasko and Kaeberlein, 2014</xref>). How these regulatory pathways actually modulate ageing progression itself is largely unknown.</p><p>The fact that yeast cells are able to modulate their longevity in response to environmental signals suggests that they have some control on the generation and accumulation of aging factors, or on the impact that these have on the physiology of the cell. We reasoned that one potential mechanism for increasing longevity could be the down-regulation of the retention of aging factors in the mother cell. Indeed, mutants affecting the retention of DNA circles in the mother cell are long-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we set here out to test whether physiological stresses affect the retention of aging factors in the mother cell, and how.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The confinement of DNA circles is reduced upon heat stress</title><p>In order to investigate whether the confinement of aging factors in the mother cell is affected upon conditions that promote longevity, we asked whether a model DNA circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>) was more likely to propagate to the bud upon heat stress or calorie restriction than under optimal growth conditions. This model DNA circle carries a centromere flanked with LoxP sites and hence, is turned into a non-centromeric circle upon expression of the Cre-recombinase and excision of the centromeric sequence. It also carries an array of repeated TetO sequences. Expression of the protein TetR, which binds to the TetO sequence, fused to GFP (TetR-GFP) allow the visualization of the circle as a fluorescent dot in vivo. An autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) promotes the replication of the DNA circle during S-phase. We transfected this model circle into cells co-expressing Cre fused to an estradiol-binding domain (Cre-EBD) and TetR-GFP. EBD mediates the retention of Cre in the cytoplasm until β-Estradiol is added to the growth medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</xref>). Upon β-Estradiol treatment and consequent centromere excision (see Materials and methods for details) the non-centromeric DNA circles detaches from the Spindle (Spc42-CFP marks the spindle pole bodies - SPB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), and no-longer segregate symmetrically, unlike their centromeric counterparts. Using this system, we asked whether cells grown in conditions of calorie restriction (0.1% glucose, 30°C) or heat stress (2% glucose, 37°C) affected the retention of the circles in the mother cell compared to cells maintained in optimal growth conditions (2% glucose, 30°C). In cells grown under optimal conditions, the circles passed very infrequently to the bud (frequency of propagation to the bud: 0.04 ± 0.01). Although calorie restriction had no effect (propagation frequency: 0.04 ± 0.01), the frequency at which individual plasmids passed to the bud was increased four folds in cells grown at 37°C (propagation frequency: 0.17 ± 0.01). This value is very similar to what we observed in cells lacking the diffusion barrier in the outer nuclear membrane (<italic>bud6Δ</italic> mutant cells, propagation frequency: 0.13 ± 0.01; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shcheprova et al. (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Thus, these data suggested that, at least under heat stress, cells might relax their ability to confine DNA circles in the mother cell.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28329.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Heat stress reduces the confinement of DNA circles in the mother cell upon mitosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model DNA circle with excisable centromere (blue) and TetO repeats (orange), which can be labeled with TetR-GFP (green) for visualization.

First, increased anaphase duration leaves more time to circles to diffuse from the mother into the bud and therefore promotes their propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gehlen et al., 2011</xref>). Second, a failure to efficiently narrow down the median constriction of the dividing nucleus leaves opportunity to nucleoplasmic, but not membrane attached, material to exchange between mother and bud parts of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gehlen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boettcher et al., 2012</xref>). Third, the presence of a diffusion barrier in the outer nuclear membrane restricts the movement of circles through the bud neck, provided that they are attached to nuclear pore complexes (NPCs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we wondered which of these parameters is affected in cells grown under heat stress.</p><p>First, we characterized the effect of heat on both anaphase duration and changes in nuclear morphology. In a strain carrying our model DNA circle, we tagged the outer nuclear membrane protein Nsg1 with GFP. Using this marker, we quantified the duration of nuclear division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and the morphology of the nuclei (length of longitudinal axis and diameter of their scission constriction) throughout anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We defined anaphase as the time window starting with the entry of a nuclear lobe into the bud and finishing with the completion of karyokinesis (the two separate nuclei move slightly toward each other, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Compared to optimal growth conditions, exposure to heat shortened anaphase duration by about 20% (from 19.7 ± 0.3 to 15.7 ± 0.5 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The length of the nucleus was increased in the first 100 seconds of anaphase but the scission constriction at the bud neck was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). If anything, an increased length of the nucleus would reduce, and not increase, the DNA circle propagation to the bud. Thus, at first sight the increased propagation of circles in populations of yeast cells grown under mild heat stress was not due to an overall prolongation of anaphase duration or change in nuclear morphology.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28329.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Changes in anaphase duration cannot explain DNA circle segregation upon heat stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dividing nuclei used to measure the duration of anaphase (maximum intensity projection, outline of the cell in yellow, scale bar is 1 µm).

To address whether the duration of one of the stages of anaphases was particularly affected and how this could influence DNA circle exchange between mother and daughter cell, we studied when exactly during anaphase DNA circles are exchanged between the mother and daughter part of the nucleus. Based on this, we then examined whether heat stress prolonged that particular stage. We took advantage of the strain described above and followed now simultaneously nuclear division and the segregation of the DNA circles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In movies of wild type cells grown at 30°C in medium containing 2% glucose, we determined the propagation flux of DNA circles through the bud neck (number of passages to the bud per minute) and compared the values obtained during early versus late anaphase. This frequency was six to eight folds higher in early anaphase than in late anaphase (0.03 ± 0.01 and 0.004 ± 0.003 passage per minute, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, DNA circles exchange between mother and bud essentially during early anaphase. An extension of early anaphase duration at the cost of late anaphase could increase the frequency at which circles pass to the bud, while maintaining a constant duration of the total anaphase.</p><p>Therefore, using the same movies, we determined the time cells spent in early anaphase. Remarkably, early anaphase was shorter, certainly not longer, in cells grown at 37°C, compared to 30°C (3.4 ± 0.1 versus 3.9 ± 0.14 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The duration of late anaphase was reduced as well (12.9 ± 0.46 versus 14.5 ± 0.46 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, early anaphase lasted the longest upon calorie restriction (5.2 ± 0.36 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), although this condition did not affect the retention of DNA circles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

The ratio between the time it took to lose 25% of the signal in the non-bleached compartment (bud) to the time it took to lose 25% of the signal in the bleached compartment (mother) was computed and is defined as the Barrier index (BI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

We expect that during early anaphase, the propagation flux of individual DNA circles through the bud neck (number of passages to the bud per unit of time, independent of anaphase duration) is increased at 37°C and decreased in calorie restricted cells, assuming that the DNA circles retention depends on the diffusion barrier. Indeed, the propagation flux in early anaphase was increased two folds in cells grown at 37°C compared to 30°C (0.06 ± 0.004 versus 0.03 ± 0.01 passage per minute; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and decreased three folds in calorie restricted cells (0.01 ± 0.01 passage per minute).

Thus, aging of the bud6∆ mutant and heat stressed cells was restored upon strengthening the diffusion barrier back to wild type or higher levels. This is consistent with the idea that heat stress increases the longevity of the mother cell at least in part through the inhibition of the diffusion barrier in the nuclear envelope and consequently through releasing aging factors, such as DNA circles, to their progeny. Collectively, our data suggest that the redistribution of age load, such as DNA circles, between mother and daughter is a mechanism for modulating the longevity of the cell in response to stresses such as heat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Yeast cells modulate their longevity via diffusion barrier strength regulation under heat stress</title><p>The efficient retention of DNA circles in the mother cell during mitosis is a key determinant of the replicative lifespan of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells. How cells achieve this retention, has been a topic of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gehlen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khmelinskii et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ouellet and Barral, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>). Our data provide evidence confirming the nuclear diffusion barrier as being a key parameter contributing to DNA circle retention and reveals that the strength of the barrier is regulated. First, we observed that the barrier loses permeability in cells grown at 37°C, increasing propagation of DNA circles to the bud. Second, the barrier permeability is restored in these cells upon calorie restriction which leads to full restoration of circle retention in the mother cell. These results are consistent with the observation that the attachment of DNA circles to NPCs is required for their efficient retention in the mother cell, in a barrier-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, heat stress did not impair NPC-DNA circle association, indicating that it does not affect DNA circle propagation via their detachment from the nuclear envelope.</p><p>Furthermore, our data indicate that regulation of barrier permeability under heat stress results in the redistribution of the age load during mitosis, resulting in a longer life span for the mother cell. In other words, the yeast cell is able to modulate longevity by regulating the diffusion barrier. We observed a two-fold reduction of barrier strength during heat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and a roughly four-fold increase of DNA circle propagation to the daughter cells at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Effectively, this represents a decrease of circle retention from 96% to 83% for what concerns the model DNA circle. Is such an apparently mild decrease sufficient to explain the lifespan increase that we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>)? Mathematical modeling studies predicted that a retention probability above 99% is required to simulate the aging curves experimentally established for wild type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gillespie et al., 2004</xref>). This is in part due to the fact that the replication origin on the rDNA circles is activated only in about 60% of the cell cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gillespie et al., 2004</xref>), such that the loss of ERCs to the daughter cells is inefficiently compensated by replication of the DNA circles. Accordingly, previous studies confirmed that a slight reduction of this retention efficiency has a strong effect on the longevity of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>) reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denoth Lippuner et al. (2014</xref>). This fits with the observation here that ERC levels decrease with roughly 3.5-fold in 16 generations old mother cells grown at 37°C compared to 30°C, despite the apparently high retention efficiency of 83% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How is the diffusion barrier regulated?</title><p>Our study establishes that the modulation of barrier strength is not merely a direct consequence of nutrients limitation or temperature increase on barrier formation or stability, but a process elicited by specific regulatory pathways in response to environmental disturbances.

Remarkably, inhibition of both PKA and Tor1 (via calorie restriction) in cells either grown at 37°C or expressing a constitutively active form of Pkc1 prevented the weakening of nuclear barrier that is normally observed under these conditions. These data suggest that Pkc1 might modulate barrier strength through Tor1 and PKA. To our knowledge, this is first evidence that Pkc1 might regulate TORC1 and PKA, revealing an intriguing link between these pathways that now needs to be substantiated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>An ‘age-sharing’ mechanism underlies the longevity effect of heat stress</title><p>Besides <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shama et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shama et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Swieciło et al., 2000</xref>), heat stress promotes longevity in several other species, ranging from flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lithgow et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khazaeli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Le Bourg et al., 2001</xref>) to worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cypser and Johnson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gems and Partridge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holloszy and Smith, 1986</xref>). Heat stress is also a protein denaturant agent. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic species exposed to elevated temperatures induce the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) that are well conserved among species and help the cell maintain proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lindquist and Craig, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morano et al., 2012</xref>). In budding yeast, several HSPs are induced upon heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boy-Marcotte et al., 1999</xref>) and are implicated in refolding heat-denatured proteins, preventing their aggregation or, if severely damaged, targeting them for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hilt and Wolf, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Craig et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parsell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</xref>).

Additionally, the lifespan extension observed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> upon heat stress, requires the heat shock protein Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shama et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shama et al., 1998b</xref>).

Heat stress was also proposed to induce the oxidative stress response, thus protecting cells against Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), also associated with ageing in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morano et al., 2012</xref>). These observations have suggested that heat stress promotes longevity via induction of “repair” and/or a “clearance” mechanisms that refold denatured molecules, prevent their aggregation and target damaged/toxic species for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Estruch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Verbeke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calderwood et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In striking contrast, we show here that a potent mechanism to promote longevity is the opening of the diffusion barrier in the nuclear envelope and the ‘dumping’ of at least some of the mother’s burden onto their daughters. Barrier weakening is clearly not the mechanism promoting longevity in response to calorie restriction, establishing that it is not the only mechanism through which cells can modulate the effects of age. Most likely, the ‘repair’, ‘clearance’ and ‘sharing/dumping’ mechanisms co-exist and their relative impact might vary between conditions. In any case, the fact that rescuing DNA circle confinement largely abolishes the effect of heat stress on lifespan extension indicates that at least under that condition ‘dumping’ age load onto the population is a prominent mechanism of longevity regulation. Here, we have focused on the characterization of a single type of aging factor. However, the fact that other factors, such as deposit precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saarikangas et al., 2017</xref>) also depend on the diffusion barrier for their confinement in the mother cell suggest that the regulation we have uncovered might affect more than only DNA circles. Furthermore, other mechanisms might help redistribute aging factors. Our study is probably only scratching the top of a larger panel of possibilities. Indeed, the nature of the aging factors being redistributed to the progeny could depend on the nature of the physiological signals that the cell faces. In addition, the fact that calorie restriction extends the replicative lifespan of yeast cells without affecting circle confinement indicates that barrier opening is not the only mechanism of longevity modulation.</p><p>The idea that stress does not lead to higher fidelity but rather less is actually quite satisfying. Indeed, the widespread idea that yeast cells generate less damage or eliminate them better when they are under stress is somehow paradoxical. It seems somewhat counterintuitive that cells would do better when they are stressed than when they are not, although we agree that there might be selection advantages to such a situation. In any case, our data open the question of why do cells activate a pathway for living longer and aging slower in response to stress, and this potentially at the cost of their progeny. Several lines of thoughts merit attention here. One possibility is that dispersing the pre-existing damage through a large population of cells allows the individual cells to better survive. Here, the gain in longevity would merely be a contingent effect. However, another line of thoughts could be that older yeast mother cells have acquired with age something beneficial, helping them to better cope with stress. Sharing this with their progeny might be important for the survival of the population.</p><p>Remarkably, middle-age mother cells do cope better with heat than young ones (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>). If the yeast mother cells carry some components that provide them with a selective advantage under stress, then opening the barrier might have two advantages at once: it might not only allow them to share this advantage with their daughters, but by allowing them to dump damage, it could also help keeping these experienced mothers alive longer. Both effects would be to the benefit of the survival of the genotype. In favor of such a model, it has been recently shown that around 30% of the genome can recombine out of the chromosomes and form DNA circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Møller et al., 2015</xref>). In some cases, these circles carry genes likely to promote survival in response to specific stresses, such as cupper intoxication and salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Møller et al., 2015</xref>). Relaxing barrier permeability would still allow circle accumulation in the mother, but at the same time increase the number of daughters that inherit at least few circles and can accumulate them as well.</p><p>Another supportive scenario relates to the observation that protein aggregates that are retained in the mother cell can provide adaptive advantages. This is for example the case when the Whi3 mnemon aggregates in response to futile pheromone exposure and mediates adaptation of the cell to the lack of a partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caudron and Barral, 2013</xref>). Provided that mnemon asymmetry also depends on ER compartmentalization, opening the barrier would allow the mother to share adaptive circles and mnemons with her progeny and at the same time to soften of the pro-aging effect that these factors have on her.</p><p>Whether the ‘dumping/sharing’ mechanism is conserved beyond yeast is unknown. However, it has recently become clear that diffusion barriers are conserved in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, at least the diffusion barrier of neural stem cells changes strength during development and with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moore et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, barrier regulation might be a recurring way to modulate the distribution of age and fate determinants between sister cells in many organisms, and hence a widely used mechanism for modulating the longevity of diverse cell types.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents, strains, and growth conditions</title><p>All used strains were constructed according to standard genetic techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Janke et al., 2004</xref>) and are isogenic to S288c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Winzeler et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The next morning cells still exponentially growing were streaked on YPD plates containing 1 µM β-Estradiol. β-Estradiol binds to the <underline>E</underline>stradiol <underline>B</underline>inding <underline>D</underline>omain (EBD) in EBD-Gal4, which consequently enters the nucleus and triggers the expression of a recombinase. This is responsible for recombination between the recombination sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), thus excising the centromere from the DNA circle. After 4 hr in β-Estradiol, cells were suspended in medium lacking tryptophan (-TRP) and imaged with an Olympus BX50 microscope, equipped with a piezo motor, a monochromatic light source and a CCD camera (Andor885). The microscope was controlled with the TillVision software (Till Photonics/FEI Munich GmbH, Germany). Images were acquired with a 100x/1.4 NA oil immersion objective, 2 × 2 binning and 20 focal slices (0.3 µM spacing). Maximum intensity projection was used to localize the DNA circles and the SPBs. Cells in anaphase containing 1, 2 and 4 circles not co-localizing with the SPBs were analyzed for the presence of the circle in the mother and/or the bud.

The microscope was equipped with a CCD HQ<sup>2</sup> camera (Photometrics, Arizona), 250W Xenon lamps, Softworx software (Applied Precision, Slovakia) and a temperature chamber, set to the desired temperature. A 100x/1.40 NA U plan S Apochromat oil immersion objective (Olympus, Japan) was used. 30-min time lapse movies (1 frame per minute) with 20 stacks (0.25 µM spacing) were acquired. Maximum intensity projection was performed. The propagation flux of individual DNA circles through the bud neck in early and late anaphase was measured as a DNA circle passage frequency per minute, considering the moment when a circle is observed for the first time in the daughter compartment as the passage event.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Anaphase duration and nuclear morphology analysis</title><p>For the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, cells were grown and samples prepared and imaged as explained in the previous paragraph. Early anaphase was defined as the time window starting with the entry of the nucleus into the bud and finishing with the formation of a dumbbell-shaped nucleus. Late anaphase corresponds to the further elongation of the nucleus, and particularly of the bridge between the two future daughter nuclei, and finishes with the resolution of that bridge at karyokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). For the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, cells were grown overnight to low density on YPD plates. The next morning cells still exponentially growing, were suspended in -TRP medium and immobilized on a -TRP pad (2% agar). Cells were imaged with a Deltavision microscope as described in the previous paragraph. A 2 × 2 binning and an auxiliary 1.6x magnification were used. Time lapse movies of 25 s interval for 25 min and 7 stacks (0.3 µM spacing) were acquired. After 3D iterative deconvolution, neck width and M-D axis length were measured considering only cells where we could follow the entire nuclear division process. These measurements were performed in an equatorial focal section of each nucleus and plotted as mean distance over time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>NPCs-DNA circles attachment assay</title><p>Cells were grown overnight as in ‘<italic>DNA circles propagation assay</italic>’. The cells contained the model circle and expressed TetR fused to mCherry (TetR-mCherry), a Nup82 tagged with 3 copies of super folder GFP (Nup82-3x sfGFP) to label the NPCs and Spc42p with GFP (Spc42-GFP) to label the SPB. The cells were grown at either 30°C or 37°C. After 4 hr of β-Estradiol treatment, the cells were suspended in low fluorescent SD -TRP medium and immobilized on a cover slip with a SD -TRP pad (2% agar). For rapid imaging, a Nikon Eclipse T1 microscope was used, with acquisition times of 25 and 50 ms for GFP and mCherry respectively. The microscope was equipped with a LUDL BioPrecision2 stage with Piezo Focus, two 200 mW laser lines (DPSS 488 nm and DIode561 nm), a sCMOS camera (Orca Flash 4.0 V2) and a temperature chamber (Oko-lab), set to the desired temperature. A 100x/1.49 CFI Apochromat TIRF oil immersion objective was used. The microscope was controlled with the VisiVIEW software (Metamorph/Molecular Devices, California). For each channel (mCherry and GFP), 9 stacks (0.3 µM spacing) were acquired, with one bright field image in the center of the stack. Cells in anaphase containing one DNA circle dot distinct from the SPB were analyzed using the software Fiji (imagej.net/Fiji, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). 2 pixel wide GFP and mCherry fluorescence intensity profiles were measured for each cell along the nuclear rim (excluding the SPB). These measurements were performed in the focal plane for both Nup82-3x sfGFP and the DNA circle (tetR-mCherry). Cells where the DNA circle localized at, or close to the SPB were disregarded. All the single-cell Nup82-3x sfGFP traces were aligned relative to the corresponding brightest tetR-mCherry pixel (DNA circle) and averaged to obtain a mean profile, subsequently plotted for both channels. The mean Nup82-3x sfGFP intensity per position was only calculated for positions where the number of cells &gt; 10. After background subtraction, the mean GFP intensity at the rim was set to 1. The GFP intensity at the tetR-mCherry peak was measured as fold induction compared to the normalized value of the rim.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>FLIP experiments</title><p>Cells were grown as explained in <italic>'Anaphase duration and nuclear morphology analysis</italic>'. Time lapse movies of 3–5 s interval for 4–5 min were acquired. For the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref> (except <italic>bcyΔ</italic> mutant cells), cells were imaged with a confocal LSM 510 microscope, controlled by ZEN 2010 (Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc, Germany). We used a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 NA oil immersion objective and 3% of laser intensity with 25% laser output (Argon laser, 488 nm). Bleaching pulses were iterated (as indicated in the figures) for 80 times with 60% laser intensity. For <italic>bcyΔ</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) all was as for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> but the following: a confocal LSM 780 microscope (controlled by ZEN 2011, Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc, Germany), 3.5% of laser intensity (laser output of 40%, Argon laser, 488 nm) and a multi-array 32PMT GaAsP detector were used. Bleaching pulses were iterated for 50 times with 100% laser intensity. For the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, everything was as for <italic>bcyΔ</italic> mutant cells but the following: 20% of laser intensity; bleaching pulses were iterated for 100 times with 100% laser intensity. For all FLIP experiments, bleaching pulses were iterated at every frame and quantification was performed using Fiji as follows: the total integrated fluorescence intensity was measured in the mother and bud compartments and in 3–5 neighboring control cells. After background subtraction, the fluorescence intensity of mother and bud compartments was normalized to the mean intensity of the control cells (to correct for fluorescent decay due to exposure) and set to 100%. The resulting single-cell fluorescence profiles were pooled to obtain a single profile. This was fit to a one phase decay function, using the software Prism 6 (GraphPad software, GraphPad Software, Inc., California). The initial Y0 value was constrained to 100%. The resulting best fit values for plateau and K and their relative errors were used to measure the <underline>B</underline>arrier <underline>I</underline>ndex (BI, see main text for BI definition). The standard error of the BIs was calculated by error propagation on the errors obtained from the fit. <italic>bcy1Δ</italic> mutant cells and a wild type strain were analyzed in parallel, using the LSM 780 microscope. This showed a significantly lower BI in <italic>bcy1Δ</italic> mutant cells. For comparison purposes, this BI was normalized relative to the wild type analyzed with the LSM 510 microscope. This allowed us to compare <italic>bcy1Δ</italic> with the experiments performed with the LSM 510 microscope and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Replicative lifespan analysis</title><p>Cells were streaked from −80°C and grown for 2 days on YPD plates. After 2 days they were streaked again on YPD plates and grown at either 30°C or 37°C overnight. The next morning they were streaked on fresh and pre-warmed YPD plates and grown for 2 hr at 30°C or 37°C. After 2 hr, virgin daughters were separated from mother-virgin daughter pairs and placed on defined spots on the plate, using a Zeiss Axioscope 40 microdissection microscope. The microscope was equipped with a 10X objective. Every 1.5 hr, the isolated daughters were visited and newly born daughters removed and counted. Dissection was performed for 10–14 hr per day and at room temperature for all experiments. Between dissection rounds, cells were kept in a wet box at either 30°C or 37°C. Overnight, the wet boxes was stored at +4°C, to slow down the cell cycle. Two independent experiments per condition with 20–40 virgin daughters per experiment were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Detection of DNA circles in aged cells by Southern blotting</title><p>A Southern blot was performed, as before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>) but with DNA from young and aged cells both cultured at 30°C or 37°C. Young cells were harvested from an exponentially growing culture. Aged cells were purified according to the protocol of the mother enrichment program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</xref>), with some adaptations. Briefly, 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells were washed with PBS and labeled with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts) and recovered for 2 hr at 30°C or 37°C prior to the addition of β-Estradiol (1 µM final concentration). The cells were harvested after 26 hr of incubation at 30°C or 37°C. After a wash with PBS, batches of 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells were resuspended in 1 mL PBS supplemented with 50 µl streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (MicroMACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Germany), incubated for 30 min at 4°C and loaded onto LS MACS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) for purification. Cells were eluted using 1 × PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and split into two fractions: (1) 10% of the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and the bud scars labeled with 5 µg/ml calcofluor white and visualized by microscopy. The fraction of aged cells in the population and the bud scar count per aged cells were quantified. (2) Cells were lysed and DNA was purified using standard methods. DNA content was quantified performing qPCR amplifying ACT1 from aged and young cells in triplicate. The fraction of DNA from aged cells per sample was equilibrated with DNA from young cells, to have in both samples same amount of DNA originating from aged cells. The amount of DNA loaded into the gel was equilibrated based on qPCR reads. A 0.6% agarose gel contained ethidium bromide and was run in TBE with ethidium bromide for 25 hr at 50 V at 4°C. The gel was blotted to a cationized nylon transfer membrane (Zeta-Probe GT, Bio-RAD, California) using standard protocols. Membranes were hybridized with a probe generated by conventional PCR, amplifying the rDNA locus of genomic DNA extracted from wild type yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lindstrom et al., 2011</xref>) and 5’ end-labeled with <sup>32</sup>P. The blot was visualized using a Typhoon phosphoimager (GE healthcare, UK). The relative band intensity of the different ERC bands per sample were measured in Fiji (imagej.net/Fiji, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) and summed for plotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>A two-tailed unpaired student’s t-test was used to test for significance, for the nuclear morphology a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used, for the replicative lifespan experiments a log-Rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used. For the anaphase durations, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used. Unless otherwise indicated, all the analyzed mutants/conditions were always compared to wild type cells (30°C, 2% glucose).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"> <title>Acknowledgements</title> <p>We thank Fabrice Caudron, Juha Saarikangas, Ana-Maria Farcas, Marek Krzyzanowski, Xiuzhen Chen and Jette Lengefeld for critical reading of earlier versions of the manuscript, Anna Marzelliusardottir and Annina Denoth-Lippuner for technical support and former and present members of the lab for fruitful discussions over the years.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report effects of heat stress, caloric restriction and the signaling pathways PKC, TOR &amp; PKA on the retention of molecules in the mother nucleus. They suggests a model in which heat stress increases longevity as a result of DNA circle propagation to the bud and support this model by life-span experiments. All reviewers were enthusiastic about the study and support publication, provided that the authors address the following comments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see below, all three reviewers requested additional experimental support for the model (heat shock increases lifespan due to reduced retention of eccDNA). Alternatively, this conclusion should be toned down.</p><p>In addition, reference to previous studies should be made more complete.</p><p>Please respond to the other comments either by changes in the text, additional experiment if necessary and explanations to the reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Baldi et al. present a solid set of experiments that demonstrate the effects of heat stress, caloric restriction and the signaling pathways PKC, TOR &amp; PKA on the retention of molecules in the mother nucleus.

These nuclear retention measurements correlate well with longevity.</p><p>In general, the experiments support the conclusions. However, the last statement: correlation to longevity, is slightly weak. It would be strengthened by quantification of DNA circle daughter propagation in cells grown in 200 ng ml<sup>-1</sup> rapamycin (we know that this condition increases lifespan – is propagation also increased?). How about analysis of PKC1-R398P in terms of DNA circles and lifespan at 2% and 0.1% glucose?</p><p>If any of this information is in the literature, the authors should state so.</p><p>If these experiments work out, I would suggest a different title: Heat stress promotes longevity in budding yeast by relaxing the confinement of age-promoting factors in the mother cell</p><p>It's helpful to identify the model organism – we don't know if these conclusions will extend to other organisms. This title is easier for me to understand.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the manuscript titled &quot;Heat stress promotes longevity through relaxing age confinement in the mother cell&quot;, authors Barrel et al. reported heat stress results in weakened nuclear diffusion barriers, allowing increased distribution of extrachromosomal circular DNAs into the daughter cells. They found that this pathway is regulated by PKC via downstream Tor1 and Pkc1. Overall, the manuscript was well written and the experiments were thoughtfully designed and carefully executed. Most of the results are convincing and support their major conclusions. However, the manuscript feels incomplete without further addressing the following questions, especially considering the longevity focus of the manuscript title.</p><p>1) The authors showed that heat stress extended lifespan for mother cells by weakening the nuclear diffusion barrier. It is assumed that heat weakening the diffusion barrier will allow extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) to be segregated more into the daughter cells. This should be experimentally tested – whether heat stress results in less accumulation of ERCs in the mother cells.</p><p>2) Further, the propagation rate for model circular DNAs was 0.04 under normal conditions according <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. This rate was increased to 0.17 under heat stress. Another way to read this data is that 96% of circles are retained in the mother and this rate decreases to 83% under heat stress. Is this change sufficient to significantly alter accumulated ERCs in old cells? Some mathematical estimates will help readers to understand and support the conclusion on longevity.</p><p>3) According to proposed model, like bud6 mutant, heat stress should also shorten lifespan for the daughter cells. This should also be experimentally tested and compared to bud6.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The work by Yves Barral and coworkers represents a comprehensive analysis of the molecular and cell biological mechanisms for prolonged longevity in connection to heat stress in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Barrel and coworkers describe how circular DNA evades retention in yeast mother cells by TOR and Pkc dependent pathways upon heat stress using advanced microscopic and molecular methods.</p><p>These observations are important for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying aging. Though the conclusions are drawn for yeast, they may also apply for metazoans.</p><p>Substantive concerns</p><p>1) The experiment presented in Figure 8 suggests a model in which heat stress increases longevity as a result of DNA circle propagation to the bud. Two replicative lifespan experiments are shown in support. However, neither these nor other experiments in the manuscript show that reduced accumulation of circular DNA leads to increased replicative lifespan at 37°C. Hence the model is not supported. Either this model can be taken out of the manuscript or experiments must be made to support the model.</p><p>2) Introduction, paragraph five. To my knowledge, &quot;This retention mechanism seems to be generic for DNA circles […] independent of their sequence&quot; is not supported by the literature.</p><p>3) Subsection “DNA circles exchange between the mother and the daughter cells during early anaphase” final paragraph. The authors conclude &quot;Thus the duration of anaphase cannot […] frequency with which circles propagate into daughter cells&quot;. I am a confused here because I interpret their experiments differently. A) Most circle transfer happen in early anaphase, B) early anaphase is shorter at 37°C and more circles propagate, C) early anaphase is longer under calorie restriction and less circles propagate. Hence there is correlation between anaphase and the frequency with which circles propagate, not the opposite, as stated – the manuscript should be clear on this point, since conclusions drawn from these experiments are repeated throughout the manuscript.</p><p>4) The Introduction contains a large section about aging factor in yeast that should be shortened into a few lines if at all mentioned (e.g. PMA1 retention and change in pH is not relevant). A review like this does not belong in a research paper, as it sidetracks the reader from the treated problem.</p><p>5) The result section describes a large number of control experiments. These control experiments are important for the main conclusion, but their description should be reduced substantially, put into supplementary results and/or some can be left out altogether. That way, important observations such as circle transfer being 6 times higher in early anaphase will also be more evident.</p><p>6) The discussion subsection “A “damage‐sharing” mechanism underlies the longevity effect of heat stress “– is well written though I have some concern about the argument &quot;The idea that stress does not lead to […] one does not see really why cells should do better when they are stressed than when they are not&quot; The argument that we humans cannot explain the connection between stress and lifetime extension does not exclude that this connection has evolved as result of selection.</p><p>7) Subsection “The diffusion barrier confines DNA circles to the mother cell during division in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>” paragraph two is not really a discussion. A summary, rather than a discussion, should be reduced.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28329.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Baldi et al. present a solid set of experiments that demonstrate the effects of heat stress, caloric restriction and the signaling pathways PKC, TOR &amp; PKA on the retention of molecules in the mother nucleus.

As is expected from our previous results the <italic>PKC1-R398P</italic> mutation does increase the propagation of the DNA circle to the daughter cells, in fitting with the fact that this mutation causes a decrease in barrier strength.</p><p>For what concerns the life-span of the <italic>PKC1-R398P</italic> mutant cells, we had already investigated this question. However, these cells are actually extremely sick, for probably a number of reasons that have nothing to do with the reduction of barrier strength. Accordingly, these cells are also very short-lived or easily killed by the dissection needle. Therefore, the experiment suggested by the reviewer cannot be carried out in a conclusive manner.</p><p>For what concerns rapamycin treatment, we assume that its effect in extending longevity must follow another path than barrier opening since this treatment increases the strength of the barrier rather than decreasing it. However, it is possible, if not even likely, that it acts by relaxing circles from retention in the mother cells through other mechanisms, such as possibly circle detachment from NPCs. Our data about DNA circle propagation (not shown) support the idea that rapamycin affects circle retention. However, since we have no data at this stage about how rapamycin affects circle retention and whether this is the mechanism by which it extends longevity, we have not added these data to this manuscript.</p><p>Altogether, these data indicate that indeed, calorie restriction and rapamycin treatment do not promote longevity through opening of the diffusion barrier, as our data already suggested. Furthermore, opening of the diffusion barrier, whether through growth at 37°C or in response to the <italic>PKC1-R398P</italic> mutation does indeed promote the propagation of the DNA circles to the daughter cells.</p><p>However, in order to strengthen our last statement, we have now added data showing that cells grown at 37°C accumulate 3.3 folds less DNA circles at the age of 16 than corresponding mother cells grown at 30°C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If any of this information is in the literature, the authors should state so.</p></disp-quote><p>We went back through our manuscript and tried to make sure that we do not forget any relevant reference.

To address it, we purified old mother cells from a population grown at 30°C and 37°C using the mother enrichment program. The ERC content was visualized and quantified using Southern-blot analysis. We observed a 3.3 fold lower ERC content in heat stressed aged cells, consistent with a heat-induced relaxation of the diffusion barrier strength.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Further, the propagation rate for model circular DNAs was 0.04 under normal conditions according <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.

Is this change sufficient to significantly alter accumulated ERCs in old cells? Some mathematical estimates will help readers to understand and support the conclusion on longevity.</p></disp-quote><p>Mathematical studies have been carried out and are reported in at least two papers: Gillespie et al., 2004 and in Shcheprova et al., 2008 (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The mathematical modeling reported in the first study predicted that a retention probability above 0.99 is required to simulate experimentally obtained aging curves (Gillespie et al., 2004). The second study established that reducing retention even slightly has a big effect on longevity.</p><p>In the mathematical model, using a replication rate that is closer to the values that are estimated to be physiological and a retention rate of 83% (17% propagation), the DNA circles pass nearly as efficient as they replicate, resulting in marginal accumulation with age and decreased aging effects. These data are also reviewed in Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014. Moreover, we observed that heat stressed cells after 16 generations of aging showed a 3.3-fold reduction in ERC content with an 83% retention rate. Altogether, yes, a drop of 14% in retention is likely to have a strong effect on longevity.</p><p>We added these elements to the Discussion section in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) According to proposed model, like bud6 mutant, heat stress should also shorten lifespan for the daughter cells. This should also be experimentally tested and compared to bud6.</p></disp-quote><p>Prompted by the reviewer’s comment, we started to do these experiments. We do see that heat stress shortens the life span of daughters. However, in these experiments we also see a defect at 30°C, such that the experiments are not conclusive. We have acquired evidence over the years that the rejuvenation of the daughters is very sensitive to experimental conditions (and the data in this paper certainly support this idea). For example, the duration of the shift to 4°C during the night and to which extend the plates dry during the experiment have strong impacts on rejuvenation of the daughters. We went out of time for these experiments and will not be able to satisfactorily address this point. However, we recognize that this is an important issue that needs to be addressed further in the future. We are currently investing increasing efforts in the development of microfluidics methods, and this will probably be the way to go in the future. Unfortunately, we are not yet able to catch chosen daughters in these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) The experiment presented in Figure 8 suggests a model in which heat stress increases longevity as a result of DNA circle propagation to the bud.

Either this model can be taken out of the manuscript or experiments must be made to support the model.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, we have now addressed this point by isolating old mother cells grown either at 30°C or at 37°C, using the mother enrichment program. We then quantified their ERC content using Southern-blot analysis. As explained above, these results indicate that cells grown at 37°C indeed accumulate less DNA circles as they age.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Introduction, paragraph five. To my knowledge, &quot;This retention mechanism seems to be generic for DNA circles [...] independent of their sequence&quot; is not supported by the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is actually correct: there are sequences that are able to relieve plasmids from efficient retention, such as the HMR and HML loci and other binding sites for transcription repressors. The data suggest that this acts by recruiting Sir2 and other histone deacetylases, possibly because they can counteract SAGA. However, this is out of the scope of this paper and we have therefore removed the erroneous statement without entering the topic any further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “DNA circles exchange between the mother and the daughter cells during early anaphase” final paragraph. The authors conclude &quot;Thus the duration of anaphase cannot […] frequency with which circles propagate into daughter cells&quot;. I am a confused here because I interpret their experiments differently. A) Most circle transfer happen in early anaphase, B) early anaphase is shorter at 37°C and more circles propagate, C) early anaphase is longer under calorie restriction and less circles propagate. Hence there is correlation between anaphase and the frequency with which circles propagate, not the opposite, as stated – the manuscript should be clear on this point, since conclusions drawn from these experiments are repeated throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed correct, we observe a correlation between the duration of anaphase and the retention of the circles in the mother cell. The shorter anaphase, the less the circles are retained. The point that we meant to make is that this correlation is opposite to the effects expected. A short anaphase should allow fewer plasmids to diffuse from the mother into the bud. We observe the opposite. Actually, we have observed in the past that cells with a diffusion barrier need longer to progress through anaphase. The data here suggest that the stronger the barrier, the longer the cells need. This would explain why they also pass fewer circles to the bud. Accordingly, barrier defects shorten the duration of anaphase. We believe that this reflects the constraints that the barrier imposes on the nuclear envelope during its elongation. Therefore, we believe that the correlation between anaphase duration and circle retention is indirect and reflects the effect of the diffusion barrier on both: impeding anaphase progression and preventing the passage of circles to the bud. We have corrected the text to eliminate our misleading statement. However, we did not feel that discussing the relationships between barrier strength and anaphase duration falls within the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Introduction contains a large section about aging factor in yeast that should be shortened into a few lines if at all mentioned (e.g. PMA1 retention and change in pH is not relevant).

However, we would like to stress here that the intuition seems to not be too far-fetched since it is what we seem to observe: Stressed cells live longer not because they increase the fidelity with which they avoid or correct damage but essentially because they reduce the fidelity with which they confine it in the mother cell. The point that we want to introduce here is that this observation opens another question, which we think is even more important: Then, why the hell do cells confine these damages so efficiently to the mother cell if this has such adverse effects on their longevity? The idea that we are trying to introduce is that what the mothers retain might include beneficial elements. For example, DNA circles and protein aggregates could have adaptive roles. The barrier might serve the purpose of the mother in adapting to her environment. In case of stress, barrier opening could help share such beneficial elements between mother and bud. This discussion has been slightly expanded to bring the point more clearly across.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection “The diffusion barrier confines DNA circles to the mother cell during division in S. cerevisiae” paragraph two is not really a discussion.
