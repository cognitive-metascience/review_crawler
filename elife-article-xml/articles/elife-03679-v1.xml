Several studies have demonstrated that increases in the high mutation rates inherent to RNA viruses lead to viral extinction in cell culture, but evidence during infections in vivo is limited. In this study, we show that the broad-range antiviral nucleoside favipiravir reduces viral load in vivo by exerting antiviral mutagenesis in a mouse model for norovirus infection. Increased mutation frequencies were observed in samples from treated mice and were accompanied with lower or in some cases undetectable levels of infectious virus in faeces and tissues. Viral RNA isolated from treated animals showed reduced infectivity, a feature of populations approaching extinction during antiviral mutagenesis. These results suggest that favipiravir can induce norovirus mutagenesis in vivo, which in some cases leads to virus extinction, providing a proof-of-principle for the use of favipiravir derivatives or mutagenic nucleosides in the clinical treatment of noroviruses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03679.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03679.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03679.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses can infect, take control of and replicate themselves inside the living cells of other organisms. Some viral diseases can be treated with antiviral drugs, which stop viral infections either by making it more difficult for viruses to enter cells or by preventing the virus replicating once inside. As antiviral drugs are currently only available to treat a handful of viral infections, efforts are underway to develop and test experimental antiviral drugs.</p><p>One such experimental drug is called favipiravir, which is proving to be effective against several viruses that store their genetic information in the form of RNA molecules. These viruses include those that cause diseases such as influenza, gastroenteritis, and Ebola. Along with ongoing work determining how safe and effective favipiravir is for treating viral infections, researchers are also attempting to better understand how favipiravir works.</p><p>Whenever a strand of RNA is copied to allow a new virus to form, there is a risk that mistakes—or mutations—that could harm the virus are introduced into the genetic code. Previous experiments performed on cells grown in the laboratory suggested that favipiravir works against RNA viruses by increasing how often these mutations occur. RNA viruses naturally experience a large number of mutations and the ability to make mutations is in fact a benefit for viruses as it allows them to evolve rapidly and to escape immune responses. However, there is a limit to how many mutations can be tolerated in the viral genome before it can no longer replicate. Therefore, a slight increase in how often mutations occur—as thought to be caused by favipiravir—is able to stop the RNA virus replicating and halt the infection. However, favipiravir's mode of action had yet to be confirmed in living animals.</p><p>Using mice, Arias et al. tested favipiravir's ability to treat a persistent infection by norovirus—the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans and also responsible for life-threatening chronic diarrhoea in immunodeficient patients. Treatment increased the number of mutations that occurred when the viral RNA replicated and could reduce the amount of virus in the mice to undetectable levels. In addition, favipiravir did not show toxicity in mice after 8 weeks of treatment. This suggests that favipiravir has the potential to be used safely and effectively to treat norovirus and other RNA viruses, although further studies are required before it can be developed into a clinical treatment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03679.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03679.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>quasispecies</kwd><kwd>lethal mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>error-catastrophe</kwd><kwd>norovirus</kwd><kwd>favipiravir</kwd><kwd>polymerase fidelity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT097997MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodfellow</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Favipiravir, a novel nucleoside analogue, can clear a persistent norovirus infection in vivo through lethal mutagenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Due to elevated error frequencies during the replication of their genetic material, RNA virus populations exist as complex distributions of mutant genomes also known as quasispecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Domingo et al., 2012</xref>). Genetic variability confers viral populations the flexibility to rapidly adapt to the environment, typically the host, and respond to different selective constraints such as the immune system or antiviral compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Domingo et al., 2008</xref>). As a consequence, changes in the replication fidelity of a virus can affect its virulence and transmission during natural infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vignuzzi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bull et al., 2010</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that RNA virus replication error rates are finely balanced to generate ample diversity while maintaining sufficient accuracy in the transmission of genetic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vignuzzi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gnädig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sanz-Ramos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rozen-Gagnon et al., 2014</xref>). Pioneering theoretical studies on self-replicating genomes suggested that any live organism has a maximum error rate tolerated to copy its genome. Given their elevated mutation rates, it was anticipated that RNA viruses exist close to their corresponding tolerated threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swetina and Schuster, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Domingo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eigen, 2002</xref>). Hence, slight increases in virus mutation frequencies might result in the extinction of the replicating population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eigen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Domingo et al., 2010</xref>). These predictions led to the proposal of lethal mutagenesis of viruses as a new therapeutic approach based on reducing the fidelity of genome replication.</p><p>Several nucleoside analogues (i.e., ribavirin, 5-fluorouracil, 5-azacytidine) and non-nucleoside compounds (amiloride) display antiviral activities in cell culture against a wide range of RNA viruses and appear to act via increased mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Loeb et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crotty et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sierra et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grande-Pérez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dapp et al., 2009</xref>). Increased mutation frequencies are accompanied with decreased virus progeny, infectivity and fitness, leading in some cases to the complete extinction of the virus population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Domingo et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite all the evidence in cell culture, data confirming lethal mutagenesis as a plausible therapeutic approach in vivo remains limited. Although some of the antiviral compounds with mutagenic activity in cell culture are also reported to have antiviral activity in vivo, controversy exists regarding the therapeutic mechanism. To date, the most successful antiviral compound with mutagenic activity in cell culture is purine analogue ribavirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crotty et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maag et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brochot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perales et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moreno et al., 2011</xref>). Ribavirin is commonly used in combination with pegylated interferon in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. There are contradictory results on whether the mode of action of ribavirin on HCV in vivo is due to mutagenesis, immunomodulatory activities, or other antiviral mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Graci and Cameron, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chevaliez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lutchman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perelson and Layden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dietz et al., 2013</xref>). Although increased HCV mutation frequencies have been reported in several cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asahina et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dietz et al., 2013</xref>), some studies have not found increased mutagenesis as a factor contributing to the associated antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chevaliez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lutchman et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore there remains an open question as to whether or not ribavirin-mediated antiviral activity in vivo is as a result of mutagenesis or one of the other reported mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Graci and Cameron, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chevaliez et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, further investigations are needed to demonstrate that lethal mutagenesis is a conceivable approach for the general treatment of RNA virus infections in vivo.</p><p>Several novel compounds eliciting antiviral mutagenesis in cell culture were recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dapp et al., 2014</xref>). Among them, favipiravir is a novel broad spectrum nucleoside analogue which is effective in the control of a vast number of RNA viruses in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gowen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Furuta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mendenhall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caroline et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oestereich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smither et al., 2014</xref>), although its therapeutic mechanism of action is still under study. Favipiravir was initially identified as an antiviral compound for the treatment of influenza virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Furuta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sidwell et al., 2007</xref>) whose activity correlates with increased mutagenesis in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranovich et al., 2013</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that favipiravir-triphosphate can be used as a substrate by the virus polymerase and incorporated ambiguously into RNA opposite C and U in the template molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>With the aim of demonstrating lethal mutagenesis as a conceivable approach to treat viral infections in vivo, we investigated whether ribavirin and favipiravir elicit antiviral activities in a mouse model of persistent norovirus infection. Favipiravir caused significant decreases in virus titres and viral RNA levels and led to the clearance of infectious virus in the faeces of seven out of nine animals (only two out of ten animals did not shed detectable infectious virus in control group). Blind passaging of faecal and tissue samples in cell culture confirmed that favipiravir treatment led to viral extinction in some animals. In contrast, ribavirin showed limited efficacy in vivo which correlated with lower antiviral activity in cell culture when compared to favipiravir. Favipiravir antiviral activity in vivo was associated with a significant increase in viral mutation frequencies. Viral RNA isolated from faeces of treated animals showed decreased specific infectivity, and infectious virus from faeces showed decreased fitness in tissue culture. These data suggest that favipiravir causes increased mutagenesis leading to decreased infectivity and fitness of viral genomes, both features of viral populations approaching extinction during mutagenesis. These results constitute a proof of concept for lethal mutagenesis in vivo and support antiviral therapies based on mutagenic compounds at the clinical level. The data also support the use of favipiravir in the treatment of norovirus infections for which there are not yet licenced antivirals or vaccines available and highlight a need for further studies on favipiravir and other improved derivatives as possible broad-range antiviral strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ribavirin and favipiravir inhibit norovirus replication in cell culture</title><p>To investigate whether ribavirin and favipiravir elicit any antiviral activity on norovirus replication, we employed two different murine norovirus (MNV) strains, MNV-1 and MNV-3. MNV-1 was the first MNV strain isolated as the causative agent of a fatal infection in Stat1<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karst et al., 2003</xref>). Later studies identified many other MNV strains, including MNV-3, wide spread in different mice laboratory colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hsu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thackray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barron et al., 2011</xref>). MNV is used as a model to study norovirus replication and pathogenesis and has facilitated a better understanding of the norovirus life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wobus et al., 2006</xref>). MNV-1 efficiently replicates in cell culture although it shows limited virulence in wild-type mice. In contrast, MNV-3 typically produces lower yields in tissue culture, yet establishes long-term persistent infections in wild-type mice, being detected for at least 8 months after inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McFadden et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that ribavirin and favipiravir elicit antiviral activity against MNV-1 and human norovirus (HuNoV) replicon in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang and George, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rocha-Pereira et al., 2012</xref>). However, the mechanism of action and their utility in vivo have not been described.</p><p>The treatment of RAW264.7 cells infected with MNV (MOI of 0.01 TCID50/cell) with ribavirin or favipiravir resulted in significant reductions in virus yields, reaching up to a 3-log<sub>10</sub> decrease for ribavirin and a 4-log<sub>10</sub> for favipiravir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Favipiravir inhibition occurred in a gradual manner, with the greatest reduction in virus titre being observed at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). This result is suggestive of a cumulative antiviral activity often observed with increasing number of mutations in viral genomes during successive rounds of replication. In contrast, ribavirin inhibited norovirus replication from an early time point (8 hr), suggesting a different mechanism of action, an additional antiviral activity relative to favipiravir, or potentially due to a different mutational spectrum activity elicited by these two compounds. However, it is alternatively possible that the delayed inhibition shown by favipiravir compared to ribavirin reflects the fact that it takes several more steps to convert favipiravir to the active form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Furuta et al., 2005</xref>). To investigate this possibility, we repeated the kinetics by incubating the cells overnight with favipiravir before infection to facilitate favipiravir conversion into favipiravir-triphosphate. No major differences were observed with cells pre-incubated during 1 hr or overnight with favipiravir (data not shown), which suggests that ribavirin might be a more potent inhibitor of viral RNA replication. To confirm this possibility, we determined the viral RNA synthesis kinetics for MNV-3 in the presence of both compounds and confirmed that ribavirin inhibits viral RNA synthesis from an early time post-infection, while the effects of favipiravir are only observed at later time points (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ribavirin and favipiravir are mutagenic for MNV and cause decreased infectivity</title><p>Although ribavirin and favipiravir cause increased mutagenesis in several RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Graci and Cameron, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moreno et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranovich et al., 2013</xref>), the mechanism of antiviral activity against noroviruses is not known. To determine whether ribavirin and favipiravir treatment resulted in greater mutation frequencies, we carried out sequence analysis of individual molecular clones isolated from populations subjected to 4 passages in the presence of either 200 μM ribavirin or favipiravir. We found that both compounds caused significant increases in the mutation frequencies of replicating virus. Ribavirin treatment resulted in a ∼threefold increase while favipiravir led to a five to sixfold increase in the number of mutations per nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Importantly, alterations in the transition frequency patterns were also observed. Ribavirin treatment resulted in greater proportion of G to A and C to U transitions than in untreated virus populations, while favipiravir led to a slight increase in A to G and U to C transition rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

To investigate whether these compounds reduced the infectivity of treated norovirus populations, we serially passaged MNV in the presence of either ribavirin or favipiravir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, respectively). In both cases, lower virus titres and encapsidated viral RNA levels were observed during passage in cell culture. After 5 passages, virus titres for MNV-1 treated with 400 μM favipiravir, and MNV-3 treated with either 400 μM ribavirin or favipiravir were close to or below the detection limit, indicating that ribavirin and favipiravir can cause lethal mutagenesis of MNV. We confirmed that MNV-3 was extinguished after 5 passages in the presence of 400 μM favipiravir, by three consecutive blind passages in RAW264.7 cells in the absence of the drug. The specific infectivity, a measure of the ratio of infectious virus per encapsidated genome, was consistently reduced during passages in the presence of favipiravir for both MNV strains. However, treatment with ribavirin resulted in decreased specific infectivity only for MNV-3 treated with the highest concentration (400 μM). This suggests that the lower mutagenic activity exhibited by ribavirin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is responsible for this limited effect on specific infectivity. MNV-3 was more sensitive to favipiravir and ribavirin than MNV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3 and 4</xref>), although this difference could not be associated with significant variations in the mutation frequency values between these strains during infections in treated or untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This different behaviour may be related to the observation that MNV-3 has lower fitness than MNV-1 (compare virus titre yields for untreated infections in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3 fig4">Figures 1, 3 and 4</xref>) which can result in a greater sensitivity to mutagenesis, as previously reported for other viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sierra et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pariente et al., 2001</xref>).

BHK-21 cells support MNV replication but not virus (re)infection, resulting in a single round of replication for the transfected genomes and a better correlation between infectious genome units and virus titre. Thus, this approach provides an indirect measure of viral genome specific infectivity, as only viable genomes will result in the recovery of infectious virus. Viral titres recovered were consistently lower in samples obtained from favipiravir-treated animals than in placebo-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting decreased specific infectivity as a consequence of increased mutagenesis. Virus titres for genomes isolated from ribavirin-treated animals showed no significant difference with untreated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To compare whether mutagenesis in treated animals resulted in lower fitness of virus samples recovered, we determined the relative replication rates of virus populations recovered from mice after 18 days of treatment. To this aim, we carried out MOI controlled infections (0.01 TCID50/cell) in RAW264.7 cells using virus previously isolated from faecal samples and propagated once in cell culture. Virus yields obtained using virus from favipiravir-treated animal samples were lower on average than those isolated from placebo-treated animal samples, suggesting that mutagenesis induced by favipiravir results in a viral fitness cost in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Thus, favipiravir causes increased mutagenesis and decreases the specific infectivity and fitness of norovirus in vivo which supports an antiviral activity mediated by enhanced mutagenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Lethal mutagenesis has been the subject of numerous studies in cell culture in the last few years as an alternative approach to classical antiviral therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perales et al., 2011</xref>). Due to the elevated mutation frequencies in RNA viruses, it was predicted that an increase in the replication error rate might result in the extinction of the viral population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eigen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Domingo et al., 2010</xref>). However, several in vivo studies carried out up to date have resulted in insufficient evidence to support lethal mutagenesis as a practical approach at the clinical level. In this study, we show that favipiravir, a purine nucleoside analogue, can cause the extinction of an RNA virus during replication in its natural host. The antiviral activity observed in vivo is associated with increased mutation frequencies and, importantly, reduced infectivity in virus samples isolated from the treated animals. These are features typically observed in viral quasispecies approaching extinction during lethal mutagenesis which constitutes a proof-of-principle for this antiviral strategy.</p><p>Favipiravir was initially identified as an antiviral compound for the treatment of influenza virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Furuta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sidwell et al., 2007</xref>) and currently is being tested in a phase 3 clinical trial. Previous studies on mice and data from clinical trials in humans show that favipiravir is well tolerated in vivo with much less toxicity exhibited than ribavirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gowen et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we observed no major side effects in the mice treated during the 8 weeks. The only apparent side-effect is that treated mice show a modest reduced rate of weight gain compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its activity in vivo against influenza virus and data shown here on MNV, favipiravir is efficient in the control and clearance of a broad number of RNA viruses including picornavirus, parmyxovirus, bunyavirus, arenavirus, and togavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Furuta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gowen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mendenhall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caroline et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oestereich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smither et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, favipiravir has shown efficient antiviral activity in mouse models for Ebola virus infections, which has led some African countries to consider using this drug for the control of the current outbreak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ikuomola, 2014</xref>). Further studies are needed to elucidate if the mechanism of action of favipiravir against these other viruses is lethal mutagenesis, and if it constitutes a possible universal antiviral mutagen for the clinical treatment of viral diseases. In particular, an attractive possibility would be to study the effect of favipiravir in the control of HCV, particularly given the lower toxicity displayed by favipiravir.</p><p>These results are also relevant for the development of antiviral strategies to control human norovirus (HuNoV) infections for which there are currently no licenced vaccines or antiviral therapies. Due to the absence of cell culture systems to recover and propagate infectious HuNoVs, MNV has been suggested as a potential surrogate system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wobus et al., 2006</xref>). HuNoVs are a significant cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis with large economic losses typically associated with frequent outbreaks in contained environments (&gt;$160 million in UK hospitals alone). In addition, they have been linked to other important disorders such as ulcerative colitis and persistent diarrhoea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ludwig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capizzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bok and Green, 2012</xref>). Chronic norovirus infections constitute a major health problem in immunocompromised patients with no treatment yet available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bok and Green, 2012</xref>). Favipiravir or other derivatives with improved pharmacokinetic properties may constitute an attractive candidate for the treatment of these patients. The rapid evolution and large mutation frequencies of norovirus replicating in immunocompromised patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bull et al., 2012</xref>) suggest that antiviral mutagenesis could be an effective approach. Favipiravir could also be considered as prophylactic treatment to reduce virus dissemination during the course of an outbreak, especially in contained environments such as hospitals or nurseries. The data obtained for persistently infected mice support this possibility with lower virus yields shed by treated animals since an early time during treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that the combination of a mutagenic compound with a classical antiviral molecule can be more efficient in the extinction of a virus than the use of the compound alone or the combination of classical inhibitors only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pariente et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perales et al., 2009</xref>). Inhibitors with antiviral activity in vivo have been identified for multiple RNA viruses, including norovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rocha-Pereira et al., 2013</xref>), encouraging further studies in this direction. Given its significant efficacy in the control of different RNA viruses, favipiravir or other derivatives with improved pharmacokinetics constitute attractive candidates to become universal antiviral compounds against viral diseases via lethal mutagenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics</title><p>Studies with mice were performed in the Department of Pathology BSU Unit (PCD 80/2802) after ethical review by the University of Cambridge Review Panel and subsequent approval by the UK Home Office (PPL70/7689).

The loss of infectivity and the increased genetic burden during passage in tissue culture and in mice is chronicled for murine norovirus. The persistent norovirus infection developed by this laboratory is an excellent system to study clearance of chronic viral infections.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4">Figures 1-4</xref> show nice cell culture experiments in which mutagens ribavirin and favipiravir reduce and even extinguish virus, cause mutation accumulation in the viral RNA, and reduce the particle-to-PFU ratio in a way expected if the genetic burden on the viral genome increases. Although these kinds of experiments have been done previously in the Andino, Kirkegaard, Vignuzzi, and other laboratories, none have been done with favipiravir, which is more effective, less toxic and shows a different pattern of mutagenesis. This is a thorough and interesting study that presents the first clear experimental demonstration that this type of compound can virus disappearance by introduction of mutations into the viral genome.</p><p>The work will be an important contribution to the field once several issues have been addressed:</p><p>1) The authors have overstated their case and should “tone down” their rhetoric in several places. These include:</p><p>a) The claim that this is “the first proof of principle for lethal mutagenesis as a feasible therapeutic approach”. “Feasible” is a very subjective term. Many papers have shown inhibition of virus growth and pathogenesis in mouse models in the presence of ribavirin, and many papers have shown increased mutagenesis in viruses grown in cell culture. It is true that there are very few studies that have both shown increased mutation accumulation as well as treatment effectiveness in the same paper. Other examples of the in vivo effects of ribavirin on a reduction in viral titers and either an increase or an altered mutation spectrum in mice includes:</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chung et al., 2013</xref>, J. Virol. 87:10997.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dietz et al., 2013</xref>, cited in paper. This paper shows a change in mutation profile in the presence of ribavirin in humans concomitant with a decrease in viral load.</p><p>b) The exaggerated claim in the title that the compound “can drive viral extinction during replication in vivo”. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows reduction of virus below the detection limit, but virus also 'extinguishes' in this experiment in the untreated mice, just later. Therefore, the mice were not actually 'chronically infected'.</p><p>c) Similarly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, the authors show the disappearance of viral RNA from the faeces of 7/9 favipiravir-treated animals while this occurred in only 2/10 control animals. This is a trend but probably not significant and not sufficient to make it into the title. It is not clear in this case, also, that the mice in this experiment were 'chronically infected' because the amount of RNA was certainly trending downward even in the control.</p><p>2) The issue of “viral extinction” is an important one. For a virus to be driven to extinction, it should not recrudesce in the absence of drug. Have the authors done this experiment? (And if not, it should be done.)</p><p>3) The enhanced efficacy of ribavirin at early time points could either be “due to a different mechanism of action or an additional antiviral activity” or the different mutational spectrum could render it less possible for adaptive mutations to accumulate. This is the major argument against the concept of lethal mutagenesis, promoted by several laboratories including that of James Bull.</p><p>4) That the mutation rate increases in correlation with compound treatment does not mean that it was causal. Of course, it is likely that it was, but the authors should tone down their statements of causality.

Directly inhibition of RdRp could be tested by doing kinetics experiments in intact cells using RT-PCR because mutagenic effects should only be apparent after accumulation of mutations that manifest after few rounds of replication (particularly at high MOI), whereas direct effects on the RdRp may be clear on one step-replication curve. An alternative is to perform biochemical analyses of the effects of favipiravir on the purified polymerase.</p><p>7) Another important issue is whether or not the virus can develop resistance to favipiravir, and could also demonstrate that the central tenet of the study is correct.

These figures show that ribavirin inhibited norovirus replication at early time points, but that favipiravir gradually inhibited replication. The authors argue that this difference indicates that the two compounds act via different mechanism of actions. However, it is alternatively possible that the delayed inhibition shown by favipiravir compared to ribavirin reflects the fact that it takes several more steps to convert favipiravir to the active form compared to ribavirin. For example, favipiravir is predicted to be ribosylated and polyphosphorylated (Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2005 Mar;49(3):981-6) whereas ribavirin only needs to be converted to the triphosphorylated form.

These two are main features of virus approaching extinction in tissue culture. Thus, our results suggest that virus replicating in favipiravir-treated animals are losing fitness and infectivity as a consequence of mutagenesis. We believe that this evidence constitutes a step beyond the majority of studies done in vivo to date and permit us to propose mutagenesis as a major antiviral trait associated to favipiravir treatment.
