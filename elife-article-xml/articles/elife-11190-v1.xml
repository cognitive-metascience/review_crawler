control has focused on basic metabolic and homeostatic neurobiological substrates. Most animals, including humans, have habitual feeding patterns in which meals are consumed based on learned and/or environmental factors. Here we illuminate a novel neural system regulating higher-order aspects of feeding through which the gut-derived hormone ghrelin communicates with ventral hippocampus (vHP) neurons to stimulate meal-entrained conditioned appetite. Additional results show that the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) is a critical downstream substrate for vHP ghrelin-mediated hyperphagia and that vHP ghrelin activated neurons communicate directly with neurons in the LHA that express the neuropeptide, orexin. Furthermore, activation of downstream orexin-1 receptors is required for vHP ghrelin-mediated hyperphagia. These findings reveal novel neurobiological circuitry regulating appetite through which ghrelin signaling in hippocampal neurons engages LHA orexin signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11190.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11190.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11190.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Eating can occur for many different reasons. We often eat not simply because we are hungry, but because we have learned to eat at specific times of day or in response to factors in our environments (for example, an advert that reminds of us of something tasty). Despite this, few researchers have investigated how biological signals from the gut communicate with the brain to enable this type of learned, or “conditioned”, feeding behavior.</p><p>Brain cells called neurons communicate with each other in specific circuits that can cross between different brain regions. Hsu et al. have now developed a “disconnection neuropharmacology” approach, which alters whether the neurons in different brain regions can communicate with each other, to investigate the effects signaling molecules have on brain activity and behavior. Using this approach in rats revealed a new circuit in the brain that controls learned feeding behavior through ghrelin, a hormone that is released from the stomach and increases appetite.</p><p>Hsu et al. found that the hippocampus, a brain region important for learning and memory control, uses ghrelin as a signal to engage in learned feeding behavior. Neurons in the hippocampus that respond to ghrelin communicate with other neurons in a region of the brain called the lateral hypothalamus (known for its role in feeding) that produce a signaling molecule called orexin. This circuit therefore links memory and feeding behavior.</p><p>Future work will investigate the neural circuits between the hippocampus and other brain regions that are important for feeding behavior, and the hormones that are important for triggering activity in these circuits.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11190.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11190.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>appetite</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>ventral hippocampus</kwd><kwd>GHSR</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK097147</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanoski</surname><given-names>Scott E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006034</institution-id><institution>University of Southern California</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>USC Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute Pilot Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hahn</surname><given-names>Joel D</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanoski</surname><given-names>Scott E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK102478</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanoski</surname><given-names>Scott E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK104897</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanoski</surname><given-names>Scott E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A communication pathway linking memory processing and feeding behavior exists between the gut hormone ghrelin, the hippocampus and the hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Feeding behavior rarely occurs as a direct result of an immediate metabolic or nutrient deficiency. Rather, most animals (including humans) have habitual feeding patterns, consuming a fixed number of meals at approximately the same time each day. Environmental stimuli associated with learned meal anticipation elicit preparatory biological ‘cephalic’ responses (e.g., pancreatic insulin release) that occur prior to food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Woods and Ramsay, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Woods et al., 1970</xref>). These types of conditioned biological responses are advantageous when environmental factors place constraints on eating (e.g., predator threat, limited periods of food availability, and social or professional obligations) because they promote consumption of a large quantity of food within a relatively short time period. One important biological signal associated with conditioned appetite and feeding is ghrelin, a hormone derived from P/D1 cells in the stomach that is the only known circulating hormone that increases food intake(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tschöp et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowley et al., 2003</xref>). While often referred to as a ‘hunger’ hormone, ghrelin is perhaps more aptly described as a meal-anticipatory hormone based on findings from both humans and rodents showing that ghrelin levels rise before an anticipated feeding bout independent of energy deprivation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frecka and Mattes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cummings et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drazen et al., 2006</xref>). Genetic deletion of the ghrelin receptor (growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1A; GHSR) eliminates food anticipatory activity under meal entrainment feeding schedules(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis et al., 2011</xref>), further supporting the notion that ghrelin acts as a conditioned meal-anticipatory signal.</p><p>The mechanisms through which ghrelin communicates with the central nervous system to control learned aspects of food intake regulation are poorly understood. The hippocampus is a brain region historically associated with visuospatial and episodic memory function that has more recently been linked with the control of various feeding-relevant behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benoit et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kanoski, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parent et al., 2014</xref>), including conditioned meal anticipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poulin and Timofeeva, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inglis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Henderson et al., 2013</xref>). GHSR is expressed abundantly in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mani et al., 2014</xref>), and we recently demonstrated that pharmacological activation of GHSR by ghrelin in ventral/temporal subregions of the hippocampus (vHP) potently stimulates food intake by increasing both meal frequency and meal size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kanoski et al., 2013</xref>). However, the extent to which endogenous vHP GHSR signaling controls conditioned anticipatory feeding behavior has not been investigated.</p><p>The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) is implicated in the control of fundamental motivated behaviors, including food intake (For review see: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stanley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leinninger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berthoud and Münzberg, 2011</xref>]). Classic studies show that LHA electrical ablation results in profound hypophagia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Teitelbaum and Epstein, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand and Brobeck, 1951</xref>), whereas LHA electrical stimulation robustly increases food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delgado and Anand, 1953</xref>). The LHA has direct connections with brain regions involved in the regulation of energy balance, including the hypothalamic arcuate and paraventricular nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hahn and Swanson, 2015</xref>), and the medial nucleus of the solitary tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciriello et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the LHA is also directly connected with several brain regions that regulate ‘higher-order’ cognitive aspects of feeding behavior, including the vHP, amygdala, nucleus accumbens (ACB), and ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hahn and Swanson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hahn and Swanson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahn and Swanson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goto et al., 2005</xref>). Of note, vHP pyramidal neurons in field CA1 and the subiculum are a major source of direct and exclusively ipsilateral input to the LHA, especially the dorsal perifornical LHA (dpLHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hahn and Swanson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahn and Swanson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kishi et al., 2000</xref>). The dpLHA also has abundant expression of the neuropeptide orexin (ORX/hypocretin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swanson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hahn, 2010</xref>), which in addition to an established role in behavioral arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hagan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chemelli et al., 1999</xref>), also has a central orexigenic role in the control of ingestive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Willie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodgers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sakurai, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thorpe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sweet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olszewski et al., 2009</xref>). We hypothesize that LHA ORX neurons are a critical downstream substrate of vHP ghrelinergic appetitive neural responding, because [1] orexin receptor 1 (Ox1R) signaling is required for ventricular ghrelin-induced hyperphagia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cone et al., 2014</xref>), and [2] LHA ORX neurons are activated in anticipation of feeding under meal entrainment schedules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jiménez et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the present study we investigate the neural substrates through which ghrelin communicates conditioned appetite and feeding behavior to and within the brain. We hypothesize the existence of a neural pathway whereby peripherally-derived ghrelin (secreted in anticipation of feeding) activates GHSR-expressing vHP glutamatergic (pyramidal) neurons, which in turn activate orexin-expressing dpLHA neurons to stimulate appetite and feeding via CNS Ox1R signaling. We employed a combination of methods to facilitate a correlative approach, including neural pathway-tracing, immunohistochemistry, behavioral neuropharmacology, meal entrainment conditioning, and excitotoxic unilateral lesion-mediated neural ‘disconnection’ between pharmacological vHP GHSR activation and the dpLHA. The results of these experiments suggest novel mechanisms linking mnemonic processes with gut-brain communication to control feeding behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endogenous ghrelin signaling in vHP neurons promotes conditioned feeding behavior</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> depicts a representative 100nl vHP injection site. Rats restricted to 4 hr chow access per day (meal entrainment schedule) learned to gradually increase their chow consumption over the 8 day training period (significant main effect of Day, p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Bilateral parenchymal delivery of the selective GHSR antagonist, JMV2959 (10 μg) to vHP neurons significantly reduced 4 hr chow intake in meal-entrained rats (p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, the same dose of JMV2959 had no effect on 4 hr rebound feeding following 20 hr food restriction in control rats that were not meal entrained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, the JMV2959-induced intake reduction observed in meal-entrained rats appears to be specific to conditioned feeding behavior as opposed to being based on higher baseline kcal consumption in meal entrained vs. control rats. This is supported by results showing that vHP JMV2959 administration did not reduce 4 hr Western diet intake in non-meal entrained, non-food restricted rats under conditions in which total kcal intake exceeded levels observed in meal-entrained rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Compared to equivalent levels of food restriction, the anticipation of eating in meal entrained rats had a greater stimulatory effect on ghrelin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drazen et al., 2006</xref>), indicating that ghrelin acts as a meal anticipation hormonal signal that facilitates the consumption of large quantities of food. This notion is also consistent with data showing a role for ghrelin in stimulating gastric motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Masuda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peeters, 2003</xref>) and increasing meal size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kanoski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Swartz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Lartigue et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faulconbridge et al., 2003</xref>). Here we identify and characterize a novel neural substrate extending these previous findings by demonstrating that vHP ghrelin signaling is physiologically relevant for conditioned feeding behavior. After exposure to a meal entrainment schedule in which rats were restricted to 4 hr food access each day, pharmacological blockade of vHP GHSR signaling prior to food access significantly reduced 4 hr chow consumption. Comparatively, vHP GHSR blockade had no effect on a 4 hr chow intake in equally food-restricted rats that had not undergone the meal entrainment learning. Moreover, the intake reduction appears to be specific to conditioned feeding behavior as opposed to being based on higher baseline kcal consumption in meal entrained vs. control rats. This is supported by results showing that vHP JMV2959 administration did not reduce Western diet intake in non-food deprived, non-meal entrained animals under conditions where baseline kcal intake of the Western diet was actually higher than in meal-entrained rats consuming chow. However, another study showed that peripheral GHSR antagonist (Compound 26) delivery failed to suppress feeding in meal-entrained mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perello et al., 2010</xref>), yet we note that this previous study utilized a different GHSR antagonist, a different species, and a different route of administration (peripheral). Collectively, these findings build on previous work showing that pharmacological vHP GHSR activation increases meal frequency and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kanoski et al., 2013</xref>). Here we establish the endogenous relevance of vHP GHSR signaling to a specific component of feeding – conditioned feeding. We hypothesize that pharmacologically induced hyperphagia following vHP ghrelin injections occurs, at least in part, by augmenting the saliency of conditioned food-relevant interoceptive stimuli and/or external cues that are present in the environment.</p><p>To investigate neural pathways downstream to vHP ghrelin-mediated feeding behavior, we focused on the dpLHA region that contains abundant ORX-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swanson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hahn, 2010</xref>), and provide evidence of an input to dpLHA ORX-expressing from GHSR-expressing neurons in the vHP (field CA1). Our data confirm the existence of an exclusively ipsilateral direct input to the dpLHA from the vHP field CA1, and further demonstrate that ~85% of vHP field CA1 neurons retrogradely labeled from the dpLHA are immunoreactive for GHSR. These findings suggest that vCA1 ghrelin-responsive neurons send a direct input to the dpLHA, thereby highlighting the dpLHA as a downstream target for vHP ghrelin-mediated feeding.</p><p>Based on research showing an extensive population of orexin producing neurons in the dpLHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swanson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hahn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sakurai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1999</xref>), as well as functional and neuroanatomical interactions between ghrelin and Ox1R signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Olszewski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perello et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Solomon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Toshinai et al., 2003</xref>), we next investigated the relationship between vCA1 and dpLHA orexin neurons. A direct connection from the vHP to dpLHA neurons was confirmed by the presence of PHAL-immunoreactive axons in the dpLHA following vHP field CA1 PHAL injections. Several instances of PHAL-labeled axons with varicosities and terminal boutons were recorded in close apposition to dpLHA ORX-expressing neurons. Triple-labeling for PHAL, ORX and the presynaptic marker synaptophysin indicated that some of these close appositions were putative sites of synaptic input. Next, we tested whether vHP GHSR activation engages dpLHA orexin neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis of Fos and orexin expression in the dpLHA in rats treated with vHP ghrelin or vehicle injections revealed Fos expression in approximately 70% of dpLHA orexin-expressing neurons. Taken together, these findings indicate a functional pathway involving GHSR-expressing vHP field CA1 neurons and their downstream communication to dpLHA orexin neurons.</p><p>To investigate the functional relevance of a putative vHP field CA1 ghrelin to LHA orexin connection further, we combined behavioral neuropharmacology (vHP ghrelin injection) with an excitotoxic unilateral LHA lesion-mediated neural disconnection approach (adapted after [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Petrovich et al., 2002</xref>]). This approach takes advantage of an exclusively ipsilateral connection between the vHP and the LHA. Results show that vHP ghrelin administration ipsilateral to unilateral LHA lesions (vHP GHSR to LHA communication eliminated) blocks vHP ghrelin-activated hyperphagia that occurs in rats with sham lesions, and that also occurs when vHP ghrelin injections are given contralateral to the unilateral dpLHA lesion (vHP GHSR to LHA communication intact). These data indicate that vHP to dpLHA communication is critical for vHP ghrelin-mediated feeding effects.</p><p>A limitation in interpreting these findings with regard to the control of conditioned feeding behavior is that these experiments utilized pharmacological activation of vHP ghrelin receptors during free feeding conditions, and therefore the endogenous relevance of this neural circuitry during conditioned or entrained feeding requires further research. However, our data from Exp. 1 provide strong support for the endogenous relevance of vHP ghrelin signaling system for conditioned food intake. We hypothesize that the robust hyperphagic response following vHP GHSR activation during free feeding conditions is based, at least in part, on pharmacologically activating conditioned feeding behavior in the presence of food-associated cues. In other words, pharmacological vHP GHSR activation is potentially bolstering the saliency of internal (e.g., circadian, metabolic) or external cues within the animal’s environment (e.g., food hopper) that have the capacity to promote feeding behavior based on learned associations with feeding. Consistent with this framework, vHP GHSR activation increases meal frequency in response to external environmental stimuli (auditory, visual) that were associated with palatable food access, whereas vHP ghrelin signaling does not augment feeding in response to control stimuli with no prior food association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kanoski et al., 2013</xref>). However, because present data do not directly assess the functional importance of vHP ghrelin to LHA orexin neural circuitry in conditioned feeding, we acknowledge that this pathway might also mediate aspects of non-conditioned appetite and feeding behavior. Indeed, ghrelin signaling in other brains regions appears to stimulate non-conditioned appetitive responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Skibicka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Skibicka et al., 2013</xref>). For example, ICV or intra-amydala administration of the same GHSR antagonist used in this study (JMV2959) reduces free feeding in fasted (non-entrained) animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Salomé et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Crespo et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Neurons in the LHA also express GHSR, and LHA orexin-producing neurons are activated by external food-related cues as well as by direct LHA ghrelin administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Olszewski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Petrovich et al., 2012</xref>). These findings suggest that in addition to the vHP, the LHA might also be a target for ghrelinergic conditioned feeding responses. However, our present data reveal that intra-LHA JMV2959 (including a dose that was effective in the vHP) had no effect on food intake in meal-entrained and non-meal-entrained animals, suggesting that while ghrelin signaling in various brain regions stimulates non-conditioned feeding behavior, vHP ghrelin signaling is a potentially unique neural substrate for learned aspects of feeding behavior. We note that it is also possible that vHP ghrelin to LHA orexin neural circuitry mediates non-conditioned aspects of feeding, however, this notion requires further investigation.</p><p>Our neuroanatomical data are consistent with previous research showing that vHP output to the LHA primarily targets the dpLHA region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hahn and Swanson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahn and Swanson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kishi et al., 2000</xref>) that was targeted with our unilateral NMDA lesions. While the anatomical and behavioral data in the current study suggest that vHP neurons communicate ghrelinergic signaling to the dpLHA directly, we recognize that multisynaptic pathways are also likely be involved. In addition to providing an input to the LHA, vHP field CA1 neurons also provide an input to several other feeding-related brain regions, including the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ishikawa and Nakamura, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007</xref>). These regions also provide a topographically organized input to the LHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hahn and Swanson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahn and Swanson, 2012</xref>), and neural connectivity between the amygdala-LHA and mPFC-LHA has been shown to be critical for conditioned cue-potentiated feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Petrovich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Petrovich et al., 2005</xref>). Additional studies are required to determine the functional relevance of these other pathways to vHP ghrelin-mediated appetite.</p><p>We examined the requirement of downstream Ox1R signaling for vHP ghrelin-mediated feeding effects, demonstrating that central Ox1R blockade (via LV injections of an Ox1R antagonist) attenuated the hyperphagic effects of vHP ghrelin signaling. However, because ventricular injections spread throughout the CNS and Ox1R s are expressed throughout the brain, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hervieu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marcus et al., 2001</xref>), we can only speculate as to the mediating sites of Ox1R activation. Recent research has shown that blockade of Ox1Rs in the VTA attenuates food intake induced by LV ghrelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cone et al., 2014</xref>). Given these findings, and the role of VTA dopaminergic signaling in various aspects of feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Skibicka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nieh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Borgland, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Narayanan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cacciapaglia et al., 2011</xref>), we hypothesize that VTA Ox1R signaling is a critical downstream target of vHP ghrelin to dpLHA orexin signaling, however, this remains to be tested. Previous literature has also shown that central orexin signaling has roles in sleep/wake and arousal in addition to regulating feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hagan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chemelli et al., 1999</xref>). The current study did not directly assess the relationship between vHP ghrelin signaling and orexin mediated arousal. It is possible that the enhanced saliency of external food-related cues following vHP ghrelin signaling is mediated by increased arousal, as well as potential changes to circadian activity, from downstream activation of central Ox1R's (possibly in the locus coeruleus). Further studies are required to test these possibilities, as well as the role of downstream Ox1R signaling in other aspects of feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goforth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zheng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parise et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harris et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cason and Aston-Jones, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thorpe and Kotz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thorpe et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Based on the present results and the findings of related previous research, we propose the following model in which vHP ghrelin signaling engages conditioned feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>): [1] Ghrelin is secreted from the stomach in response to cues (internal or external) related to meal anticipation, [2] Ghrelin crosses the blood brain barrier and enters the central nervous system, [3] vHP GHSR-expressing neurons are activated by ghrelin, [4] These vHP ghrelin-activated neurons engage downstream dpLHA orexin-expressing neurons, [5] Activation of this neural pathway increases appetite and feeding behavior.

For all surgical procedures, rats were anesthetized (ketamine 90mg/kg and xylazine, 2.8 mg/kg), and sedated (acepromazine. 0.72 mg/kg). All procedures were approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee, at the University of Southern California.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Central drug injections, and excitotoxic (NMDA) lesions (Experiments 1, 3, 5 and 6)</title> <p>Experiments involving central drug injections were as follows: (Exp. 1) bilateral vHP injection of a ghrelin receptor (GHSR) antagonist (JMV2959, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA); (Exp. 3) unilateral dpLHA injections of NMDA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); (Exp. 3 and 5) unilateral vHP injection of ghrelin (Bachem, Torrance, CA); (Exp. 6) bilateral vHP injection of ghrelin and lateral ventricle injection of an orexin receptor type 1 (Ox1R) antagonist (SB334867, Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO). Drugs were dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), except SB334867 which was dissolved in DMSO.  Drugs were delivered using a microinfusion pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) connected to a 33-gauge microsyringe injector, via indwelling guide cannulae. Flow rate was calibrated and set to 5 µl/min; injection volume was 100 nl/hemisphere for Exp. 1, 3 and 6. Injection volume for NMDA lesions were 200 nl (dose: 4 μg). Ventricular injections in Exp. 6 were 1 ul in volume. Injectors were left in place for 30 sec post-injection.</p><p>Guide cannulae (26-gauge, Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) for bilateral vHP drug injections were implanted at the following stereotaxic coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Paxinos and Watson, 2007</xref>): -4.9 mm anterior/posterior (AP), 4.8 mm medial/lateral (ML), 6.1 mm dorsal/ventral (DV); they were then affixed to the skull with jewelers screws. Coordinates for lateral ventricular injections of Ox1R antagonist SB334867 were -0.9 mm AP, 1.8 mm ML, 2.6 mm DV. Coordinates for excitotoxic (4 ug, NMDA, 200 nl) LHA lesions, were -2.9 mm AP, 1.1 mm ML, -8.9 mm DV. Injectors for drug administration projected 2 mm beyond guide cannulae. Coordinates for LHA injections were -2.9 mm AP, +/- 1.0 mm ML, -6.7 mm DV. Placement of vHP and LHA cannulae placement was determined post-mortem by injection (via guide cannulae) of a blue dye (100 nl 2% pontamine sky blue ink). Data from animals with dye restricted to the vHP were included in the analysis (a representative vHP injection site is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In total, 12% of rats with vHP cannulae were excluded from the analysis because of misplaced cannulae, determined by the presence of blue dye as noted above.</p><p>The extent of unilateral NMDA dpLHA-targeted lesions was determined postmortem by immunohistochemical detection of the neuronal marker NeuN. Rats showing pronounced (65%) loss of NeuN labeling within the dpLHA compared to a contralateral sham (aCSF) injection in the same animal were included in data analysis (two rats with minimal or misplaced lesions were excluded).</p><p>Targeting of the OX1R antagonist SB334867 to the lateral ventricle (Exp. 6) was verified 1 week post-injection of the antagonist by elevation of cytoglucopenia resulting from injection (at the same coordinates) of 210 μg (2 μl) of 5-thio-D-glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ritter et al., 1981</xref>).

PHAL immunoreactive axons in the LHA confirmed the exclusively ipsilateral nature of vHP to LHA projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; representative vHP PHAL injection site, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Experiments 2–5 included immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. Animals were anesthetized, then perfused transcardially with ice-cooled 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M borate buffer of pH 9.5. The brains were removed and immersed in the same (unused) fixative containing 12% sucrose for 20–24 hr at 4ºC. The brains were then blocked transversely at the level of the caudal midbrain, and each block was flash-frozen in dry-ice cooled hexane before being sectioned frozen on a sliding microtome (transverse plane, 30 µm thickness, 5 series). Sections were stored in antifreeze solution at -20°C until further processing (Antifreeze solution: 30% ethylene glycol, 20% glycerol in 0.02 M potassium phosphate-buffered saline—KPBS).</p><p>The following primary antibodies were used: (Exp. 2) anti-CTB (raised in goat) and anti-GHSR (goat); (Exp. 4) anti-PHAL (goat), anti-ORX1a (rabbit), and anti-synaptophysin (mouse); (Exp. 5) anti-cFos (sheep) and anti-ORX1a (rabbit). Antibody incubations were done at 4ºC (washes and other steps at room temperature). Primary antibody incubation was overnight (~18 hrs). Primary antibodies were diluted in the following solution: KPBS containing 1% donkey serum and 0.1% Triton X-100; this step was followed by KPBS washes (8 changes, 10 mins each). Overnight secondary antibody incubation: Biotinylated secondary antibodies or secondary-fluorophore conjugates were diluted in KPBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100; this step was followed by KPBS washes (6 changes, 10 mins each). Overnight tertiary incubation (if biotinylated secondary antibodies were applied: Streptavdin-fluorophore conjugate was diluted in KPBS; this step was followed by KPBS washes (3 changes, 10 mins each). Sections were mounted onto glass slides, allowed to dry, and coverslipped, using 50% glycerol in KPBS mountant. Coverslip edges were sealed with clear nail polish.</p><p>Controls for IHC: For each primary antibody used, a standard control was performed in which the primary antibody was omitted from the protocol (to control for non-specific signal resulting from subsequent antibody and signal-detection reagents). In addition, for GHSR primary antibodies, an adsorption / neutralization was performed using the GHSR peptide sequence (a propriety sequence derived from a portion of the complete GHSR sequence). Following this adsorption, GHSR labeling was abolished. Photomicrographs were acquired using either a Nikon 80i and (Nikon DS-QI1,1280X1024 resolution, 1.45 megapixel) under epifluorescent illumination, or as optical slices using a Zeiss LSM 700 UGRB Confocal System (controlled by Zeiss Zen software).

After recovery from surgery, they were put on a meal-entrainment schedule where they were limited to food access for 4 hr daily, beginning at 10:00 AM (start of dark cycle), for 8 days. One day after the last training day, immediately prior to lights off, the meal-entrained rats were injected via their bilaterally implanted cannulae with either 0 µg, 1 µg, or 5 µg of a ghrelin receptor (GHSR) antagonist (JMV2959; total doses: 0 µg, 2 µg, 10 µg).

A between-subjects design was used to avoid conditioning effects with repeated food restriction. Given the baseline differences in food intake between meal-entrained and control rats, to control for a lack of observable effects based on low kcal intake (i.e., floor effect) in controls, a separate cohort of non-food restricted rats (n=11) were first habituated to 1 ~3 g pellet of a ‘Western diet’ a day (45% kcal fat, enriched with sucrose; Research Diets D12451) for 5 days, given at random times to avoid conditioning effects.

Using several classical neuroanatomical techniques, including histochemistry, targeted stereotaxic injections, anterograde and retrograde tracing, and brain site lesioning in rats, the investigators now describe a pathway in which GHSR-expressing ventral hippocampal neurons from the CA1 region project to ipsilateral dpLHA orexin neurons. When activated by ghrelin, this pathway results in ghrelin-induced food intake.</p><p>This paper is strong for several reasons:</p><p>1) Theme: While the hippocampus has been described before as playing a role in various aspects of ghrelin action, the neuronal circuits within which ghrelin-responsive hippocampal neurons participate have not been known. This study describes for the first time a ghrelin-responsive neuronal circuit involving the hippocampal neurons.</p><p>2) Technique: The neuroanatomical techniques utilized are classic and performed elegantly.</p><p>A major comment follows, although it should not require any major changes to address: The investigators frame this work and this pathway as all being relevant to ‘conditioned feeding’ which they model with about a week of restricted access to food for only 4 hr per day. However, I think it is premature with the data provide to attribute this pathway as being relevant specifically to their model of conditioned feeding. Only in the experiments summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> was the meal entrainment done – and for those experiments, injections of a GHSR antagonist directly into the vHP were used to confirm that GHSR-expressing vHP neurons were important for conditioned feeding (but not for 4 hr rebound feeding following a 20 hr food restriction). In the subsequent experiments, neuroanatomic techniques were used to track the projections of GHSR-expressing/ghrelin-responsive neurons to the LHA. Also, the orexigenic effects of pharmacologic ghrelin-injections into the vHP were assessed in LHA-lesioned animals or Orexin receptor blocker-administered animals. Activation of LHA neurons was also assessed in animals administered ghrelin into the vHP. Thus, while GHSR-expressing vHP neurons appear to be important for conditioned feeding, the GHSR-expressing vHP neurons projecting to the LHA orexin neurons are not necessarily involved in that particular aspect of ghrelin-induced eating. Thus, the possible role of this newly described pathway in a broader scope of ghrelin's many feeding-related actions should be mentioned. If the investigators want to limit this pathway to conditioned feeding, further physiologic experiments would be needed – e.g., inhibit downstream portions of that pathway and determine how it affects conditioned feeding.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The set of studies presented here are important in addressing the neurobiological substrates of overeating in today's society – where consumption is rarely triggered by caloric deficit. They are also important in elucidating an under-appreciated node for the regulation of feeding – the vHP. The work is well conducted and thorough. The authors provide ample data to support most of their conclusions. I have three major comments that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) A key argument, and the title of the paper, posits that ghrelin action in the ventral hippocampus augments the conditioned aspects of feeding through LH orexin neurons. A limitation of the manuscript is that the authors do not actually show this. First, they show that hippocampal ghrelin augments conditioned bouts of feeding. They then go on to show that hippocampal ghrelin increases unconditioned food intake and this requires an intact ipsilateral LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and the availability of central orexin receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, the authors do not show that central orexin receptors are required for ventral hippocampal ghrelin to augment conditioned feeding. Repeating the approach in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> but infusing either vehicle or the SB334867 into the lateral ventricle would solidify the argument. The use of an orexin saporin for a selective LH lesion would also solidify the argument.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors compare food intake induced by vHP ghrelin (or vehicle) in animals with (or without) LH lesions. They compare these groups separately according to whether or not the animals had an LH lesion or sham (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These data should be combined and compared using an ANOVA with main effects of surgery (Lesion, Sham) and treatment (Vehicle, Ghrelin). This comparison will help parse out any non-specific effects of the LH lesion unrelated to ghrelin treatment. Moreover, this is critical because bilateral LH lesions are well known to alter feeding behavior and it appears there are differences in the amount of food consumed between the lesion and sham animals that received vehicle. For example, compare food intake vehicle treated animals in lesion and sham groups at 1 hr and 5 hr.</p><p>3) The authors are very thoughtful in their Discussion. However, if the authors posit that the source for vHP GHSR activation is peripheral ghrelin evoked by interoceptive or external cues then GHSRs are likely to be activated in other brain regions where they are expressed – including LHA GHSRs. LHA orexin neurons express GHSRs and are activated by cues. While the authors are to be commended for showing that vHP GHSRs are required for the full expression of conditioned feeding in the present paradigm – supporting an endogenous roll for ghrelin in the vHP, the manuscript would be strengthened by investigating another GHSR-rich region to determine if similar effects are observed or whether the GHSRs in the vHP uniquely participated in meal-entrained conditioned feeding. At the very least, this unresolved issue should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11190.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Both reviewers indicated considerable enthusiasm for this paper; however they both suggested a few changes that would enhance its impact.

We acknowledge the possibility that the hippocampal ghrelin to lateral hypothalamic orexin circuit could potentially be involved in aspects of appetite and feeding behavior other than conditioned feeding. We further agree that the data presented in Exp. 3 and 6 do not directly assess the importance of this circuit in conditioned feeding. To address this issue, we considered repeating the conditioned feeding paradigm using designs parallel to Exps. 3 and 6, however, we note that the animals are robustly hyperphagic during 20 hr food restricted meal entrainment conditions, and thereby activation of vHP ghrelin receptors would be unlikely to augment intake from a high baseline of excessive food intake (i.e., ceiling effect). Moreover, an antagonist approach for the ghrelin receptor in Exps. 3 and 6 is not logical since these studies are designed to investigate downstream pathways.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree that our previous manuscript draft did not sufficiently consider a role for vHP ghrelin in other (e.g., non-conditioned) aspects of appetite and feeding. Accordingly, we have revised the title and Abstract, extended our Discussion, and modified the overall language throughout the manuscript to reflect a broader discussion of the role of ghrelin signaling in the hippocampus and elsewhere in the brain in many aspects of feeding behavior. For example, our title now reads, &quot;Hippocampus ghrelin signaling mediates appetite through lateral hypothalamic orexin pathways&quot;, and &quot;learned feeding aspects of feeding behavior&quot; was explicitly removed from the Abstract. Other instances include the Introduction and Discussion (end of last three paragraphs). While we retain the viewpoint that hippocampal ghrelin signaling is critical for conditioned feeding (based on Exp.1), in this revised manuscript, we do not disregard the possibility of the vHP-LHA circuitry as being involved in a variety of other food-motivated behaviors. Overall our extended discussion uses a more cautious tone with regards to vHP ghrelin having an exclusive role in conditioned feeding.</p><p><italic>If the authors want to broaden the role of ghrelin acting on the 'hippocampus to orexin neuron circuit' to mediate many aspects a feeding, then they should compare the relative importance of hippocampal input to orexin neurons with other potential inputs (reviewer #2 comment 3). The authors should also address the other concerns raised by the reviewers.</italic> </p><p>As specifically suggested by Reviewer #2 we have added an additional experiment which compares the relative importance of hippocampal GHSR mediated conditioned feeding with another GHSR rich region, the lateral hypothalamus (LHA). As stated by Reviewer #2, the LHA contains orexin producing neurons that are activated by both LHA ghrelin infusion and by external food-related cues (Olszewski et al., 2003; Petrovich et al. 2012). Moreover, LHA ghrelin infusion (like vHP ghrelin infusion) increases food intake in rats (Olszewski et al., 2003). Therefore, the LHA is a logical additional target of potential importance for ghrelin-mediated conditioned feeding effects. Our new experiment replicates Exp.1, except that the GHSR-1A receptor antagonist, JMV2959, is now administered bilaterally to the LHA in meal-entrained animals and non-entrained animals (20 hr food deprived). We have included this new experiment in the manuscript, and the results (described in subsection “Endogenous ghrelin signaling in LHA neurons does not regulate conditioned feeding behavior”) are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. Our results show that GHSR blockade using a dose of JMV2959 that was effective in the vHP had no effect on entrained food intake or non-entrained food intake in similarly food-restricted animals. These findings suggest that vHP ghrelin signaling is particularly critical in the expression of conditioned feeding behavior based on internal (or potentially external) contextual cues, whereas LHA ghrelin signaling could be mediating other aspects of appetite and feeding. In this revised manuscript we now further elaborate in the Discussion on the feeding effects of ghrelin in brain regions such as the lateral hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, and amygdala (Olszewski et al., 2003;, Perello et al., 2010; Skibicka et al., 2011; Alvarez-Crespo et al., 2012) as well as other feeding effects of downstream orexin signaling (Zhu et al., 2002; Goforth et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2007; Parise et al., 2011; Harris et al., 2005; Thorpe et al., 2005; Thorpe et al., 2006). The specific mechanisms underlying LHA ghrelin mediated feeding will require further studies beyond the scope of this manuscript, but we believe that this additional experiment adds further support for the importance of vHP GHSR-1A signaling specifically in mediating conditioned feeding effects and improves the overall quality of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Minor comment from the Reviewing editor: It is customary to put a space between numbers and units, e.g. 4 hr, not 4 hr.

In addition, we have altered the title and Abstract to reflect this more cautious perspective. Please see above (response to Reviewing Editor) where we expand on how we address this caveat in this revision, and where we also explain the conceptual difficulties inherent in expanding Exps. 3 and 6 to include conditioned feeding models.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The set of studies presented here are important in addressing the neurobiological substrates of overeating in today's society – where consumption is rarely triggered by caloric deficit. They are also important in elucidating an under-appreciated node for the regulation of feeding – the vHP. The work is well conducted and thorough. The authors provide ample data to support most of their conclusions. I have three major comments that need to be addressed: 1) A key argument, and the title of the paper, posits that ghrelin action in the ventral hippocampus augments the conditioned aspects of feeding through LH orexin neurons. A limitation of the manuscript is that the authors do not actually show this. First, they show that hippocampal ghrelin augments conditioned bouts of feeding. They then go on to show that hippocampal ghrelin increases unconditioned food intake and this requires an intact ipsilateral LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and the availability of central orexin receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, the authors do not show that central orexin receptors are required for ventral hippocampal ghrelin to augment conditioned feeding. Repeating the approach in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> but infusing either vehicle or the SB334867 into the lateral ventricle would solidify the argument. The use of an orexin saporin for a selective LH lesion would also solidify the argument.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer for highlighting this limitation with the manuscript and for providing suggestions to enhance the paper. Please see above (response to the Reviewing Editor) for our rationale regarding the conceptual difficulty involved with repeating the experiments from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig8">Figures 5 and 8</xref> using a conditioned feeding approach. Thus, as an alternative to address this caveat, we have now stressed throughout this revised manuscript that while vHP ghrelin signaling has important roles in conditioned feeding, it may well be the case that vHP ghrelin to LHA orexin neural circuitry has broader roles in feeding behavior, particularly given that orexin signaling and the LHA neural processing are involved in several aspects of feeding behavior (Zhu et al., 2002; Goforth et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2007; Parise et al., 2011; Harris et al., 2005; Thorpe et al., 2005; Thorpe et al., 2006), (Stanley et al., 2011; Jennings et al., 2013; Legrand et al., 2015; Cason and Aston-Jones, 2013). Overall, in this revision we now take a more cautious approach towards attributing this circuit with an exclusive role in conditioned feeding, and we have altered the title, Abstract, and Discussion accordingly.</p><p>Regarding your suggestion to repeat the approach in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> with LV SB334867, this is an interesting idea but we do not think that such an approach is feasible as it would require an orexigenic agonist (vHP ghrelin) application under conditions of excessive feeding. In other words, in our meal entrainment schedule, the rats are robustly hyperphagic during the 4 hr food access period, and thereby activation of vHP ghrelin receptors would be unlikely to augment intake from a high baseline of excessive food intake (i.e., ceiling effect).</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors compare food intake induced by vHP ghrelin (or vehicle) in animals with (or without) LH lesions. They compare these groups separately according to whether or not the animals had an LH lesion or sham (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These data should be combined and compared using an ANOVA with main effects of surgery (Lesion, Sham) and treatment (Vehicle, Ghrelin). This comparison will help parse out any non-specific effects of the LH lesion unrelated to ghrelin treatment. Moreover, this is critical because bilateral LH lesions are well known to alter feeding behavior and it appears there are differences in the amount of food consumed between the lesion and sham animals that received vehicle. For example, compare food intake vehicle treated animals in lesion and sham groups at 1 hr and 5 hr.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing our attention to this important matter. It was an oversight to omit this important statistical analysis from our previous submission, and we have now included the analysis in accordance with the reviewers; suggestion. After performing an ANOVA with group as a between subjects factor and drug as a repeated measures factor, we found no overall significant group effect on food intake at any time point. Importantly, we did obtain a significant interaction between group and drug at the 5 hr time point of food intake, and marginal significance for this interaction at 1 hr and 3 hr. This analysis is now added to the results of Exp.3 (subsection “Endogenous ghrelin signaling in LHA neurons does not regulate conditioned feeding behavior”).</p><p><italic>3) The authors are very thoughtful in their Discussion. However, if the authors posit that the source for vHP GHSR activation is peripheral ghrelin evoked by interoceptive or external cues then GHSRs are likely to be activated in other brain regions where they are expressed – including LHA GHSRs. LHA orexin neurons express GHSRs and are activated by cues. While the authors are to be commended for showing that vHP GHSRs are required for the full expression of conditioned feeding in the present paradigm – supporting an endogenous roll for ghrelin in the vHP, the manuscript would be strengthened by investigating another GHSR-rich region to determine if similar effects are observed or whether the GHSRs in the vHP uniquely participated in meal-entrained conditioned feeding. At the very least, this unresolved issue should be discussed.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We agree that ghrelin signaling in different brain regions likely produces diverse effects on feeding behavior, which has prompted us to perform your suggested experiment: examining another GHSR-rich region (the LHA) and its function in conditioned feeding. We administered the ghrelin receptor antagonist JMV2959 in the LHA (using a dose that was effective in the vHP for reducing meal-entrained intake) in both meal-entrained and non-entrained (20 hr restricted) animals. Our results from this new experiment are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> (please also see “Experiment 1: Effect of vHP-mediated ghrelin signaling on conditioned feeding behavior”, in the Methods, and “Endogenous ghrelin signaling in LHA neurons does not regulate conditioned feeding behavior”, in the Results). We found that LHA GHSR blockade had no effects on food intake in meal entrained and non-meal entrained animals under the same deprivation conditions, using an identical design as experiment 1. These data suggest that ghrelin signaling in the LHA is not involved in conditioned feeding, (or at least to a lesser extent than the vHP) and may potentially have a broader and/or fundamentally different role in feeding behavior. Further assessment of LHA ghrelin mediated feeding behavior is beyond the scope of this manuscript and will require future experiments. Importantly, the notion that vHP ghrelin signaling is uniquely involved in conditioned feeding remains supported by the new data set, yet we still take a more cautious tone regarding this perspective in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have also expanded the Discussion to now address the role of ghrelin signaling in different brain regions as being involved different aspects of feeding (Sibicka et al., 2011; Sibicka et al., 2013). We now highlight two studies in which ICV (Salome et al., 2009) or intra-amygdala administration of JMV2959 (Alvarez-Crespo et al., 2012) reduces feeding in fasted (non-entrained) rats. Taken together, our study adds a novel perspective of ghrelin signaling in the brain by highlighting dissociative feeding effects of ghrelin depending on brain region.</p><p>References:</p><p>Perello M, Sakata I, Birnbaum S, Chuang JC, Osborne-Lawrence S, Rovinsky SA, et al.
