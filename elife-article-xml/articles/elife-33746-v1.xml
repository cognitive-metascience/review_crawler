reconsolidation. Retrieval can be triggered by partial and shared cues. When the cue is presented, the most relevant memory should be updated. In a contextual version of the object recognition task, we examined the effect of medial PFC (mPFC) serotonin 2a receptor (5-HT2aR) blockade during retrieval in reconsolidation of competing objects memories. We found that mPFC 5-HT2aR controls retrieval and reconsolidation of object memories in the perirhinal cortex (PRH), but not in the dorsal hippocampus in rats. Also, reconsolidation of objects memories in PRH required a functional interaction between the ventral hippocampus and the mPFC. Our results indicate that in the presence of conflicting information at retrieval, mPFC 5-HT2aR may facilitate top-down context-guided control over PRH to control the behavioral response and object memory reconsolidation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sertononin</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>reconsolidation</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>perirhinal cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003074</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Recently formed grouped PICT D 2012-0927</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weisstaub</surname><given-names>Noelia V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003074</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT A 2015-2344</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weisstaub</surname><given-names>Noelia V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005363</institution-id><institution>Universidad de Buenos Aires</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ubacyt 2014–2017 GEF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weisstaub</surname><given-names>Noelia V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Serotonin, a neurotransmitter mostly studied in relation with emotions, also plays an important role in the control of episodic memories.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flexibility and updating of memories is an adaptive capacity present in human and non-human animals. In rodents, fear and associative conditioning has been used as a way to study the underlying circuits and molecular mechanisms of flexible memories through analysis of extinction, reversal learning and updating of contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodriguez-Ortiz and Bermúdez-Rattoni, 2017</xref>). However, little is known about the flexibility of episodic types of memory in spite of the evidence that the very process of remembering can affect memory stability. In particular, context-dependent memories might be an aid to guide adaptive behavior relaying on previous experience. For example, we would need to update memories from a previously dangerous neighborhood that is now a commercial district to adapt our behaviors to this new environment. Reconsolidation is the process by which consolidated memories enter a new period of instability after reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miranda and Bekinschtein, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nader et al., 2000</xref>) that can serve stabilization, strengthening, and updating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKenzie and Eichenbaum, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodriguez-Ortiz and Bermúdez-Rattoni, 2017</xref>). Its molecular mechanisms have been extensively studied in animals using fear and appetitive conditioning and spatial learning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nader, 2015</xref>). However, very little is known about the molecular and neural mechanisms of episodic memory reconsolidation, consistently observed in human autobiographical memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Forcato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wymbs et al., 2016</xref>). Retrieval of similar, but distinctive, experiences can be triggered by similar cues, so how the brain controls which memories are to be updated by reconsolidation is a key question regarding the persistence of episodic memories. Here, we use object recognition memory in rodents as an episodic-like memory to tackle this important question. These elaborate memories involve multiple sensory pathways converging in multisensory areas, including the medial temporal lobe (MTL), of specific importance to episodic memory in humans. Interactions between PFC and hippocampus and other MTL structures may support the ability to create contextual representations, and use these contextual representations to retrieve the appropriate memories within a given context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>). Also neurons from the MTL respond to specific objects and contexts, suggesting that different areas may interact and work together to supportepisodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahn and Lee, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brandman and Peelen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davachi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Diana et al., 2007</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee and Park, 2013c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Squire et al., 2007</xref>). Evidence indicates that different MTL regions store parts of the representation of a particular episode, and this raises the question of how this information is integrated, consolidated, retrieved, reactivated and reconsolidated. In addition, it is not known what happens after the memory of a given episode is reactivated; does the memory reconsolidate in all structures? Are different features of the memory reactivated in different regions? Is reactivation controlled by the same mechanisms in each region?</p><p>The serotonergic system is a key neuromodulator of PFC function and its relevance in memory processing has recently started to be understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meneses, 2015</xref>). The 5HT2a receptor (5-HT2aR) is one of the main post-synaptic serotoninergic receptor types and it is highly expressed in the PFC. A handful of studies suggest a role for 5-HT2aR in episodic memories in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Quervain et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>), and a few animal studies have addressed a potential role of 5-HT2aR during memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meneses, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meneses and Hong, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>). We have previously shown that mPFC 5-HT2aR plays a role in recognition memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bekinschtein et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, we demonstrated that 5-HT2aR activation is required when previously familiar and competing information is simultaneously presented. Thus, the activity of this receptor in mPFC could affect memory reactivation in downstream structures of the MTL. In this work we evaluate the importance of 5-HT2aR activation in the PFC in the control of retrieval and reconsolidation in different structures of the MTL when these processes are guided by contextual cues, similar to that which may occur during episodic memory retrieval in humans. We hypothesize that 5-HT2aR-mediated signaling in PFC during episodic memory retrieval differentially affects object memory reconsolidation depending on the contextual cues, and in that manner produces long lasting changes in episodic memory storage. Revealing the mechanisms of episodic memory retrieval and reconsolidation would be important to understand the function of these types of memory in guiding appropriate behavior in particular environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>5-HT2aR activity in the mPFC modulates recognition memory reconsolidation in the PRH</title><p>Episodic memories are characterized for the encoding and retrieval of unique episodes. In rodents, episodic-like memories can be analyzed using a variety of behavioral paradigms. The Object in Context (OIC) task is a modified version of the spontaneous object recognition task characterized by having a strong spatial component, and can be considered an episodic-like task in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggleton et al., 1989</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morici et al., 2015a</xref>). To solve this task, animals require to retrieve a unique experience of an object explored in a particular context. As in other recognition memory tasks, it involves multiple sensory pathways and structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Warburton and Brown, 2015</xref>). In particular, the PRH is engaged by specific object stimuli and signals the familiarity of those items, whereas the hippocampal region is involved in processing the contexts in which these events occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown et al., 2010</xref>). We used the OIC task to evaluate the mechanisms involved in control of retrieval and reconsolidation by the mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This task is a three-trial procedure that allows evaluation of the congruency between the context and the objects presented within it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). During the training phase, animals learned two different context-object associations. During test 1, the retrieval phase, a copy of each object used before is presented in one of the contexts. Thus, one of the objects is presented in an ‘incongruent’ context (object B = incongruent object), while the other is presented in a ‘congruent’ one (object A = congruent object). Novelty comes from a novel combination of an object and a context, and exploratory behavior will be driven by retrieval of a particular ‘what’ and ‘which context’ conjunctive representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eacott and Norman, 2004</xref>). We have previously shown that blockade of mPFC 5-HT2aR signaling affects retrieval in the OIC, but has no effect in a one-item object recognition task (SNOR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bekinschtein et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that blockade of mPFC 5-HT2aR selectively affects discrimination based on the combination of object identity and other features such as the context or the recency of the experience. In fact, after blockade of 5-HT2aR in mPFC during the test session, animals explore the congruent and incongruent object equally as if they are both equally familiar compared with a complete novel object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bekinschtein et al., 2013</xref>). As memory retrieval can lead to reactivation and trigger reconsolidation, we hypothesized that 5-HT2aR inactivation might affect the pattern of object memory reconsolidation in PRH (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buckley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bussey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horne et al., 2010</xref>]). After administration of MDL into the mPFC, the congruent and incongruent objects seemed to be retrieved with equal strength. Thus, we predicted that 5-HT2aR blockade in mPFC would render the incongruent and congruent object memory traces sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors, such as emetine (EME), whereas in control animals, only the memory of the congruent object more strongly retrieved would be sensitive to the drug. Similar to what we described for short-term memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bekinschtein et al., 2013</xref>), infusion of the 5-HT2aR specific antagonist MDL 11,939 (MDL) in the mPFC impaired the resolution of OIC during test 1, 24 hr after acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, left panel). MDL effect was transient as it did not affect the expression of the original object memories during test 2 in the MDL/VEH group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, right panel). Infusion of EME immediately after test 1 disrupted long-term memory retention during test 2 in the VEH/EME group for the congruent object (object A) only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This suggests that the memory trace for the congruent object was labilized in PRH during test 1. However, blockade of mPFC 5-HT2aR during test 1 in combination with EME infusion into PRH immediately after test 1, disrupted long-term memory for both the incongruent (object B) and congruent (object A) objects, as observed in test 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, right panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This suggests that both memory traces were labilized becoming susceptible to the effects of EME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, right panel). Total training exploration time did not differ between objects A and B (paired t test, t = 0.078, p=0.9381, mean<sub>A</sub> = 48.99 ± 1.969, mean<sub>B</sub> = 49.16 ± 2.048). However, there was a difference in exploration time between the first and second exposures to each context during training (One-way ANOVA, F = 29,53, DF = 3, MS = 3968, p<sub>main effect</sub> &lt;0.0001; significant Bonferroni multiples comparisons, context1 (Tr1 vs Tr2) mean<sub>Tr1</sub> = 30.08 ± 1.461, mean<sub>Tr2</sub> = 19.93 ± 1.173, p&lt;0.0001, context2 (Tr1 vs Tr2) mean<sub>Tr1</sub> = 30.27 ± 1.728, mean<sub>Tr2</sub> = 17.44 ± . 9589, p&lt;0.0001), that was expected, after re-exposure to the same context object association. EME affects the behavioral response of the rats during test 2. One conceivable possibility is that EME perceived the novel objects presented during test 2 (C or D) as familiar. Another possibility is that EME is blocking reconsolidation of the previously familiar objects, causing amnesia. If the second hypothesis is true, rats will lose the ability to remember the association between the objects and the previously familiar context showing enhanced exploration of object A. We compared the exploratory time of object A during test 2 between the VEH and EME groups. We found that animals infused with EME have enhanced exploration of object A relative to the VEH group, whereas there were no differences in the level of exploration of object B across groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>., panel a). Thus, animals infused with EME lost the memory for object A, they are not perceiving the novel object as familiar. As pharmacological receptor antagonists could potentially bind to other targets, we confirmed the specificity of the function of 5-HT2aR signaling in OIC retrieval and reconsolidation using 5-HT2aR knockout (<italic>Htr2a-/-</italic>) mice. We cannulated <italic>Htr2a-/-</italic> and <italic>Htr2a+/+</italic> mice in PRH and trained them in the OIC task. We infused EME or VEH in the PRH immediately after test 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and analyzed retention of the original memories during test 2, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, upper panel). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morici et al., 2015a</xref>), <italic>Htr2a-/-</italic> mice had a deficit in the resolution of OIC task compared with <italic>Htr2a+/+</italic> mice in test 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, left panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Infusion of EME in the PRH immediately after test 1 impaired memory retention of the congruent object in <italic>Htr2a+/+</italic> mice and the retention of both the congruent and incongruent memory traces in <italic>Htr2a-/-</italic> during test 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, right panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This result suggests that both the memories for the congruent and incongruent objects undergo reconsolidation in the PRH of <italic>Htr2a-/-</italic>, but only the congruent object memory reconsolidates in the PRH of <italic>Htr2a+/+</italic> mice. Interestingly, the absence of 5-HT2aR did not affect the integrity of the original memory, as <italic>Htr2a -/-</italic> mice infused with VEH were able to recognize effectively each object during test 2, suggesting that mPFC 5-HT2aR activation is involved in the selection of the memory traces to be reactivated and not in the storage of the memories per se. Specificity of infusion site was controlled by infusion of EME after test 1, 0.1 mm above the area of interest.

However, under certain circumstances they can have other molecular targets not directly implicated in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Alberini, 2008</xref>). Zif268/Egr1 is a transcription factor important for reconsolidation of different types of memories including recognition memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Veyrac et al., 2014</xref>), making it a good candidate to mediate reconsolidation in an OIC task. We investigated this hypothesis by infusing an antisense (ASO) or a scramble (miss-sense) control oligonucleotide (MSO) for Zif268 in the PRH in combination with pre-test 1 injection of MDL into the mPFC. Oligonucleotides are specific for target mRNAs and much less likely than protein synthesis inhibitors to affect other processes not related to translation. We hypothesized that if Zif268 was involved in the reconsolidation of OIC memory traces in PRH, the infusion of ASO would disrupt the reconsolidation of the memory traces labilized during test 1. During test 2, the VEH/ASO group showed amnesia only for the congruent object, while the MDL/ASO group showed amnesia for both the congruent and incongruent objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The effect of ASO on test 2 cannot be explained by an effect of the ASO in memory retrieval during test 1, as in this instance, the VEH/ASO performance was similar to that of the VEH/MSO group (Unpaired t test, mean<sub>VEH/MSO</sub> = 0.2484 ± 0.04714, mean<sub>VEH/ASO</sub> = 0.2767 ± 0.04341, p=0.6664, t = 0.4430). This result indicates that expression of Zif268 is necessary for object memory reconsolidation in PRH.

We evaluated two characteristics highly relevant to the process we were studying, novelty during the retrieval session and effective memory reactivation during retrieval. In the first experiment, rats were trained as before, but test 1 consisted of exposure to two copies of a congruent object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Immediately after, half of the animals were injected with EME and half with VEH into PRH. Both groups exhibited comparable memory retention for the congruent object during test 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), indicating that a contextual mismatch between what has been experienced during training and what is present during test 1 is required for labilization/reconsolidation of object memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hupbach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pedreira et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sevenster et al., 2014</xref>). In a second experiment, we compared memory retention during test 2 in rats that were exposed to the OIC paradigm (reactivation condition) and rats that at the time of the test 1 were returned to their homecages and thus memory retrieval was not engaged (homecage condition). Immediately after test 1 (for the reactivation condition) or 24 hr after training (for the homecage condition), the animals were infused with EME or VEH into PRH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

Context-guided retrieval is one of the main characteristics of episodic memory. However, little is known about the consequences of contextual reactivation on memory reconsolidation across different structures. If retrieval of object memories in the OIC task is context-guided, this task would be extremely relevant for the study of episodic memory reconsolidation. Thus, we propose that contextual information is an important cue for reactivation of relevant object memories in the PRH. To test this hypothesis, animals were trained in the OIC task but during test 1 they were exposed to a familiar empty context in which objects A or B were experienced during training. We found that infusion of EME into PRH immediately after exposure to the context alone (test 1) was enough to cause amnesia for the contextually congruent object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, right panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), but not for the incongruent object in test 2. This result suggests that the context cue can drive the labilization of the memory for objects previously associated with it, and that retrieval and reactivation of object memories in PRH is context-guided. If contextual information is used to guide retrieval, then presentation of the objects in a context not experienced before should not be sufficient for reactivation of object memories in PRH. To test this hypothesis, we first habituated rats to a third context different from the other two (trained contexts) and trained them in the OIC as before. During test 1, we presented a copy of each of object A and object B in this third familiar context in which no objects were experienced. Immediately after test 1, we infused EME in the PRH and 24 hr later we evaluated the memory for both objects in test 2. As predicted, infusion of EME into the PRH after test 1 did not produce any deficit in memory retention for any of the objects during test 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

This result could be caused, for example, by failure to process the context correctly, that is the animals could be misremembering having seen the incongruent object in the context used for test 1. If this were true, infusion of MDL would allow reactivation and reconsolidation of the incongruent object even if it was absent during test 1. Thus, we designed a similar experiment in which animals were trained as described before but the incongruent object was swapped for a novel object during test 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). We found that both groups, independently of the manipulation of the mPFC spent more time exploring the novel object compared with the congruent object during test 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, left panel). Infusion of EME immediately after test 1 blocked the reconsolidation of the congruent trace independently of the infusion of MDL or vehicle in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, right panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), but had no effect on the reconsolidation of the incongruent object. This result suggests that in the absence of the incongruent object, serotoninergic modulation of mPFC 5-HT2aR was not necessary to solve the task. mPFC 5-HT2aR signaling might have a selective role in conditions in which correct retrieval is the consequence of recognizing a particular combination of an object and a context.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>5-HT2aR blockade in the mPFC has no effect on reconsolidation of the OIC memory traces in the dorsal hippocampus</title><p>Classically, the hippocampus has been involved in different memory tasks that depend on contextual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eichenbaum, 2017c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Izquierdo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Warburton and Brown, 2015</xref>). Pharmacological studies indicate that the functionality of the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) is required for the correct resolution of the OIC task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bekinschtein et al., 2013</xref>). Also, protein synthesis in the CA1 region of the hippocampus has been shown to be necessary for object recognition memory reconsolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Balderas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clarke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Radiske et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rossato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sachser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Winters et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that 5-HT2aR activation could modulate reconsolidation in the dorsal CA1 region of the HPC (dCA1), as it did in PRH. We bilaterally implanted cannulae in mPFC and dCA1. As expected, MDL infusion into mPFC before test 1 impaired performance in the OIC task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, left panel). However, blockade of dCA1 protein synthesis after test 1 affected memory retention for the incongruent object without impairing the retention of the congruent object. This effect was independent of the blockade of mPFC 5-HT2aR. Unexpectedly, our result suggests that the incongruent, but not the congruent, trace is reactivated in the dCA1 during test 1 in a mPFC 5-HT2aR-independent way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, right panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Similar to that observed for the infusion of EME in the PRH, the infusion of this drug in the dHPC appears to affect the reconsolidation; however, in this case, the reconsolidation of the incongruent object (B). If, as we predicted, the effect of EME is the blockade of reconsolidation, then rats would lose the ability to remember the association between the objects and the previously familiar context, showing enhanced exploration of object B. We analyzed the exploratory time between VEH and EME groups for objects A and B. We found enhanced exploration of object B in the EME group compared with the VEH group, indicating that EME-infused animals had effectively forgotten object B and not that they were treating the novel object as familiar. We also evaluated some of the conditions required for OIC reconsolidation in dHPC. We trained animals in the OIC task and, during test 1, we exposed the rats to two copies of the congruent object and infused EME or VEH in dCA1 immediately after.

If contextual information is not stored in the mPFC, then it should be accessible to it from other areas such as the hippocampus. However, the ventral but not the dorsal hippocampus has direct unidirectional connections with mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Swanson et al., 1978</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that the pathway vHPC-mPFC could be important to provide contextually relevant information to the mPFC during test 1, required to solve the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>). To test whether this direct connection played a role in the control of memory retrieval and reconsolidation in the OIC, we combined muscimol (MUS) or VEH infusions into the ventral CA1 (vCA1) right before test 1 with EME or VEH infusions into the PRH immediately after test 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Silencing the vCA1 region during test 1 resulted in reconsolidation of the congruent and incongruent memory traces, while when the vCA1 region was active, only the congruent memory trace was sensitive to EME infusion. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Importantly, if animals were trained in SNOR, which does not require integration of object and context, blockade of vCA1 activity had no effect on memory retention in test 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). This set of results indicates that vCA1 activity is necessary during retrieval for discrimination between the congruent and incongruent objects, but not for object recognition per se. As vCA1 sends direct, mostly ipsilateral, connections to the mPFC (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vertes, 2006</xref>]), we postulated that both structures might be serially connected for the control of object-context memory retrieval and reconsolidation in the PRH. We performed a disconnection experiment on the vCA1 and mPFC circuit, combined with EME infusions into the PRH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We had two predictions: first, inactivation of vCA1 and blockade of 5-HT2aR in the mPFC ipsilaterally before test 1 should not produce any memory impairment during retrieval. On the other hand, contralateral inhibition of these structures should cause memory impairment in test 1. Second, if vCA1 and mPFC were interacting during retrieval in test 1 to control memory reactivation and reconsolidation, ipsi or contralateral manipulation of the structures would produce distinct patterns of amnesia in PRH during test 2. Rats were infused ipsi- or contralaterally with MDL in the mPFC and MUS in the vCA1 immediately before test 1. All animals were bilaterally infused with EME in the PRH immediately after test 1. We found that ipsilateral blockade of 5-HT2aR signaling and vCA1 activity had no effect on retrieval of OIC task during test 1. However, when the same manipulation was done contralaterally, the congruent and incongruent objects were explored equally, indicating a memory deficit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, left panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Our main findings are that (1) OIC memories reconsolidate at least in two structures, PRH and dCA1; (2) context guides reconsolidation of object memories in PRH and this process is sensitive to mPFC 5-HT2aR modulation; (3) context-guided reconsolidation of object memories in dCA1 is independent of mPFC 5-HT2aR activation; (4) Zif268 is required for context-guided reconsolidation of object memories in both structures; and (5) functional interaction between vCA1 and mPFC is necessary during retrieval to control context-guided reconsolidation in PRH.</p><p>Reconsolidation is defined as a post-retrieval restabilization process that shares important characteristics with the stabilization of memories that occur shortly after acquisition.Reconsolidation has been proposed as a mechanism for memory updating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Although human studies have shown reconsolidation-related changes in declarative memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Forcato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wymbs et al., 2016</xref>), most non-human animal studies of reconsolidation have focused on emotional memories (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Careaga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kroes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2017</xref>]). Only recently have researchers started to analyze the characteristics of reconsolidation of recognition memories in animals. In the OIC task, we observed that the animals distributed their exploratory behavior toward the contextually incongruent object during test 1. This suggests that they can recognize the identity of the objects but also the context in which they were presented. These complex and probably simultaneous assessments might require the combined activity of different brain structures, including the PRH, HPC and PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arias et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bachevalier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eichenbaum, 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kinnavane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Lee, 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The PRH has been proposed as a region where complex objects representations are stored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Albasser et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olarte-Sánchez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buckley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bussey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schultz et al., 2015</xref>), and it is particularly relevant for familiarity discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown and Banks, 2015</xref>). The HPC is required for storage and processing of spatial information, and is a key structure for integration of object-context information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eichenbaum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton et al., 2012</xref>). We found that in the OIC task, reconsolidation occurs at least in the PRH and dCA1. However, the memory feature reactivated and reconsolidated in these structures, appears to be different. The memory of the contextually incongruent object is reconsolidated in the dHPC, suggesting that contextual novelty is sufficient to labilize the memory trace in this region. On the other hand, the simultaneous presentation of the familiar object or only the context in which it was presented is enough to labilize the congruent memory trace in the PRH, suggesting that this region can rely on contextual information to selectively reactivate a particular object memory trace associated with that context. The differences observed in the type of information reconsolidated in each structure indicate that different features of episodic memories might be updated through this process in different brain regions. These results are in agreement with previous work in which it was shown that the hippocampus responds to spatial cues (object B would trigger a contextual missmatch), while PRH responds to the single objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton et al., 2012</xref>)</p><p>Many studies support a role for mPFC in memory through cognitive or strategic control over memory retrieval in other brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hernandez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>). During episodic memory retrieval, contextual cues are important to establish the trace dominance in the face of competition for retrieval resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eichenbaum, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farovik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee and Lee, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Livne and Bar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>). In the OIC task, the congruent memory appears to be the most relevant to solve the task while the incongruent memory trace could somehow interfere with retrieval by activating a different episode. Changes in the behavioral response observed after mPFC 5-HT2aR blockade suggest that this receptor could be involved in the selection of the dominant trace during retrieval and this could, in turn, affect context-guided reconsolidation of object memory traces. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that mPFC 5-HT2aR blockade affected the reconsolidation pattern in the PRH but not in the dCA1, suggesting that serotonin modulation of mPFC function can exert direct top-down control on memory retrieval and reconsolidation in PRH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Our results suggest that engagement of mPFC appears to be a selective mechanism that occurs only when previously known information (e.g. objects A and B) is simultaneously presented but does not participate if the retrieval cues are linked to a single episode, such as when only a novel object is presented. This suggests that the reported modulation of mPFC activity was specific to discrimination between a congruent and an incongruent OIC, but not between a familiar (congruent) and a novel object. Although we cannot conclude from this set of results that this occurs because of the presence of competing episodes, a prediction that could be tested in future is that as the similarity of the episodes increases, so does 5-HT2aR modulation of the mPFC during retrieval.</p><p>It has been previously shown that Zif268 is necessary during both memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jones et al., 2001</xref>) and reconsolidation of SNOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bozon et al., 2003</xref>) using mice that are genetically deficient for this protein. In this work we decided to test whether Zif268 was also involved in the context-guided reconsolidation of object memories in PRH and HPC. Blockade of Zif268 expression in PRH and HPC recapitulated the deficits observed in the same structures using a broad protein synthesis inhibitor, suggesting that Zif268 might be part of the main mechanism involved in reconsolidation within these structures. Interestingly, infusion of MDL in mPFC before memory reactivation allowed the contextually incongruent trace to also be susceptible to Zif268-ASO infusion in the PRH. Then, Zif268 appears to belong to the core transcription mechanism of reconsolidation. Also, to our knowledge, our work is the first to identify a role for Zif268 during reconsolidation in PRH. Our results suggest that a similar transcriptional mechanism mediates reconsolidation for the OIC task in the HPC and PRH.</p><p>The effect observed on reconsolidation is 5-HT2a mediated, as the pattern of object memory reconsolidation in H<italic>tr2a-/-</italic> mice was similar to that observed by acute blockade of mPFC 5-HT2aR in rats. This result indicates that if there were a functional compensatory mechanism, this would not be sufficient to reverse the retrieval/reconsolidation deficit in the OIC. Importantly, these experiments specify that our pharmacological approach selectively disrupts 5-HT2aR signaling. Diffuse serotonin axons innervate and modulate PFC activity through excitatory and inhibitory receptors throughout the laminar organization of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lesch and Waider, 2012</xref>), generating complex modulation of PFC function. Slice electrophysiological experiments indicate that one possible mechanism by which this could occur is by modulating the gain of mPFC neurons. Interestingly, 5-HT2aR principal neurons in the cortex are predominantly colossal cells that project to other cortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Avesar and Gulledge, 2012</xref>), suggesting that they might have a rapid and direct effect on downstream cortical regions. Although our experiments do not address how blocking 5-HT2aR might be affecting context-guided retrieval, we could hypothesize that blocking 5-HT2aR during retrieval might alter the gain modulation of the cells and also the oscillation activity of the system, altering the output to target structures such as the PRH. Independently of the mechanism involved, the blockade of one particular serotonergic receptor, the 5-HT2aR, is enough to change the ability of the mPFC to correctly control context-guided retrieval when conflicting information is presented.</p><p>To control context-guided retrieval in PRH, mPFC might require to access or encode contextual information. Recent evidence suggests there is a bidirectional flow of information between the mPFC and the HPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eichenbaum, 2017b</xref>), wherein the events that initiate prefrontal control over memory retrieval may arise from the ventral part of the HPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>). According to this scenario, environmental cues that define the context are processed by the ventral HPC. This context-defining information could be sent via direct projections to mPFC where neuronal ensembles would develop distinct representations. When subjects subsequently experience the same context, contextual information presented during retrieval would activate a more specific ensemble in mPFC to select the appropriate context representations in the dorsal HPC, while also suppressing context-inappropriate memories.</p><p>This model predicts that mPFC requires information from vHPC when animals are exposed to contextual relevant cues to control memory retrieval. Our results indicate that vHPC interacts with mPFC to control memory context-guided retrieval and reconsolidation in PRH, suggesting that both structures process information in series rather than as part of a parallel information circuit. Based on the direct unidirectional connection between vHPC and mPFC, we hypothesized that during test 1, vHPC provides contextual relevant information to the mPFC that is compared with previously acquired information to select the most relevant trace and control memory retrieval in PRH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although our data do not support this directly, it is plausible that dHPC is the key area in which context and object information is assembled into a coherent trace. In our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bekinschtein et al., 2013</xref>), we showed that mPFC 5-HT2aR activity interacts with dHPC to solve the OIC task. Combining these data with our most recent findings, we can speculate that mPFC-dHPC interaction occurs through an indirect pathway involving PRH and vHPC. Thus, the contextual information that probably integrates spatial and object information is used to control memory reactivation in the PRH. When the animals were presented with information requiring integration of object and contextual features, mPFC would interact with PRH, controlling the strength of object memory expression. In the absence of 5-HT2aR signaling, the interaction between mPFC and PRH is severed and so is context-guided retrieval and reconsolidation in the PRH. This is observed as a deficit in behavioral discrimination as well as in the labilization of object traces in PRH. This lack of retrieval selectivity has a durable effect on long-term memory, leading to persistent changes of the original memory traces.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33746.009</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of functional connectivity of some of the structures involved in the retrieval and reconsolidation of OIC.</title><p>mPFC and vCA1 interaction is required to control object memory trace retrieval and reconsolidation in PRH.

For experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3a, c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a and c</xref>, animals were reintroduced to context 1 or context 2 and were allowed to explore for 3 min one copy of object A and one copy of object B (OIC version). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5b</xref>, animals were reintroduced to one of the contexts and were allowed to explore a copy of object A or object B (depending on the retrieval context) and one copy of a new object, spontaneous novel object recognition version (SNOR version). In experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, animals were exposed for 3 min to one copy of object A and one copy of object B in a third context, previously habituated but not used during the training session (not-associated version). For the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, rats were exposed to context 1 or 2 but in this case without objects (context-only version) or with two copies of object A or B, depending on the retrieval context used (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4b</xref>, no-novelty version).

For sample and test phases, we analyzed the total exploration time for every copy of the objects in each session. For the test sessions we also calculated the Discrimination Index (DI). In test 1, the DI was calculated as t<sub>incongruent</sub> – t<sub>congruent</sub>/total exploration (time exploring the congruent +incongruent objects) of the session. In the particular case in which during test 1 animals were exposed to a novel object instead of an incongruent, then the DI was calculated as t<sub>novel</sub>– t<sub>congruent</sub>/total exploration In test 2 a DI for each of the trials was calculated as t<sub>novel</sub>– t<sub>familiar</sub>/total exploration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Criteria of exclusion</title><p>Animals that explored the objects for less than 5 s during any of the phases were excluded from the experiments. Once the animals recovered from surgery the behavioral procedure started. Rats were run in groups of 8–10 per week and randomly assigned to each experimental group at the beginning of the experiment. So, all conditions within an experiment were run simultaneously. For example, for experiment 1a rats were divided between the Veh/veh; Veh/Eme; MDL/Veh; MDL/EME. Sample size was determined. Overall, 29 rats and 18 mice were excluded based on this criterion (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>As a result of the loss of 12 video recordings from the experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, we excluded those animals from all the data and analysis presented. One mouse was excluded from the analysis because its was H<italic>tr2a+/-</italic>.</p><p>Exploration times for test 1 or test 2 that were outside the confidence interval (mean ± 2 SD) were considered to be outliers and excluded from the sample. None of the animals were excluded based on this criterion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunoblot assays</title><p>PFC and HIP tissue punches were homogenized with a micropestle in an ice-chilled buffer (20 mM Tris-HCL [pH 7.4], 0.32 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 15 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml bacitracin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 15 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 50 mM NaF, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate). Samples of homogenates (10 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gels) under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred onto PDVF membranes in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 10% v/v methanol) for 16 hr at 40V and 4°C. Western blots were performed by incubating membranes first with anti-Zif268 antibody (C19, rabbit polyclonal IgG, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA), then stripped and incubated with anti-actin antibody (C-11, goat polyclonal IgG, 1:10000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA). The ECF system was used for chemifluorescent immunodetection. Western blots were quantified using ImageJ software (Version 1.51 k, NIH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad 6.01.

No significant differences in total exploration between treatments were observed for any of the experiments. Differences between exploratory time for objects A and B were observed in all vehicle- and in some of the MDL-treated groups across experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), suggesting that the experimental procedures had no deleterious effect on the subjects' exploratory behavior but it did affect their discrimination in a task-specific manner. Total exploratory time during test session 2 is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. No significant differences in total exploration for any of the sessions that conform to test 2 were observed for any of the experiments, with the exception of the EME group described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We would like to thank Dr Lionel Muller Igaz, Dr Emiliano Merlo and Dr Juan Belforte for their critical reading and comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor with Richard Ivry coordinating the process as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Karim Nader (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper presents results from a comprehensive set of experiments examining mechanisms of object-in-context memory reconsolidation. The key finding is that 5-HT2a receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex modulate reconsolidation of memories in the perirhinal cortex. The reviewers agreed that these findings were potentially interesting and important. However, the reviewers also felt that the manuscript suffered from a lack of clarity throughout all sections, including a lack of a clear setup of the rationale for the studies in the Introduction (with citations to relevant prior work). It is essential for the authors to improve the presentation of their Results to ensure that the paper can be read and understood by a broad audience. Most critically, reviewers also agreed that a key analysis is missing, an analysis that is needed to substantiate the study's conclusions. Specific comments are detailed below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors' main conclusions are obscured by only reporting discrimination ratios during exploratory behavior. The interpretation of spontaneous exploration-based behaviors requires that raw values of exploration of incongruent and congruent objects be reported across all phases of the task. Specifically, the authors claim that the experimental manipulations after test 1 block the reconsolidation of the congruent object (A). If this is the case, then animals are 'forgetting' that they have experienced object A in the familiar context previously. This would be associated with enhanced exploration of object A. Thus, for example, during test 2 if the authors were to compare exploration of object A for rats that received emetine (EME) versus those rats that received vehicle, the EME group should have enhanced exploration relative to the vehicle control. Without a comparable analysis being performed, it is conceivable that the EME effect was due to this drug making the rat/mouse behave as if the novel object in test 2 was familiar. This possibility cannot be eliminated by presentation of the discrimination index alone. Another way to rule out this latter possibility would be to compare the exploration times of the novel objects in test 2 (C versus D) to test whether there was a difference in novel object exploration in EME versus vehicle conditions. Without such analyses, the main conclusions of the study are not well-founded.</p><p>2) The rationale for the studies require much better justification. It is unclear why certain studies were done and why others were not. Some restructuring of presentation could help. For example, the 'boundary conditions' experiments could be much better introduced and justified with regard to the processes that they address. In general, there should be a better lead-in to the circuits that will be examined.</p><p>3) Key references to relevant prior work are missing. There is no mention of Aggleton's work on object recognition, although his group has published many studies examining the role of the PRH and HPC that are relevant to this study. In addition, mentions to relevant work by Malcolm Brown should be expanded and elaborated.</p><p>4) There was a lack of a clear explanation of the behavioural/psychological mechanisms that support these data. A few specific examples are as follows. Why is the presentation of the incongruent object critical to induce reconsolidation of the congruent object in the PRH (i.e., is this related to prediction error?)? 5-HT2aR activity was not necessary to solve the OIC task when a comparison was made between a familiar OIC congruent object and a novel object, but was necessary between a familiar OIC congruent object and an incongruent OIC object. This suggests that the reported modulation of mPFC activity was specific to discrimination between a congruent and an incongruent OIC but not between a familiar (congruent) and novel object? Why would this be? Also, the idea of competing episodes is interesting, but it is unclear whether it would depend on the extent of similarity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33746.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors' main conclusions are obscured by only reporting discrimination ratios during exploratory behavior.

The discrimination index as we have calculated is standard in behavioral studies, and used in a number of different behavioral paradigms. However, we understand the reviewers' concerns regarding reporting only the index, as we could be misinterpreting the results. We have now added two additional tables as supplementary information that contain the raw values of the exploration times for the congruent and incongruent objects for the different experiments. We are reporting the data for each phase of the task. Supplementary files 1 and 2 contain the data of test 1 (total exploratory time and times for each object respectively). Supplementary file 3 contains the data of test 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specifically, the authors claim that the experimental manipulations after test 1 block the reconsolidation of the congruent object (A).

As mentioned in response to the previous point, it would indeed be important to differentiate the different alternative explanations for our results. We run this analysis for the two main experiments of the manuscript described in Figure 1A and Figure 4A respectively. We added these analyses as a supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and subsection “5-HT2aR activity in the mPFC modulates recognition memory reconsolidation in the PRH” and subsection “5-HT2aR blockade in the mPFC has no effect on reconsolidation of the OIC memory traces in the dorsal hippocampus”). As the reviewers predicted, the infusion of EME in the PRH after test 1 affected the exploratory time of the objects during test 2, supporting our view that EME is blocking the reconsolidation. In the first experiment in which EME was infused in the PRH, we see a change in the exploration of object A when we compared the EME vs. VEH groups. In the case in which EME was infused in the dHPC, we see differences in the exploratory time for object B (the one that reconsolidates in the dHPC). These results are consistent with what we reported based on the discrimination indexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The rationale for the studies require much better justification.

We made significant changes to the text to better address the rationale behind the experiments we performed. Regarding the boundary condition section we emphasized the rationale behind the experiments performed: i.e. since to our knowledge this is the first study analyzing reconsolidation of the OIC task, we wanted to control that some important hallmarks of the reconsolidation process were present in the OIC task as they were described for other object recognition task. We clarified this by adding a paragraph in this section (subsection “Boundary conditions for reconsolidation in the OIC task in PRH”)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Key references to relevant prior work are missing.

We apologize for not being comprehensible enough. We now realize that some of the concepts we were trying to present were not clearly presented. We modified the Discussion in order to introduce the topics suggested by the reviewers and to bring forward the main ideas we are trying to make with this manuscript. Briefly, we believe that the different patterns of reconsolidation in the PRH and the dHPC arise because this process is engaged by different types of mismatches. An object novelty engages reconsolidation in PRH, but a contextual mismatch does it for the HPC. In addition, 5HT2aR in the mPFC would be necessary for retrieval and reconsolidation when retrieval cues activate the representation of more than a single episode. Establishing the mechanisms by which 5HT2aR in the mPFC modulates this process will be the goal of future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
