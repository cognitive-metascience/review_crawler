yet the molecular mechanisms by which the Wnt5a-Ror pathway mediates these processes are largely unknown. Using a proteomic screen, we identify the kinesin superfamily protein Kif26b as a downstream target of the Wnt5a-Ror pathway. Wnt5a-Ror, through a process independent of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin-dependent pathway, regulates the cellular stability of Kif26b by inducing its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Through this mechanism, Kif26b modulates the migratory behavior of cultured mesenchymal cells in a Wnt5a-dependent manner. Genetic perturbation of Kif26b function in vivo caused embryonic axis malformations and depletion of primordial germ cells in the developing gonad, two phenotypes characteristic of disrupted Wnt5a-Ror signaling. These findings indicate that Kif26b links Wnt5a-Ror signaling to the control of morphogenetic cell and tissue behaviors in vertebrates and reveal a new role for regulated proteolysis in noncanonical Wnt5a-Ror signal transduction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>noncanonical Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>Ror</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>tissue morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>regulated proteolysis</kwd><kwd>Kif26b</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM119574-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Hsin-Yi Henry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cantú</surname><given-names>Andrea V</given-names></name><name><surname>Jong</surname><given-names>Brigette Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IRG-95-125-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Hsin-Yi Henry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01NS045500-29</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenberg</surname><given-names>Michael E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R21ES023297-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laird</surname><given-names>Diana J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2OD007420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laird</surname><given-names>Diana J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Susman</surname><given-names>Michael W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences or the National Institutes of Health.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Kif26b, a new component of the evolutionarily conserved Wnt5a-Ror signaling pathway, is controlled by regulated proteolysis and plays crucial roles in mediating vertebrate embryonic tissue morphogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Wnt family of extracellular signaling factors orchestrates diverse developmental processes during both embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis. Dysfunction of Wnt signaling has been implicated in many human diseases ranging from congenital birth defects to neoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kikuchi et al., 2012</xref>). Wnt ligands achieve high functional versatility in part by activating multiple biochemically distinct pathways to regulate diverse cell biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Veeman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Semenov et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the well-characterized ‘canonical’ Wnt pathway that signals through the transcription co-regulator β-catenin to induce target gene expression, a subset of Wnts signal independently of this Wnt/β-catenin pathway via ‘noncanonical’ mechanisms to control cytoskeleton-driven morphogenetic events such as directed cell movements, changes in cell polarization and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Veeman et al., 2003</xref>). The best-studied noncanonical Wnt, Wnt5a, is critical for the proper morphogenesis of many tissues throughout the developing embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yamaguchi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bodmer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Laird et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chawengsaksophak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miyoshi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cha et al., 2014</xref>). Dysregulation of Wnt5a signaling leads to birth defects and is associated with multiple pathological processes in the adult including cancer metastasis and inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kurayoshi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Da Forno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yamamoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatt and Malgor, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ford et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Qin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A growing consensus suggests that the Ror family of receptor tyrosine kinases mediates Wnt5a-dependent morphogenetic functions in the developing animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Green et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mikels et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ho et al., 2012</xref>). However, how Wnt5a signaling via Ror receptors affects downstream cellular processes remains poorly understood. In a previous study, we found that among the many biochemical activities previously proposed to be downstream of Wnt5a signaling, only the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic scaffolding protein Dishevelled (Dvl) required the expression of both Wnt5a and Ror proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ho et al., 2012</xref>). This finding suggested that Wnt5a-Ror-dependent phosphorylation of Dvl specifically mediates the biological functions of Wnt5a signaling and led us to propose that Ror and Dvl are key components of the noncanonical Wnt5a pathway. The assignment of these proteins to a common pathway is further supported by the observation that human mutations in <italic>WNT5A</italic>, <italic>ROR2</italic>, <italic>DVL1 and DVL3</italic> can cause Robinow syndrome, a congenital disorder characterized by short-limbed dwarfism and morphological defects in craniofacial and genital structures, demonstrating that the Wnt5a-Ror-Dvl pathway regulates morphogenesis during human development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afzal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Bokhoven et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Person et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bunn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">White et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">2016</xref>). However, since the function of Dvl phosphorylation is not clear, and Dvl is a common component of several signaling pathways including the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, how the Wnt5a-Ror pathway signals to carry out its biological functions remains incompletely understood.</p><p>In this study, we conducted a whole phosphoproteome-scale mass spectrometric screen comparing wild-type cells with cells lacking the Ror family of proteins in an effort to identify additional effectors of Wnt5a-Ror signaling. The screen identified a number of candidate proteins whose levels or phosphorylation status was influenced by Wnt5a-Ror signaling, including factors involved in cytoskeletal regulation and cell adhesion, processes crucial for the morphogenesis of tissues. We then focused the remainder of the study on characterizing Kif26b, a member of the kinesin microtubule motor superfamily, which stood out as a particularly promising target of Wnt5a-Ror signaling for the following reasons. Mutations in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs of <italic>Ror</italic> and <italic>Kif26b</italic> produce similar neuronal migration and axon guidance phenotypes, suggesting that these molecules might function in a common molecular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wightman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Forrester et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, recent studies demonstrated that Kif26b plays crucial roles in regulating cytoskeleton-driven processes, including cell migration, polarization and adhesion, raising the possibility that Kif26b could function specifically as a cytoskeletal effector of the Wnt5a-Ror pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Uchiyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guillabert-Gourgues et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Through a series of biochemical studies, we demonstrate that Wnt5a-Ror signaling regulates the steady-state abundance of Kif26b in cells via a mechanism involving the ubiquitin-proteasome system that is independent of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin-dependent pathway. Importantly, gain- and loss-of-function experiments in cultured mesenchymal cells indicate that Wnt5a-Ror-Kif26b signaling modulates mesenchymal cell migration. We also find that perturbation of Kif26b function disrupts a number of Wnt5a/Ror-dependent processes in vivo. For example, in developing zebrafish embryos, mis-expression of Kif26b causes axis and craniofacial malformations, thus mirroring the effects of mis-expression of Wnt5a or Ror in zebrafish. In developing mouse embryos, Kif26b expression is required for primordial germ cells to populate the developing gonad, a process that also requires the expression of Wnt5a or Ror proteins. Taken together, these findings establish Kif26b as a downstream effector of the noncanonical Wnt5a-Ror pathway that regulates cell and tissue behaviors during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A phosphoproteomic screen identifies Wnt5a-Ror signaling targets</title><p>We sought to discover downstream effectors of Wnt5a-Ror signaling, as these could provide insight into the biochemical regulation and cell biological functions of the pathway. We reasoned that perturbation of upstream pathway components, such as the Ror receptors, would result in alterations in the biochemical regulation of downstream effectors. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) carrying conditional knockout alleles for the <italic>Ror1</italic> and <italic>Ror2</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ho et al., 2012</xref>) and screened for biochemical changes that occur upon genetic ablation of these genes. We previously showed that embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) MEFs are a useful physiologically-relevant system for studying Wnt5a-Ror signaling. Not only are these cells derived from mesenchymal tissues that undergo active Wnt5a-Ror signaling in vivo, they continue to express high levels of endogenous Wnt5a, Ror1, Ror2 and Dvl proteins in culture and undergo autocrine/paracrine Wnt5a-Ror signaling without the addition of exogenous Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ho et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Using these conditional knockout MEFs, we performed a phosphoproteome-wide mass spectrometric screen to identify Ror-dependent changes in protein phosphorylation and/or abundance. Our reasoning was that since Wnt5a signaling regulates the phosphorylation state of known downstream components of the Wnt5a-Ror pathway, including Ror1, Ror2 and Dvl proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryja et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nishita et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grumolato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ho et al., 2012</xref>) and microarray analysis of primary MEFs lacking both Ror1 and Ror2 proteins failed to identify transcriptional changes relative to wild-type cells, Wnt5a-Ror signaling likely affects cellular functions via a transcription-independent process in MEFs (M.W.S., M.E.G., H.H.H. unpublished data).</p><p>To conduct the screen, we employed tandem mass tag (TMT) technology that enables the characterization and quantification of peptides from six experimental conditions in a single, multiplexed mass spectrometric (MS) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ting et al., 2011</xref>).

For high confidence identification of biochemical changes that are specific to the cells in which the Ror proteins were inducibly knocked out, phosphopeptides categorized as ‘hits’ had to meet the following criteria: (1) an average of ≥2-fold increase or decrease in the abundance of the phosphopeptide in 4-OHT-treated <italic>Ror1<sup>f/f</sup>; Ror2<sup>f/f</sup>; CAG-CreER</italic> MEFs relative to vehicle-treated <italic>Ror1<sup>f/f</sup>; Ror2<sup>f/f</sup>; CAG-CreER</italic> MEFs; (2) a significant fold change (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) across two experimental replicates; and (3) a &lt;2-fold increase or decrease in the abundance of the phosphopeptide in 4-OHT-treated <italic>Ror1<sup>+/+</sup>; Ror2<sup>+/+</sup>; CAG-CreER</italic> MEFs relative to vehicle-treated <italic>Ror1<sup>+/+</sup>; Ror2<sup>+/+</sup>; CAG-CreER</italic> MEFs.

To determine whether Wnt5a-Ror signaling induces the downregulation of Kif26b expression via a noncanonical Wnt signaling mechanism, we tested whether blocking the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway with Dkk-1, an antagonist of the β-catenin-dependent Wnt pathway that binds and prevents the phosphorylation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway co-receptors Lrp5 and Lrp6, inhibits the Wnt5a-induced decrease in Kif26b protein in MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bafico et al., 2001</xref>).

To ensure that the Dkk-1 protein used in the experiment was active, we assessed whether the same concentration of Dkk-1 was capable of blocking signaling by Wnt3a, a prototypic canonical Wnt that induces the phosphorylation of the Wnt receptor Lrp6. We found that Wnt3a-dependent phosphorylation of Lrp6 was completely blocked in the presence of Dkk-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

For this purpose, we used IWR-1, a small molecule that inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling by stabilizing Axin2, a key component of the β-catenin destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2009</xref>).

To more accurately quantify Kif26b levels in live cells, we developed a flow cytometry-based reporter assay using NIH/3T3 cell lines stably expressing a GFP-Kif26b fusion protein. We chose NIH/3T3 cells for the reporter assay because these cells express key components of the Wnt5a-Ror pathway, including Ror1, Ror2, Dvl2 and Kif26b, which we found to be similarly regulated by Wnt5a as in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Furthermore, NIH/3T3 cells are an immortalized cell line derived from mouse embryonic mesenchymal cells that undergo morphogenetic movements during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Todaro and Green, 1963</xref>), and they have been used previously to study cell behaviors in the context of Wnt5a-Ror signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Endo et al., 2012</xref>). Western analysis and immunostaining of these NIH/3T3 cell lines confirmed that the GFP-Kif26b protein is stably expressed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).</p><p>Given that Wnt5a signaling acutely downregulates the level of endogenous Kif26b expression in MEFs, we tested whether Wnt5a similarly downregulates GFP-Kif26b levels in the reporter NIH/3T3 cells.

These results indicate that Wnt5a treatment leads to a decrease in GFP-Kif26b in NIH/3T3 cells similar to that observed for endogenous Kif26b in MEFs, and that the GFP-Kif26b reporter can be used reliably to monitor the decrease in Kif26b protein expression in response to Wnt5a signaling.

Given that exposure of fibroblasts to Wnt5a leads to a decrease in Kif26b expression over minutes to hours but does not lead to a reduction in the level of <italic>Kif26b</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), we favored the latter possibility. To directly measure the rate of Kif26b turnover, we treated WRK reporter cells with cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis and then used flow cytometry to measure the effect of Wnt5a treatment on the rate of GFP-Kif26b turnover. Consistent with the hypothesis that Wnt5a treatment leads to the increased degradation of Kif26b, we found that Wnt5a accelerated the turnover of GFP-Kif26b in the reporter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In the absence of Wnt5a stimulation, 80.2% of the GFP-Kif26b signal remained in the cells 6 hr after the initiation of the cycloheximide treatment. By contrast, in the presence of Wnt5a stimulation, only 33.2% of the GFP-Kif26b signal remained in the same period. These results strongly suggest that Wnt5a treatment leads to a decrease in the steady-state levels of Kif26b expression in cells by promoting Kif26b turnover.</p><p>We next investigated whether Wnt5a downregulates Kif26b expression by increasing the rate of Kif26b degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). To test this hypothesis, we asked whether a selective inhibitor of the proteasome, epoxomicin, blocks downregulation of Kif26b expression in response to Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meng et al., 1999</xref>). Pre-treatment of the WRK reporter line with epoxomicin strongly blocked Wnt5a-induced Kif26b downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>). This result suggests that Wnt5a-induced downregulation of Kif26b occurs via proteasome-dependent degradation.</p><p>To determine whether protein ubiquitination is specifically required for Wnt5a-induced Kif26b degradation, we tested whether an inhibitor of the E1 enzyme required for ubiquitin activation, PYR-41, also blocks Wnt5a-induced Kif26b downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). Pre-treatment of the WRK reporter cells with PYR-41 blocked Wnt5a-induced Kif26b downregulation to an extent similar to that observed upon epoxomicin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). This finding provides further evidence that downregulation of Kif26b expression induced by Wnt5a occurs via the UPS. We conclude from these results that exposure to Wnt5a leads to the downregulation of the steady-state levels of Kif26b expression by promoting Kif26b ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Frizzled and Dishevelled proteins mediate Wnt5a-induced Kif26b degradation</title><p>Our pharmacological inhibitor experiments suggest that the WRK reporter assay might be used to interrogate other molecular components of the Wnt5a-Ror signaling pathway that operate upstream of Kif26b. To test this idea, we first investigated a possible role of Frizzled (Fzd) proteins in Wnt5a-dependent Kif26b degradation. Fzds make up a family of 10 seven-transmembrane domain receptor proteins that function as co-receptors in canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling and as polarity determinants in the PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vinson and Adler, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhanot et al., 1996</xref>).

Moreover, protein sequence homology analysis and in vivo mouse genetic studies revealed that Fzd1, Fzd2 and Fzd7 form a distinct sub-family that functions redundantly to control tissue morphogenetic events such as convergent extension of embryonic tissues and closure of the palate and ventricular septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). As many of these developmental processes also require the Wnt5a-Ror pathway, we hypothesized that certain Fzd proteins, such as those in the Fzd1, Fzd2 and Fzd7 sub-family, might participate in Wnt5a-Ror-Kif26b signaling.</p><p>To test whether Fzd proteins mediate Wnt5a-Ror-Kif26b signaling, we first took a loss-of-function approach using Shisa proteins, which are Wnt signaling regulators that inhibit Fzd processing and trafficking by sequestering Fzds in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yamamoto et al., 2005</xref>). We found that viral transduction of Shisa2 expression, but not Cas9 expression as a control, partially blocked the ability of Wnt5a to induce Kif26b degradation in the WRK reporter cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>).

We first focused on members of the Fzd1, Fzd2 and Fzd7 sub-family, as the mouse knockout phenotypes of these Fzds are most consistent with a functional interaction with the Wnt5a-Ror pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, we found that lentiviral transduction of Fzd1 or Fzd7 expression, but not of the negative control Cas9, constitutively induced Kif26b degradation as measured in the WRK assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). This finding, taken together with the decreased Wnt5a-Ror-Kif26b signaling upon expression of the Fzd inhibitor Shisa2, strongly suggests that Fzd family proteins are involved in Wnt5a regulation of Kif26b degradation, possibly as co-receptors together with members of the Ror family of proteins.</p><p>We also considered the possibility that functional specificity might exist among the different Fzd sub-families. We therefore used the WRK assay to test multiple members from each Fzd sub-family, as defined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, we found that all the Fzd family members that we tested were able to induce Kif26b degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, it is possible that the specificity of Fzd protein function is lost when these proteins are overexpressed.</p><p>We next investigated the role of Dvl proteins in Wnt5a-Ror-dependent Kif26b degradation. Our previous study identified Dvl phosphorylation as a specific downstream target of Wnt5a-Ror signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ho et al., 2012</xref>), and a recent study demonstrated that the Dvl and Kif26b proteins physically interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guillabert-Gourgues et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, we found that Wnt5a-induced Kif26b degradation occurs with similar kinetics as Wnt5a-induced Dvl phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether Dvl proteins are required for Wnt5a-dependent degradation of Kif26b. Since the presence of three <italic>Dvl</italic> genes in the mammalian genome makes loss-of-function analysis of Dvl proteins challenging, we took a gain-of-function approach to determine if Dvl protein expression affects Wnt5a-Ror-dependent Kif26b degradation. Notably, a similar overexpression approach was previously used to demonstrate a role for Dvl proteins in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, as overexpression of Dvl proteins in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos induces axis duplication recapitulating overexpression of canonical Wnts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sokol et al., 1995</xref>). Using the WRK reporter assay, we found that overexpression of Dvl1, but not overexpression of a control protein Cas9, led to an increase in Kif26b degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>), mimicking the effects of Wnt5a stimulation or Fzd overexpression. Taken together, these findings establish a functional role for both Fzd receptors and Dvl1 (and likely other Dvl proteins) in Wnt5a-Ror-dependent Kif26b degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The Wnt5a-Ror-Kif26b signaling cassette directs the migratory behavior of cells</title><p>Genetic studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have shown that mutations in the nematode orthologs of <italic>Kif26b</italic> (<italic>vab-8</italic>) and <italic>Ror</italic> (<italic>cam-1</italic>) cause similar polarized cell migration and axon guidance phenotypes, and a recent study in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) demonstrates a physical interaction between Kif26b and Dvl3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Forrester et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wolf et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chien et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guillabert-Gourgues et al., 2016</xref>). These findings, together with the observations reported above, raise the possibility that the cell biological effects of noncanonical Wnt signaling are mediated by the Wnt5a-Ror-dependent degradation of Kif26b. To test this hypothesis, we employed both gain- and loss-of-function approaches in cultured NIH/3T3 cells, the same cells used for the WRK assays. Western analysis of the NIH/3T3 cell lines used in the WRK assay showed that GFP-tagged Kif26b protein is overexpressed relative to endogenous Kif26b in NIH/3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that these cells could be used to assess the effects of Kif26b overexpression on cell responses. For examining the effects of loss of Kif26b expression on cellular responses in NIH/3T3 cells, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to generate stable cell lines in which the expression of <italic>Kif26b</italic> is knocked out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Western blot analysis verified complete elimination of Kif26b protein relative to a control cell line expressing the Cas9 endonuclease without a guide RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We next confirmed that neither GFP-Kif26b overexpression nor loss of Kif26b affects cell proliferation or survival through mitotic index quantification and TUNEL staining, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>), indicating that these NIH/3T3 cell lines could be used to study other possible Kif26b-dependent cellular responses.</p><p>We employed an automated kinetic wound-healing assay that provides a quantitative, integrated readout of cell morphogenesis such as cell polarization, cell motility and cell adhesion by measuring the wound closure efficiency of cells under different experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gujral et al., 2014a</xref>).

These studies, taken together with the findings in mammalian cells described in this article, suggest that Wnt5a, Ror and Kif26b proteins may function as part of an evolutionarily conserved pathway that orchestrates morphogenetic processes during the development of tissues.</p><p>Further evidence suggesting Kif26b may function in noncanonical Wnt signaling came from a recent study that identified Kif26b as a binding partner of Dvl3 in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guillabert-Gourgues et al., 2016</xref>), as Dvl proteins are known targets of Wnt5a-Ror signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ho et al., 2012</xref>).

In addition, we provide further evidence that Fzd and Dvl proteins are shared functional components of both Wnt signaling branches. Collectively, these observations suggest that the Wnt-Fzd-Dvl signaling module is an ancient and conserved feature common to multiple Wnt signaling systems. During evolution of the pathway, different signaling branches appear to have adopted additional regulatory mechanisms to achieve signaling and functional specificity. For example, while the Wnt/β-catenin pathway uses the Lrp5/6 receptors in conjunction with Fzd receptors to transmit a canonical Wnt signal across the plasma membrane, the Wnt5a-Ror pathway uses Ror1/2 receptors, likely also in conjunction with Fzds, to transmit a noncanonical Wnt signal.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26509.028</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of Wnt5a-Ror-Kif26b signaling.</title><p>Schematic of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling (<bold>A</bold>) vs. noncanonical Wnt5a-Ror-Kif26b signaling (<bold>B</bold>).

In the conventional paradigm of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, ligand binding induces receptor dimerization or oligomerization, which in turn enhances the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). This then triggers receptor autophosphorylation and the subsequent recruitment and/or phosphorylation of downstream cellular effectors. Whether the Ror family of receptor tyrosine kinases possesses catalytically active kinase activity, however, is still under debate. It was reported that Wnt5a can stimulate the ability of full-length Ror2 to phosphorylate a GST-Ror2 kinase domain fusion protein on tyrosine residue(s) in vitro, and that mutagenesis of conserved tyrosine residues within the tyrosine kinase regulatory loop of Ror2 impairs the protein’s ability to repress canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mikels et al., 2009</xref>). Ror1 and Ror2, however, are known to harbor substitutions at amino acid residues generally believed to be critical for normal kinase function, and recent biochemical and structural studies have further suggested that the Ror proteins are pseudokinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gentile et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mendrola et al., 2013</xref>). In our phosphoproteomic study, we identified nine distinct Kif26b phosphorylation sites on eight unique phosphopeptides, and all these sites mapped to serine or threonine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In general, tyrosine phosphorylation is more dynamic than serine or threonine phosphorylation and tends to be underrepresented in large-scale phosphoproteomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lombardi et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore examined whether Wnt5a-Ror signaling induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Kif26b in NIH/3T3 cells using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody-based affinity pull-down approach. However, under the various experimental conditions tested, we observed no effect of Wnt5a-Ror signaling on the tyrosine phosphorylation of Kif26b (S.S.C. and H.H.H., unpublished data). Thus, whether Ror receptors are active kinases or pseudokinases, and whether Kif26b is a direct substrate of these receptor tyrosine kinases will require further investigation.</p><p>It is also possible that phosphorylation of Kif26b by other cellular kinases is involved in Wnt5a-dependent regulation of Kif26b. Interestingly, a previous study showed that cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylates Kif26b on multiple serine and threonine sites and that these phosphorylation events play a critical role in controlling the stability of Kif26b by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Terabayashi et al., 2012</xref>). It will be important in future studies to test whether these mechanisms, as well as the additional phosphorylation sites identified in our proteomic screens, are required for Wnt5a regulation of Kif26b degradation.</p><p>The functional interplay between Ror and Fzd receptors is also currently unclear. We have demonstrated that overexpression of Fzd family members is sufficient to induce Kif26b degradation in NIH/3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Overexpression of Ror2, however, does not have the same effect (E.P.K. and H.H.H., unpublished observation). These observations raise the possibility that Fzd proteins may function as the signaling receptors, while Ror proteins may play a modulatory role. This model is also consistent with our observation that even though endogenously expressed Wnt5a requires Ror1 and Ror2 expression to downregulate levels of Kif26b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>), high concentrations of exogenously added Wnt5a can induce Kif26b degradation in Ror1 and Ror2 double knockout MEFs (M.W.S., M.E.G. and H.H.H., unpublished data), suggesting that Wnt5a can signal through receptors other than Rors. A deeper understanding of how Ror and Fzd proteins mediate Wnt5a-Kif26b signaling will require additional biochemical, structural and functional studies.</p><p>Our study also directly implicates Dvl proteins in promoting Kif26b degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>) and further suggests a broader role for Dvl in regulating the stability of Wnt signaling effectors. Interestingly, during canonical Wnt signaling, Dvl functions to <italic>inhibit</italic> the degradation of β-catenin, whereas during noncanonical Wnt5a signaling, Dvl functions to <italic>induce</italic> the degradation of Kif26b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). How Dvl transmits pathway-specific signals remains to be elucidated, but it likely involves differential post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, differential protein-protein interactions, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wallingford and Habas, 2005</xref>). The identification of Kif26b as a specific target of Dvl in the noncanonical Wnt signaling branch provides a new inroad to address this important question.</p><p>There is also emerging evidence that noncanonical Wnt signaling may function more generally to regulate the degradation of multiple proteins. For instance, Wnt5a signaling can induce the degradation of the cell adhesion receptor Syndecan 4 via the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carvallo et al., 2010</xref>), and noncanonical Wnt5a and Wnt11 signaling has been associated with the proteasomal degradation of the focal adhesion molecule Paxillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kurayoshi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iioka et al., 2007</xref>). It is possible that Wnt5a downregulates multiple effector molecules to affect the shape and behavior of cells in a variety of cell types and developmental contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cellular and developmental functions of Kif26b</title><p>Data from our wound-healing assay suggest that one function of the Wnt5a-Ror-Kif26b axis is to modulate the migration of cells via Wnt5a-dependent degradation of Kif26b. How might Kif26b function at a subcellular level to affect cell migration? Mesenchymal cell migration typically involves four reiterative steps: protrusion of the leading edge, formation and maturation of focal adhesions, forward translocation of the cell body and finally retraction and de-adhesion of the trailing edge. Using the GFP-Kif26b NIH/3T3 cell line, we observed that the Kif26b protein is predominantly localized to the trailing edge of the cell, which is most consistent with a role of Kif26b in promoting trailing edge de-adhesion and/or retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This model is supported by a previously reported binding interaction between Kif26b and Myosin IIb, a key regulator of cell trailing edge de-adhesion and contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Uchiyama et al., 2010</xref>). It may also explain why Wnt5a has been reported in some studies to promote, while in others to suppress, cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kremenevskaja et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dissanayake et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nomachi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Enomoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McDonald and Silver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Prasad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Connacher et al., 2017</xref>). It is well established that a delicate balance of cell adhesive and contractile activities dictates the manner by which cells migrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parsons et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huttenlocher and Horwitz, 2011</xref>). Moreover, this balance is likely to be different in different cell types and subject to further regulation by the extracellular environments to which the cells are exposed. Thus, if the primary function of the Wnt5a-Kif26b signaling axis is to modulate the strength of cell adhesion and/or contractility at the trailing edge, it could potentially manifest in opposing cell migratory behaviors depending on the cell types and the culture conditions used in a given study. Higher resolution imaging studies capable of directly measuring cell adhesion dynamics and contractile forces will be crucial to understanding how Kif26b functions at the trailing edge of the cell, or at other subcellular locations, to affect cell migration.</p><p>Although we have shown in a wound-healing assay that higher Kif26b levels promote the migration of NIH/3T3 cells and that Wnt5a signaling negatively regulates the migratory behavior of these cells via the degradation of Kif26b, it is likely that the signaling dynamics of the Wnt5a-Ror-Kif26b pathway are actually considerably more complex in vivo. During embryogenesis, migration and other morphogenetic processes must occur in a highly choreographed fashion where signals that promote and restrict cell movements are finely tuned in time and space. It is therefore possible that the relatively modest Wnt5a-dependent alteration of Kif26b levels we observed in vitro, as measured across entire cell populations, does not accurately reflect the dynamic regulation of the pathway that occurs during the development of tissues. The function of the Wnt5a-Ror pathway may not be simply to degrade Kif26b constitutively within a cell or tissue, but rather to tune the activity of Kif26b with a high degree of temporospatial resolution to achieve proper tissue morphogenesis. Indeed, cells are known to integrate and amplify shallow spatial gradients of extracellular cues into robust changes in behaviors, such as during axon pathfinding and neutrophil chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">von Philipsborn and Bastmeyer, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The in vivo significance of Kif26b in noncanonical Wnt5a-Ror function is demonstrated by our gene perturbation experiments. Disruption of Kif26b expression, whether by mis-expression in zebrafish or by loss-of-function gene ablation in mouse embryos, results in developmental defects that are similar to those observed when Wnt5a or Ror expression is perturbed. These findings, taken together with the observation that loss-of-function <italic>cam-1</italic> and <italic>vab-8</italic> mutants in <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibit similar neuronal migration and polarization phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Forrester et al., 1998</xref>), support the model that Wnt5a, Ror and Kif26b comprise a signaling cassette crucial for the morphogenesis of tissues during development. However, it is important to note that while our in vivo experiments focus on comparing the gross morphological phenotypes of <italic>Kif26b, Wnt5a and Ror</italic> mutants, they do not directly demonstrate that the similarities in the observed phenotypes are caused by common underlying mechanisms. Therefore, it remains crucial to characterize the molecular and cellular basis of the <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, <italic>Ror</italic> and <italic>Kif26b</italic> mutant phenotypes, which will further establish the functional interactions among these molecules.</p><p>It is notable that genetic loss-of-function perturbation of Kif26b expression in mice does not closely mimic perturbation of Wnt5a or Ror expression in all developmental contexts. For instance, <italic>Kif26b</italic> knockout mice do not exhibit the global tissue truncation and craniofacial malformation phenotypes seen in <italic>Wnt5a</italic> and <italic>Ror1/2</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yamaguchi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Uchiyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ho et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, <italic>Kif26b</italic> knockout mice fail to elicit sprouting of the ureteric bud, resulting in kidney agenesis or severe kidney hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Uchiyama et al., 2010</xref>), whereas <italic>Wnt5a</italic> or <italic>Ror</italic> knockout mice exhibit duplication of the ureteric bud, resulting in pleiotropic kidney defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nishita et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yun et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>There are a number of explanations that might reconcile these seemingly discordant findings in different biological contexts. First, given the highly complex temporal and spatial dynamics that Wnt5a-Ror-Kif26b signaling likely undergoes in vivo, it becomes difficult to predict the ultimate phenotypes of embryos that constitutively lack the expression of downstream signaling components across development. Second, Kif26b may not be required in all tissues that undergo Wnt5a-Ror signaling during their morphogenesis. It is likely that other effector molecules may compensate for the genetic loss of <italic>Kif26b</italic> in certain developing tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, the closely related <italic>Kif26a</italic> gene is broadly expressed during mouse embryogenesis, and the Kif26a protein is also a target of Wnt5a-Ror signaling (M.K.S., E.P.K., H.H.H. unpublished data). Thus, one plausible explanation is that the developmental requirement of <italic>Kif26b</italic> in tissue extension and craniofacial morphogenesis may be masked by the continued expression of <italic>Kif26a</italic> in <italic>Kif26b</italic> knockout mice. By RT-qPCR, we verified that <italic>Kif26a</italic> mRNA is indeed expressed at appreciable levels in both wild-type and <italic>Kif26b</italic> knockout E12.5 MEFs, although we did not find evidence that <italic>Kif26a</italic> transcription is specifically upregulated in <italic>Kif26b</italic> knockout MEFs (E.P.K. and H.H.H., unpublished data). <italic>Kif26a</italic> single knockout mice also do not exhibit phenotypes typical of noncanonical Wnt5a-Ror signaling defects, instead manifesting with megacolon from enteric nerve hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, discovering the full extent of developmental processes regulated by the Kinesin-11 family of proteins, as well as their functional relationship to the Wnt5a-Ror pathway, awaits a loss-of-function analysis of both <italic>Kif26a</italic> and <italic>Kif26b</italic> together, which may reveal non-overlapping phenotypes not present in either <italic>Kif26a</italic> or <italic>Kif26b</italic> single loss-of-function mutants. Lastly, it is also likely that other signaling branches apart from Kif26b exist within the Wnt5a-Ror pathway, and that these branches control distinct cellular processes that do not require the expression of the Kinesin-11 family of proteins. Thus, building a more complete inventory of the pathway components and understanding how these components interact functionally represents an important direction of future investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mouse strains used in the study were described previously: <italic>Ror1<sup>f/f </sup></italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ho et al., 2012</xref></italic>), <italic>Ror2<sup>f/f</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ho et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>CAG-CreER</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayashi and McMahon, 2002</xref></italic>, stock # 004453, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), <italic>Wnt5a<sup>-/- </sup></italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yamaguchi et al., 1999</xref></italic>, stock # 004758, Jackson Laboratory), and <italic>Kif26b<sup>f/f</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Recuenco et al., 2015</xref>, stock # CDB0800K<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www2.clst.riken.jp/arg/mutant_list_file/CDB0800K.html">, RIKEN CDB, Japan, http://www2.clst.riken.jp/arg/mutant_list_file/CDB0800K.html</ext-link>). <italic>Kif26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were produced by crossing <italic>Kif26b<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice to a ubiquitous Cre deleter line (<italic>EIIA-Cre</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lakso et al., 1996</xref>], stock # 003724, Jackson Laboratory). <italic>Ror1<sup>f/f</sup>, Ror2<sup>f/f</sup></italic> and <italic>CAG-CreER</italic> mice were maintained in a mixed 129 and C57BL/6J background. <italic>Wnt5a<sup>-/-</sup> and Kif26b<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>mice were maintained in a C57BL/6J background.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jeremy Nathans as the Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. One of the three reviewers, Karl Willert, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Three experts reviewed your manuscript, and their assessments, together with my views (Reviewing Editor), form the basis of this letter. As you will see, all of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work.</p><p>I am including the three reviews at the end of this letter, as there are a variety of specific and useful suggestions in them. In discussions among the reviewers, one over-arching point is that the strengths and weaknesses of the in vivo assays need to be made clear. Also, is it possible to specifically look directly at tyrosine phosphorylation of Kif26b? Does Wnt5a lead to an increase of P-Tyr on Kif26b? Such an experiment will not establish a direct link between Ror kinase activity and Kif26b phosphorylation, but it would provide additional insight into the signaling mechanism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This submission from Susman and colleagues provides a very comprehensive story about the role of Kip26b as a key downstream effector of Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling. The work encompasses proteomic screens, cell-based analyses, evaluation of genetically engineered mice, and evaluation of function in a zebrafish model. The comprehensive nature of this analysis provides a high degree of confidence in the overall model presented. However, there are a few questions that should be addressed prior to a decision being made on the manuscript. The most important of these is the nature of Kif26b phosphorylation induced by Wnt5a via Ror1/2.</p><p>1) The work identifying Kif26b as a protein that is differentially phosphorylated (or differentially stabilized) in the absence of Ror1/2 is convincingly presented. However, more information should be provided on what residues are phosphorylated within Kif26b downstream of Ror1/2 activation. Are there phospho-tyrosine residues present in Kif26b that can be identified based on the proteomics screen? Or are the residues responsible phospho-serine or phospho-threonine? There is very little discussion of this in the manuscript and it would seem to be a critical point of information regarding Kif26b stability and the nature of the signal downstream of Ror1/2 and Dvl.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes an elegant set of experiments demonstrating that Kif26b protein stability is regulated by non-canonical Wnt signaling. This is an important piece of work as it provides the first robust biochemical assay of non-canonical Wnt signaling, an assay that has been sorely lacking for many years. As such, this finding will potentially redefine the direction of this field of research, especially since this increased protein turnover in response to Wnt5a-Ror signaling will likely apply to other proteins. Furthermore, the GFP reporter protein developed and characterized here is a powerful tool to monitor non-canonical Wnt signaling activity. Overall, this is an incredibly important finding supported by convincing and clear data.</p><p>There are a number of points that I would like to see addressed by the authors listed here, not in order of priority:</p><p>The result that Wnt3a, just like Wnt5a, leads to a reduction in Kif26b protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) is quite interesting and indicates that one Wnt, in this case &quot;canonical&quot; Wnt3a, can simultaneously activate both pathways. The authors use rDKK1 to block canonical Wnt signaling and this has no effect on the reduction of Kif26b. The authors should extend this experiment by showing that inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling downstream of the Wnt-receptor interaction similarly has no effect on this readout. This can be achieved with tankyrase inhibitors, such as IWR.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>: This experiment shows that inhibition of endogenous Wnt protein secretion with the Porcupine inhibitor C59 leads to an increase in Kif26b, as one would expect for blocking all endogenous Wnt signaling. This is a nice experiment and it should be extended by showing that Porcn inhibition can be rescued with Wnt5a protein. Furthermore, this assay should allow the authors to further address the effect of &quot;canonical&quot; Wnt signaling on Kif26b protein levels; e.g. does Wnt3a, like Wnt5a, reduce Kif26b protein? Does GSK3 inhibition (or const. active β-catenin) reduce Kif26b levels? Such experiments would solidify the claim that the effect on Kif26b is independent of the well-studied Wnt/β-catenin pathway.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>: it looks like shRNA-mediated KD of Kif26b leads to a reduction in Dvl2 phosphorylation. Is that the case? If yes, is there some sort of reciprocal interaction between Kif26b and Dvl-phosphorylation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref> further speak to this possibility. Could the authors address this possibility?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>: It is unclear whether the protein detected here is WT Kif26b or the GFP-Kif26b fusion protein. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> suggests that the majority of detected protein is overexpressed fusion protein, however, can the authors verify this by probing this blot with GFP antibody to only detect the GFP reporter protein?</p><p>In regards to the GFP-Kif26b reporter: with this assay, the authors should be able to narrow down the domain of Kif26b that confers the destabilization effect on GFP. A series of truncations of Kif26b could identify the critical region and provide additional information about the mechanism by which this protein is targeted for degradation by Wnt5a-Ror signaling. Perhaps such experiments are intended for a future publication, but it certainly would be a logical extension that would substantially enhance this current study.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B-E</xref>: Can the authors show GFP-Kif26b protein levels and localization upon Wnt5a stimulation?

There thus is intense interest in their signaling pathways. The components of the canonical β-catenin pathway have largely been identified, but the components of the alternate Wnt signaling pathway mediated by Ror kinases are less clear. Here the authors take a proteomics approach to identify proteins whose abundance or phosphorylation are regulated by Ror kinase signaling. They identify the kinesin Kif26B as a protein whose abundance is negatively regulated by Wnt5a/Ror signaling. They provide clear evidence that this involves targeting it for destruction by the proteasome. They then add some data suggesting possible phenotypic consequences of loss or overexpression of Kif26B. These data provide some support for the idea that may be an effector of non-canonical Wnt signaling, but are less compelling. Overall, I thought the weaknesses significantly reduced my enthusiasm.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1) Strong interest in the pathway in the cell and developmental biology community.</p><p>2) Solid biochemical data in the first half of the paper.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1) The effect of the pathway on Kif26B stability, while clear, was relatively modest (50% reduction).</p><p>2) The biological backup testing the role of Kif26B in Wnt/Ror signaling was less compelling, involving either relatively superficial similarities after over-expression or partial effects after loss-of-function.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) While the proteomic and biochemical data supporting downregulation of Kif26B by Wnt/Ror signaling were clear, the authors should have provided a quantitative assessment of the degree of downregulation-for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> it looks like the effect is only 2-fold but the loading control is very over-exposed so it's difficult to assess. This would have made it clearer that while Kif26B is destabilized by Wnt/Ror signaling, significant levels remain-this is important for determining biological consequences. Similarly, Wnt5a treatment of 3T3 cells also only led to a 50% reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and since Kif26B heterozygous mice are wild-type in phenotype, one wonders how critical this effect would be in vivo. Further, given the β-catenin paradigm, an effort to see if particular subcellular pools of Kif26B were preferentially targeted for destruction would have been revealing.</p><p>2) The loss- and gain-of-function assays were not very sophisticated or mechanistically compelling. The &quot;cell migration assay&quot; was presented simply as quantitation of cell density, with only a single image presented (I would also question whether those fine protrusions seen in that image are &quot;retraction fibers) and without any further analysis of mechanism by which Kif26B might affect this process. The fact that Wnt5a can block the effects of Kif26B overexpression was rather surprising, given that over-expression looked to be 10 fold and Wn5a in other contexts only reduced levels by 50%. They also missed what I view as the best test in this cell line-does Kif26B KO block the effects of Wnt5a on migration. Finally, I would question the idea that NIH 3T3 cells, in culture for 70 years, represent a good model for &quot;mouse embryonic mesenchymal cells that undergo morphogenetic movements during development&quot;. The contrast to the earlier work by others on Kif26B in HUVEC cells was striking-in that work the authors presented abundant cell biological data assessing the mechanisms by which Kif26B regulated cell migration.

The Kif26B knockout mouse has an interesting kidney phenotype, but appears to lack many of the phenotypes of the Wnt5a knockout, and Wnt5a is not the only Wnt with potential non-canonical signaling functions. These data suggest that, at best, Kif26B acts in a subset of tissues. The role of Kif26A, mentioned only in passing, also needs to be considered-it also has a known mouse KO phenotype, also one without a clear Wnt/Ror signaling connection.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26509.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>In discussions among the reviewers, one over-arching point is that the strengths and weaknesses of the</italic> in vivo <italic>assays need to be made clear.

However, under the various experimental conditions tested, we did not find evidence that activation of the Wnt5a-Ror pathway stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Kif26b. Consistent with this observation, all of the Kif26b phosphorylation sites identified in our proteomic screen mapped to either serine or threonine residues. We have added a new figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) to more clearly show the Kif26b phosphorylation sites identified in the proteomic screen and included a new paragraph in Discussion to discuss these findings. We also discussed the current literature concerning whether the Ror receptors are active tyrosine kinases or pseudokinases.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>This submission from Susman and colleagues provides a very comprehensive story about the role of Kip26b as a key downstream effector of Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling. The work encompasses proteomic screens, cell-based analyses, evaluation of genetically engineered mice, and evaluation of function in a zebrafish model. The comprehensive nature of this analysis provides a high degree of confidence in the overall model presented. However, there are a few questions that should be addressed prior to a decision being made on the manuscript. The most important of these is the nature of Kif26b phosphorylation induced by Wnt5a via Ror1/2.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The work identifying Kif26b as a protein that is differentially phosphorylated (or differentially stabilized) in the absence of Ror1/2 is convincingly presented. However, more information should be provided on what residues are phosphorylated within Kif26b downstream of Ror1/2 activation. Are there phospho-tyrosine residues present in Kif26b that can be identified based on the proteomics screen? Or are the residues responsible phospho-serine or phospho-threonine? There is very little discussion of this in the manuscript and it would seem to be a critical point of information regarding Kif26b stability and the nature of the signal downstream of Ror1/2 and Dvl.</italic> </p><p>Please see our response under “Reviewing Editor’s Comments” above.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>[…] The result that Wnt3a, just like Wnt5a, leads to a reduction in Kif26b protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) is quite interesting and indicates that one Wnt, in this case &quot;canonical&quot; Wnt3a, can simultaneously activate both pathways. The authors use rDKK1 to block canonical Wnt signaling and this has no effect on the reduction of Kif26b. The authors should extend this experiment by showing that inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling downstream of the Wnt-receptor interaction similarly has no effect on this readout.

This is a nice experiment and it should be extended by showing that Porcn inhibition can be rescued with Wnt5a protein. Furthermore, this assay should allow the authors to further address the effect of &quot;canonical&quot; Wnt signaling on Kif26b protein levels; e.g. does Wnt3a, like Wnt5a, reduce Kif26b protein? Does GSK3 inhibition (or const. active β-catenin) reduce Kif26b levels? Such experiments would solidify the claim that the effect on Kif26b is independent of the well-studied Wnt/β-catenin pathway.</italic> </p><p>We have repeated the C59 treatment experiment to additionally show that the effect of C59 on WT MEFs (i.e. C59 causes an increase in Kif26b expression in these cells) can be effectively reversed by the application of ectopic Wnt5a.
