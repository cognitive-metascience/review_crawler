Striatal CINs exhibit tonic firing punctuated by distinct pauses. Pauses occur in response to motivationally significant events, but their function is unknown. Here we investigated the effects of pauses in CIN firing on spiny projection neurons (SPNs) – the output neurons of the striatum – using in vivo whole cell and juxtacellular recordings in mice. We found that optogenetically-induced pauses in CIN firing inhibited subthreshold membrane potential activity and decreased firing of SPNs. During pauses, SPN membrane potential fluctuations became more hyperpolarized and UP state durations became shorter. In addition, short-term plasticity of corticostriatal inputs was decreased during pauses. Our results indicate that, in vivo, the net effect of the pause in CIN firing on SPNs activity is inhibition and provide a novel mechanism for cholinergic control of striatal output.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32510.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells or neurons communicate with one another using electrical impulses and chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. Additional molecules known as neuromodulators regulate the communication process. In contrast to neurotransmitters, neuromodulators do not send messages directly from one neuron to the next. Instead they change the way that neurons respond to neurotransmitters.</p><p>For example, the neuromodulator acetylcholine is most abundant in a region called the striatum. Located deep within the brain, the striatum contributes to learning and memory, motivation, and movement. Studies in rodents show that neurons within the striatum called cholinergic interneurons are almost continuously active. Each time these cells fire, they release acetylcholine. But whenever an animal experiences something unusual or important, the interneurons temporarily stop firing. Zucca et al. wanted to know whether these pauses in firing also act as a signal within the striatum.</p><p>To find out, Zucca et al. inserted a light-sensitive ion channel into cholinergic interneurons in the mouse striatum. Activating the ion channels with a laser beam stopped the interneurons from firing. Zucca et al. showed that these pauses in firing reduced the activity of another group of neurons, the spiny projection neurons. These are the major output neurons of the striatum. They send messages from the striatum to other parts of the brain. The results thus suggest that cholinergic interneurons signal notable events by temporarily blocking output from the striatum.</p><p>Understanding how cholinergic interneurons work will help reveal how the striatum drives behavior. It may also lead to treatments for diseases caused by cholinergic system dysfunction. Many patients with Parkinson’s disease or schizophrenia take medicines to block the effects of acetylcholine. Understanding how acetylcholine affects the striatum may help clarify how these treatments work.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd><kwd>interneuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004199</institution-id><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wickens</surname><given-names>Jeffery</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HFSP - RGP0048/2012 - NIV</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wickens</surname><given-names>Jeffery</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Optogenetics and in vivo recordings in mice reveal that pauses in cholinergic interneurons offer an alternative mechanism to inhibit subthreshold and suprathreshold events of spiny projection neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acetylcholine – the first neurotransmitter to be identified – is present in high concentrations in the striatum of the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>) where it is released by a population of intrinsic cholinergic interneurons (CINs) that are distinct from the cholinergic projection neurons that innervate the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Woolf and Butcher, 1981</xref>). In addition, recent studies indicate an external cholinergic innervation from the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei to the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dautan et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2014</xref>). CINs play an important role in behavior by modulating the activity of the principal output neurons of the striatum, the spiny projection neurons (SPNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Witten et al., 2010</xref>). Previously there has been great interest in the role of CINs in disorders of the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maurice et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pisani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shen et al., 2015</xref>) and more recently in behavioral flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okada et al., 2014</xref>). The neuronal mechanisms for regulation of SPN activity by CINs are therefore of intense current interest.</p><p>CINs are tonically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson et al., 1990</xref>) and although they represent only 1% of striatal neurons their extensive axonal fields allow them to control large striatal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolam et al., 1984</xref>). These features combine with a diverse array of receptors for acetylcholine both at pre- and post-synaptic locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernández-Echeagaray et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hersch et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sugita et al., 1991</xref>). Thus, CINs are crucial modulators of striatal function. In particular, CINs control SPN excitability and response to glutamatergic inputs via activation of postsynaptic muscarinic type 1 receptors (M1). At the presynaptic level CINs exert a tonic inhibitory influence over incoming information via the activation of muscarinic type 2 (M2/M4) receptors located on cortical and thalamic glutamatergic terminals.</p><p>The firing pattern of CINs in vivo varies according to behavioural context. During slow wave activity or activated brain states, spontaneous CIN activity ranges from tonic firing, which may be regular or irregular, to bursts of firing separated by pauses of variable duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharott et al., 2012</xref>). In awake animals exposed to repeated, motivationally significant stimuli, putative CINs respond by a pause in firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graybiel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 2004</xref>), sometimes preceded and often followed by a burst. Previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crittenden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nelson et al., 2014</xref>) has focused on the effects of the burst component. In awake animals, the pause has been reported to have either no reliable effects with pauses of short duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al., 2011</xref>), or a mixture of excitation and inhibition during pauses of long duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Witten et al., 2010</xref>) on firing activity of SPNs recorded extracellularly. Here we focus on the effects of the pause on subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations of SPNs recorded intracellularly, as well as supratheshold firing activity of SPNs identified by juxtacellular recording in vivo.</p><p>We used optogenetic silencing of CINs – optimized to produce a pause in nearby CINs – during whole-cell and juxtacellular electrophysiological recording from CINs and SPNs in vivo. We found that a pause in CIN firing caused an inhibitory effect on SPN activity in vivo, reversing expectations based on in vitro studies and computational theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashby and Crossley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franklin and Frank, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pakhotin and Bracci, 2007</xref>) and complementing previous in vivo findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Witten et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, a pause in CIN firing hyperpolarizes the membrane potential of SPNs and reduces the short-term plasticity at cortical inputs, leading to decreased firing of SPNs in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pause in cholinergic interneuron firing decreases firing of striatal projection neurons in vivo.</title><p>We injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding the neuronal silencer Halorhodopsin (NpHR) into the striatum of ChAT-cre mice to induce pauses in CINs that mimic naturally occurring pauses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

When individual cells were analyzed, within the group of cells exposed to 1 s light, a total of 14/22 cells showed a significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in firing, at a median latency of 700 ms from the light pulse. Three cells showed a significant (p&lt;0.05) increase in firing after the light pulse, one cell showed a significant increase (p&lt;0.05) followed by a significant decrease (p&lt;0.05), and four cells showed no significant change in firing rate. However, these changes occurred at much longer latency after the light offset. To determine which responses were due to the pause (and not the rebound firing activity), we tested cells for inhibition during the light on period. A total of 9/14 of the cells showing an inhibitory response (64%) showed a significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease within the 1 s light on period, median latency of 400 msec. Light-induced pauses of CINs resulted in a similar inhibition of SPNs firing both in anesthetized mice (1 s: 43.7 ± 6.32 % n=22) and in awake, head restrained mice (51.52 ± 13.9 % n=7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). These results indicate that a pause in CIN firing of 1 s duration significantly reduces the firing of SPNs in vivo.</p><p>We next tested the effect of a shorter light pulse (0.5 s) on the SPNs firing. In the cells exposed to a 0.5 s light on period (n = 17 cells), the group average PSTH showed a significant decrease in firing rate at the 400–500 ms bin (red bins, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). When individual cells were analyzed, however, none of the cells (0/17) showed a significant decrease during the 0.5 s period of light on. These results indicate that a pause in CIN firing of 0.5 s duration was not of sufficient duration for the effect that was observed reliably with 1 s duration.</p><p>To determine the effect of the transition from light on to light offset, we analyzed the activity of SPNs in the period after the light offset, relative to the last 500 ms of the light on period. There was no significant increase from this new baseline until 700–800 ms after the light off (p&lt;0.01, see Materials and methods). Consistent with this, the firing rate remained more than 2 s.D. below the initial baseline mean (magenta bins, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pause in cholinergic interneuron firing modulates subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations in SPNs in vivo.</title><p>To understand the cellular mechanisms underlying the reduction of firing in SPNs, we then obtained in vivo whole cell recordings of SPNs in the dorsal striatum of mice anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The best-fit of the sum of two Gaussian distributions to the all-amplitudes distribution of the membrane potential revealed that, during a pause (5 s) in CIN firing, the membrane potential of SPNs shifts to more hyperpolarized values in the DOWN state (before: −71.59 ± 1.82 mV; pause: −72.77 ± 1.86 mV; after: −71.66 ± 1.75 mV; n = 13; Repeated Measure One-way ANOVA, F(2, 24)=7.692; p=0.0026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We therefore tested the hypothesis that a pause could decrease intrinsic excitability of SPNs via modulation of M1 receptors in acute slices.

Pauses in CIN firing caused hyperpolarization of subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations measured by in vivo whole-cell recording and caused a significant decrease in the firing rate of SPNs measured using in vivo juxtacellular recordings. Short-term facilitation of corticostriatal synaptic transmission was also modulated during a pause. The main novel feature of the present study is a focus on the effect of the pause uncontaminated by preceding or following bursts, which required measurement during pauses of sufficient duration to separate pause effects from effects of rebound firing. The use of in vivo whole-cell recording configuration furthermore, enabled the effects of the pause on the subthreshold membrane potential to be measured intracellularly, which revealed subthreshold changes associated with the significantly decreased firing of SPNs during the pause. In addition, in vivo whole cell recordings permitted measurement of EPSPs in response to stimulation of the motor cortex, which showed that short term plasticity of cortical input was modulated by the pause. We believe these findings constitute the first direct evidence that the pause in CIN firing carries a meaningful signal to postsynaptic SPNs, complementing previous studies that have focused on the effects of burst-pause or pause-burst sequences.</p><p>The subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations measured by in vivo whole-cell recording revealed that during a pause there was a hyperpolarizing shift of subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations, a slower transition between hyperpolarized and depolarized membrane potentials, and reduced duration of spontaneously occurring synchronous depolarizations. The underlying membrane potential fluctuations are seen during slow-wave sleep and anesthesia, but during wakefulness the membrane potential fluctuations are less stereotyped, with depolarizing synaptic events of variable amplitude occurring in temporally unstructured sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mahon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sippy et al., 2015</xref>). Understanding exactly how a pause would modulate these less stereotyped membrane potential fluctuations requires further whole cell recording experiments in awake animals.</p><p>Our finding that pauses in CIN firing cause inhibition of SPN firing complements an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al., 2011</xref>) that showed a decrease in firing of SPNs after an optogenetically induced pause-burst sequence. The inhibitory effect reported in this earlier study was synchronous with the rebound increase in firing that often occurs after an optogenetically induced pause. Taken together with our findings, there thus appear to be two successive inhibitory effects related to the pause-burst sequence. First, our data show a pause mediated inhibition caused by interruption of cholinergic excitation of SPNs. Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al. (2011)</xref> have shown a burst-mediated inhibition caused by activation of GABAergic inputs to SPNs from other neurons excited by acetylcholine.</p><p>The onset of the inhibitory effect on SPNs of the pause in CINs was statistically significant 400 ms after the onset of the pause, both in the group where the pause lasted 500 ms and in the group where the pause duration was 1 s. Consistent with this delayed effect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al. (2011)</xref> reported no inhibition of SPNs during a pause of 200 ms duration. The delayed onset of inhibition that we observed at 400 ms could not have been detected in this 200 ms timeframe. In an additional group of 3 cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al. (2011)</xref> also did not detect an inhibition of MSNs during a 1 s exposure to light. The detection of inhibitory responses in cells with low firing rates and a high coefficient of variation in firing times is challenging, and in a small sample it is not possible to rule out an inhibitory effect. The absence of pause-related inhibition in the cells exposed to 1 s light in the earlier study might also reflect differences in the power output of the optical fibre (4–10 mW versus 10–30 mW output) and the diameter – 200 µm versus 125 µm etched down to 50 µm used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al. (2011)</xref>.</p><p>The use of pauses of longer duration enabled the effect of the pause to be measured in isolation from the effects of any prior or subsequent rebound firing of CINs. In the natural firing patterns of CINS, the duration of the pauses varies considerably in different behavioural situations. Pauses occurring in response to sensory cues paired with motivationally significant events acquire a pause duration in the range of 200–300 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aosaki et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 2004</xref>). In anaesthetized animals pauses of duration 380–800 ms have been reported in response to a light stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schulz et al., 2011</xref>). In vivo, spontaneous firing activity is broken up by pauses that vary in duration up to one second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharott et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, pauses of similar duration to those used in the current experiments occur naturally as well as in controlled behavioural paradigms. The use of longer duration pauses made it possible to distinguish effects of pauses from rebound firing. In our juxtacellular recordings both 0.5 s and 1 s light pulses showed a significant reduction of SPNs firing in the group average starting at 400 ms. Single cell analysis showed that during a light pulse of 1 s, 64% of the SPNs displayed a significant inhibition in their firing rate. We did not detect, however, any significant effect on the firing of individual SPNs in response to 0.5 s light. These results thus leave an open question about the modulatory role of short pauses of CINs (&lt;400 ms) on the activity of SPNs and the striatal processing that occurs in response to sensory cues paired with motivationally significant events. We speculate that short pauses may exert their effects mainly by rebound increases in firing, acting on nicotinic receptors on GABA interneurons as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al. (2011)</xref>, while longer pauses may engage a dual mechanism involving pause-related removal of muscarinic excitation via M1 receptors, in addition to GABA inhibition activated on the rebound.</p><p>We used NpHR to optogenetically silence CINs during 0.5 and 1 s pauses for recording responses of SPNs in juxtacellular configuration, and changes in membrane potential fluctuations in cells recorded in whole-cell mode during 5 s pauses. Light activation of NpHR caused effective silencing of CINs, as shown by measurements of action potential firing at the soma in our recordings. One caveat for the use of the inward Cl- pump - especially during longer pulses - is the increased rebound firing, evident at the light offset, which may intensify the naturally occurring rebound firing that often follow a pause in CIN firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mahn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raimondo et al., 2012</xref>). Although in the current experiments the main focus is on the effects during the period of the silencing rather than at the time of the rebound, it may be helpful to use other tools in parallel in future experiments to avoid this possibility.</p><p>Cell by cell analysis of the effects of the CINs pause on SPNs showed that while the group average showed a significant decrease in firing rate during the 1 s pause, a fraction of the neurons in the group did not show an individually significant decrease in firing rate. There are several possible explanations for why some SPNs did not respond to optogenetic manipulation of CINs. It is theoretically possible that not all SPN neurons in the sample express M1 receptors. However, this seems unlikely given that nearly all medium spiny neurons have M1 receptor messenger RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yan et al., 2001</xref>) and express M1 receptor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hersch et al., 1994</xref>). The remaining possibilities include that the non-responding SPNs were beyond the reach of the axonal arborization of a pausing CIN; or in a location where CINs did not express the neuronal silencer NpHR.</p><p>The present results add new knowledge – the inhibitory effects on SPNs of the pause in CIN firing – to existing knowledge concerning the effects of burst-pause or pause-burst sequences. We observed inhibition caused by the pause, occurring before the onset of the burst, after a delay of approximately 400 ms. We consider the most consistent interpretation to be that the clearance of acetylcholine levels from the synaptic cleft by acetylcholinesterase is the crucial factor for the onset of the inhibition we observed. It has been an open question whether the dynamics of acetylcholine clearance are fast enough for acetylcholine concentration to track momentary pauses in firing. If clearance were not extremely fast, the extracellular space would act as a capacitor and smooth out the effects of pauses. Clearance by hydrolysis of acetylcholine is catalyzed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The high levels of expression of AChE in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>), and the extremely fast kinetics of this enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Quinn, 1987</xref>), imply rapid clearance and sensitivity to dynamic fluctuations in CIN firing rate. However, current techniques for measuring acetylcholine concentration have insufficient temporal resolution to detect dips during pauses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mattinson et al., 2011</xref>). The observed effects of a pause in CIN firing on SPNs, are thus the first direct evidence that pauses in CIN firing are meaningful signals to the postsynaptic SPNs.</p><p>Analysis of the firing of SPNs in the period immediately after the pause in CIN firing did not show an additional inhibition in the present study. Thus, the rebound firing of CINs that occurred in this period appeared to cause no additional inhibition relative to the firing rate reached during the exposure to light. The recovery to baseline levels after the 1 s pause, however, was relatively slow compared to the recovery after the 0.5 s pause. After the 1 s pause there was no significant increase in firing until 700 ms after the end of the light exposure, consistent with a second inhibitory process. During longer pauses (1 s), acetylcholine levels would be expected to have decreased below baseline levels, leading to the inhibition reported in the present study. Inhibitory effects of the rebound burst might be expected to add to the pause-related inhibition. However, these might not be apparent in the measurements due to a floor effect. That is, the firing rate of the SPNs is already low at the end of the longer pause, and further inhibition at this point would not produce significant effects. An implication of our findings is therefore that the effects of a burst following a pause may depend on the duration of the pause.</p><p>During natural firing patterns, CIN excitation preceding and following a pause can be expected to result in a complex interplay of the temporal dynamics of acetylcholine level changes with the dynamics of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in SPNs, presynaptic glutamatergic inputs, or GABAergic interneurons. In vivo, there is often an excitation before the pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matsumoto et al., 2001</xref>). A burst preceding a pause was not studied in the current experiments, which started with the optogenetically-induced pause. Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Witten et al. (2010)</xref> used optogenetically induced excitation of CINs and found that a 10 Hz burst caused inhibition of SPNs. In that case the first burst in the burst-pause sequence would be expected to initiate a complex sequence of events. The burst would have excitatory effects on neuropeptide Y–expressing neurogliaform neurons mediated by nicotinic receptors, causing fast GABA inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faust et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faust et al., 2016</xref>) and excitatory presynaptic effects leading to release of GABA from dopamine terminals on a slower timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nelson et al., 2014</xref>). During the initial burst, muscarinic receptors would also be activated causing presynaptic inhibition of cortical input by M2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2010</xref>) and increased excitability by M1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lv et al., 2017</xref>) Activation of nicotinic receptors on dopamine terminals would also cause dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Using a standard protocol to assess the short term synaptic changes typical of corticostriatal synapses, we observed that during a pause such protocol produced an increase in the first EPSP of the train, while the total facilitation measured as the ratio between the last to first pulse was decreased, thus defining a temporal window in which corticostriatal integration was attenuated. We did not investigate the mechanism underlying this effect. It is possibly related to muscarinic receptors that are expressed at pre-and postsynaptic sites on corticostriatal synapses on SPNs. A brief pause of tonic activation of presynaptic M2/M4 receptors controlling glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pakhotin and Bracci, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pancani et al., 2014</xref>) might lead to the increased amplitude of the first EPSP. Another possibility is a postsynaptic effect of reduced M1 receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shen et al., 2007</xref>). Although other mechanisms can be at play, the phenomenon observed suggests that the pause might activate a filter, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio, effectively reducing the ability of spatial summed excitatory inputs to reach action potential threshold and activate the postsynaptic SPN. However, further experiments would be required to determine the physiological basis for the pause-related perturbation in synaptic integration.</p><p>Our recordings from acute slices show that the pause induced an increase in spike threshold and a decrease in excitability of SPNs. Both effects are occluded by pirenzepine, an inhibitor of M1 and M4 receptors. Thus, reduced muscarinic receptor activation due to decreased acetylcholine concentration during a pause in CIN firing may be one mechanism for the expression of this inhibition on SPNs activity. Acetylcholine activation of the M1 receptor excites SPNs by reducing membrane K<sup>+</sup> conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 1996</xref>), modulating a transient K<sup>+</sup> conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akins et al., 1990</xref>), and increasing NMDA receptor mediated currents and persistent Na<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calabresi et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2000</xref>). Conversely, a decrease in M1 receptor activation as occurs during a pause, would be expected to increase the membrane K<sup>+</sup> conductances, hyperpolarizing the membrane potential, and decrease NMDA currents, causing shorter duration of the UP state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Plotkin et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, the present findings are compatible with known actions of muscarinic M1 receptors on SPNs.</p><p>The inhibitory effect of the pause suggests a novel mechanism for the modulatory function of CINs in striatal function. The activity of CINs in awake animals is related to behavioral contexts such as reward probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shimo and Hikosaka, 2001</xref>), stimulus location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ravel et al., 2006</xref>) or behavioral context and current state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stalnaker et al., 2016</xref>). Ensembles of SPNs are recruited by cortical inputs causing transitions to firing activity. A pause in CIN firing would inhibit the SPNs within its axonal arbor, and favour a transition to a more hyperpolarized membrane potential, transiently decreasing the neuronal output of the ensemble of SPNs. In the context of inhibitory interactions among SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tunstall et al., 2002</xref>), this might favour cortical information transfer in a different ensemble of SPNs in the domain of tonically firing CINs. Acetylcholine released by a burst preceding a pause would have presynaptic effects on dopamine terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cragg, 2006</xref>) and experiments using optogenetic stimulation show that additional CIN spikes cause phasic release of dopamine by activating presynaptic nicotinic receptors on dopamine terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>). These nicotinic receptors rapidly desensitize in increased acetylcholine and may be expected to regain their sensitivity to acetylcholine after a pause, facilitating further dopamine release. Recovery from desensitization during the pause depends on the duration of the exposure to acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reitstetter et al., 1999</xref>). Partial recovery begins on a subsecond timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2009</xref>) consistent with the duration of a pause. During the pause, acetylcholine clearance occurs allowing recovery of nicotinic receptors to continue. At the same time, the stimulation is removed from muscarinic receptors leading to the inhibition that we describe. The net effect will depend on the acetylcholine levels reached during the burst, the rate of clearance, and the duration of the subsequent pause. The sequence would enable dopamine-dependent plasticity of the corticostriatal synapses active at the time of the pause. Such a mechanism may be important for understanding set shifting in behavioral flexibility, and loss of flexibility in neuropsychiatric diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ztaou et al., 2016</xref>), dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pisani et al., 2007</xref>) and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lieberman et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice, Virus injections</title><p>Male heterozygous B6;129S6-<italic>Chat</italic><sup>tm2(cre)Lowl</sup>/J mice (ChAT-cre; The Jackson Laboratory) were used in the present study.

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding the neuronal silencer NpHR (AAV5-DIO-NpHR-eYFP) was obtained from the University of Pennsylvania (Gene Therapy Program, Pennsylvania, USA) or University of North Carolina (UNC vector core, USA). At postnatal day 14 (P14) we made a 300 nl unilateral stereotaxic guided injection in ChAT-cre mice. The injection volume and flow rate were controlled with an injection pump (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, USA). Viral injections were targeted to the dorsal striatum (AP +0.7, ML ±1.5 relative to bregma, DV −1.7 relative to dura). Mice were anesthetized with vaporized isoflurane (Muromachi, Japan) and returned to the home cage with the doe after the end of the surgery.

Slices (300 μm thick) containing the striatum were cut on a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica, Germany) on an oblique plane, at 45° between coronal and horizontal cuts to preserve corticostriatal connections. Slices were mounted on a porous membrane and incubated for 30 min at 34° C in oxygenated ACSF containing the following (in mM): 126.0 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.0 CaCl2, 2.0 MgCl2, 18.0 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaHPO4, 10.0 glucose, then allowed to recover for at least 1 hr at room temperature before recording. Whole cell recordings were obtained from SPNs identified by size in the dorsal striatum in an area where fluorescent CINs expressing NpHR-eYPF could be visualized (OlympusBX51WI, DAGE-MTI IR-1000, and Olympus DP72). Pipets (4–6 MΩ) were pulled from P-97 (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and filled with an intracellular solution containing the following (in mM): 119 K-MeSO4, 12 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 0.4 Na-GTP, 2 Mg-ATP, (280–300 mOsm, pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH).

For optogenetic manipulations, CINs expressing NpHR-eYFP were activated with short pulses of green light generated by a 530 nm LED (CAIRN, UK) under the control of the digital output of the amplifier. Current steps of 500 ms at increments of 20 pA were used to assess rhoebase current as well as the relationship between AP number and increasing current injection.

The animals were kept warm (~37°C) for the whole duration of the surgery via a heating pad connected to a DC temperature controller provided with a feedback system (FHC Inc., Bowdoin, ME). An eye lubricant was applied to prevent corneal drying during the surgery. A stereomicroscope (LEICA M651) was used to locate the atlas coordinates, using bregma as a reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</xref>). Two craniotomies were drilled between 0 and 1.5 mm anterior from bregma, to allow the insertion of the optic fiber and recording electrode, and between 1.8 and 2.2 mm for insertion of a bipolar stimulating electrode for experiments of corticostriatal plasticity. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained from dorsal striatum between 1,9 and 2.5 mm from dura using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier connected to a Digidata 1440A. Data were acquired with pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices), digitized at 20 kHz, filtered at 10 kHz, and analyzed offline with Clampfit 10.4 (Molecular Devices) or MATLAB as indicated. Activation of NpHR was achieved with a 100 mW, 593 nm laser (Shanghai Dream Lasers Technology Co., Ltd., China) via an optic fiber (200 μm, 0.22 NA) inserted into the dorsal striatum (+1 mm AP, 0 mm ML, −2.1 mm DV from dura) with a 26° angle. Light pulses were externally triggered using pClamp (Molecular Devices). The intensity of light stimulation was between 4–10 mW, measured at the tip of the fiber, outside of the brain. To measure the intensities of light we used a an optical power meter (model 1936 C, Newport, Irvine, CA, USA) equipped with a photodiode sensor (model 918D-UV-OD3, Newport, Irivine,CA, USA). For the activation of NpHR we used a square pulse with the following durations: 0.5 s, 1 s, 5 s. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were achieved using a standard blind-patch approach as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Margrie et al., 2002</xref>). Electrodes used for whole-cell recordings had a resistance between 4.5 and 6 MΩ and were filled with a solution containing (in mM) 135 K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 sodium phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP and 0.3 Na-GTP (290–300 mOsm, pH 7.2–7.3 adjusted with KOH). The intracellular solution was supplemented with 0.2% (wt/vol) biocytin for <italic>post hoc</italic> cellular identification and morphological reconstruction. Only SPNs that showed a typical bimodal distribution of the membrane potential and initial membrane potentials values ≤ −60 mV in vivo were included in the study. At the end of each recording, injection of biocytin was achieved by applying positive current pulses (0.5–1 nA, 500 ms, for 5–10 min) through the bridge circuitry of the amplifier.</p><p>Juxtacellular recordings of striatal neurons were obtained using glass electrodes (5–7 MΩ) filled with Ringer’s solution containing (in mM): 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 5 HEPES, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, or intracellular solution. Juxtacellular units were high pass filtered at 300 Hz. Light durations of 0.5 and 1 sec s, were delivered at 50 s interval and repeated 10 times.</p><p>Spontaneous firing properties of striatal neurons in juxtacellular configuration were estimated during a 3–5 min period before any stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Optically tagged single unit showing patterned pause-burst responses were classified as CINs. Cluster separation between CINs and SPNs was done using classically defined electrophysiological characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isomura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharott et al., 2012</xref>): spike waveform (half-width), firing frequency and regularity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Firing frequency, interspike intervals and half-width were calculated using a detection threshold function in Clampfit. The units obtained in awake head fixed configuration showed similar clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>) and were pooled together.</p><p>For plasticity experiments, a bipolar electrode was used to stimulate cortical inputs from the motor cortex area which send dense projections to the dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wall et al., 2013</xref>). EPSPs were electrically evoked with trains of 10 stimuli delivered at 25 Hz (repeated every 30 s). To test the effect of a pause each train started 500 ms after the onset of the light pulse (total duration: 1 s). The EPSP amplitude was quantified by measuring the peak of the synaptic response obtained from the average trace of all the sweeps recorded. Values were normalized for the first EPSP amplitude.</p><p>UP and DOWN states were algorithmically detected using the strategy proposed for characterizing membrane potential fluctuations in electrophysiological data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reig and Silberberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seamari et al., 2007</xref>). UP states that were at least 0.2 s in duration were considered. Data were further analyzed with MATLAB 2014.</p><p>Spontaneously occurring UP and DOWN states were analyzed before, during and after a pause in CINs firing, by sampling a window of 5 s in each condition. The duration of the light was 5 s, delivered at 30 s interval and repeated at least five times. UP and DOWN states occurring during a pause were compared to those occurring in the preceding 5 s and 10 s after the end of the light pulse, when CINs tonic firing recovered to baseline rate, based on observations from juxtacellular recordings. The average of all UP states occurring before (n = 334), during (n = 319) and after a pause (n = 325) revealed a slower slope of the UP states during light. To quantify the slope of the transitions from DOWN to UP state, UP states were center aligned and scaled to have equal baseline values. The slopes of the transition from DOWN to UP state was calculated from the best-fit line of a linear regression on the membrane potential values in the region between 10% to 90% of the peak of the UP state. The average peak potential was calculated by taking the middle 50% of the membrane potential values for each single UP state event.</p><p>Head-fixed awake in vivo electrophysiology experiments required a second surgery for implanting the head-bar after at least 6 weeks from virus injection. Mice were anaesthetized with gaseous isofluorane (Muromachi, Japan) and placed in a stereotaxic frame. The skull was cleaned to locate and mark bregma with an oil based marker and a head-bar (Phenosys, Germany) was glued to the skull with Super-bond (Sun Medical, Japan). Post-surgery, mice were given a single dose of Carprofen (Rimadyl, 0.5 mg/kg IP) and Buprenorphin (Lepetane, 0.05 mg/kg IP) for pain alleviation. 3 days after implantation, mice were handled for at least three sessions as they habituated to head-fixation and jet-ball (PhenoSys, Germany). Mice were able to freely moving over the spherical ball and they all exhibited grooming, resting, or running behaviors during each session. After habituation, on the day of electrophysiology recording, a craniotomy was performed under ketamine/xylazine mix. Mice recovered from the anaesthesia before initiation of Juxtacellular recordings and optical stimulation of CINs expressing NpHR-eYFP were obtained using same procedure as reported for anesthetized experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunohistochemistry and image analysis</title><p>To recover the morphology of neurons filled with biocytin during in vivo whole-cell patch clamp recordings, brains were removed after completion of electrophysiology experiments and fixed for at least one week at 4°C in a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1X phosphate buffer saline (PBS), pH 7.0.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor and Naoshige Uchida as the Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Veronica Alvarez (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this brief report, the authors tested the impact of silencing striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) on the firing of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in vivo and in vitro. They selectively expressed optogenetic tools (NpHR) in the cholinergic interneurons, and used yellow light stimulation to silence the firing of striatal cholinergic interneurons. During the light stimulation, they observed that striatal SPNs have reduced excitability: increased time in down-state, reduced time in up-state, reduced action potentials, and increased time transitioning from down-state to up-state. And consistent with previous observations, it is likely caused by reduced M1 receptor activation, and subsequently reduced intrinsic excitability caused by M1 receptor modulation. The reviewers appreciated that the in vivo whole cell recordings are technically challenging, and the data presented in the paper are generally of high quality.</p><p>It has been widely observed that CINs display a pause of firing in response to salient stimuli. However, its significance and how it affects the activity of other neurons remain to be determined. Although this issue has been addressed, at least in part, in previous studies, the result of the present study differs from previous conclusions (e.g. Witten et al., 2010 reported an increase in SPN firing during CIN inhibitions and a decrease during CIN excitations). The data presented in the present study provide deeper insights into how CIN pauses affect the activity of SPNs.</p><p>However, the reviewers raised various concerns regarding the data analysis and the validity of some conclusions. We, therefore, would like to see your response.</p><p>Essential points:</p><p>1) In animals that are not engaged in overt behaviors, SPNs fire at very low rates (less than 1 spike per second) and in a highly irregular (sporadic) manner. Such firing patterns present a challenge for analyses designed to detect significant decreases in firing. The authors have used a highly unusual metric to define a decrease in firing, namely dipping under 35% of the mean baseline firing. Equally worrying, there is no account of how many of the SPNs tested actually exhibited a significant decrease in firing. The current analyses are not rigorous or compelling. There is insufficient evidence to support the claim of a &quot;powerful inhibition&quot;, but this issue goes beyond semantics. The data should be re-analyzed (on the basis of single neurons, as well as groups), using standard techniques for normalization and a more stringent threshold for significance, e.g. +/- 2 SDs of mean baseline firing. The proportion of tested neurons that reach criteria should be reported.</p><p>2) The authors delivered light pulses with durations of 0.5, 1 or 5 seconds, and subsequently inhibited (silenced) some CINs for similar durations. One reviewer raised a concern that these durations are artificial because the evidence in the literature indicates that the typical pause duration of TANs (putative CINs) is 200-250 milliseconds although a different reviewer pointed out that some literatures show CIN pauses that last more than 500 ms. However, the reviewer raised the issue that CIN pauses are often preceded or followed by burst firing, and these CIN excitations surrounding a pause may obscure the main observations of CIN pauses inhibiting SPN activity.</p><p>To remedy these issues, the reviewers suggest the following. First, the authors should more carefully discuss the relevant literatures and justify the durations of optogenetic inhibitions. It is preferable if SPN responses to light pulses of shorter durations (200-250 ms) were tested but this issue could be remedied if the authors can justify longer durations of inhibition based on the literature. Second, the reviewers noticed that optogenetic inhibition of CINs was often followed by rebound excitation of CINs. This appears to give the opportunity to address, at least in part, the issue of surrounding excitations. Specifically, please analyze the firing of SPNs immediately following CIN inhibitions. Based on the result, the authors may be able to discuss the impact of CIN's rebound excitations. The authors noted that excitation preceding a CIN pause cannot be addressed by addressing this, but this issue can be beyond the scope of the present study. Nonetheless, the reviewers would like to see a careful discussion on this issue (the potential effects of CIN excitations both preceding and following a pause).</p><p>Related to the issue of CIN rebound excitations, one reviewer raised the following issue: After NpHR silencing, CINs show prominent rebound firing with sustained enhanced firing that lasts for hundreds of milliseconds. If the proposed mechanism were true, one would expect that muscarinic tone would be significantly enhanced, and SPN firing would be increased. However, the data did not show such effect. What could be the explanation?</p><p>3) The wider relevance of studying the effects of 5 second pulses of light on the UP and DOWN states of SPNs in anesthetized mice is unclear. This is because SPNs in awake behaving animals do not exhibit such stereotyped fluctuations in membrane potential (see, for example, Mahon et al., PMID:17135420 and Sippy et al., PMID:26439527). A key question thus remains answered; what is the effect of CIN pauses on SPN membrane potentials and firing when animals are not anesthetized? The reviewers suggest that the authors reduce the tone of discussing UP and DOWN states.</p><p>4) Figure 3 shows that integration of cortical inputs was severely impaired when CINs were silenced by NpHR. However, such perturbation in synaptic integration is unlikely caused by reduction in M1 modulation. The authors should perform similar experiments in brain slice with M1 receptor antagonist to further validate the finding, or reduce the tone of the involvement of M1 receptors.</p><p>5) The authors should discuss the differences from previous studies more explicitly in order to help identify the novelty of the present work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32510.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential points:</p><p>1) In animals that are not engaged in overt behaviors, SPNs fire at very low rates (less than 1 spike per second) and in a highly irregular (sporadic) manner.

The lines on the peristimulus time histogram now show 2 S.D.s from the mean. To statistically test at what point changes became significant, we calculated the cumulative sum of residuals of the observed deviation of the firing rate from the mean, and tested if the difference exceeded a critical value predicted from a Poisson distribution. We have detailed this approach in the Materials and methods section as follows:</p><p>“To analyse the effects of light exposure on the firing rate of SPNs we used a minimal criterion of 2 S.D. difference from the mean. […] Bins with frequencies more than 2 S.D.s below the mean firing rate of the baseline were considered significantly different from baseline if they occurred after the CUSUM crossed the significance level.”</p><p>We also analyzed the proportion of neurons that showed significant changes individually. For this analysis we applied the 2 S.D. criterion and the CUSUM as detailed in the Materials and methods section (above). We report the findings in the Results section as follows:</p><p>“The light-induced pause in CIN firing caused inhibition of firing activity in SPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) which dropped below 2 S.D. from the mean firing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). […] These results indicate that a pause in CIN firing of 1 s duration significantly reduces the firing of SPNs in vivo.”</p><p>We have deleted adjectives such as “powerful” from the text and instead report statistical significance levels.</p><p>In the case of the 0.5 s light exposure, this data is also reanalyzed and is now presented in the supplementary materials because we felt it did provide additional information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors delivered light pulses with durations of 0.5, 1 or 5 seconds, and subsequently inhibited (silenced) some CINs for similar durations.

We considered pauses occurring during spontaneous firing activity as well as stimulus-evoked pauses. We added new discussion of relevant papers showing that longer duration pauses occur in both kinds of activity, see Discussion as follows:</p><p>“The use of pauses of longer duration enabled the effect of the pause to be measured in isolation from the effects of any prior or subsequent rebound firing of CINs. […] In any case, it is important to distinguish effects of pauses from rebound firing, and the available methods for detecting the effects of the pause require longer durations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the reviewers noticed that optogenetic inhibition of CINs was often followed by rebound excitation of CINs.

What could be the explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have analyzed the firing of SPNs immediately following CIN inhibition when there is a brief period of increase in CIN firing (rebound). During and after the rebound period the firing of SPNs stayed 2 S.D. below the mean and did not show further significant inhibition. By 700 ms after the light off the firing rate of SPNs had increased significantly above the last 500 ms of the light on period, however it was still more than 2 S.D. below the mean at this point. Thus, the increase in acetylcholine associated with the rebound firing that follow the pause seems to be associated with a second inhibitory effect.</p><p>Regarding the explanation for why SPN firing is not increased after the light is turned off, we suggest that this may be due to a second inhibitory effect and a paragraph referencing the relevant literature has been added to the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“Analysis of the firing of SPNs in the period immediately after the pause in CIN firing did not show an additional inhibition in the present study. […] That is, the firing rate of the SPNs is already low at the end of the longer pause, and further inhibition at this point would not produce significant effects. An implication of our findings is therefore that the effects of a burst following a pause may depend on the duration of the pause.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The wider relevance of studying the effects of 5 second pulses of light on the UP and DOWN states of SPNs in anesthetized mice is unclear. This is because SPNs in awake behaving animals do not exhibit such stereotyped fluctuations in membrane potential (see, for example, Mahon et al., PMID:17135420 and Sippy et al., PMID:26439527). A key question thus remains answered; what is the effect of CIN pauses on SPN membrane potentials and firing when animals are not anesthetized? The reviewers suggest that the authors reduce the tone of discussing UP and DOWN states.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reduced the tone of discussion of UP and DOWN states and explained that such stereotyped fluctuations in membrane potential do not occur in awake animals in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“The subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations measured by in vivo whole-cell recording revealed that during a pause there was a hyperpolarizing shift of subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations, a slower transition between hyperpolarized and depolarized membrane potentials, and reduced duration of spontaneously occurring synchronous depolarizations. […] Understanding exactly how a pause would modulate these less stereotyped membrane potential fluctuations requires further whole cell recording experiments in awake animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3 shows that integration of cortical inputs was severely impaired when CINs were silenced by NpHR. However, such perturbation in synaptic integration is unlikely caused by reduction in M1 modulation. The authors should perform similar experiments in brain slice with M1 receptor antagonist to further validate the finding, or reduce the tone of the involvement of M1 receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that further experiments are needed. We have reduced the tone of the discussion concerning the involvement of M1 receptors in such mechanism throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should discuss the differences from previous studies more explicitly in order to help identify the novelty of the present work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following paragraph in the Discussion to address this point:</p><p>“Based on in vivo whole cell recordings we show that optogenetically-induced pauses in CIN firing have direct and reproducible inhibitory effects on SPN activity. Pauses in CIN firing caused hyperpolarization of subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations measured by in vivo whole-cell recording and caused a significant decrease in the firing rate of SPNs measured using in vivo juxtacellular recordings. […] We believe these findings constitute the first direct evidence that the pause in CIN firing carries a meaningful signal to postsynaptic SPNs, complementing previous studies that have focused on the effects of burst-pause or pause-burst sequences.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
