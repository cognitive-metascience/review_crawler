the function of neural circuits are incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that the E3 ubiquitin ligase IDOL determines synaptic ApoER2 protein levels in response to neuronal activation and regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis and plasticity. IDOL-dependent changes in ApoER2 abundance modulate dendritic filopodia initiation and synapse maturation. Loss of IDOL in neurons results in constitutive overexpression of ApoER2 and is associated with impaired activity-dependent structural remodeling of spines and defective LTP in primary neuron cultures and hippocampal slices. IDOL-deficient mice show profound impairment in experience-dependent reorganization of synaptic circuits in the barrel cortex, as well as diminished spatial and associative learning. These results identify control of lipoprotein receptor abundance by IDOL as a post-transcriptional mechanism underlying the structural and functional plasticity of synapses and neural circuits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lipoprotein receptor</kwd><kwd>ApoE</kwd><kwd>dendritic spines</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin ligase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH077022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Kelsey C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4R01NS076942</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Portera-Cailliau</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tontonoz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL066088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tontonoz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL090553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tontonoz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Control of lipoprotein receptor protein levels at synapses by the E3 ubiquitin ligase IDOL is shown to be important for the plasticity of neuronal dendrites in vitro and learning and memory in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Learning and memory are associated with long-term structural changes at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lamprecht and LeDoux, 2004</xref>), and there is a direct relationship between spine morphology and synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dillon and Goda, 2005</xref>). Spines with large heads express higher levels of AMPA receptors and establish stronger synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tada and Sheng, 2006</xref>). In addition, mounting evidence indicates that synaptic plasticity and learning are associated with changes in spine morphology and that these morphological changes depend on NMDAR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gambino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayashi-Takagi et al., 2015</xref>). LTP-inducing stimuli cause the formation of new spines and the enlargement of existing ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nägerl et al., 2004</xref>), whereas LTD is associated with the shrinkage and elimination of spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okamoto et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, spine morphogenesis and remodeling provide a physical basis for memory in neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasai et al., 2003</xref>). However, the mechanisms that link spine remodeling and synaptic activity remain to be fully elucidated.</p><p>ApoE receptors are members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene family that play important roles in maintaining the proper function of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herz and Bock, 2002</xref>). ApoE Receptor 2 (ApoER2/LRP8) and the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) bind Reelin in addition to ApoE, and ApoER2/VLDLR-mediated Reelin signaling is essential for controlling neuronal migration and positioning during early brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herz and Chen, 2006</xref>). ApoER2 is also required for the maintenance of proper synaptic function in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Arcangelo, 2005</xref>). Mice lacking ApoER2 display a defect in LTP while exhibiting normal baseline synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weeber et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting a role for ApoER2 in synaptic plasticity.</p><p>Given the strong links between ApoER2 and neuronal function, it is reasonable to hypothesize that ApoER2 levels might be coupled to synaptic activity. However, the pathways that control ApoER2 expression and activity in the brain, and the mechanisms by which ApoER2 affects synaptic plasticity are incompletely understood. Long-term synaptic plasticity requires activity-dependent modifications of synaptic strength and connections. This spatially and temporally coordinated process involves multiple components, including changes in glutamate receptor trafficking, cytoskeleton remodeling, and proteasome-mediated local protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mabb and Ehlers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murakoshi and Yasuda, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shepherd and Huganir, 2007</xref>). The downstream impact of ApoER2 signaling on these components remains to be fully elucidated.</p><p>One candidate physiological regulator of ApoER2 signaling is Inducible Degrader of the LDL receptor (IDOL; encoded by the <italic>Mylip</italic> gene), an E3 ubiquitin ligase whose expression is transcriptionally controlled by liver X receptors in (LXRs) in cell types such as hepatocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zelcer et al., 2009</xref>). The IDOL-UBE2D complex ubiquitinates the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Prior studies have shown that the LXR-IDOL pathway regulates cellular cholesterol levels and impacts plasma LDL levels in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scotti et al., 2011</xref>). Studies in cultured cells have shown that IDOL also promotes the degradation of ApoER2 and VLDLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2010</xref>), but the ability of IDOL to affect the abundance of these lipoprotein receptors in vivo, and the physiological significance of such regulation is unknown. Furthermore, since IDOL and LXR signaling regulate lipoprotein receptors in a cell type-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong et al., 2014</xref>), the potential impact of IDOL and LXR on neuronal ApoE receptor biology and neuronal physiology cannot yet be predicted.</p><p>Here we show that ApoER2 protein levels are actively regulated at the post-translational level in response to neuronal activation and during LTP, and we identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase IDOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zelcer et al., 2009</xref>) as the critical gatekeeper that controls synaptic ApoER2 abundance. IDOL-dependent regulation of ApoER2 dictates dendritic spinogenesis and morphogenesis. Moreover, loss of IDOL impairs activity-dependent remodeling of the synaptic actin skeleton, and compromises synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. These findings reveal a novel post-transcriptional mechanism modulating spine morphogenesis and remodeling in response to synaptic activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamic regulation of neuronal ApoER2 expression by IDOL</title><p>To explore the physiological function of IDOL in neurons, we examined its expression pattern in the brain.

We observed striking increases in VLDLR and ApoER2 protein abundance in total cortical lysates and P2 fractions from IDOL-deficient compared to wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also found that the induction of mRNA encoding IDOL expression during postnatal mouse brain development between P2 and P22 correlated with decreasing ApoER2 protein despite constant <italic>Lrp8</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Moreover, this developmental ApoER2 regulation was abolished in the absence of IDOL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> lower panel). The increase of IDOL expression in the post-natal period paralleled that of PSD95 and the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> upper panel), which rise due to the robust synaptogenesis that occurs during this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sans et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>We also found that IDOL bidirectionally regulated ApoER2 and VLDLR protein levels in primary neurons. Deletion of IDOL in <italic>Mylip</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> neurons by means of an AAV-CamKII-<italic>Cre</italic> vector resulted in &gt;95% reduction in mRNA encoding IDOL and strong increases in ApoER2, VLDLR and LDLR protein compared to cells transduced with GFP-expressing AAV vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Conversely, AAV-mediated overexpression of IDOL in primary cortical neurons greatly reduced the levels of these lipoprotein receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>There are no antibodies capable of detecting endogenous IDOL protein due to its autocatalytic proteosomal turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zelcer et al., 2009</xref>). To examine the subcellular localization of IDOL, we transfected a GFP-tagged, catalytically-inactive IDOL fusion protein (GFP-IDOL C387A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scotti et al., 2013</xref>) into primary hippocampal neurons. In immature neurons (7 days of in vitro culture; DIV7), GFP-IDOL distributed widely in soma and dendritic shafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, in mature DIV18 neurons, GFP-IDOL concentrated at synapses, and was juxtaposed with the glutamatergic presynaptic marker vGlut1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This synaptic enrichment was further confirmed by colocalization of PSD95 and transfected WT GFP-IDOL fusion protein in the presence of MG132 (to block proteosomal degradation of IDOL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether the IDOL-ApoER2 pathway was linked to synaptic activity, we incubated DIV16-18 cortical neurons with the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (Bic), which drives glutamatergic activity.

The reduced spine formation observed with IDOL overexpression, and the increased proportion of filopodia with IDOL knockout, are reminiscent of phenotypes caused by inactivation or constitutive activation of the GTPase Rac1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakayama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang and Macara, 2006</xref>). We found that IDOL overexpression decreased, while IDOL knockout increased, the basal level of GTP-bound (active) Rac1 in primary cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The induction of Rac1 activity downstream of glutamate receptors, particularly NMDAR, plays a central role in promoting actin polymerization and enlargement of the spine head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xie et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore further tested whether IDOL affects Rac1 activity in response to neuronal activity. In control primary neurons, Bic treatment induced Rac1 activity as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Interestingly, although IDOL-deficient neurons showed increased basal Rac1 activity, Bic failed to induce, and actually reduced, Rac1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). However, induction of ERK phosphorylation in response to Bic treatment was not impaired by either IDOL knockdown or overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This observation suggests that the IDOL-ApoER2 axis selectively affects signaling pathways related to actin remodeling. Supporting the notion that ApoER2 is the principle mediator of IDOL effects on Rac1, the Rac1 activity phenotype of neurons overexpressing ApoER2 resembled that of IDOL-deficient neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>): both showed increased basal Rac1 activity and compromised Rac1 induction upon Bic treatment.</p><p>It has previously been reported that c-jun-terminal kinase interacting proteins 1/2 (JIP1/2) interact with ApoER2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stockinger et al., 2000</xref>) as well as Tiam1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchsbaum et al., 2002</xref>), the major Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor that couples the NMDAR to Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tolias et al., 2005</xref>).

First, we tested control and IDOL-deficient mice in the standard Morris water maze with a hidden platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vorhees and Williams, 2006</xref>). WT mice performed better than IDOL-deficient mice in this task, as measured by reduced escape latencies over the course of the training trials, although both groups improved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

Either too little or too much ApoER2 is detrimental.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data implicate the IDOL-ApoER2 axis as a key player in regulating dendritic spine initiation and morphogenesis and their structural remodeling downstream of glutamate receptor activation. Loss of IDOL does not globally disrupt CNS development or basal synaptic transmission, but greatly impairs the functional plasticity of synapses and neural circuits in vivo. IDOL-deficient neurons are defective in their ability to undergo activity-dependent spine remodeling and IDOL-deficient mice show impaired cognitive function and a complete failure to reorganize neural circuits.</p><p>A key conceptual insight of the current work is the requirement for proper control of synaptic ApoER2 proteins levels for neuronal plasticity and learning. Since loss of ApoER2 impairs LTP, and since ApoER2 mediates Reelin signaling to enhance learning and memory in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Niu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rogers et al., 2011</xref>), it has been suggested that increased ApoER2 expression would be beneficial. On the contrary, we have shown here that the constitutive ApoER2 expression caused by IDOL deficiency is detrimental to proper dendritic spine morphogenesis and the plasticity of neural circuits. Furthermore, we found that ApoER2 protein expression in mature neurons is not constant, but is acutely regulated at the post-translational level in response to neuronal activity and the induction of LTP. IDOL thus provides a mechanism to actively control ApoER2 levels in order to facilitate the development of new spines and synapses.</p><p>Our observation that IDOL bidirectionally regulate spine density through ApoER2 is consistent with previous studies showing that spine density is decreased in ApoER2 KO mice and increased in the setting of ApoER2 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dumanis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wasser et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Lrp8</italic> lacking exon 16, which encodes the O-linked sugar (OLS) domain, increased the stability of ApoER2 in neurons and was associated with higher spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wasser et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, while mild increases in ApoER2 levels in response to exon 16 deletion led to enhanced LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wasser et al., 2014</xref>), we showed constitutive high level of ApoER2 expression in IDOL-deficient mice severely impaired LTP. To reconcile these observations, we propose that the dynamic regulation of ApoER2 levels, rather than its absolute abundance, is critical for the functional plasticity of spine synapses. ApoER2 lacking the OLS domain is likely still regulated by IDOL in response to neuronal activity, although its dynamics will be based on the higher ApoER2 level. On the contrary, loss of IDOL completely abolished activity-dependent regulation of ApoER2 levels, which consequently led to impaired structural and functional plasticity of dendritic spines.</p><p>Our study also suggests that Rac signaling may be involved in the regulation of neuronal structural plasticity by ApoER2. Considerable evidence suggests that spatial and temporal coordination of actin dynamics are prerequisite for synapse formation and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dillon and Goda, 2005</xref>). The Rho small GTPases (particularly RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42) are regulators of the actin cytoskeleton that have a profound influence on spine morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newey et al., 2005</xref>). One Rac-GEF implicated in the activity-dependent remodeling of dendritic arbors is Tiam1, which is responsible for the coupling between NMDAR and Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tolias et al., 2005</xref>). We found that IDOL overexpression reduces, while IDOL knockout increases, Rac1 activity in neurons. Loss of IDOL impairs the coupling between glutamate receptor activation and Rac1, increasing basal Rac1 activity and blocking the activation of Rac1 by neuronal activity. The bidirectional regulation of Rac1 activity by IDOL aligns closely with IDOL’s impact on spine morphogenesis.</p><p>We speculate that ApoER2 may be component of a ‘signaling hub’ modulating Rac1 activity and actin remodeling of dendritic spines. The JNK-interacting protein (JIP) was originally identified as a putative scaffold that binds components of the JNK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitmarsh et al., 1998</xref>). Recent studies have shown that JIP is localized at post-synaptic densities (PSD) in neurons, and is indispensable for the normal function of NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kennedy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pellet et al., 2000</xref>). Our data suggest that postsynaptic JIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stockinger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Verhey et al., 2001</xref>) and Tiam1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchsbaum et al., 2002</xref>) could be involved in mediating the effects of IDOL-ApoER2 axis on Rac1 activity. However, since JIP1 is also an important regulator of axonal development and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dajas-Bailador et al., 2008</xref>), distinguishing the pre- and post-synaptic functions of JIP1 is technically challenging. Complete elucidation of the molecular components and signaling pathways mediating the effects of IDOL on the morphogenesis and remodeling of dendritic spines will require further investigation.</p><p>We aware of the limitations of artificial overexpression systems, and we acknowledge the formal possibility that high-level exogenous expression of IDOL in neurons may have off-target or dominant-negative effects. However, our demonstration that knocking down ApoER2 expression reversed the effects of IDOL expression strongly suggests that these effects are specific. Furthermore, our conclusions from overexpression systems are bolstered by corresponding loss-of-function experiments in genetically modified cells and animals.</p><p>What is the benefit of IDOL-dependent ApoER2 regulation for neuronal physiology? IDOL is highly conserved from humans to <italic>drosophila melanogaster</italic>, most likely due to the functions elucidated in this study. We speculate that the IDOL-ApoER2 pathway helps to balance the mobility and stability of dendritic spines, and modulates the speed of spine maturation and synapse formation. High ApoER2 levels during the early postnatal period may serve to keep spines immature and motile. This would be advantageous, because spine motility permits the sampling of large numbers of potential presynaptic partners before connections are stabilized via activity-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jontes and Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Portera-Cailliau et al., 2003</xref>). We further hypothesize that the IDOL-ApoER2 pathway may function as a negative feedback mechanism similar to homeostatic scaling for the maintenance of neuronal network stability. Hebbian plasticity, including LTP and LTD, provoke positive feedback responses and are potentially prone to instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turrigiano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vitureira and Goda, 2013</xref>). In mature neurons, IDOL expression is suppressed by glutamate receptor activity, leading to the stabilization of ApoER2. Once it passes a certain threshold, this increased ApoER2 expression would be predicted to uncouple activity-induced Rac1 induction and actin polymerization, thus preventing the further enhancement of LTP. The impact of the IDOL-ApoER2 pathway on different forms of synaptic plasticity is an important topic for further investigation. It will also be of great interest to explore the involvement of the IDOL-ApoER2 pathway in the cognitive deficits associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Mylip</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Mylip</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mice (backcrossed to C57BL/6 background for nine generations) have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong et al., 2014</xref>).

Internalized GluR2 receptors were detected with Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fractionation of brain tissue</title><p>Brain tissues were homogenized in ice-cold HE buffer (10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, protease inhibitor, PH 7.4) for 10 to 15 s/strike using a tissue homogenizer 600 rpm 10 strikes on ice. Centrifuge the remaining homogenate for 10 min at 800 g, 4°C. Supernatant (S1) was separated from the pellet (P1) by decanting or using a transfer pipet.

The patch pipet solution contained (in mM): 130 CsMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 TEA-Cl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 10 KCl, 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 4 tris-ATP, 0.3 tris-GTP, adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH. The bath solution contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 5 KCl, 3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 glucose, 0.001 tetrodotoxin, 0.1 picrotoxin, 0.001 strychnine adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Recordings were performed at room temperature (22–25°C), and each coverslip was held in the recording chamber for less than one hour. Neurons were held at −70 mV, and traces were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using Axon Instruments Digitizer and pClamp software. To confirm transduction for each neuron recorded, DIC and florescent images were acquired, following each recording, using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 equipped with a Zeiss Axiocam MR camera and Axiovision acquisition software. Recordings were considered for analysis if the series resistance was less than 15 MΩ and if at least 50 mEPSCs were collected. Threshold detection and analysis of mEPSCs was performed using pClamp software. Negative-going events with amplitudes larger than –10 pA and lasting longer than 0.5 ms were automatically detected, and any non-mEPSC events were manually rejected. Student's t-test will be used for the statistical comparisons between genotypes. cLTP induction in cultured hippocampal neurons.</p><p>LTP was induced in cultured hippocampal neurons through activation of NMDA receptors with application of 200 µM glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2001</xref>). The cells were first treated for 10 min at room temperature with bath solution containing (in mM): 152 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 0.001 tetrodotoxin, 0.1 picrotoxin, 0.001 strychnine adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The cells were then treated with 200 µM glycine in the 0 Mg<sup>2+</sup> solution at room temperature for 5 min. After this time, the glycine treatment was replaced with the recording bath solution described above for 30 min at room temperature before the coverslip was transferred to the recording chamber for patch recordings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In vitro electrophysiology</title><p>Adult c57/Bl6J mice (2–3 month old) were deeply anaesthetized with Isoflurane (Isothesia, Henry-Schein, USA) before decapitation. Acute coronal slices (400 μm) through the dorsal hippocampus were cut with a vibratome (VT1000s; Leica Microsystems, Germany) in ice-cold cutting artificial cerebrospinal solution (aCSF) composed of (in mM): 130 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 24 NaHCO3, 1 CaCl2, 3 MgSO4, and 10 D-glucose (all from Sigma, Germany) saturated with 95% O2% and 5% CO2. The slices were immediately transferred to a submerged holding chamber and incubated at ~33°C for 30 min and then at room temperature (RT) for ≥1 hr in the solution used for recording, similar to cutting aCSF, except that it contained 3 mM CaCl2 and 1.5 mM MgSO4 for LTP experiments or 1.5 mM MgSO4 and 4 mM CaCl2 for LTD experiments. All recordings were done in a submersion recording chamber perfused with aCSF (T = 31 ± 0.5°C) at a flow rate of 2–2.5 ml × min− 1. A bipolar concentric stainless steel electrode (FHC, USA) was placed in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region of the hippocampus to allow orthodromic stimulation (constant current, 0.2 ms pulses delivered at 0.05 Hz) of the Schaffer collateral/commissural fiber synapses onto CA1 pyramidal cells. Delivery of stimulation via the Digidata 1322A interface (Molecular Devices, USA) was controlled by pClamp 10.4 software (Molecular Devices, USA) and a stimulus isolator (model: A385; WPI, USA). The stimulus intensity was adjusted between 30 and 110 µA to evoke 60% of maximum response, as determined from the input-output curve and the resulting synaptic potentials – field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs). fEPSPs were recorded using an aCSF-filled glass microelectrode (4.5–7 MΩ) placed in stratum radiatum. The recordings were performed with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, USA) and fEPSPs were digitized (Digidata 1322A interface; Molecular Devices, USA), acquired at a sampling rate of 10 kHz, saved to a PC and analyzed off-line with Clampfit 10.4 (Molecular Devices, USA) and OriginPro 9.0 software (OriginLab Corporation, USA). The fEPSPs were monitored for at least 30 min until the amplitudes were generally stable.</p><p>Input-Output (IO) curves were established by plotting the fEPSP slope against various intensities of the test pulse, ranging from 0 μA to 110 μA in 10 μA steps. LTP of the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synaptic response was induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) consisting of two trains of 100 pulses at 100 Hz (intertrain interval of 10 s) at 100% intensity of the test stimulus. The evoked fEPSPs were recorded for at least 60 min after the HFS. LTD was elicited using a paired-pulse 1 Hz protocol (PP-1Hz) consisting of paired-pulses (50 ms interstimulus interval) repeated at 1 Hz for 15 min, for a total of 900 paired-pulses. The average of fEPSP slopes recorded between 55 and 60 min after HFS or PP-1Hz were used for statistical comparisons. Different slices from the same animal were sometimes used for several experiments, including LTP, LTD or paired-pulse facilitation, but each slice was subjected to only one particular test.</p><p>The fEPSP slopes were expressed as a percentage of the 10 min baseline value before the HFS/PP-1Hz. The Mann–Whitney U test was chosen for statistical comparisons of the LTP/LTD data using Origin Pro 9.0 software (OriginLab Corporation, USA). A p value &lt; 0.01 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Behavior tests</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Morris water maze test</title><p>The maze is a stainless-steel circular tanks with 200 cm diameter. The tank is filled water dyed with white, liquid tempera paint to make the water opaque. A platform is placed in one of the quadrants of the pool and submerged 1 cm below the surface. During the trial, mice were placed in the desired start position facing the tank wall, and released into the water at water-level. If a mouse failed to find the platform within 60 s, it was then placed on the platform for 15 s before being removed. Mice were then place at a new start location and the trial repeated for 4 times/day. On days 4, 7 or 9, the probe test (the mouse was allowed to free swim for 60 s with the submerged platform removed) was conducted. Percent time spent in the goal quadrant was calculated and analyzed for each mouse. The experimenter was blind to the genotype of the animals. Behavioral data from the training period were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Data from the probe test were analyzed using one-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Fear conditioning</title><p>Mice were placed in a shock chamber (Med Associates Inc.) on day 1 and allowed to explore the environment freely for 2 min, followed by a 2 s, 0.5-mA foot-shock. Mice were placed back in their home cage 30 s after foot shock. On day 2, mice were placed in the training context for 5 min, and the level of freezing was recorded using FreezeFrame program and analyzed. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze percent freezing scores of the contextual freezing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Optical intrinsic signal imaging</title><p>Chronic glass-covered cranial windows were implanted as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holtmaat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mostany and Portera-Cailliau, 2008</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5% via nose cone) and placed in a stereotaxic frame over a warm water re-circulating blanket. Dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg; Baxter Healthcare Corp.) and carprofen (5 mg/kg; Pfizer) were administered subcutaneously to reduce brain edema and local tissue inflammation. A 4 mm craniotomy was performed with a pneumatic dental drill. The center of the craniotomy was placed of over the left hemisphere, 2.5 mm lateral to the midline and 2 mm caudal to Bregma. A sterile 5 mm glass cover slip (#1; Electron Microscopy Sciences) was gently laid over the dura mater and glued to the skull with cyanoacrylate-based glue. Dental acrylic was then applied throughout the skull surface. A titanium bar (0.125 × 0.375 × 0.05 inch) was embedded in the dental acrylic to secure the mouse on to the stage for imaging.</p><p>Optical intrinsic signal (OIS) imaging of the hindpaw (HP) and the D2 whisker (D2W) sensory receptive fields was done at 4 different intervals before and after whisker removal: baseline control (average of 2 time points), +1 week, +2 weeks and +3 weeks. OIS imaging was performed through the cranial window on mice under light anesthesia with 0.5–0.75% isoflurane and a single dose of chlorprothixene (6 mg/kg, i.p., Sigma-Aldrich). The cortical surface was illuminated by green (535 nm) and red (630 nm) sets of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) mounted around a ‘front-to-front’ tandem arrangement of objective lenses (135 mm and 50 mm focal lengths, Nikon). The green LEDs were used to visualize the superficial vasculature and the red LEDs were used for IOS imaging. The microscope was focused to ~350 µm below the cortical surface. Imaging was performed at 10 frames per second using a fast camera (Pantera 1M60, Dalsa), frame grabber (64 Xcelera-CL PX4, Dalsa) and custom routines written in MATLAB (provided in Source Code Files 1 to 6). Each session consisted on 30 trials, taken 20 s apart, of mechanical stimulation for 1.5 s (100 Hz) using a glass micropipette coupled to a piezo bender actuator (Physik Instrumente). Frames 0.9 s before onset of stimulation (baseline) and 1.5 s after stimulation (response) were collected. Frames were binned 3 times temporally and 2 × 2 spatially. Stimulated cortical areas were identified by dividing the response signal by the averaged baseline signal (DR/R) for every trial and then summing all trials. Response maps were then thresholded at 50% of maximum response to get the responsive cortical areas for D2W and HP. For figures, we aligned the response maps for D2W and HP stimulation within and across animals for all time points with the help of the corresponding photomicrographs of the superficial vasculature. To generate the final image, we merged and color-coded the responses for D2W and HP (green and red, respectively) for every time point into a single RGB image in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.).</p><p>Cortical sensory representation map sizes were defined by ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). A two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test was used to compute statistical differences between WT and IDOL-deficient groups in Origin Pro 9.0 software (OriginLab Corporation, USA). All data are presented as the mean ±standard error of the mean. Significance was set at p&lt;0.01.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Thomas O'Dell for help in slice electrophysiology experiments, Andrew Poulos, Jesse Cushman, Yong-Seok Lee and Alcino Silva for help with behavioral studies, Joachim Herz for sharing antibodies to ApoER2 and VLDLR, Richard Huganir for the cortical neuron culture protocol, Victoria Ho for help in primary neuron culture, and Jon Salazar for genotyping and mouse care.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.

In support of these conclusions, the authors combine over-expression and knockdown/out of Idol and ApoER2 to show that dynamic regulation of ApoER2 abundance by Idol regulates experience-dependent structural and functional plasticity of neurons.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The dendritic fragments shown in the manuscript tended to associate with parallel GFP positive filaments, which look like axons. The axon structures intermingled with dendrites. Because both are GFP-positive, it became difficult to recognize isolated dendritic protrusions. Perhaps for this reason, the authors did not provide the results of quantitative analyses for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (except <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), although the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> did mention quantitative analysis. In addition, the presynaptic vGluT1 signals cannot determine the position of postsynaptic spines. To make the data convincing, the authors have to provide better images and use different methods to indicate postsynaptic structures and/or synaptic contact sites. Another concern regarding high infection or transfection efficiency is whether the effect of Idol is purely contributed by the postsynaptic neurons. When both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons lost or overexpressed Idol, one cannot tell whether the effect is completely contributed from the postsynaptic Idol and its downstream signal.</p><p>2) One of the key conclusions is that Idol deletion leads to substantial alterations in the morphology of dendritic spines, as exemplified by decreased spine head width and increased density of (likely immature) spines. This is supported by multiple lines of evidence, including the Golgi staining data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>. Functionally, these changes are likely to cause decreases in the frequency and/or amplitude of spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission in mice. Presentation of this kind of functional data would greatly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>3) The authors are strongly encouraged to modify the text in a way to minimize excessive interpretation or discussion, and also substantially tone down the conclusions including the manuscript title. The results shown in the manuscript do not fully support the Idol-ApoER2-Rac1-spine axis in controlling dendritic spine formation and neuronal plasticity.</p><p>4) To fit the model, the authors have to first provide comprehensive evidence supporting the essential and sufficient role of ApoER2 in Idol-regulated spine formation, synaptic plasticity and memory. The rescue experiments in dendritic spine formation were only provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, and 7, the authors investigated the effect of Idol alone, but not ApoER2 rescue. Thus, it is unclear whether ApoER2 is indeed critical for Idol-regulated neural plasticity and memory. As an E3 Ub ligase, Idol is expected to have multiple subtracts. The effects of Idol deletion or overexpression are likely contributed by other Idol subtracts. To conclude the title of the manuscript &quot;The E3 ubiquitin ligase Idol regulates neuronal plasticity through control of synaptic ApoE receptor levels&quot;, more rescue experiments in electrophysiology and behavioral analysis have to be included.</p><p>5) If Idol acts solely through the downregulation of ApoER2 to alter the spine features, one may expect that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, the phenotype of siApoER2/GFP group should be opposite to Idol deletion. Thus, spine density should be decreased and spine head should be larger. However, the authors did not show the results of spine density, which should be included in the manuscript. For the size of spine heads, siApoER2 had actually no effect on GFP control neurons. The data suggest manipulation of ApoER2 alone is not critical for dendritic spine formation. In Idol knockout neurons, ApoER2 knockdown only partially rescued the size of dendritic spines. It also suggests that the effect of Idol is not completely mediated by ApoER2. To explain this controversial observation, the authors brought up a possibility of dynamic regulation of ApoER2. However, there were no data to support the dynamic regulation of ApoER2.</p><p>6) The authors tried to link Rac1 and neuronal activity to the Idol-ApoER2 pathway. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, Rac1 activity was reduced by Idol overexpression but enhanced by Idol knockout. The data fit the model. However, as the authors were also aware, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, they unexpectedly found that in Idol KO neurons, Bic treatment reduced the Rac1 activity to be even lower than that of GFP/Ctrl group and that Idol overexpression enhanced the Rac1 activity in the presence of Bic. These data did not favor the model that NMDAR activation downregulates Idol expression to control Rac1 activity. It suggests that NMDAR likely uses an Idol-independent pathway to inhibit the Rac1 activity.</p><p>The part of Idol alone is convincing. However, the causal relation of ApoER2 and Rac1 regulation by Idol in dendritic spine formation and neuronal plasticity is questionable.</p><p>7) The Introduction section is well written but some descriptions in the Results and Discussion section lack cogency.</p><p>a) Introduction, last paragraph and other, &quot;dynamic regulation of ApoER2 abundance&quot;. In the manuscript, there is not any study related to &quot;dynamic regulation&quot;.</p><p>b) Subsection “Excess Idol activity inhibits spinogenesis by limiting ApoER2 protein”, last paragraph, the authors found that expression of Idol at the late stage did not alter spine density (again, quantitative analysis is required for making this conclusion). In contrast, Idol overexpression at the early stage reduced dendritic spine density. The results suggest the involvement of Idol in the initial stage of spine formation but not maintenance. It is not clear why the authors said that Idol is &quot;not required for synapse formation&quot; in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>c) &quot;the effects of Idol on spinogenesis were preserved in Ldlr-/- neurons (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D)&quot;. Figure 2—figure supplement 1D showed only immunoblots of GluR1, GluR2, NR1 and TRF, which cannot be used to indicate &quot;spinogenesis&quot;.</p><p>d) What is &quot;CR50&quot; in Figure 2—figure supplement 1E?</p><p>e) &quot;adding RAP (a high affinity competitive ligand for ApoE receptors) did not abolish the effects of Idol expression (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). Together, these data suggested that the inhibitory effects of Idol on spinogenesis were likely mediated through ApoER2, and largely independent of the uptake of lipoprotein particles.&quot; If Idol expression indeed dramatically reduces ApoER2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), there is no or low ApoER2 in Idol expressing cells to respond to RAP. Why do the authors expect to see the effect of RAP?</p><p>f) Subsection “Idol-mediated ApoER2 regulation is essential for spine morphogenesis”, first paragraph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), again the, images are not clear enough to show the morphology of individual dendritic protrusion (see above point 1). And also the signals of GluT1 alone are not sufficient to conclude synaptic contact sites or excitatory synapses.</p><p>g) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, quantitative analyses of spine density and vGlyT1/Postsynaptic marker double puncta need to be included. The protein levels of ApoER2 in all four groups also need to be examined.</p><p>h) &quot;ApoER2 has been reported to interact directly with NR1, but co-immunostaining with vGluT1 revealed that NR1 was appropriately localized on dendritic spines in Idol deficient hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).&quot; In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, there are only GFP and NR1 signals.</p><p>i) &quot;loss of Idol increased protein levels of JIP1 in both total brain lysates and P2 fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).&quot; Again, the change of JIP1 could be independent from ApoER2. Idol may regulate multiple parallel pathways to control spine formation.</p><p>j) &quot;defects in actin remodeling upon NMDAR activation may underlie the failure to induce LTP in the absence of Idol.&quot; In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and its figure supplements, there is no any data related to actin remodeling.</p><p>k) &quot;precise control of neuronal ApoER2 protein levels by Idol is indispensable for synaptic plasticity&quot;. The data in the manuscript do not fully support this point.</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors provide many potential mechanisms that may link Idol deletion with spine alterations. Although the suggested mechanisms are attractive, the causal relationships are weak relative to the data in earlier figures, unless the authors could demonstrate that JIP1 knockdown reverses the spine phenotypes caused by Idol KO. This should be clearly mentioned in Discussion.</p><p>9) Although it is possible that both too much and too little Idol or ApoER2 could cause spine abnormalities, in general, interpretation of the results from over-expression of a protein relative to those of gene KO should carefully be interpreted. It is still possible the spine disrupting effects of, for instance, Idol overexpression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, although it is E3 activity-dependent, could be a non-physiological dominant negative effect. This should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29178.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The dendritic fragments shown in the manuscript tended to associate with parallel GFP positive filaments, which look like axons.

To address reviewer’s comments regarding the quality of the images and the markers indicating synaptic contact sites, we have added better quality images that distinguish the dendritic protrusions from axons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>.

First, the substrate of Idol, ApoER2 is mainly located at postsynaptic terminal of synapses. This is published and we have reconfirmed this in the present study. Second, we show that GFP-tagged, catalytically-inactive Idol fusion protein (GFP-Idol C387A) is distributed in dendritic shafts, and concentrated at synapses in mature hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, 1H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Third, we show that overexpression of Idol has major impacts on the levels of postsynaptic proteins including AMPAR, NMDAR1 and PSD95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and reduces the amplitude of mEPSCs of hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>)–both of which indicate a postsynaptic effect. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that Idol may affect presynaptic functions, there is no currently no data to support this. In our view it is reasonable to conclude based on all of the evidence outlined above that the majority of the Idol effects we is due to postsynaptic actions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>2) One of the key conclusions is that Idol deletion leads to substantial alterations in the morphology of dendritic spines, as exemplified by decreased spine head width and increased density of (likely immature) spines.

We found no difference in the IO curves between WT and <italic>Idol</italic><sup>–/–</sup> slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that basal synaptic function was not affected by the absence of Idol. In addition, Basal mEPSCs recordings of hippocampal neurons also did not reveal changes in either amplitude or frequency of mEPSCs upon Idol deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Both of these datasets suggest that, although loss of Idol affects spine morphogenesis, it does not have a major impact on basal synaptic transmission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>3) The authors are strongly encouraged to modify the text in a way to minimize excessive interpretation or discussion, and also substantially tone down the conclusions including the manuscript title. The results shown in the manuscript do not fully support the Idol-ApoER2-Rac1-spine axis in controlling dendritic spine formation and neuronal plasticity.</italic> </p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively modified the text in response to this concern. We have substantially revised the title, Abstract, and Discussion. The manuscript has also been refocused to emphasize the role of the Idol-ApoER2 axis in regulating spine initiation and morphogenesis, and the associated impairment of spine structural remodeling and synaptic plasticity. We concede that, although an involvement of Rac1 in regulating spine morphology and remodeling is suggested by our data, the underlying signaling pathways remain elusive and thus will require further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>4) To fit the model, the authors have to first provide comprehensive evidence supporting the essential and sufficient role of ApoER2 in Idol-regulated spine formation, synaptic plasticity and memory. The rescue experiments in dendritic spine formation were only provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, and 7, the authors investigated the effect of Idol alone, but not ApoER2 rescue. Thus, it is unclear whether ApoER2 is indeed critical for Idol-regulated neural plasticity and memory. As an E3 Ub ligase, Idol is expected to have multiple subtracts. The effects of Idol deletion or overexpression are likely contributed by other Idol subtracts. To conclude the title of the manuscript &quot;The E3 ubiquitin ligase Idol regulates neuronal plasticity through control of synaptic ApoE receptor levels&quot;, more rescue experiments in electrophysiology and behavioral analysis have to be included.</italic> </p></disp-quote><p>With respect, the reviewer’s statement: “As an E3 Ub ligase, Idol is expected to have multiple subtracts (sic)” is factually incorrect. It is possible that since the reviewer comes from the neuroscience field, he/she may be unfamiliar with our extensive prior work documenting Idol target specificity and elucidating the structural basis for target recognition by Idol (e.g., Calkin et al. PNAS, 2011; Zhang et al., Genes Dev. 2011; Hong et al., JBC 2010). We have already proven that Idol has ONLY three targets: LDLR, VDLR and ApoER2. It does not degrade any other member of the LDLR family, and no other protein in the genome contains the recognition sequence.</p><p>In response to the reviewer, we have added new experiments further supporting that, among Idol’s 3 lipoprotein receptor targets, ApoER2 is the major player. Our collective results (including the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) strongly suggest that ApoER2 mediates the effects of Idol on spine initiation and morphogenesis. First, knockdown of ApoER2 using siRNA markedly reduced synaptogenesis in primary hippocampal neurons; conversely, ApoER2 overexpression resulted in a 2-fold increase in spine density and a ~50% reduction in head width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Both knockdown and overexpression of ApoER2 largely recapitulated the effects of Idol overexpression and deficiency, respectively. Second, expression of an Idol-resistant ApoER2 mutant (F894A) rescued the reduction in filopodia density induced by Idol overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and knocking down ApoER2 in Idol-deficient neurons increased the width of spine heads. Third, our new data show that neurons overexpressing ApoER2 resembled the phenotype of Idol-deficient neurons with respect to Rac1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both showed increased basal Rac1 activity and compromised Rac1 induction upon Bic treatment.</p><p>Although we agree it would be desirable to rescue the effects of Idol deficiency by manipulating ApoER2 in vivo, this is extremely challenging and the reviewers did not really offer a constructive and practical suggestion for how this could be accomplished. It is known that the ApoER2 knockout mouse shows defects in neuronal migration, impaired LTP, and learning and memory. Complete loss of ApoER2 impacts dendritic spine initiation, NMDAR signaling, and neuronal positioning as shown by our study and by numerous previous publications. Since the global ApoER2 KO mouse already has so many severe defects, no useful information could be drawn by crossing it to the Idol-knockout mouse. The resulting mice will certainly have defects, but it would be totally unclear how they relate to Idol. Tissue-specific and/or inducible ApoER2 KO mice have not yet been described.</p><p>Generating an <italic>inducible and reversible</italic> ApoER2 knockout/knockin mouse model in the background of Idol deficiency could potentially serve as a useful model to study the question; however, such a model will take years to generate and validate and is obviously beyond the scope of an <italic>eLife</italic> revision. We have now revised our manuscript to somewhat soften the conclusions about the in vivo role of ApoER2 vs LDLR and VLDLR in Idol effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>5) If Idol acts solely through the downregulation of ApoER2 to alter the spine features, one may expect that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, the phenotype of siApoER2/GFP group should be opposite to Idol deletion.

However, there were no data to support the dynamic regulation of ApoER2.</italic> </p></disp-quote><p>We are unclear as to the reviewer’s definition of “dynamic”. We show that Idol mediates changes in ApoER2 protein levels in response to neuronal activation and induction of LTP (e.g., Figure X and Figure X). To us, this is a perfectly reasonable use of the term “dynamic”. It does not just determine basal levels of ApoER2, but changes them actively in response to other stimuli. We have limited our use of this term in the revised paper and instead state “Idol is important for mediating acute changes in ApoER2 protein levels in response to…”</p><p>Our results (including the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) strongly suggest that ApoER2 is the main mediator of Idol’s effects on spine initiation and morphogenesis. Please refer to our response to comment 4 for elaboration of the complete supporting evidence. In addition, we showed that ApoER2 protein levels in neurons and in brain is not constant, but is regulated during the early-postnatal period and in response to neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C, D, I, J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>) at the post-translational level in Idol-dependent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>6) The authors tried to link Rac1 and neuronal activity to the Idol-ApoER2 pathway.

This result provides further support for a causal relationship between ApoER2 levels and Rac1 activity. However, as pointed out above, we acknowledge that the detailed signaling pathways connecting Idol to Rac1 activity and the structural remodeling of dendritic spines are not yet clear and must be topics for further investigation.</p><p>Idol overexpression reduces, while Idol knockout increases, Rac1 activity in neurons. The bidirectional regulation of Rac1 activity by Idol aligns closely with Idol’s impact on spine morphogenesis. Idol overexpression enhanced the Rac1 activity in the presence of NMDAR activation (Bic treatment), consistent with our model that reduced ApoER2 will enhance the coupling between NMDAR and Rac1. It is not clear why Bic treatment reduced Rac1 activity in Idol KO neurons further than in controls. It has been shown that NMDAR activation leads to spatiotemporal activation of Rho GTPases. Rho GTPases work together to coordinate the F-actin organization/remodeling in dendritic spines through their mutual antagonism: for example RhoA antagonizes the activity of Rac1 and CDC42. We speculate that Idol manipulation might specifically decouple NMDAR and Rac1 activation. Reduced Rac1 activity is a possible net outcome due to imbalanced Rho GTPase signaling. Therefore, the reduced the Rac1 activity upon Bic treatment in Idol KO neurons does contradict our working model.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have softened our conclusions on this point and instead emphasized other aspects of the Idol-ApoER2 connection in the revised paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>7) The Introduction section is well written but some descriptions in the Results and Discussion section lack cogency.</italic> </p><p><italic>a) Introduction, last paragraph and other, &quot;dynamic regulation of ApoER2 abundance&quot;.

We observed that addition of RAP to primary neuron culture had little effect on the level of key post-synaptic proteins (in WT or IDOL KO), and the effects of Idol remain intact in the presence of RAP.
