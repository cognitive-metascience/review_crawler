Opioids affect both pain and reward through uncharacterized modulation of this circuitry. This study examined opioid actions on glutamate transmission between these brain regions in mouse. Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists potently inhibited MThal inputs without affecting ACC inputs to individual striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). MOR activation also inhibited MThal inputs to the pyramidal neurons in the ACC. In contrast, delta-opioid receptor (DOR) agonists disinhibited ACC pyramidal neuron responses to MThal inputs by suppressing local feed-forward GABA signaling from parvalbumin-positive interneurons. As a result, DOR activation in the ACC facilitated poly-synaptic (thalamo-cortico-striatal) excitation of MSNs by MThal inputs. These results suggest that opioid effects on pain and reward may be shaped by the relative selectivity of opioid drugs to the specific circuit components.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>opioid</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>feed-forward inhibition</kwd><kwd>opioid receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS081071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Tianyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003194</institution-id><institution>New York Stem Cell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherrer</surname><given-names>Gregory</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA042779</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Birdsong</surname><given-names>William T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA044481</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherrer</surname><given-names>Gregory</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS106301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherrer</surname><given-names>Gregory</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS104944</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Tianyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01NS094247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Tianyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By differentially modulating the two major excitatory inputs to the striatum, mu- and delta-opioid receptors regulate the balance between thalamic and cortical inputs to the striatum.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Opioids blunt both sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational dimensions of pain by modulating neuronal activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oertel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zubieta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corder et al., 2018</xref>). The affective-motivational dimension of pain underlies the aversiveness and negative emotional affect that arise in response to activation of nociceptive inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gracely, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Navratilova and Porreca, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Treede et al., 1999</xref>). This study examines how opioids modulate the circuitry involved in affective-motivational pain perception.</p><p>In humans, affective pain perception is associated with increased activity in the medial thalamus, as well as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casey et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peyron et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peyron et al., 2000</xref>). In rodents, chronic pain is associated with hypersensitivity of mediodorsal thalamic neurons to sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Whitt et al., 2013</xref>) and activation of the ACC has been shown to be aversive using a conditioned place aversion paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johansen and Fields, 2004</xref>). In contrast, lesions of the ACC decrease affective-motivational pain responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansen et al., 2001</xref>). Anatomically, neurons from the medial thalamus (MThal) send glutamate afferents to the cortical regions, including the dorsal and ventral ACC, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and insular cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</xref>), as well as to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hunnicutt et al., 2016</xref>). The ACC in turn projects to the DMS, forming a circuit connecting the MThal and the ACC, both of which provide convergent glutamate inputs to the DMS. This thalamo-cortico-striatal circuit has been demonstrated to be involved in pain processing, in particular, affective pain perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rainville et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Price, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fields, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yokota et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>Clinically, opioids are used to reduce pain perception by modulating both sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational aspects of pain. Mu-opioid receptors (MORs) and delta-opioid receptors (DORs) are predominantly expressed in the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus and ACC, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansour et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erbs et al., 2015</xref>). Injection of opioids into the MD or ACC can relieve pain and induce conditioned place preference in an animal model of chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carr and Bak, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Navratilova et al., 2015a</xref>), suggesting a role for opioid modulation of thalamic and cortical circuitry in affective pain.</p><p>The striatum is enriched in MORs and DORs, as well as the endogenous opioid ligand enkephalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pert et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koshimizu et al., 2008</xref>). Also, opioids have been shown to inhibit glutamate inputs to the striatum, as well as GABA release from local striatal circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang and North, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffman and Lupica, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brundege and Williams, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atwood et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banghart et al., 2015</xref>). In this context, the striatum serves as a potentially critical hub for opioid-dependent modulation of fast synaptic transmission in the affective pain circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zubieta et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The current work determines how and where opioids modulate synaptic transmission between the thalamic, cortical and striatal regions that are important for the perception of affective pain. Results revealed opposing roles of the MORs and DORs regarding information flow from the thalamus to the striatum, whereby MOR activation decreased glutamate transmission in the striatum, while DOR activation facilitated glutamate transmission via disinhibition of cortical pyramidal neurons. Thus, MOR and DOR activation are predicted to play opposing roles in pain processing mediated by the thalamo-cortico-striatal circuit. Together, these data identify specific synaptic connections within the thalamo-cortico-striatal circuit that are modulated by opioids and illustrate how different opioid subtypes can independently modulate neuronal communication at the circuit level.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Opioid receptor agonists suppress excitatory transmission in the dorsomedial striatum</title><p>Because the DMS mediates learning and expression of motivated behaviors in response to both aversive and rewarding stimuli, the opioid sensitivity of glutamate afferents in the DMS was investigated. In acute mouse brain slice preparations, individual striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) were identified based on physiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kreitzer, 2009</xref>). Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained and glutamate release was evoked using electrical stimulation. AMPA receptormediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were pharmacologically isolated and recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). Similar to previously published results in the nucleus accumbens and dorsolateral striatum, application of the mu- and delta-selective opioid agonist [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin (ME, 3 µM) significantly decreased the amplitude of the EPSCs. This inhibition was reversed upon washout of ME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>; ME: 77.8 ± 4.6% of baseline; washout: 90.5 ± 2.6% of baseline; baseline vs ME: W(11) = 1, p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang and North, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffman and Lupica, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brundege and Williams, 2002</xref>).

In addition, MORs and DORs appear to be enriched in the medial thalamus and midline cortical structures (including the ACC), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erbs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). To test whether anatomically distinct expression of MORs and DORs in the thalamus and the cortex confer specific opioid sensitivity to these two inputs to the striatum, an optogenetic approach was used to isolate the specific thalamic and cortical inputs onto MSNs in the DMS. Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) encoding two optically-separable channelrhodopsin variants were injected into the MThal and ACC of three- to five-week-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The blue light-sensitive channelrhodopsins (CsChR or ChR2(H134R)) were expressed in the MThal while the red light-sensitive channelrhodopsin (Chrimson) was expressed in the ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nagel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>). Expression of one channelrhodopsin variant alone demonstrated wavelength-selectivity of optically-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (oEPSCs) in response to brief pulses of either blue (470 nm) or red (625 nm) light, and minimal cross-contamination from undesired light stimulation was observed under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d–e</xref>). Following co-expression of Chrimson in the ACC and either CsChR or ChR2(H134R) in the MThal, illumination with both blue (470 nm, MThal inputs) and red light (625 nm, ACC inputs) evoked robust oEPSCs in individual MSNs in the DMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The MOR-selective agonist DAMGO inhibited oEPSC amplitude to MThal stimulation (470 nm light) in a reversible manner, and did not alter oEPSC amplitude to ACC stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; DAMGO I<sub>MThal</sub>: 38.2 ± 6.1% of baseline, <italic>z</italic> = 4.738, p&lt;0.001; I<sub>ACC</sub>: 92.8 ± 4.9%, <italic>z</italic> = 0.459, p=0.647).

Previously, we described the mesoscopic anatomical connectivity between subregions within the thalamus and cortex, and the convergence of their axonal projections within the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hunnicutt et al., 2016</xref>). Here, guided by such information, we used both anatomical and functional approaches to demonstrate the connectivity of the MThal, ACC and DMS. We found that projections from the MThal and ACC converged in the DMS, rather than the ventral striatum which has been well studied for reward and drug addiction. Further, we found different opioid receptors differentially affect projection-specific synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). Specifically, activation of MORs suppressed both MThal-ACC and MThal-DMS excitatory synapses, however, activation of DORs enhanced the excitatory input from the MThal to the pyramidal neurons in the ACC by disinhibiting local feed-forward inhibition mediated by PV interneurons in the ACC. This DOR-mediated disinhibition of MThal-ACC synapses has functional significance at the network level in that it facilitates information to flow from the MThal to the DMS via the ACC. Our results suggests that opioid effects on pain and reward are shaped by the relative selectivity of opioid drugs to the specific circuit components.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Convergence of thalamic and cortical inputs to the striatum</title><p>Glutamate afferents from the midline cortical structures and medial thalamus converge to the DMS in the affective pain pathway. Here, we demonstrated that single MSNs in the DMS can receive inputs from both the midline cortex and medial thalamus. These results establish the anatomical basis for investigating convergence and integration within this circuit. Being able to detect convergence of MThal and ACC inputs at the level of the individual cell also paves the way for future studies of this circuit with single cell resolution at the population level.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Individual MThal neurons projects to both the ACC and DMS</title><p>Consistent with studies demonstrating cortical and striatal projections for midline thalamic neurons in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Otake and Nakamura, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuramoto et al., 2017</xref>), the simultaneous retrograde bead injections localized to the rostromedial ACC and DMS demonstrated double-labeling of individual neurons in the lateral MD and CL thalamus, suggesting that in mice single thalamic neurons can project to both the cortex and striatum. It should be acknowledged that the exact location of the retrograde bead labeled neurons relative to defined borders of the thalamic nuclei is not perfectly accurate since a small range of slices containing the MThal were fit to a single plane of the mouse atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franklin and Paxinos, 2001</xref>) without correcting for irregularities such as brain slice angles. Furthermore, the diffusion of retrograde beads in brain tissue is limited such that each injection is relatively small and localized, thus, the number of colocalized neurons is not an absolute measure of the fraction of MD neurons projecting to both the ACC and DMS. Despite these constraints, the retrograde bead injections and retrograde viral labeling experiments both suggested the presence of a population of neurons in the MThal that project to both the ACC and DMS. We also confirmed that these collaterals originating from the MThal made functional en passant synapses in the DMS. Based on these tracing experiments and convergence of the cortical and thalamic inputs to the striatum experiments mentioned above, a circuit with a direct monosynaptic arm from the MThal to the DMS, and an indirect poly-synaptic arm from the MThal via ACC to the DMS is described.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Opioid modulation of the thalamo-cortico-striatal circuitry</title><p>The MOR agonist DAMGO had a strong inhibitory effect on the MThal inputs to the DMS, whereas neither DAMGO nor the DOR agonist DPDPE had a significant effect on the ACC inputs to the DMS. These results indicate that the midline thalamostriatal pathway stands as a major source of opioid-regulated glutamate inputs to the DMS, and that MOR agonists alter the relative influence of cortical and thalamic inputs on DMS excitability. The MThal inputs to the ACC were also inhibited by MOR agonists. Given the extensive MOR-sensitive axonal projections from the MThal to the ACC, it is possible that the analgesic and rewarding effect of morphine injection into the ACC is due in part to inhibition of thalamic glutamate inputs to the ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Navratilova et al., 2015b</xref>). Together, MOR activation may selectively suppress information from MThal to the striatum either directly or indirectly, but may leave intact other information that is also going through the ACC to the striatum. This may contribute to the selective analgesic and rewarding effect of morphine without affecting other cognitive functions.</p><p>There are two major subtypes of MSNs in the striatum, dopamine receptor 1 (D1)-positive and dopamine receptor 2 (D2)-positive MSNs each making up ~50% of total MSNs. While we have not observed any bi-modal distribution or obvious heterogeneity in MSN responses, it will be interesting to investigate the cell type-specific and input-specific opioid sensitivity in this circuit in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Opposing effects of opioid subtypes on circuitry modulation</title><p>Although all opioid receptors couple to the inhibitory G<sub>i</sub> pathway, their effect on the circuit can be distinct. In this study, the lack of strong inhibition of DORs on glutamate transmission in the corticostriatal projections together with the potent DOR inhibition of GABA release from PV interneurons to pyramidal neurons in the ACC allows for DORs to function in a disinhibitory manner. DOR activation effectively leads to hyper-excitable ACC circuits, while MOR activation functions in an inhibitory manner, dampening glutamate release in the thalamo-cortico-striatal circuit. These results complement a previous study in which DOR activation resulted in increased activity in the rat insular cortex following dental pulp stimulation, while MOR activation decreased the insular cortex activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yokota et al., 2016a</xref>). A follow-up study found that inhibitory transmission from fast-spiking interneurons to pyramidal neurons was inhibited by DOR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yokota et al., 2016b</xref>). The current results extend these findings to the mouse ACC and identify that specifically, PV interneurons are a target of DOR inhibition.</p><p>While PV interneurons have been suggested to selectively mediate feed-forward inhibition of thalamocortical transmission in the ACC, it is important to note that the current findings do not rule out potential influence of opioids on other interneuron populations. In fact, immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization data presented here suggest that DOR expression is not restricted to PV interneurons, as only approximately 20% of DOR-positive neurons were parvalbumin-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Furthermore, certain neurons in the ACC have been shown to express MORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanaka and North, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vogt et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that there are additional opioid-sensitive neurons within the local ACC circuits.</p><p>It has recently been shown that MOR agonists can modestly inhibit insular-striatal glutamate transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>). In this study ACC-striatal transmission was relatively insensitive to MOR and DOR agonists, while PFC-striatal transmission appeared marginally sensitive to the DOR agonist DPDPE. Thus, there may be heterogeneity in the opioid sensitivity of cortical projections to the striatum. The current results also suggest that MORs and DORs are positioned to serve opposing functions in regulating affective pain circuitry and reward and motivated behaviors. In addition, an important aspect is how endogenous opioid receptor ligands modulate this circuit. Future technological development might allow the investigation of endogenous ligand release and their effects on specific components of the thalamo-cortico-striatal loop, as outlined in this work.</p><p>The MD, ACC, and striatum have been demonstrated to play roles in pain- and reward-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kawagoe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LaLumiere and Kalivas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Merrer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Navratilova et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, some aspects of the analgesic and rewarding/addictive effects of opioids may arise from modulation within the poly-synaptic circuits between the MThal, ACC and striatum described here. Increased ACC activity is associated with increased affective pain intensity and decreased ACC activity is associated with analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johansen and Fields, 2004</xref>). The current results suggest that drugs acting in the ACC at either MOR or DOR have the potential to modulate this circuitry. These data also suggest that commonly prescribed and abused opioids, which primarily act through MOR, could alter the relative influences of glutamate inputs to the striatum in addition to their postsynaptic effects on striatal MSNs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Sodium and chloride reversal-potentials were empirically determined by recording spontaneous EPSCs/IPSCs, isolated by presence of GABAergic or glutamatergic antagonists, respectively, under a range of holding potentials (−90 to 40 mV with 5 mV increments each for 1 min recording duration). oEPSC and oIPSC were recorded at −55 and 5 mV, respectively.</p><p>Whole-cell voltage and current clamp recordings were collected by WTB using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA), digitized at 20 kHz (Instrutech ITC-16, New York, NY), and recorded (Axograph X software), and by BCJ using an Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) digitized at 10 kHz and recorded with <italic>Ephus</italic> software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ephus.org">www.ephus.org</ext-link>). Optically evoked currents were elicited by LED illumination through the microscope objective (WTB and BCJ, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan, BX51W with 60X, 1.0 NA water immersion objective, except for polysynaptic circuit activation which utilized a 20X, 0.5 NA water immersion objective), or by laser illumination (473 nm Crystal Laser, Reno, NV) through the microscope objective (BCJ, details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mao et al., 2011</xref>) Neuron). In brief, laser beam position was controlled by galvanometer scanners (Cambridge Technology, Bedford, MA). Beam was passed through an air objective (4 x, 0.16 NA, UPlanApo, Olympus, beam diameter ~8–16 µm). Timing and light power of the laser stimulation was controlled by a TTL-controlled shutter (Uniblitz, Rochester, NY) with typical dwell time 1 ms (up to 5 ms for polysynaptic and loose cell-attached experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), and a circular gradient neutral-density filter of 0.04–1.5 optical density (Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ) set to yield typical 3–5 mW power after objective, respectively. For LED stimulation a TTL-controlled LED driver and 470 nm LED (Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) were used to illuminate the slice directly over the recorded cell generally with ~1 mW of power for 0.5 ms or 1 ms, although power was increased or decreased if evoked currents were unusually weak or strong, respectively. For two-wavelength optical excitation, single flashes of 470 nm (one msec,&lt;0.5 mW) and 625 nm LEDs (3 ms, 1.4 mW, Thorlabs) were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology data analysis</title><p>Data collected by WTB were analyzed either in Axograph or Matlab, data collected by BCJ in <italic>Ephus</italic> were analyzed in Matlab. Pooled data were processed in Matlab and R. All collected data were analyzed using the same protocols. Peak current amplitude was calculated relative to mean current during 50 ms baseline prior to the stimulus. In three cases the recorded oIPSCs (recorded as positive current) was completely blocked in the presences of DAMGO, yielding a small negative current deflection (residual EPSC-mediated sodium current as a result of imperfect voltage-clamp at the estimated sodium-reversal potential). To calculate agonist effects on the oIPSCs relative to baseline recordings the small negative currents were substituted with a positive current value (0.00001 pA). Signal latencies were calculated between stimulation and 10% of peak current for oEPSCs or peak of action potentials. Charge transfer was calculated by integrating recorded current during a defined time window following photostimulation, as described below, and was corrected by baseline charge transfer during a time window measured immediately prior to stimulation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref> large portion of ‘non-responding’ cells were observed in experiments from ‘tail’ injected mice (hippocampus +retrosplenial cortex). In order to determine the charge transfer in an unbiased way, we first determined the averaged onset, rise, and decay time of monosynaptic inputs to the recorded cells (thalamic and cortical inputs to the MSNs, thalamic inputs to the L2/3 or L5 pyramidal neurons), and determined the integration time window (averaged rise +decay time) and the time position relative to stimulation (averaged onset time) for individual cell types. These cell type-specific integration time windows and positions allowed us to determine the charge transfer in an unbiased way in both responding and non-responding cells. Charge transfer of polysynaptic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>) were calculated as integrated current between onset and decay time window, both defined as 10% of peak current.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Retrograde bead injection and tissue processing</title><p>Red and green retrobeads (Lumafluor, Durham, NC) were injected similar to viral injections described above with the exception that 100 and 200 nl of retrobeads were injected into the cortex and striatum, respectively. Five days post-injection, mice were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Brains were dissected and stored overnight in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Sections containing injection sites were sliced at 100 µm thickness, and sections containing the thalamus were sliced at 50 µm thickness and stained with DAPI (300 nM in PBS) to label nuclei.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescent imaging and analysis for retrograde bead labeling</title><p>Thalamic sections containing red and green retrobeads were imaged at 20x magnification using three laser lines (405, 488 and 561 nm) on a Yokogawa spinning disk confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). A Z-stack series was acquired with a 0.44 µm optical section thickness, and for each image 3 x 3 tiles with 15% overlap were applied. Laser power and exposure times were identical for all images. Retrobead-labeled cells were manually counted on Imaris 9.0 software (Bitplane) and each slice was recounted twice with consistent exposure settings to generate an average. A cell was counted if at least two punctate fluorescent spots were orthogonally detected directly adjacent to DAPI-labeled nuclei. Colocalization of dual-color spots was quantified using a built-in Imaris function with criteria that red and green-labeled spots must be spaced no more than 8 µm apart.</p><p>Subsequent imaging alignment was performed according to the mouse brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franklin and Paxinos, 2001</xref>), and aligned using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

Injection sites were imaged on a brightfield epifluorescent macroscope (Olympus MVX10) using identical settings, and uniform thresholds were established using fluorescent values from the top 90% brightest pixels (ImageJ).

We first pretreated the tissue with solutions from the pretreatment kit to permeabilize the tissue, and then incubated with protease for 30 min and the hybridization probes for another 2 hr at 40°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>PV/DOR Immunohistochemistry</title><p>A previously described immunostaining protocol was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bardoni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scherrer et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, five to eight week-old mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine and perfused transcardially with 0.1 M PBS, followed by 4% formaldehyde solution in 0.1 M PB. The brain was dissected, post-fixed for 4 hr at 4°C, and cryoprotected overnight in 30% sucrose in PBS. Frozen brain tissue was then sectioned at 40 µm and incubated with a 5% NDST blocking solution (0.3% Triton X-100 solution in 0.1 M PBS plus with 5% normal donkey serum) for at least 1 hr. The primary antibody was diluted in the same solution, and incubated with brain sections overnight at 4°C. After washing the primary antibody three times for 5 min with 0.3% Triton X-100 solution in 0.1 M PBS, sections were incubated with secondary antibody solution in 1% NDST solution at room temperature for 2 hr. Sections were then mounted on microscope slides with Fluoromount (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) after washing with PB for three times for 5 min. Images were acquired with a confocal microscope (Leica DM2500, Wetzlar, Germany). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-GFP: Abcam (chicken; 1:1,000); anti-Parvalbumin: Swant (goat; 1:1,000).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>For electrophysiology experiments, to avoid observer-bias all data was quantified using automated custom-written analysis software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jongbloets et al., 2019</xref>) followed by manual confirmation. For in-situ hybridization experiments, signals were manually counted, and cells displaying five or more labeled dots in their cytoplasm were considered positive. All experiments involving conditions (baseline, agonist, antagonist) were first tested with a Skillings-Mack test for significant changes in any of the conditions. Only when a significant change was reported (α = 0.05), three Wilcoxon signed-rank tests between combination of conditions was performed, unless stated otherwise. The Skillings-mack test is a non-parametric test, which allows for missing data points (unbalanced design). Dual-channelrhodopsin experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and Figure 1—figure supplement 1h S2H) required a linear mixed model (LMM) since a 3-way ANOVA could not be performed due to unbalanced design. LMM accounted for correlation of measurement within individual cells (random effects). The fixed effects in the LMM were opioid type (mu vs. delta), source (MThal vs. ACC/PFC), condition (baseline vs. agonist vs. antagonist), as well as all interactions referred in the text as two-way (opioid type x source, opioid type x condition, source x condition) and three-way (opioid type x source x condition). Due to the paucity of observations (n = 7/8) and high number of fixed effects, we relaxed the type I error for the LMM to detect significant trends in interactions (α = 0.15). <italic>Post-hoc</italic> analysis of <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis for specific comparisons were performed using linear combinations based on the LMM (α = 0.05). All source data and related custom software for quantification and statistical analysis are available at GitLab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jongbloets et al., 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/opi_syn_circuit">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/opi_syn_circuit</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher Ford (Reviewer #1); Carlos Paladini (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines how opioid receptors modulate synaptic transmission in thalamo-cortico-striatal circuits. Opioids strongly regulates these circuits and determining exactly where in these circuits these receptors act to gate thalamo-cortical activity into the striatum is an important question. The authors used optogenetics (two color ChR2 chrimson/chronos) in brain slices to thoroughly identify where and how mu and δ opioid receptor alter circuit activity in these regions. They show that MORs but not DORs strongly inhibit medial thalamic glutamatergic inputs to the DMS and ACC, and that a proportion of mThal neurons that project to the ACC also project to the DMS. Within this circuit DORs are expressed primarily on PV interneurons in the ACC where they function to regulate feed-forward inhibition into the ACC. Finally, they show that MORs inhibit thalamo-cortical-striatal circuits while DORs alternatively disinhibit these circuits. This work advances our understanding of how opioids mechanistically can alter circuit activity that likely underlies the affective-motivational aspects of pain processing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following points must be addressed before final acceptance of the manuscript. Most of these concerns can be addressed with additional analysis, modifications of the figures and extension of the Discussion section. For your understanding of these essential revisions, the full reviews are appended below.</p><p>1) In Figure 3E,F, it is unclear what proportion of MSNs exhibited an EPSC when AAV2-retro-Cre was injected into the AAC and AAV-DiO-ChR2 was injected into the MThal. Further describing the proportion of cells in the DMS exhibited EPSCs would help show the distribution of cells that receive input from mThal cells that also project to the ACC. A scatter plot of the responders/non-responders of MSNs that exhibited EPSCs would be informative.</p><p>2) There is concern about the lack of reversal (due to no application of antagonist) or application of antagonist that does not reverse the opioid inhibition of the synaptic response/firing of the cell. In several experiments neurons are included in the analysis where the opioid inhibition is not reversed by the antagonist (e.g. Figure 4C,F; Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,F, Figure 5C). There also appear to be cells that have a data point for the agonist but without a connected data point for the antagonist. For example, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 4C,F, Figure 5. Of particular concern is the data shown in figure 4f which is pivotal to the interpretation of the data presented in this study. The effect of DPDPE on the IPSC seems very variable. In some cells the agonist inhibited the response and this was sometimes reversed, sometimes no antagonist response is shown (for largest inhibition) and in some cases the antagonist produced a large overshoot in the size of the synaptic current. There only appears to be one cell where δ receptor activation reduces the size of the IPSC and this is reversed to baseline by the antagonist. How could these changes in synaptic responses be due to activation of the relevant opioid receptor if they were not reversed by the relevant antagonist? If there is a biological basis for it, rather than experimental, it would be interesting to see it discussed.</p><p>3) The authors suggest that overall activation of the striatum will determine whether the person experiences the affective aspect of pain (Introduction). Is there evidence that activation of the striatum, regardless of whether this comes from the thalamus or cortex, is aversive? Or do the different inputs to the striatum result in a different experience of the aversive component of pain?</p><p>4) It is surprising that, given the substantial circuit differences from D1 and D2 spiny projection neuron activation, that D1 and D2 SPNs were not identified. Although the differential effect of MOR agonist alleviates this concern, it is nonetheless preferable to have an independent measure that each laser activates distinct pathways. When activating the 470 laser and the 625 laser simultaneously, the currents should sum linearly if they are from distinct inputs.</p><p>5) Does Figure 6B show action potentials? These must be escaped action currents. Nevertheless, they appear to have half-widths of 3 ms. Using escaped action currents as a measure of firing rate may be affected by the &quot;voltage command&quot; even when not broken in to the whole-cell mode.</p><p>6) Do the specific MThal inputs to ACC synapse on the ACC projections to DMS?</p><p>7) Although different opioids may have differing effects, it is difficult to discern what the endogenous effect of opioids may be on the circuit. MOR activation on MThal to ACC pyramidal pathway causes a decrease in EPSC amplitude and a decrease in IPSC amplitude. Meanwhile, DOR activation causes a decrease in IPSC amplitude in ACC pyramidal neurons. What is the net effect on firing?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the present manuscript Birdsong and Jongloets et al., examine how opioid receptors modulate synaptic transmission in thalamo-cortico-striatal circuits. Over a series of careful experiments, the authors use optogenetics in brain slices to thoroughly identify where and how mu and δ opioid receptor alter circuit activity in these regions. As opioids are well known to strongly regulate these circuits determining exactly where in these circuits these receptors act to gate thalamo-cortical activity into the striatum is a significant advance. The authors make good use of two color ChR2 (chrimson/chronos) to determine that MORs but not DORs strongly inhibit medial thalamic glutamatergic inputs to the DMS and ACC, and that a proportion of mThal neurons that project to the ACC also project to the DMS. They go on to show that within this circuit DORs are expressed primarily on PV interneurons in the ACC where they function to regulate feed-foreward inhibition into the ACC. Finally, using the clever combination of cell attached recordings and dual recordings in the ACC and DMS they show that MORs inhibit thalamo-cortical-striatal circuits while DORs alternatively disinhibit these circuits.</p><p>The experiments and controls have been performed well and carefully analyzed/interpreted. Based on the work provided in the manuscript and supplemental figures I believe that the conclusions are well justified and no further experiments are required. The exciting aspect of this work is that marks a significant advance in furthering our understanding of how opioids mechanistically can alter circuit activity that likely underlies the affective-motivational aspects of pain processing. Together, with the carefully performed experiments and well written manuscript make it appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>My only suggestion relates to the presentation of data in Figure 3. It was unclear what proportion of MSNs exhibited an EPSC when AAV2-retro-Cre was injected into the AAC and AAV-DiO-ChR2 was injected into the MThal (Figure 3E,F)? A scatter plot of the responders/non-responders of MSNs that exhibited EPSCs would be informative.

The anterior cingulate cortex and the medial thalamus projections were individually stimulated by optogenetic activation of either Chrimson or ChR2. The mThal to Str pathway was sensitive to mu receptor agonism whereas the ACC to Str pathway was insensitive to both MOR and DOR activation. However, the mThal to ACC projection was sensitive to MOR activation. This creates a circuit whereby mThal afferents synapsing directly on ACC pyramidal neurons are sensitive to MOR while inhibitory interneurons in the ACC are sensitive to DOR.

Most of these concerns can be addressed with additional analysis, modifications of the figures and extension of the discussion. For your understanding of these essential revisions, the full reviews are appended below.</p><p>1) In Figure 3E,F, it is unclear what proportion of MSNs exhibited an EPSC when AAV2-retro-Cre was injected into the AAC and AAV-DiO-ChR2 was injected into the MThal. Further describing the proportion of cells in the DMS exhibited EPSCs would help show the distribution of cells that receive input from mThal cells that also project to the ACC. A scatter plot of the responders/non-responders of MSNs that exhibited EPSCs would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the question of how frequently ACC-projecting MThal inputs synapse to the MSNs in the DMS is an interesting one but might not be possible to address with the limitation of existing reagents and methods. This is mainly due to two factors, both of which affect the interpretation of non-responders. (1) The existing retrograde viruses, including rAAV2-retro we used here, have been improved in terms of label efficiency but are far from 100%. Therefore, we cannot virally infect all axons within the ACC that arise from the MThal by our viral combination of rAAV2-retro expressing Cre-recombinase in the ACC and AAV2 expressing DIO-ChR2-EYFP in the MThal. As a result, if an MSN does not exhibit an EPSC upon light stimulation, it does not necessarily mean that it is not receiving ACC-projecting MThal inputs. (2). Whether an EPSC, thus a synaptic connection, can be detected also depends on the expression level of ChR2, which can vary across animals, and is a known caveat of the optogenetic tools. The smaller EPSCs we observed in these experiments (Figure 3F) relative to other experiments (Figure 1C and Figure 2B) is likely due to the low efficiency of the retrograde Cre-recombinase expression in the MThal cells which resulted in much lower expression level of ChR2 in the MThal compared to that expression observed in other experiments.</p><p>In summary, given the limitation of the current technology and intersectional nature of this experiment, in our system, the lack of EPSCs does not lead to the conclusion of lack of bona fide synaptic connections. Therefore, we feel that in this case, the scatter plot will not address the question the reviewer is interested in. In the meantime, we now emphasize in the main text that what we can claim is the existence of the ACC-projecting MThal neurons which also project to the MSN in the DMS, and this projection is sensitive to enkephalin (subsection “Thalamostriatal and thalamocortical projections can arise from the same medial thalamic neuronal population”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is concern about the lack of reversal (due to no application of antagonist) or application of antagonist that does not reverse the opioid inhibition of the synaptic response/firing of the cell. In several experiments neurons are included in the analysis where the opioid inhibition is not reversed by the antagonist (e.g. figure 4C,F; Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,F, Figure 5C). There also appear to be cells that have a data point for the agonist but without a connected data point for the antagonist. For example, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 4C,F, Figure 5. Of particular concern is the data shown in Figure 4F which is pivotal to the interpretation of the data presented in this study. The effect of DPDPE on the IPSC seems very variable. In some cells the agonist inhibited the response and this was sometimes reversed, sometimes no antagonist response is shown (for largest inhibition) and in some cases the antagonist produced a large overshoot in the size of the synaptic current. There only appears to be one cell where δ receptor activation reduces the size of the IPSC and this is reversed to baseline by the antagonist. How could these changes in synaptic responses be due to activation of the relevant opioid receptor if they were not reversed by the relevant antagonist? If there is a biological basis for it, rather than experimental, it would be interesting to see it discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the variability in effect of DPDPE on the IPSCs is a mix of experimental limitations in this biological system. First, the IPSCs are generally large and disynaptic or polysynaptic meaning small changes in excitability can have large effects. If the IPSCs are polysynaptic, inhibiting the PV cells would lead to disinhibition of other pyramidal cells which may in turn excite more PV cells as a negative feedback. Because a small number of PV cells densely innervate pyramidal cells, adding or losing the input of a single PV cell can have a large effect on IPSC amplitude particularly when the frequency of optical stimulation is low and the number of trials that are averaged is limited.</p><p>We have established standards for recording quality and health of cells. In some experiments, cell health or recording criteria did not hold long enough for a full set of pharmacology experiments, e.g., only agonists were added and no antagonists were added. We still include those cells with the part that all criteria were met. That is why some data points did not have antagonist data (these data points lack a gray dashed line). For this reason, we were very careful with our statistical analyses and utilized steps to specifically deal with the unmatched data points. As stated in subsection “Quantification and Statistical Analysis”, “The Skillings-mack test is a non-parametric test, which allows for missing data points (unbalanced design).”</p><p>The lack of reversal in some examples may be due to incomplete reversal as a result of competition between DPDPE and naltrindole. Additionally, desensitization or rundown of the channelrhodopsin currents in the MThal to PV synapses may also contribute to the non-full reversal with antagonists. In combination with the notion above that small changes in the EPSP amplitude evoked in putative PV neurons could bring the PV cells below action potential threshold, a small change in channel rundown can have a major effect in this experimental setup.</p><p>In addition, these experiments involve stepping the membrane potential between -60 mV and +5 mV. There was potentially some contamination of the IPSCs with EPSCs as a small inward current is noticeable in the example traces in Figure 4E. Small drift in the actual holding potential or changes in space clamping over the experiment could also result in slight changes of the relative contributions of EPSCs and IPSCs, and thus the peak amplitude of the IPSCs measured.</p><p>In Figure 5, multiple possibilities also exist for some non-full reversal effects. We believe that the reversal of DPDPE inhibition by naltrindole is slow, and therefore may not have been completely reversed in a timeframe relevant for these experiments. This could be due to kinetics of competition binding, or the inhibition may be mediated in part by kinase activity which can have effects after G-protein signaling is terminated. In addition, some other forms of plasticity could be induced by DOR activation which would be slow to reverse on the timescale of these experiments.</p><p>We do want to experimentally address whether the issue is due to non-specific effects of the pharmacological reagents we used. The rationale is that one potential possibility of the partial irreversibility is because DPDPE may modulate synaptic transmission via DOR-independent pathway, therefore DOR antagonist naltrindole would not able to reverse the DPDPE-mediated modulation of IPSCs. Therefore, we have performed an additional experiment which is to repeat the experiments shown in Figure 4D-F, except that we applied DOR-antagonist naltrindole first, followed by DOR-agonist DPDPE. AAV2-CAG-ChR2(H134R)-TdTomato virus was injected in the MThal, and feed-forward inhibitory inputs to L5 pyramidal neurons the ACC were evaluated (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). We recorded optically-evoked IPSCs (oIPSCs), and first perfused DOR-antagonist naltrindole followed by DOR-agonist DPDPE. Naltrindole pre-treatment prevented the DPDPE-mediated modulation of oIPSC, as observed in Figure 4 and Figure 5, (Figure 4—figure supplement 3), indicating that DPDPE modulates GABAergic neurotransmission via a DOR-dependent pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors suggest that overall activation of the striatum will determine whether the person experiences the affective aspect of pain (Introduction). Is there evidence that activation of the striatum, regardless of whether this comes from the thalamus or cortex, is aversive? Or do the different inputs to the striatum result in a different experience of the aversive component of pain?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. Our original rationale was that since both increased ACC and medial thalamic activities are known to be associated with pain perception (e.g., Casey et al., 1994; Davis et al., 1997; Peyron et al., 1999, Peyron et al., 2000), and these two regions most strongly converge in the DMMS (Hunnicutt et al., 2016), we predicted that decreased activity of these terminals in the DMS would be involved in pain relief, though this has not been directly demonstrated to our knowledge. We have now re-worded this part to reflect that MOR and DOR activation is predicted to modulate pain responses in opposite ways (Introduction, “Thus, MOR and DOR activation are predicted to play opposite roles in pain processing mediated by this thalamo-cortico-striatal circuit”), and we think this is better reflective of our data and current knowledge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is surprising that, given the substantial circuit differences from D1 and D2 spiny projection neuron activation, that D1 and D2 SPNs were not identified. Although the differential effect of MOR agonist alleviates this concern, it is nonetheless preferable to have an independent measure that each laser activates distinct pathways. When activating the 470 laser and the 625 laser simultaneously, the currents should sum linearly if they are from distinct inputs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that investigating cell type-specific effects onto D1 and D2 MSNs would be interesting. So far, under our experimental conditions, we have not observed obvious heterogeneous responses, at least not a bi-modal distribution as one might expect if there are major differences in D1 versus D2 responses, of opioid inhibition of MThal inputs to the MSNs, indicating that inputs to both D1 and D2 MSNs might be modulated in a similar fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Previous work comparing the excitatory input kinetics between D1 and D2 MSNs suggest that the risetime of mEPSCs are slower in D2 MSNs (Al-muhtasib et al., 2018). If the DAMGO effect on EPSC amplitude is different between D1 versus D2 MSNs, a correlation is expected between baseline EPSC risetime and DAMGO effect on EPSC amplitude in our data. Under current conditions, no significant correlation between DAMGO effect on EPSC amplitude and baseline EPSC risetime obtained from all MSNs is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). Furthermore, comparison of two putative MSN subpopulations, defined using a cluster analysis among all recorded MSNs based on the baseline EPSC kinetics (Figure 4—figure supplement 3C), yielded non-significantly different distributions of DAMGO effect on EPSC (Figure 4—figure supplement 3D). Together, this suggests that so far, there is no evidence that observed mu-opioid mediated suppression of thalamostriatal inputs is dependent on the identity of the recorded MSN. We think the systematic investigation of cell-type specific response is beyond the scope of current manuscript but an interesting question for future investigation. We have now added a notion that we have not observed any evidence for opioids’ modulation of the thalamic inputs that suggest potential D1 and D2 MSN specific effects (subsection “Opioid modulation of the thalamo-cortico-striatal circuitry”).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>No clear bi-modal or two population effects detected in MOR-mediated suppression of thalamostriatal inputs to the MSNs in the DMS.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Histogram of cell distribution based on effects of mu-opioid agonist DAMGO on optically-evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitude recorded in the MSNs; n = 40 neurons from 25 mice.

From these data the degree of cross-activation was estimated to be very low (approximately 4% for Chrimson by 470 nm, and &lt; 1% for ChR2 and CsChR by 625 nm). We feel that the cross-activation data together with the data demonstrating a clear inhibition of the 470 nm-evoked currents by DAMGO with no effects on the 625 nm-evoked currents should alleviate the concern of unintended activation with 625 nm light. To further verify our results and conclusions that specific opioid receptor types modulate distinct inputs to the striatum we performed independent control experiments as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. In these experiments individual projection origins, i.e. ACC, PFC, AMThal, and MThal, were injected with only one ChR2 variant, CsChR, and subsequently tested their sensitivity to opioid modulation. We confirmed that DAMGO specifically modulated the thalamostriatal projections, and therefore that these projections represent functionally and pharmacologically distinct inputs compared to the corticostriatal projections. Thus, we feel confident that there was very little cross talk and any potential cross-activation did not change any interpretations of the data.</p><p>We did not attempt the additivity analysis suggested due to the fact that the activation of Chrimson by 470 nm light is still not 0 (as mentioned above, 4%; Figure 1—figure supplement 1). While the low intensity of 470 nm stimulation we used may not evoke large EPSCs, we cannot exclude the possibility that 470 nm and 625 nm light together lead to non-linear effects for reasons beyond our current understanding of these tools.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Does Figure 6B show action potentials? These must be escaped action currents. Nevertheless, they appear to have half-widths of 3 ms.

Voltage clamp mode setting on the amplifier was used and the voltage command was set and adjusted when needed during the experiment, to obtain an amplifier current of 0 pA. This approach ensures that the spike activity of the recorded neuron was not influenced by the cell-attached mode settings, since no current is flowing between the cell and electrode (Perkins, 2006). The firing rate therefore should not be affected by the voltage command. In addition, quantification of the action potential widths (width at half-max action current amplitude, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>) during baseline and agonist applications (DAMGO and DPDPE) were combined, showing that the mean action potential width is 1.36 ms, consistent with the reported action potential widths in L5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse ACC (1.13 ms, Lee et al., 2007) and in L5 pyramidal neurons in the neocortex (2.08 ms, see neuronelectro.org).

MOR activation on MThal to ACC pyramidal pathway causes a decrease in EPSC amplitude and a decrease in IPSC amplitude. Meanwhile, DOR activation causes a decrease in IPSC amplitude in ACC pyramidal neurons. What is the net effect on firing?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the endogenous effect of opioids is an import question and a future direction to take. However, addressing the endogenous effects of opioid receptor activation is currently difficult and is beyond the scope of the current work. The main obstacle for addressing this question is the ability to reliably release and quantify the release of endogenous opioids, e.g., enkephalin or dynorphin in mouse brain slice. We did attempt to trigger release of enkephalin in transgenic mouse lines, which expressed channelrhodopsin in putative enkephalin-releasing cells (<italic>PENK-IRES2-Cre;Ai32</italic> mice). Unfortunately, it was difficult to establish the reliable stimulation protocols for enkephalin release due to lack of reliable ways to measure enkephalin release. For the same reason, it is difficult to pharmacologically address the net effects on firing without knowing whether/how the endogenous opioid receptor is activated. These pharmacological agents, e.g. enkephalins, endorphins and dynorphins, have differential affinities for mu, δ and kappa opioid receptors, though the affinity differences can be minimal between mu and δ receptors (e.g. Raynor et al., 1994). Differences in affinity, the sites of action, and the concentration of endogenous agonists will together determine the net effect of firing in the ACC. Based on our findings, our prediction is that at modest concentrations of endogenous opioid receptor ligands with highest affinities for MORs preferably reduce ACC firing, and therefore suppress both direct thalamostriatal and the indirect thalamo-cortico-striatal pathways, whereas those endogenous ligands with highest affinities for DORs, at relatively selective concentrations increase ACC firing. Because IPSCs are sensitive to both mu and δ agonists, low to moderate concentrations of non-selective agonists would be predicted to impact feed-forward inhibition more profoundly and have a net excitatory effect, while higher concentration would greatly diminish EPSCs producing a net inhibitory effect. The future work that measures the endogenous ligand release sites and concentrations will provide key information for answering these questions. Since the direct testing of these predictions is not feasible with our current means, and the related topic might be work of its own in the future, we have not included major discussions but have added a short one to this point (subsection “Opposing effects of opioid subtypes on circuitry modulation”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
