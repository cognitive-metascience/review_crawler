Type IIB topoisomerases and their homologs support both archaeal/plant viability and meiotic recombination. Topo VI, a prototypical type IIB topoisomerase, comprises two Top6A and two Top6B protomers; how these subunits cooperate to engage two DNA segments and link ATP turnover to DNA transport is poorly understood. Using multiple biochemical approaches, we show that Top6B, which harbors the ATPase activity of topo VI, recognizes and exploits the DNA crossings present in supercoiled DNA to stimulate subunit dimerization by ATP. Top6B self-association in turn induces extensive DNA bending, which is needed to support duplex cleavage by Top6A. Our observations explain how topo VI tightly coordinates DNA crossover recognition and ATP binding with strand scission, providing useful insights into the operation of type IIB topoisomerases and related meiotic recombination and GHKL ATPase machineries.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31724.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Each human cell contains genetic information stored on approximately two meters of DNA.

These results could also be generalized to other enzymes, for example those that help the genetic processes at play when sperm and egg cells form.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ATP-dependent molecular machines</kwd><kwd>DNA topology</kwd><kwd>type II topoisomerases</kwd><kwd>protein-nucleic acid interactions</kwd><kwd>protein allostery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 CA077373</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>James M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE 1106400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wendorff</surname><given-names>Timothy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The engagement of DNA crossings is shown to license ATP hydrolysis and DNA cleavage by topoisomerase VI, a finding with mechanistic ramifications for related GHKL ATPases and meiotic recombination machineries.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The appropriate control of transcription, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation are essential to cell proliferation. These three processes are antagonized, however, by the double helical structure of DNA, which supercoils in response to helicase and polymerase activity and which promotes chromosome interlinkage during replicative synthesis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang, 2002</xref>]). In all cells, enzymes known as topoisomerases are used to overcome the natural topological impediments arising from these physical transactions that impinge on DNA. Many different topoisomerase families exist to relieve super-helical tension and DNA entanglements, all of which transiently form either single strand or double strand breaks to manipulate DNA topology (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Forterre and Gadelle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schoeffler and Berger, 2008</xref>]).</p><p>Type II topoisomerases introduce transient double strand breaks into DNA, and play a key role in unlinking catenated DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Holm et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Spell and Holm, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zechiedrich and Cozzarelli, 1995</xref>). The type IIA subfamily of topoisomerases, which are principally used in bacteria and eukaryotes, utilize a so-called ‘two-gate’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roca et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roca and Wang, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roca and Wang, 1992</xref>), in which one DNA duplex (termed the transport- or ‘T’-segment) is captured by one half of the enzyme, actively passed through a second, protein-bound DNA duplex (the gate- or ‘G’-segment), and expelled through the other end of the enzyme. T-segment capture is regulated by the ATP-dependent closure of one subunit dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roca and Wang, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wigley et al., 1991</xref>), referred to as the ‘ATP-gate’, while a pair of catalytic tyrosine residues responsible for G-segment cleavage and opening reside in a second, separable subunit-subunit contact point termed the ‘DNA-gate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morais Cabral et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Morrison and Cozzarelli, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tse et al., 1980</xref>). In most instances, repeated cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis allow for the processive removal of multiple DNA crossings. The use of ATP by type II topoisomerases in general has been proposed to serve as a mechanism for preventing the inappropriate formation of potentially cytotoxic DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bates et al., 2011</xref>); however, the molecular basis for the coupling between ATP turnover and DNA cleavage has remained enigmatic for the superfamily as a whole.</p><p>The type IIB topoisomerases, which are exemplified by DNA topoisomerase VI (topo VI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bergerat et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bergerat et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Forterre et al., 2007</xref>), share evolutionarily conserved catalytic elements with their type IIA counterparts but are structurally distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corbett and Berger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nichols et al., 1999</xref>). Topo VI comprises an A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> heterotetramer formed by two Top6A and two Top6B subunits: Top6A forms a ‘U’-shaped dimer that serves as the DNA-gate for G-segment cleavage and opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bergerat et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nichols et al., 1999</xref>), while Top6B constitutes the ATP-gate and dimerizes in response to nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corbett and Berger, 2003</xref>). Topo VI is thought to serve as the primary topoisomerase for DNA decatenation and supercoil relaxation in archaea and is required for endoreduplication and cell growth in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bergerat et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bergerat et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartung et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sugimoto-Shirasu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yin et al., 2002</xref>). Topo VI is also found sporadically throughout the bacterial domain, and a single chain variant, topo VIII, is found in certain plasmid-based mobile elements as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Forterre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gadelle et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the type IIB topoisomerase scaffold has been co-opted to serve as the machinery responsible for introducing double-strand DNA breaks to initiate meiotic recombination in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bergerat et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vrielynck et al., 2016</xref>). How topo VI and its cousins engage DNA segments has yet to be determined.</p><p>The ATPase region is generally well-preserved between type IIA and type IIB topoisomerases, with the exception of an additional helix-two-turn-helix (H2TH) domain of unknown function found in topo VI and topo VIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bergerat et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corbett and Berger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gadelle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wigley et al., 1991</xref>). By contrast, the catalytic domains that comprise the DNA breakage-reunion region of type IIA and IIB enzymes have been extensively shuffled. One consequence of this rearrangement is that Top6A lacks a third subunit-subunit interface present in the type IIA enzymes, the ‘C-gate’ dimerization domain, which is thought to help mitigate the risk of aberrant double-strand break formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bates et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nichols et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Roca, 2004</xref>). To compensate for the loss of this element, type IIB topoisomerases appear to have evolved a stringent mechanism for controlling strand scission by Top6A that represses transesterase activity until ATP productively binds to Top6B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buhler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buhler et al., 2001</xref>). How Top6B activates Top6A is unknown; however, given that Spo11, a paralog of Top6A used in meiotic recombination, is also thought to require activation for DNA cleavage, aspects of this control mechanism may be broadly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lam and Keeney, 2014</xref>).</p><p>To better understand how type IIB topoisomerases coordinate DNA cleavage, we performed a comprehensive biochemical investigation of <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic> topo VI, a model mesophilic type IIB topoisomerase. We find that topo VI discriminates between linear and supercoiled DNA using an extensive and unanticipated DNA binding interface that specifically recognizes DNA crossings. Both gate closure and ATP hydrolysis by Top6B as well as transesterase activity by Top6A require engagement along this entire interface. Site-directed mutagenesis studies show that three conserved, positively charged regions on Top6B sense both the DNA bends and crossings present in supercoiled substrates and further serve to couple the binding of DNA crossings to B-subunit dimerization, nucleotide turnover, and DNA strand scission. Our results explain why type IIB topoisomerases absolutely depend upon the ATPase activity of the B-subunit to generate double strand breaks. These observations in turn reinforce the functional importance for DNA bending and potential T-segment-sensing elements in the related type IIA topoisomerases, and also provide insights as to how recently discovered meiotic Top6B homologs might promote Spo11 mediated strand scission during meiotic recombination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Topo VI is a distributive DNA relaxase that preferentially recognizes DNA crossings</title><p>We began our investigations of type IIB topoisomerase mechanism by measuring the affinity of <italic>M. mazei</italic> topo VI for DNAs of varying length or topological status.

Topo VI was incubated with the fluorescein-labeled 70 bp duplex DNA and varying amounts of unlabeled, supercoiled plasmid or sheared salmon-sperm DNA. The relative affinity of topo VI for each substrate was determined by monitoring how well the competitor DNAs interfered with binding of the labeled probe. The response to the titration of supercoiled DNA or sheared salmon-sperm DNA was fit to an explicit competitive binding model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang, 1995</xref>) to indirectly estimate affinities for the unlabeled substrates. Based on these measurements, topo VI showed a ~60-fold preference for supercoiled DNA (K<sub>I,app</sub> = 0.6 ± 0.3 nM) compared to sheared salmon-sperm DNA (K<sub>I,app</sub> = 39.3 ± 2.6 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The difference in affinity between supercoiled and linear DNA suggested that topo VI might preferentially engage supercoiled substrates by binding to DNA crossings, DNA bends, or both. To distinguish between these modes, we examined the time-dependent processivity of topo VI in relaxing negatively supercoiled DNA. For type II topoisomerases in general, processivity describes the ability of a single enzyme to remain bound to a G-segment DNA during multiple strand passage events. For topo VI, the progress of ATP-dependent supercoil relaxation was followed by native agarose-gel electrophoresis, using a slight molar excess of plasmid over enzyme to disfavor the binding of two topo VI molecules to a single DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A highly processive topoisomerase, such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> topoisomerase II (<italic>Sc</italic>Top2), removes the majority of supercoils on a closed circular DNA in a single enzyme-DNA encounter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) as evidenced by a paucity of intermediate DNA topoisomers between the supercoiled substrate and fully relaxed plasmid product. In contrast, topo VI produced a broad distribution of intermediate topoisomers that were gradually converted to the fully relaxed distribution, a behavior more consistent with low processivity.</p><p>To more thoroughly investigate supercoil processing by topo VI, we followed plasmid relaxation using two differently sized plasmids in a chase experiment. Following pre-incubation of a defined amount of topo VI with a slight molar excess of a primary 2.9 kb plasmid, a second, larger plasmid (6.5 kb) was added along with ATP to serve as a competing substrate for any dissociated enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In the case of a processive enzyme such as <italic>Sc</italic>Top2, the competing plasmid does not alter the initial rate at which a fully relaxed topoisomer distribution of the primary plasmid is generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, topo VI again displayed clearly distributive behavior, relaxing both plasmids more slowly and simultaneously. Although assay conditions can modulate whether a topoisomerase acts processively or distributively (salt concentration in particular), both timecourse experiments were run under low-salt conditions where type IIA topoisomerases are primarily processive. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that topo VI operates by a principally distributive mechanism, whereby once a DNA crossing is resolved by strand passage, the enzyme will tend to dissociate from the substrate before acting on a new crossing and/or bent DNA segment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Topo VI actively uses DNA crossings to couple ATP hydrolysis with DNA strand passage</title><p>A defining characteristic of type II topoisomerases is the coupling of ATP turnover with efficient and rapid strand passage.

The observation that supercoiled DNA is more effective than linear substrates in activating ATP turnover indicates that topo VI not only interrogates DNA for specific topological features, but that its activity is potentiated when such features are recognized.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31724.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Top6B dimerization and ATP hydrolysis activity are stimulated by supercoiled DNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rate of steady-state ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by topo VI alone, topo VI incubated with 400 μM basepairs of linear sheared salmon-sperm DNA (800:1 basepair to enzyme ratio), or topo VI incubated with 400 μM basepairs of 2.9 kb supercoiled plasmid DNA (800:1 basepair to enzyme ratio) as a function of ATP concentration.

A mechanism in which supercoiled DNA binding, in particular T-segment engagement, promotes Top6B dimerization could thus explain why supercoiled DNA stimulates ATP turnover. To test this idea, we developed a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) assay to monitor ATPase domain dimerization in the context of the topo VI holoenzyme. We first identified and mutated surface cysteines to non-reactive residues to create a fully functional ‘cys-lite’ construct of the holoenzyme.

ATP hydrolysis rates were again measured using a coupled assay; however, ATP was held at 2 mM for these experiments, while the concentration of DNA substrate was varied to characterize the stimulatory effects of each substrate on each enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source datas 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">2</xref>). No DNA-stimulated ATP turnover was observed for either of the Stalk/WKxY mutants. Interestingly, the H2TH<sup>AAA</sup> and H2TH<sup>EEE</sup> mutants, which exhibited large defects in strand passage, showed similar levels of ATP hydrolysis stimulation by both DNA substrates as compared to wildtype topo VI. Moreover, whereas no additional ATP turnover was observed for the KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> and KGRR<sup>EEE</sup> mutants on sheared salmon-sperm DNA, both variants showed an increased maximal rate of DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis compared to the wild-type enzyme on supercoiled DNA (albeit with a more weakly coupled response to DNA concentration than wildtype topo VI or the H2TH mutants as judged by K<sub>stim,DNA</sub>). All six mutants exhibited basal hydrolysis rates similar to both wild-type topo VI and the ATPase-deficient Top6AB<sup>E44A</sup> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the DNA-stimulated responses of each topo VI mutant are directly attributable to the introduced alterations. Collectively, these data indicate that the abrogation of strand passage activity by the KGRR loop mutants stems in part from a loss of an essential DNA-sensing motif required to carry out strand passage. However, unlike the Stalk/WKxY mutants, the KGRR loop mutants retain some feature which allows supercoiled, but not short linear DNAs, to promote ATP hydrolysis. Mutations to the H2TH domain additionally appear to largely decouple strand passage from ATP hydrolysis, yet do not appreciably alter the DNA dependence of ATPase activity. This result implies a role for the H2TH domain in facilitating A- and B-subunit coordination to minimize futile cycling.</p><p>Since all three interfaces identified affect strand passage activity and its coupling to ATP turnover, we next tested whether the observed differences result directly from weakened binding to duplex DNA. Using fluorescence anisotropy, the affinity of each mutant was assessed for a range of duplex lengths (30, 40, 60, and 70 bp) found to exhibit moderate-to-tight binding to wild-type topo VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source datas 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">3</xref>). As with native topo VI, a single-site binding model adequately described the DNA-binding isotherms for the mutant panel; the one exception was the data for the H2TH<sup>EEE</sup> mutant, which fit better to a cooperative model. This result suggests that charge reversal in the H2TH region may alter how longer duplexes are bound by the enzyme—although the direct binding data suggest that H2TH<sup>EEE</sup> binds longer DNAs better than H2TH<sup>AAA</sup>, both mutants display similar affinities for a 60 and 70 bp duplex in competitive binding experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that differences in the fluorophore environment may underlie the higher K<sub>d,app</sub> values seen in the direct binding study. Both Stalk/WKxY mutants were compromised for DNA binding overall (as judged by the maximum observed changes in anisotropy), with the magnitude of the binding defects proving more severe for the acidic substitutions. This finding highlights the Stalk/WKxY region of Top6B as an important DNA-binding interface, a finding that helps explain both why the binding affinity of topo VI is higher for DNAs whose length exceeds what is necessary to bind a Top6A dimer alone and why mutations in this region lead to defects in both strand passage and ATP hydrolysis. By comparison, the KGRR loop and the H2TH domain mutants showed either no change or only a moderate decrease (for the 60 and 70 bp duplexes) in DNA affinity compared to wildtype topo VI, suggesting that these regions potentially contribute a more peripheral or secondary site of DNA binding.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31724.022</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Effect of neutralization and charge reversal mutations to Top6B on DNA binding affinity and preferential engagement of supercoiled DNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Binding of a 30, 40, 60, or 70 bp fluorescein-labeled duplex (20 nM) to topo VI mutant constructs.

To this end, the relative affinities of supercoiled plasmid and linear, sheared salmon-sperm DNA were assessed for both sets of KGRR and H2TH mutants, using the fluorescence anisotropy-based competition assay described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source datas 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">3</xref>).

Both KGRR substitutions adversely impacted the binding of random linear DNA compared to wild type as well, a result concordant with this mutant’s negligible ATPase activity on sheared salmon-sperm DNA and which further suggests that this set of substitutions may ablate a secondary DNA-binding site on the holoenzyme. Together, these data indicate that both the KGRR loop and H2TH domain contribute to the preferential binding of topo VI to supercoiled substrates as compared to sheared salmon-sperm DNA, but that neither is solely responsible for this discrimination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The KGRR loop acts as a DNA crossing sensor to regulate Top6B dimerization</title><p>Rather than contributing to overall DNA affinity, the biochemical and biophysical activities of our topo VI mutants implicate the KGRR loop and H2TH domain in recognizing supercoiled DNA and in coupling ATP hydrolysis to strand passage.

To address this question, we added the KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> and H2TH<sup>AAA</sup> mutations into the topo VI construct used to monitor the conformational status of the ATPase domain by FRET. Following purification and labeling, we measured the emission spectra of both mutants alone and bound to supercoiled DNA. Similar to the wild-type construct, both the KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> and H2TH<sup>AAA</sup> mutants showed increased FRET efficiencies in the presence of supercoiled substrate, independent of nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the ‘enzyme alone’ spectra suggest that each mutant alters the resting conformational status of the Top6B dimer compared to wild type, with the H2TH<sup>AAA</sup> mutant taking on a more open state, and the KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> mutant taking on a more closed state. Although the H2TH<sup>AAA</sup> mutant displayed a lower FRET signal than wild type, both in the presence of supercoiled DNA alone and with supercoiled DNA and nucleotide, the addition of AMPPNP produced a rapid FRET increase in the H2TH<sup>AAA</sup> mutant similar to that of native topo VI, indicating that the ATPase region of this mutant responds to supercoiled DNA and nucleotide in a wildtype-like manner. By contrast, the KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> mutant initially manifested a higher FRET signal than either wildtype topo VI or the H2TH<sup>AAA</sup> mutant in the presence of supercoiled DNA alone; however, the addition of AMPPNP failed to elicit any further increase in FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Given that ATP binding and hydrolysis rely on Top6B dimerization, and that the maximum observed ATPase rate of the KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> construct is actually greater than wild-type topo VI in the presence of supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), the high initial FRET signal for this mutant suggests that its Top6B subunits can adopt a ‘pre-dimerized’ ATPase competent state in the presence of supercoiled DNA alone. As a consequence, the rapid ATP turnover by the KGRR mutants likely arises from the decoupling of ATP hydrolysis and product release from a slow conformational change necessary for strand passage (i.e. those that drive G-segment opening and T-segment release). In this view, the KGRR loop would serve not only as a sensor of DNA crossings, but also as an element that delays ATP turnover until T-segment binding or strand passage has occurred.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The H2TH interface engages an extended G-segment to couple nucleotide-dependent Top6B dimerization with DNA cleavage</title><p>Since the H2TH domain does not appear to participate in T-segment sensing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), yet is important for the strand passage activity of topo VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we considered whether this element might instead interact with the G-segment.

Based on this model, a ~30 bp duplex would fully engage the Top6A dimer and one Stalk/WKxY element, whereas a ~40 bp duplex would be sufficient to span both Stalk/WKxY elements in a Top6A/Top6B heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

We therefore considered whether the H2TH domains might instead help bend DNA, serve as sensors for pre-bent substrates, and/or help couple B-subunit dimerization to G-segment cleavage or strand passage. To test these ideas, we first assessed the minimal length of DNA required for nucleotide-dependent G-segment cleavage. Topo VI was incubated with 40, 60, or 70 bp long 5’-labeled duplexes in the absence of nucleotide, or with ATP or AMPPNP. Reactions were analyzed by denaturing urea-formamide PAGE to separate cleaved and uncleaved oligonucleotide products. Although the absence of a T-segment strongly inhibits G-segment scission, topo VI produced clear cleavage products in the presence of either ATP or AMPPNP on the 70 bp duplex. Faint cleavage products were also produced from the 60 bp duplex, but only in the presence of AMPPNP. The length of the cleavage products suggest <italic>M. mazei</italic> topo VI is cutting DNA slightly off-center from the preferred site identified for its <italic>S. shibatae</italic> homolog; these products are instead consistent with strand scission occurring at a secondary site six nucleotides upstream of this locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buhler et al., 2001</xref>). No cleavage was seen for any condition on the 40 bp duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>We next assessed whether the H2TH domains play a role in the observed length dependence of the G-segment cleavage reaction by measuring the nucleotide-dependent cleavage activity of our functional mutant panel on a 70 bp duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The KGRR mutants showed a slight decrease in AMPPNP-dependent cleavage, while the two Stalk/WKxY mutants displayed a greater decrease in this activity (the triple glutamate substitution proved the most severely compromised). These results are consistent with the impaired affinities that these mutant enzymes show for the 70 bp substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). By contrast, neither H2TH mutant proved capable of supporting short duplex cleavage. Collectively, these findings support the idea that for a G-segment to bind productively to the Top6A dimer, it ideally should be sufficiently long to engage both the stalk and H2TH regions of Top6B. The inability of a 40 bp duplex to support cleavage, even though this DNA binds with higher affinity than a 20 bp duplex and is long enough to reach both Stalk/WKxY regions, suggests G-segment DNAs must engage at least one H2TH domain before strand scission can be triggered.</p><p>One implication of H2TH contacts with the distal arms of an associated G-segment is that ATP-binding and ATPase domain dimerization might in turn alter G-segment bending. To test this prediction, we labeled opposing ends of the 70 bp duplex with Cy5 and Cy5.5 and monitored changes in the end-to-end distance by FRET for native topo VI and our panel of mutants. Bulk FRET efficiencies in the absence and presence of enzyme were measured by exciting Cy5 at 630 nm and scanning the spectral emission of both the donor and acceptor fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The time-dependent conformational response to the addition of AMPPNP was also assessed. The addition of wild-type topo VI alone to the labeled DNA led to a modest FRET increase, a result indicative of G-segment bending that accords with prior AFM data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Thomson et al., 2015</xref>). The KGRR mutants produced a similar FRET increase; however, both sets of Stalk/WKxY and H2TH mutants yielded only a minor nucleotide-independent response (between that of wildtype topo VI and the free duplex). Upon adding AMPPNP, FRET efficiency rapidly increased further for the labeled DNA incubated with topo VI, or the KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> or KGRR<sup>EEE</sup> mutants, indicating that nucleotide-driven dimerization of the ATPase regions leads to additional DNA bending. This FRET increase did not occur when Cy5 and Cy5.5 were placed on separate duplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), allowing us to attribute the observed changes in FRET with the doubly labeled DNA to intramolecular bending, rather than the binding of two segments <italic>in trans</italic>. While this result for the KGRR constructs initially appeared to contradict the inability of nucleotide to alter Top6B conformation in the KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> mutant on supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), we note that the substrate differed between these two experiments. Performing the Top6B dimerization experiment with excess, unlabeled 70 bp duplex showed that, similar to wildtype topo VI bound to linear DNA, the KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> mutant adopts a more open conformation when bound to the 70 bp duplex than when bound to supercoiled DNA, and that the addition of nucleotide can shift the conformational equilibrium of the enzyme toward a closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). For their part, both Stalk/WKxY mutants produced a FRET increase in the presence of AMPPNP, albeit with substantially slowed kinetics that likely account for their negligible ATPase activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). By contrast, the H2TH mutants did not support any nucleotide-dependent increase in FRET, indicating that Top6B dimerization in these mutants no longer introduces DNA bending to the distal ends of a bound G-segment. Together, these observations both suggest that topo VI engages a G-segment using an extended interface that runs from one H2TH domain to the other, and that strand scission is stimulated by bending induced by Top6B dimerization. The observation that the ATPase activity of the H2TH mutants is decoupled from strand passage, yet also substantially impaired when compared to the futile cycling of the KGRR mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), further suggests that there is a feedback mechanism which couples nucleotide turnover to efficient G-segment deformation and cleavage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The ATPase elements of type IIB topoisomerases engage supercoiled DNA to regulate DNA strand passage</title><p>Using a broad range of functional and reporter assays (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>), we show here that type IIB topoisomerases preferentially engage the DNA crossings and bends of supercoiled substrates, and that binding to supercoiled DNA in turn stimulates the nucleotide-dependent dimerization of Top6B and couples this movement to DNA cleavage and strand passage at a distance in Top6A. To recognize and exploit distinguishing features of supercoiled substrates, topo VI uses several previously unidentified DNA-binding elements integrated into Top6B, including: (1) a basic interface formed along the subunit’s C-terminal stalk and a conserved WKxY motif that is important for robust G-segment binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), (2) a basic ‘KGRR’ loop in the GHKL domain that aids DNA crossing recognition and links controlled ATP turnover to productive strand passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and (3) an H2TH DNA-binding domain that promotes nucleotide-dependent G-segment bending and links ATP turnover to DNA cleavage and strand passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>).

our data also imply that T-segment engagement may actively control both ATP turnover and DNA-gate opening to permit strand passage. As with wild-type topo VI, the binding of the KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> mutant to supercoiled DNA alone promotes Top6B dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and supports ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>); however, disruption of this region impairs the binding of a DNA crossover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), does not support additional conformational response to nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), blocks ATP hydrolysis on short linear DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and abolishes strand passage overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This behavior suggests the bends or pre-formed crossings present in supercoiled DNA help to promote B-subunit dimerization and ATP hydrolysis, and may partially compensate for a loss of the KGRR element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), but that the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to strand passage requires the productive binding of a T-segment DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Given that the T-segment storage cavity appears to be too small to accommodate DNA when fully closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corbett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Corbett and Berger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Graille et al., 2008</xref>), it has been proposed that T-segment engagement may potentiate opening of the Top6A dimer and separation of a cleaved G-segment. Considering this idea in light of our present findings suggests that the binding of the KGRR loops to a stored T-segment helps to suppress premature release of ATP hydrolysis products, which is normally linked to a slow conformational change associated with G-segment separation and subsequent T-segment release. This scheme offers a simple explanation for why the KGRR mutants rapidly hydrolyze ATP when bound to supercoiled DNA: weakening of the T-segment interaction with the KGRR loop allows for early ATP turnover, yet by not resolving the DNA crossing, Top6B remains pre-dimerized and primed to bind ATP again, leading to futile cycling without strand passage.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Topo VI’s enzymatic properties seem oddly mismatched to the expected demands of the cell</title><p>Certain biochemical properties of topo VI identified here are somewhat surprising when considering the demands placed on the cell by transcription and replication. For example, the highly distributive nature of supercoil relaxation observed for topo VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>) is at odds with a need to remove the continual local build-up of superhelical tension arising from RNA polymerase advancement or replication fork progression. The maximal observed ATP hydrolysis and strand passage rates for <italic>Mm</italic> topo VI in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) are also much slower (~50–100 fold) than rates generally observed for type IIA topoisomerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Higgins et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lindsley and Wang, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Osheroff et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sugino and Cozzarelli, 1980</xref>). These enzymatic properties raise important questions as to when and in which context topo VI acts in the cell. For instance, using estimates based on the genome size and generation time of <italic>M. mazei</italic> (Appendix 1), topo VI would appear to require ~50-fold greater specific activity to keep up with gene expression and chromosome duplication, or else be present at extremely high cellular concentrations.</p><p>Although the source of this discrepancy may be due to differences between <italic>in vitro</italic> vs. <italic>in vivo</italic> rates of strand passage, it could alternatively arise from a missing factor that enhances topo VI activity. This second explanation, if true, has intriguing ramifications. For example, if a secondary factor were to accelerate topo VI’s strand passage rate by increasing processivity, then the distributive action of topo VI might reflect an auto-inhibitory mechanism that is manifest until the enzyme is localized to the appropriate chromosomal context. Along this line, multiple protein factors have been identified to bind topo VI in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and may be obligate components of the topo VI machinery in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Breuer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Forterre and Gadelle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kirik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sugimoto-Shirasu et al., 2005</xref>). If analogous factors exist for archaeal topo VI, it may be that Top6A and Top6B actually constitute the core of a larger type IIB topoisomerase complex. Eukaryotic topo IIIα, a type IA topoisomerase, exemplifies such a strategy, interacting with a RecQ family helicase and SSB/RPA-like factors to channel DNA strand passage into efficient Holliday junction resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Plank et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Raynard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Singh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Xu et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications of functional features of type IIB topoisomerases for homologous ATPase, nuclease, and transesterase systems</title><p>The picture of the type IIB topoisomerase strand passage mechanism developed here reveals a rich set of regulatory mechanisms both shared with and divergent from type IIA topoisomerases. Of these, a central feature is the requirement that topo VI must engage a DNA crossing (as found in supercoiled or catenated DNA) to access a stable dimerized B-subunit conformation and productively turn over ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Contrariwise, Top6B takes on a predominantly open conformation when bound only to a prospective G-segment (or in the absence of DNA [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corbett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Graille et al., 2008</xref>]), even when nucleotide is present. This tight control over Top6B dimerization, and its reciprocal coupling to G-segment cleavage, likely helps compensate for the missing safeguard of a third dimerization interface – the so-called ‘C-gate’ – found in type IIA topoisomerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roca et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roca and Wang, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Williams and Maxwell, 1999</xref>). For its part, the ATPase region of type IIA topoisomerases does possess potential T-segment-sensing elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tingey and Maxwell, 1996</xref>); however, in contrast to topo VI, the ATPase domains of type IIA topoisomerase holoenzymes readily dimerize upon binding ATP, even when DNA is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gubaev and Klostermeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roca and Wang, 1992</xref>). Interestingly, in requiring the binding of a substrate T-segment for stable ATPase domain dimerization, topo VI echoes the behavior of Hsp90, whose related GHKL ATPase fold strongly depends on client protein or co-chaperone engagement to drive ATPase association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hessling et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wolmarans et al., 2016</xref>). This co-dependency raises the possibility that other GHKL ATPases, such as MutL and MORC proteins, may similarly rely on substrate/cofactor interactions as a checkpoint to license nucleotide-dependent dimerization.</p><p>Following DNA crossover recognition, ATP binding by Top6B is needed to trigger G-segment scission by Top6A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buhler et al., 1998</xref>). However, closing of the ATP gate also serves to further bend the G-segment through contacts mediated by the H2TH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Although H2TH mutants are unable to cleave short duplex substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), they support weak strand passage activity on supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), a substrate that constrains DNA bends independent of enzyme binding. This suggests that DNA bending itself, whether innate or H2TH-mediated, may help promote DNA breakage by Top6A. Although the H2TH domain is specific to type IIB topoisomerases, type IIA enzymes also bend G-segment DNAs to support cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dong and Berger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Laponogov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wohlkonig et al., 2010</xref>). This dependency raises the possibility that other nucleases or transesterases that rely on the TOPRIM fold beside type II topoisomerases (e.g. OLD family enzymes and Spo11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aravind et al., 1998</xref>)) may similarly require DNA deformation to promote strand scission.</p><p>The discovery that Spo11 was related to the DNA-cleaving Top6A subunit of archaeal topo VI was a critical development in understanding how DNA breaks are formed to initiate meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bergerat et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>). The realization that Top6A requires Top6B for DNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buhler et al., 1998</xref>) has in turn raised the question of whether Spo11 might partner with a similar regulatory factor during meiotic recombination. Recently, structurally homologous counterparts to Top6B have been recognized across a wide range of eukaryotic species (MTop6B in plants, Top6BL in mammals, Rec102 in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> and Mei-P22 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vrielynck et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the WKxY motif implicated here in G-segment binding is conserved between Top6B and some of its meiotic homologs (e.g. mammalian MTop6B and plant Top6BL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robert et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that this region could assist Spo11 with DNA targeting, and contribute to the signals necessary to activate DNA cleavage during meiosis. In those Top6B homologs where the WKxY motif is poorly conserved, alternative features on the transducer stalk may participate in binding to DNA. For example, the prospective WKxY motif in budding yeast Rec102 is highly divergent in sequence (WEEQ), yet Spo11 hotspots from this organism display a sequence bias that extends beyond the predicted footprint of the Spo11 dimer. Interestingly, this bias maps to a distance of ±11–16 bp from the dyad of Spo11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pan et al., 2011</xref>), compared to the ~17–20 bp distance between the Top6B Stalk/WKxY region and the Top6A dyad, consistent with the notion that non-Spo11 DNA interaction sites may have shifted during evolution.</p><p>In topo VI, we find that Top6B dimerization further bends DNA to potentiate cleavage by Top6A. Surprisingly, components critical for Top6B-mediated dimerization are either highly divergent or missing in meiotic Top6B homologs. For example, both Topo6BL and MTopo6B contain a highly degenerate GHKL domain that lacks essential elements required for ATP binding (only purine-binding elements are conserved, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), and Rec102 and Mei-P22 lack a GHKL domain entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dutta and Inouye, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vrielynck et al., 2016</xref>). Insofar as DNA bending, the meiotic Top6B-like factors identified thus far also lack an H2TH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vrielynck et al., 2016</xref>). Should Spo11, like Top6A, require both DNA bending and allosteric activation to achieve a cleavage-competent state, these differences indicate that it is not the newly identified Top6B-like subunits alone that are responsible for mediating this event. Candidate factors that might further regulate Spo11-dependent break formation include additional partner proteins, post-translational modifications, and tension on or deformation of the DNA itself by factors responsible for sister chromatid pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lam and Keeney, 2014</xref>). Future studies focused on defining how topo VI and Spo11-type systems physically engage DNA strands, respond to possible partner factors, and switch between inactive and active DNA-cleavage states will be needed to help shed light on how these systems operate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Methanosarcina</italic> <break/><italic>Mazei</italic>)</td><td>Top6A</td><td>N/A</td><td>NCBI Gene ID: 1480760</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Methanosarcina</italic> <break/><italic>Mazei</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">Top6B</td><td valign="bottom">N/A</td><td valign="bottom">NCBI Gene ID: 1480759</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21(DE3)-RIL</td><td>QB3-MacroLab</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">XL1-Blue</td><td valign="bottom">QB3-MacroLab</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>M. mazei</italic> Top6AB <break/>expression vector</td><td>PMID: 17603498</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>M. mazei</italic> Top6AB-KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> <break/>expression vector</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td valign="bottom">Construct generated by introduction <break/>of point mutations: K186A, R188A, <break/>and R189A to Top6B gene on <italic>M.

topoisomerases</title><p>To assess whether the enzymatic activity reported for <italic>Mm</italic> topo VI could satisfy its cellular workload in archaea, we began by estimating the <italic>in vitro</italic> strand passage rate for the enzyme. Assuming an average super-helical density of σ = −0.06 for the plasmid substrate used in our assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lockshon and Morris, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pruss et al., 1982</xref>), each DNA molecule should contain ~17 supercoils (Lk<sub>o</sub> = 2927 bp plasmid ×1 turn/10.5 bp = 280 turns/plasmid; ΔLk = σ ×Lk<sub>o</sub> = −0.06×280 turns/plasmid=~17 negative supercoils/plasmid). Based on our time-course data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), at a 1:1.4 enzyme:plasmid ratio it takes between 10 and 15 min (600–900 s) for topo VI to fully relax this substrate, indicating that one strand passage event (equivalent to the removal of two supercoils) occurs every 50–75 s (i.e.: one strand passage event/2 supercoils removed ×17 supercoils/plasmid×1.4 plasmids/enzyme/600 s = 0.02 events/sec or one event every 50 s). This rate agrees well with the maximal ATPase rates we observe (~3 ATP/min on supercoiled DNA, corresponding to one strand passage event every ~40 s for an enzyme without futile cycling). Both ATPase and supercoil relaxation rates for <italic>Mm</italic> topo VI are at least 50-fold slower than speeds reported for a broad range of bacterial and eukaryotic type IIA topoisomerases, which catalyze strand passage events at a rate of ~1–2 s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Higgins et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lindsley and Wang, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Osheroff et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sugino and Cozzarelli, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vos et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Because replication and chromosome segregation demarcate an absolute minimum requirement for topoisomerase activity in the cell, we next asked whether the genome size and doubling time of <italic>M. mazei</italic> under optimal growth conditions might allow for topo VI’s slow activity. <italic>M. mazei</italic> have a ~ 8–16 hr doubling time in optimal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mah, 1980</xref>), and possess a ~4 Mbp genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deppenmeier et al., 2002</xref>). However, the closely related <italic>Methanoscarina acetivorans</italic> maintains a chromosome copy number of ~16 in similar conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hildenbrand et al., 2011</xref>), and the maintenance of moderate to high polyploidy appears to be a common trait in euryarchaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Samson and Bell, 2011</xref>). Assuming <italic>M. mazei</italic> possess a similar genome copy number as <italic>M. acetivorans</italic> during growth, each doubling would require copying ~64 Mbp of DNA per cell. <italic>M. mazei</italic> chromosomes are circular; thus, assuming ~10 bp/turn of DNA, replicating 64 Mbp requires the removal of ~6.4 M DNA links per cell cycle. If doubling takes 10 hr, replication in <italic>M. mazei</italic> requires a minimum unlinking rate of ~200 s<sup>−1</sup> (6.4 M DNA links/36,000 s = 178 DNA links/sec). By comparison, <italic>E. coli</italic> requires a similar unlinking rate to replicate and separate its single ~4 Mbp chromosome over a 40 min cell cycle (0.4M DNA links/2400 s = 167 links/sec) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blattner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schaechter, 1962</xref>).

Because the unlinking rate required by replication does not solely fall upon cellular decatenase activity (removal of both positive supercoils ahead of the replication fork and hemicatenanes also contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hiasa and Marians, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peter et al., 1998</xref>)), the cellular copy number of ~5–30 topo IV heterotetramers in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Taniguchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wiśniewski and Rakus, 2014</xref>) may estimate the workload required of topo VI in <italic>M. mazei</italic>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Anthony Maxwell (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary of the work:</p><p>This paper describes mechanistic studies on a type IIB DNA topoisomerase (topo VI) from the archeon <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic>. This type of topoisomerase has some similarities to the better studied Type IIA topoisomerases, but significant differences in domain organization suggest there may be mechanistic difference between the IIA an IIB topoisomerase. The authors perform ATPase activity assays, FRET-based studies of dimerization of the N-terminal ATPase, direct and competition-based assays of topo IV binding to different types of DNA substrates (supercoiled DNA, a four-way junction or crossing, and linear DNAs of different lengths), and supercoil relaxing and processivity assays. A major part of this work is the identification of three regions of the enzyme with potential roles in DNA interaction and an exploration of these interactions using site-directed mutagenesis. Several mutants were made and tested in the same assays used with WT enzyme.</p><p>Based on these analyses, the authors conclude that topo VI senses and exploits both DNA crossings and bends to facilitate strand passage. Overall the manuscript provides new insights into how type IIB DNA topoisomerases tightly couple ATP hydrolysis and DNA cleavage to recognition of the appropriate DNA substrate. The results also have implications for understanding the mechanisms of paralogs of TopIIA such as Spo11, which helps initiate meiotic recombination.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Several issues should be clarified by the authors prior to publication.</p><p>1) Although WT topo VI binds the four-way junction (crossing or stacked junction) with a Kd of 122 nM, which is better than its binding to a 20 bp linear DNA (with a Kd of 427nM), the Kds of topo VI for 30 and 40 bp DNA are 84 and 49 nM, respectively, much better than that for the stacked junction (a total of 36 bp) (Figures 5 and 6). Why do the authors conclude that topo VI senses DNA crossing? Furthermore, does a four-way junction mimic a DNA crossing or catenate?</p><p>2) Is there any explanation for the decreased apparent affinity of topo VI for a 70 bp linear DNA compared to 40 or 60 bp DNA (Figure 1)? The minimal DNA length for topo VI binding appears to be 30 bp and the difference in Kds between 20 and 30 bp is five-fold. But why does increasing from 40 bp to 70 bp not increase DNA binding by topo VI? The increase in the Kd, app between 60 bp and 70 bp exceeds the uncertainties in the measurements. Can the authors comment on this decrease in affinity that occurs at about the length at which the model predicts that potentially both H2TH domains could interact with the duplex?</p><p>3) The ability of the H2TH region to facilitate bending a 70bp DNA substrate is strongly based on the FRET signal (shortened end-to-end distance of DNA) in the presence of H2TH but no FRET without H2TH. Is it possible that FRET arises from topo VI capturing two DNA molecules in the presence of H2TH?</p><p>4) The increased ATPase activity of the KGRR mutant compared to WT topo VI in the presence of supercoiled DNA and yet the lack of topoisomerase activity of the mutant (Figure 4) are not explained by its low affinity for supercoiled DNA and reduced ATPase dimerization, both of which are pre-requisites for ATPase activity. The supercoiled DNA-dependent ATPase domain-dimerization (FRET measurements) is initially high and decreases with time (Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6), which is abnormal compared to the behavior of WT and the H2TH mutant topo VI, which increase with time (Figure 6B). The suggestion that the ATPase domain dissociates does not agree with the high ATPase activity, nor with the FRET data. At 150 min, the FRET signal due the ATPase domain dimerization of the KGRR mutant is at approximately the same level as the H2TH mutant topo VI and no worse. The Km of the KGRR mutant for ATP (~300µM) is much higher than WT (~3X) and H2TH topo VI (up to 10 X). KGRR is located in the ATPase domain. Could the mutation be influencing ATP binding? Do the authors know the KGRR mutant's affinity for AMPPNP (1 mM), which is used in the dimerization assay?</p><p>5) Is there any residual supercoiled DNA nicking activity of the KGRR mutant topo VI over time (Figure 4, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1)? Is there any explanation for the different &quot;relaxed&quot; circular DNAs in WT and three mutants? Is one a nicked band? The KGRR product is dominated by the second slowest migrating band, while the H2TH mutant predominantly produced the slowest migrating relaxed circular DNA. 10. It would be helpful if the authors could indicate linear and nicked bands on the gel for clarification. In a related point, it appears that there is an increase in the fraction of nicked or linear DNA in the gels testing the KGRR mutant in comparison to the other mutants or the wild-type enzyme. Is this significant and if so does it provide any additional insight into the regulation of cleavage by the KGRR motif?</p><p>6) It is not clear that sheared salmon sperm DNA is a suitable surrogate for linear DNA. As far as is known this preparation contains a mixture of DNAs, including single-stranded forms. Why didn't the authors just use linearized plasmid DNA in this experiment?</p><p>7) One difficult issue with the ATPase assays is the possible contribution of non-specific ATPases that may contaminate the topo VI prep. This difficulty can be addressed with other enzymes, e.g. DNA gyrase, where specific ATPase inhibitors are available. In this case the authors need to be cautious about the level of 'basal' ATPase activity, and this is particularly problematic with the mutants, where a different level of contaminating ATPase is possible. One possibility is to cut the topo VI bands out of a gel, re-fold and show that the ATPase activity is intrinsic to the enzyme. In this context it is important that the authors comment on the basal ATPase rates of the mutated enzymes.</p><p>8) Quoting k<sub>cat</sub> and K<sub>M</sub> values for this enzyme may not be straight forward (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Type II topoisomerases are, in general, non-Michaelian enzymes, due to the possession of two ATPase active sites and the likely cooperativity that occurs. Although they can conform to M-M kinetics this is only 'apparent'. The ATPase data here are not really refined enough to distinguish Michaelian from non-Michaelian behaviour. However, as this is not essentially an enzyme kinetics study it does not matter too much. The authors could point this out in the text and add a footnote to the table in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 saying that these are likely to be apparent values.</p><p>9) It was surprising that the authors did not test DNA cleavage very much in this work, except in Figure 7C in the context of the mutants. Could a systematic study of cleavage couple with the binding studies have been more informative? In this context there are gels in the manuscript that show cleavage of DNA that is not commented upon, e.g. Figure 1D (large plasmid), Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Indeed the level of cleavage (linearization) is quite high in some tracks and seems to occur without ATP, which is not usually the case for topo VI. Is this a contaminant? The authors need to comment on this.</p><p>10) Subsection “Three conserved elements in Top6B play a role in DNA binding, the sensing of DNA geometry, 2 and the productive coupling of ATP hydrolysis to strand passage”, last paragraph:</p><p>The authors did the competitive binding experiments (Figure 5B) only with H2TH<sup>EEE</sup> and KGRR<sup>EEE</sup> but not with H2TH<sup>AAA</sup> or KGRR<sup>AAA</sup>. Would it be possible to include the competitive binding experiments with H2TH<sup>AAA</sup> and KGRR<sup>AAA</sup>? The authors tested these two mutants with the short-stacked junction discussed later (Figure 6B) and it would be more informative to compare the supercoil binding to these junction data for all four mutants.</p><p>11) &quot;Together, these data indicate that both the KGRR loop and H2TH domain contribute to the preferential binding to supercoiled DNA, but that neither is solely responsible for this discrimination.&quot;</p><p>If these two domain mutations only affected supercoil DNA binding, then it could be argued that these two regions are important for supercoil DNA sensing. However, the linear DNA binding is also adversely affected for both mutations (KGRR<sup>AAA/EEE</sup> and H2TH<sup>AAA/EEE</sup>) particularly for longer DNA (&gt;50bp) (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). This adverse effect can be explained for H2TH since it can stabilize binding of longer DNA, but it is puzzling why KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> shows lower binding affinity for longer DNA. In addition, if a positive patch is important for DNA interaction stabilized through electrostatic interactions, it is surprising that H2TH<sup>EEE</sup> exhibited a lower K<sub>d</sub> than that of H2TH<sup>AAA</sup>.</p><p>12) Subsection “The KGRR loop acts as a DNA crossing sensor to promote Top6B dimerization”, last paragraph:</p><p>In Figure 6—figure supplement 2, the authors compare the emission spectra of wild type, KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> and H2TH<sup>AAA</sup> with and without supercoiled DNA to probe the extent of Top6B dimerization. Interestingly, the spectra of the apo-enzymes KGRR and H2TH differ from that of the WT enzyme. For KGRR, the emission at 670 nm is higher than that of wild type while that of H2TH is lower. Is it possible that the site-specific mutation can lead to change in protein conformation? For example, two Top6B are closer or further apart for KGRR and H2TH respectively. In line with the previous comment, is it possible that this conformational change in KGRR could result in reduction in binding and or sensing of both linear DNA (G-segment) as well as the crossing DNA (T-segment)?</p><p>13) Subsection “The H2TH interface engages an extended G-segment to couple nucleotide-dependent Top6B dimerization with DNA cleavage”, second paragraph:</p><p>Regarding Figure 7: Based on the image shown in Figure 7C for the wild type case, the amounts of DNA loaded on the gel for different length of DNA appears different: the 70 bp duplex lanes appear darker than those for 60 bp, suggesting more of the 70 bp product was loaded. Is this just image artifact? Can the authors quantify the relative cleavage relative to the total in each lane? This is an important point since the argument for a critical ~70 bp length requirement for cleavage hinges on this data. Do the authors think that both H2TH should interact with DNA in order to achieve DNA cleavage or would interaction with H2TH on one side suffice? In addition, considering the fact that 20-30-40 oligo bands are well separated on the ssDNA ladder lane, the cleavage product would be expected to be located somewhere between 30-40 nt (mixture of 37 and 33 due to 2-nt stagger cut) but they appear to close to 30 nt. Do the authors have any explanation? Some of the lanes show high molecular weight bands? Are they intact duplex substrate?</p><p>14) &quot;The inability of a 40bp duplex to support cleavage, even though this DNA binds with higher affinity than a 20bp duplex and is long enough to reach both Stalk/WKxY regions, suggests G-segment DNAs must engage both H2TH regions before strand scission can be triggered.&quot;</p><p>The authors' argument is not fully convincing. As 40bp DNA contains a preferential cleavage site in the middle (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), even if Topo VI can bind one end of H2TH as shown in Figure 7B (fifth from top configuration), the cleavage product may be too low to detect due to extremely low cleavage efficiency. Thus, the 40bp cleavage data is not sufficient to draw the conclusion of two H2TH requirement. In addition, the 60bp substrate cleavage data may suggest one-H2TH interaction is sufficient.</p><p>15) Considering the complexity of this manuscript, it is recommended the authors make things clearer regarding the conditions of experiments presented in the different sections – such as ATP, AMPPNP, DNA, enzyme concentrations and if they are all same for the same type of experiments, state as such at the beginning. Otherwise a table listing the conditions of the various measurements in one place would be helpful. It would also be useful to know how the authors decided on the reaction conditions for the topo VI assays, and how these compare with the in vivo environment of <italic>M. mazei</italic>. In addition it is confusing that the authors use the bp scale to convolve the length and concentration of DNA instead of indicating the length of DNA and its concentration separately for supercoiled DNA. In line with this, &quot;800bp supercoiled DNA:enzyme&quot; in Figure 2A can be confused as 800bp length of supercoiled DNA rather than bp scaled concentration. Whereas the rational for the scaling of the amount of DNA in bp is understandable, it would be helpful to provide the length and concentration in addition to this relative measure. It would further be useful to comment on the choice of oligos used in these experiments (Figure 1—figure supplement 1); these are based on a preferred cleavage sequence for the sulfolobus enzyme. Is there evidence that the <italic>M. mazei</italic> enzyme has a similar sequence preference?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31724.061</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Several issues should be clarified by the authors prior to publication.</p><p>1) Although WT topo VI binds the four-way junction (crossing or stacked junction) with a Kd of 122 nM, which is better than its binding to a 20 bp linear DNA (with a Kd of 427nM), the Kds of topo VI for 30 and 40 bp DNA are 84 and 49 nM, respectively, much better than that for the stacked junction (a total of 36 bp) (Figures 5 and 6).

A four-way junction will fold into a stacked-X structure at the divalent cation concentrations used in our binding experiments (see (Duckett et al., 1988; Eichman, Vargason, Mooers, and Ho, 2000; McKinney, Declais, Lilley, and Ha, 2003; Ortiz-Lombardía, González, Aymamí, Azorín, and Coll, 1999). We noticed the geometry taken on by a prospective T-segment and G-segment DNA when modeled into topo VI closely mimics this stacked-X structure. We have added two panels to Figure 6 to illustrate how a stacked junction mimics this intermediate (A and B), and have revised the text in the first paragraph of the subsection “The KGRR loop acts as a DNA crossing sensor to regulatepromote Top6B dimerization” to reference these panels.</p><p>The increased affinity of topo VI for a 30 bp or 40 bp duplex may be attributed to these DNAs engaging an extended G-segment binding interface (e.g., through the Stalk/WKxY region). The Holliday junction substrate folds as a 16 bp duplex stacked on a 20 bp duplex, and should bind no better than a simple 20 bp duplex if there were no preference for topo VI to bind to a crossing. However, the affinity does increase for the junction, indicating that topo VI favorably recognizes two DNA segments. It is from the relative increase in wildtype affinity for the stacked junction, as well as the relative decrease in affinity for this substrate with the KGRR mutants, that we conclude topo VI recognizes prospective T-segment/G-segment crossings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is there any explanation for the decreased apparent affinity of topo VI for a 70 bp linear DNA compared to 40 or 60 bp DNA (Figure 1)?

Thus, the likelihood of two 70 bp duplexes binding to the same enzyme to induce a FRET response is small. However, to more explicitly rule out the potential capture of two duplexes as a cause for changes in FRET, we have repeated the DNA bending experiment using an equimolar mixture of two 70 bp duplexes, one labeled with Cy5 and the other with Cy5.5. In this setup, any observed FRET increase must occur between two duplexes, rather than by bending of a single DNA. We observe no nucleotide-dependent increase in FRET with this experimental setup, allowing us to rule out duplex capture as the source of the FRET signal. This control has been added as Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and is referenced in the last paragraph of the subsection “The H2TH interface engages an extended G-segment to couple nucleotide-dependent Top6B dimerization with DNA cleavage.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The increased ATPase activity of the KGRR mutant compared to WT topo VI in the presence of supercoiled DNA and yet the lack of topoisomerase activity of the mutant (Figure 4) are not explained by its low affinity for supercoiled DNA and reduced ATPase dimerization, both of which are pre-requisites for ATPase activity.

Wildtype topo VI takes ~40 s to complete each ATPase cycle. The KGRR-AAA mutant takes ~15 s, but fails to perform strand passage. This difference suggests that under normal circumstances, a delay in product release is an important component of the topo VI strand passage mechanism. In this view, the high ATPase rates of the KGRR mutants do not reflect a ‘better’ ATPase activity, but rather an uncoupling of the ATPase cycle (and specifically, product release) from a set of slow conformational changes that are necessary for strand passage.</p><p>The experiments in Figure 4B do not measure the K<sub>m,app</sub> of each topo VI mutant for ATP. Rather, as noted in the manuscript and Figure 4—figure supplement 2, these experiments look at the stimulation of ATP hydrolysis as a function of DNA concentration at a single (2 mM) ATP concentration. We apologize for any confusion our discussion of this experiment might have caused, and we have modified the parameter names to K<sub>stim,DNA</sub> and k<sub>cat-stim,DNA</sub>.

These data, together with the ATPase results, suggest that upon binding supercoiled DNA, the KGRR-AAA mutant enzymes ‘pre-dimerize’ into a state competent for binding and hydrolyzing ATP (and that the intact KGRR loop of wild-type topo VI prevents this conformational change from occurring until ATP also binds). If the KGRR-AAA mutant inappropriately releases hydrolysis products before strand passage (perhaps because a bound T-segment can no longer suppress the release of these products), the enzyme will remain pre-dimerized. Interestingly, Klostermeier and colleagues have noted that ATPase pre-dimerization occurs for bacterial gyrase upon DNA binding, albeit in the wild-type enzyme (Gubaev and Klostermeier, 2011).</p><p>Finally, as noted by the reviewers, both H2TH-AAA and KGRR-AAA produce similar FRET signals in the presence of supercoiled DNA and AMPPNP that are lower than the wildtype signal in the same condition. Given both mutants are impaired for strand passage, this raises the possibility that the higher wildtype signal reflects a conformational response to nucleotide binding that is not fully accessible to either mutant. Such a model directly relates to comments raised by the reviewers in point 12 (below). We have revised the text in the last paragraph of the subsection “The KGRR loop acts as a DNA crossing sensor to regulate Top6B dimerization” to convey this interpretation more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Is there any residual supercoiled DNA nicking activity of the KGRR mutant topo VI over time (Figure 4, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1)? Is there any explanation for the different &quot;relaxed&quot; circular DNAs in WT and three mutants? Is one a nicked band? The KGRR product is dominated by the second slowest migrating band, while the H2TH mutant predominantly produced the slowest migrating relaxed circular DNA. 10. It would be helpful if the authors could indicate linear and nicked bands on the gel for clarification. In a related point, it appears that there is an increase in the fraction of nicked or linear DNA in the gels testing the KGRR mutant in comparison to the other mutants or the wild-type enzyme. Is this significant and if so does it provide any additional insight into the regulation of cleavage by the KGRR motif?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion over the identity of DNA species in Figure 4A and Figure 4—figure supplement 1. We have more clearly annotated the position of linear and nicked plasmid DNA species for these experiments.

Of all the constructs, only wildtype topo VI produces a fully relaxed, closed-circle topoisomer distribution.</p><p>We do not believe excessive nicking to be a feature of the KGRR mutants. In Figure 4A, there is no dose-dependent nicking for KGRR-EEE.

As far as is known this preparation contains a mixture of DNAs, including single-stranded forms. Why didn't the authors just use linearized plasmid DNA in this experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>Other groups in the topoisomerase field have found sheared salmon-sperm DNA to be a suitable general dsDNA substrate (e.g., Wang, Lindsley, Nitiss and Austin groups (Baird, Gordon, Andrenyak, Marecek, and Lindsley, 2001; Harkins and Lindsley, 1998; Morris, Harkins, Tennyson, and Lindsley, 1999; Olland and Wang, 1999; Vaughn et al., 2005; Walker et al., 2004; West and Austin, 1999)). Following this precedent, we have frequently used sheared salmon-sperm DNA in previous studies and found no issue with the substrate (e.g., (Schmidt, Osheroff, and Berger, 2012; Schoeffler, May, and Berger, 2010; Tretter and Berger, 2012)). Based on agarose gel electrophoresis, the sheared salmon-sperm DNA used in this study consists of DNAs ranging from ~75-500 basepairs in length (primarily ~75-100 basepairs, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5A</xref>). This DNA mixture competes for DNA binding to topo VI similarly to a defined DNA substrate in the same length range (60 bp), whereas single stranded DNA competes quite poorly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5B</xref>). According to the manufacturer, the sheared salmon-sperm DNA has not been boiled and should therefore be double-stranded. We confirmed that our sheared salmon-sperm DNA preparations are resistant to S1 single-stranded DNA nuclease treatment, but that when boiled, it is degraded, confirming the manufacturer’s claims (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5C</xref>). While we do not believe these controls would add to the manuscript, we are happy to include them as supplements to Figure 1 if the reviewers deem it necessary.</p><fig id="respfig5"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31724.046</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31724-resp-fig5-v2"/></fig><p>The DNAs in the sheared salmon-sperm sample are shorter than the persistence length of DNA and thus less likely to form bends or crossings. This characteristic makes sheared salmon-sperm DNA a good substrate to compare against supercoiled plasmid DNA, which would have such features. Because linearized plasmid DNA (~3 kb) is sufficiently long to form random bends and intramolecular crossings, we expect it to have an intermediate effect upon topo VI compared to sheared salmon sperm DNA. Two tests confirm this prediction. In the first, we have found that linearized plasmid competes better than sheared salmon-sperm DNA for topo VI binding, nearly as well as supercoiled DNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig6">Author response image 6D</xref>). This result comports with our model in that topo VI preferentially binds better to crossovers than single duplexes; in the absence of ATP (which is omitted in the binding assays), the crossovers present in the supercoiled and linearized plasmids will not be resolved, and will act as a sink to pull topo VI (which is present in limiting concentrations) away from the labeled 70 bp duplex. In the second test, we found that linearized plasmid has an overall stimulatory effect on ATP hydrolysis that is intermediate compared to that measured for sheared salmon-sperm DNA and supercoiled DNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig6">Author response image 6E</xref>). This result is interesting, because at low supercoiled plasmid:enzyme ratios, where the crossover density is low (~1 crossover/enzyme), the ATPase stimulation is similar to that of linearized plasmid. However, at higher supercoiled plasmid:enzyme ratios, where the crossover density increases, the ATPase rate improves concordantly. Overall, these data are consistent with the conclusion that topo VI senses and responds to crossings present in DNA substrates. We also have not added these data to the text, but can do so if the reviewers feel it necessary.</p><fig id="respfig6"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31724.047</object-id><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31724-resp-fig6-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) One difficult issue with the ATPase assays is the possible contribution of non-specific ATPases that may contaminate the topo VI prep. This difficulty can be addressed with other enzymes, e.g. DNA gyrase, where specific ATPase inhibitors are available. In this case the authors need to be cautious about the level of 'basal' ATPase activity, and this is particularly problematic with the mutants, where a different level of contaminating ATPase is possible. One possibility is to cut the topo VI bands out of a gel, re-fold and show that the ATPase activity is intrinsic to the enzyme. In this context it is important that the authors comment on the basal ATPase rates of the mutated enzymes.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the potential for contamination by non-specific ATPases may contribute to the overall ATPase rates reported. We have added a supplemental figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 2) reporting the ‘basal’ ATPase rates for all mutants as a function of ATP concentration (see Figure 4—figure supplement 2). All mutants exhibit basal ATPase rates similar to each other and to wild-type topo VI.</p><p>To determine whether co-contaminants in our topo VI preparations contribute to measured ATP hydrolysis rates, we cloned, expressed, and purified a construct of topo VI that lacks a catalytic glutamate necessary for ATPase activity in GHKL ATPases (Top6B<sup>E44A</sup>). As expected, this mutant shows no supercoil relaxation activity (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,top). While there is some background ATPase activity in the Top6AB<sup>E44A</sup> prep, it is not DNA stimulated (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, bottom). Thus, the basal rates reported for topo VI do appear to contain a contribution from a non-specific ATPase contaminant. By contrast, the ability of DNA to stimulate (or fail to stimulate) the ATPase activity of our topo VI mutants is directly attributable to the specific mutations we have introduced. To more accurately represent the topo VI-specific ATPase activity reported in Figure 2, we have subtracted out the background ‘basal’ ATPase rate measured for Top6B<sup>E44A</sup>, and reprocessed the kinetic parameters reported in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. This adjustment is not necessary for the experiments reported in Figure 4B, as they measure stimulation above the basal rate. We have added the experiments in panel A and B as a supplement to Figure 2 and 4. We have also added callouts to each supplement in the first paragraph of the subsection “Topo VI actively uses DNA crossings to couple ATP hydrolysis with DNA strand passage” and in “Three conserved elements in Top6B play a role in DNA binding, the sensing of DNA geometry, and the productive coupling of ATP hydrolysis to strand passage”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Quoting k<sub>cat</sub> and K<sub>M</sub> values for this enzyme may not be straight forward (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Type II topoisomerases are, in general, non-Michaelian enzymes, due to the possession of two ATPase active sites and the likely cooperativity that occurs. Although they can conform to M-M kinetics this is only 'apparent'. The ATPase data here are not really refined enough to distinguish Michaelian from non-Michaelian behaviour. However, as this is not essentially an enzyme kinetics study it does not matter too much. The authors could point this out in the text and add a footnote to the table in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 saying that these are likely to be apparent values.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that ATP hydrolysis by topo VI is likely cooperative, but the reported data do not sufficiently assess turnover at low ATP concentrations to distinguish between a cooperative model and ‘apparent’ Michaelis-Menten behavior. We have modified both the text (subsection “Topo VI actively uses DNA crossings to couple ATP hydrolysis with DNA strand passage”, first paragraph) and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 to explicitly state that the reported kinetic parameters are apparent, and are not meant to imply that the enzyme acts in a truly Michaelian regime.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) It was surprising that the authors did not test DNA cleavage very much in this work, except in Figure 7C in the context of the mutants. Could a systematic study of cleavage couple with the binding studies have been more informative? In this context there are gels in the manuscript that show cleavage of DNA that is not commented upon, e.g. Figure 1D (large plasmid), Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Indeed the level of cleavage (linearization) is quite high in some tracks and seems to occur without ATP, which is not usually the case for topo VI. Is this a contaminant? The authors need to comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>Our goal in this work was to determine how topo VI engages DNA and how DNA binding may coordinate activities related to strand passage. The experiments performed in Figure 7C directly contribute to resolving these questions by determining both the DNA binding elements and minimal DNA length required for topo VI-mediated DNA cleavage. Given all the mutants under investigation, a truly systematic study of cleavage activities would greatly enlarge this study: DNA topology, oligo lengths, and ATP dependence would all need to be assessed for seven different constructs (eight when including our new ATPase-defective mutant to look at the role of hydrolysis). Then there is also the question of preferred cleavage sequences, both within the central cleavage region and more peripherally toward the H2TH domains. We agree that it would be useful to more systematically investigate DNA cleavage by topo VI, but as part of a future effort.</p><p>Regarding the DNA gels noted by the reviewers – in Figure 1D, topo VI produces a relaxed distribution for the large plasmid (13.5 kb) that runs very close to the nicked plasmid species. Since it is difficult to unequivocally distinguish this distribution from open-circle (nicked) plasmid, we repeated the experiment using a smaller chase plasmid (6.5 kb). There is better separation between relaxed and nicked bands for the 6.5 kb chase plasmid, which verifies topo VI does not produce a level of nicking or linearization beyond the 20 min control lacking ATP. We have substituted this experiment for Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Regarding the increase in open-circle/nicked plasmid DNA for gels in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, we have addressed this in the response to point 5, above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsection “Three conserved elements in Top6B play a role in DNA binding, the sensing of DNA geometry, 2 and the productive coupling of ATP hydrolysis to strand passage”, last paragraph:</p><p>The authors did the competitive binding experiments (Figure 5B) only with H2TH<sup>EEE</sup> and KGRR<sup>EEE</sup> but not with H2TH<sup>AAA</sup> or KGRR<sup>AAA</sup>. Would it be possible to include the competitive binding experiments with H2TH<sup>AAA</sup> and KGRR<sup>AAA</sup>? The authors tested these two mutants with the short-stacked junction discussed later (Figure 6B) and it would be more informative to compare the supercoil binding to these junction data for all four mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added competition assays with the H2TH-AAA and KGRR-AAA mutants to Figure 5 as requested. The KGRR-AAA mutant shows intermediate effects between wildtype and the KGRR-EEE mutant. The H2TH-AAA mutant shows minimal impairment for both sheared salmon-sperm DNA and supercoiled DNA binding when compared to the H2TH-EEE mutant. We have revised the text in the subsection “<underline>Three conserved elements in Top6B play a role in DNA binding, the sensing of DNA geometry, and the productive coupling of ATP hydrolysis to strand passage</underline>”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) &quot;Together, these data indicate that both the KGRR loop and H2TH domain contribute to the preferential binding to supercoiled DNA, but that neither is solely responsible for this discrimination.&quot;</p><p>If these two domain mutations only affected supercoil DNA binding, then it could be argued that these two regions are important for supercoil DNA sensing. However, the linear DNA binding is also adversely affected for both mutations (KGRR<sup>AAA/EEE</sup> and H2TH<sup>AAA/EEE</sup>) particularly for longer DNA (&gt;50bp) (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). This adverse effect can be explained for H2TH since it can stabilize binding of longer DNA, but it is puzzling why KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> shows lower binding affinity for longer DNA. In addition, if a positive patch is important for DNA interaction stabilized through electrostatic interactions, it is surprising that H2TH<sup>EEE</sup> exhibited a lower K<sub>d</sub> than that of H2TH<sup>AAA</sup>.</p></disp-quote><p>The ability of a site to sense supercoiled DNA does not necessarily preclude it from also impacting the binding of linear DNAs. As pointed out, the impact of the H2TH domain on linear DNA binding can be explained by the interaction of this element with longer DNA segments. As for the KGRR mutants, it may be that these substitutions affect the conformational disposition of subunits in the tetramer, which in turn makes it more difficult for DNA bound in the active site of a Top6A dimer to access the flanking Top6B WKxY and H2TH regions. The discussion outlined for points 4 and 12 comports with this reasoning.</p><p>Regarding the K<sub>d</sub> values of the 60 and 70 bp DNAs for the H2TH mutants, these point mutations lie at the outer edge of the G-segment binding tract and may therefore differentially affect either DNA binding register (discussed further in point 13) and/or the mobility of the fluorophore label. To control for such effects, we have measured the affinity of both H2TH-AAA and H2TH-EEE for unlabeled 60 or 70 bp duplexes in a competition experiment that uses the fluorescently labeled 70 bp duplex as a probe. As can be seen from the data, the H2TH-EEE mutant does not exhibit greater affinity for either DNA compared to the H2TH-AAA mutant. We have added these experiments as a supplement to Figure 5.</p><p>Interestingly, whereas a 70 bp duplex competes better than a 60 bp duplex for binding to wildtype topo VI (see point 2), competitive binding of the 70 bp duplex is relatively impaired for both H2TH mutants. As we now note in the revised manuscript, this result suggests that each set of substitutions is sufficient to ablate DNA-H2TH interactions, but that they minimally affect DNA engagement by Top6A or the Stalk/WKxY region. We also note that in the competitive binding experiments reported in the new Figure 5, the H2TH-AAA mutant binds supercoiled DNA more strongly than the H2TH-EEE mutant. This finding provides additional evidence that the H2TH site engages DNA primarily in a role as a bend sensor. These considerations are explicitly discussed in the subsection “Three conserved elements in Top6B play a role in DNA binding, the sensing of DNA geometry, and the productive coupling of ATP hydrolysis to strand passage”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Subsection “The KGRR loop acts as a DNA crossing sensor to promote Top6B dimerization”, last paragraph:</p><p>In Figure 6—figure supplement 2, the authors compare the emission spectra of wild type, KGRR<sup>AAA</sup> and H2TH<sup>AAA</sup> with and without supercoiled DNA to probe the extent of Top6B dimerization. Interestingly, the spectra of the apo-enzymes KGRR and H2TH differ from that of the WT enzyme. For KGRR, the emission at 670 nm is higher than that of wild type while that of H2TH is lower. Is it possible that the site-specific mutation can lead to change in protein conformation? For example, two Top6B are closer or further apart for KGRR and H2TH respectively. In line with the previous comment, is it possible that this conformational change in KGRR could result in reduction in binding and or sensing of both linear DNA (G-segment) as well as the crossing DNA (T-segment)?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the FRET spectra of the mutant enzymes alone, we agree that these point mutations could alter the underlying conformational states sampled by the enzyme, and that any such behavior might well contribute to the effect of each set of mutations on DNA binding (a concept also noted in response to points 4 and 11, above). We have revised the manuscript (subsection “The KGRR loop acts as a DNA crossing sensor to regulate Top6B dimerization”) to more explicitly comment on this possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Subsection “The H2TH interface engages an extended G-segment to couple nucleotide-dependent Top6B dimerization with DNA cleavage”, second paragraph:</p><p>Regarding Figure 7: Based on the image shown in Figure 7C for the wild type case, the amounts of DNA loaded on the gel for different length of DNA appears different: the 70 bp duplex lanes appear darker than those for 60 bp, suggesting more of the 70 bp product was loaded. Is this just image artifact? Can the authors quantify the relative cleavage relative to the total in each lane? This is an important point since the argument for a critical ~70 bp length requirement for cleavage hinges on this data. Do the authors think that both H2TH should interact with DNA in order to achieve DNA cleavage or would interaction with H2TH on one side suffice? In addition, considering the fact that 20-30-40 oligo bands are well separated on the ssDNA ladder lane, the cleavage product would be expected to be located somewhere between 30-40 nt (mixture of 37 and 33 due to 2-nt stagger cut) but they appear to close to 30 nt. Do the authors have any explanation? Some of the lanes show high molecular weight bands? Are they intact duplex substrate?</p></disp-quote><p>The apparent loading difference is an artifact of our previous gel scanner. A repeat of the experiment shows that loading is constant from lane to lane and that the cleavage product is still more pronounced for the 70bp oligo. We have also determined that the high molecular weight band in some lanes in Figure 7C (e.g., lanes containing wildtype topo VI and 70 bp DNA substrate) represent DNA bound to incompletely digested topo VI. These bands disappear with longer Proteinase K treatment. We have substituted these gels and quantified the% cleavage product above each lane where this product is distinguishable. Full digestion reveals that the wildtype enzyme cleaves the 70 bp DNA at a slightly higher level than either KGRR mutant. This result is concordant with the relative affinities of each construct for the 70 bp DNA. We have modified the text (subsection “The H2TH interface engages an extended G-segment to couple nucleotide-dependent Top6B dimerization with DNA cleavage”, third paragraph) to reflect these quantification data.</p><p>We agree that the cleavage bands are running at a position that would suggest topo VI is cutting off-center. Our oligo sequence is based on an optimal cleavage site identified by the Forterre group for <italic>S. shibatae</italic> topo VI (Buhler, Lebbink, Bocs, Ladenstein, and Forterre, 2001). The same group also identified a weaker cleavage site ~6 bp away from this locus; we suspect our <italic>M. mazei</italic> enzyme is cutting at this secondary site. We also agree that the data are consistent with the idea that the engagement of a single H2TH domain can be sufficient to promote cleavage. We have revised the text to reflect both points in the subsection “The H2TH interface engages an extended G-segment to couple nucleotide-dependent Top6B dimerization with DNA cleavage”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) &quot;The inability of a 40bp duplex to support cleavage, even though this DNA binds with higher affinity than a 20bp duplex and is long enough to reach both Stalk/WKxY regions, suggests G-segment DNAs must engage both H2TH regions before strand scission can be triggered.&quot;</p><p>The authors' argument is not fully convincing. As 40bp DNA contains a preferential cleavage site in the middle (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), even if Topo VI can bind one end of H2TH as shown in Figure 7B (fifth from top configuration), the cleavage product may be too low to detect due to extremely low cleavage efficiency. Thus, the 40bp cleavage data is not sufficient to draw the conclusion of two H2TH requirement. In addition, the 60bp substrate cleavage data may suggest one-H2TH interaction is sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this assessment of our data, and we have revised the text (subsection “The H2TH interface engages an extended G-segment to couple nucleotide-dependent Top6B dimerization with DNA cleavage”) accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Considering the complexity of this manuscript, it is recommended the authors make things clearer regarding the conditions of experiments presented in the different sections – such as ATP, AMPPNP, DNA, enzyme concentrations and if they are all same for the same type of experiments, state as such at the beginning. Otherwise a table listing the conditions of the various measurements in one place would be helpful. It would also be useful to know how the authors decided on the reaction conditions for the topo VI assays, and how these compare with the in vivo environment of M. mazei. In addition it is confusing that the authors use the bp scale to convolve the length and concentration of DNA instead of indicating the length of DNA and its concentration separately for supercoiled DNA. In line with this, &quot;800bp supercoiled DNA:enzyme&quot; in Figure 2A can be confused as 800bp length of supercoiled DNA rather than bp scaled concentration. Whereas the rational for the scaling of the amount of DNA in bp is understandable, it would be helpful to provide the length and concentration in addition to this relative measure. It would further be useful to comment on the choice of oligos used in these experiments (Figure 1—figure supplement 1); these are based on a preferred cleavage sequence for the sulfolobus enzyme. Is there evidence that the M. mazei enzyme has a similar sequence preference?</p></disp-quote><p>The reaction conditions (salts, buffers, etc.) for each type of experiment are the same throughout the manuscript.

Interestingly, in pilot experiments for cleavage of short duplexes (not discussed in the manuscript), <italic>M. mazei</italic> topo VI produced a small but detectable amount of cleavage of the 60 bp duplex bearing the <italic>S. shibatae</italic> sequence, but it did not cleave a 60 bp duplex with an unrelated sequence.
