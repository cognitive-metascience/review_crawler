sensed by many cell types in vivo, whether they function as signaling mediators of SC and niche cross talk to regulate tissue regeneration is largely unknown. We show here that deletion of the Notch pathway co-factor RBP-J specifically in mouse HFSCs triggers adjacent McSCs to precociously differentiate in their shared niche. Transcriptome screen and in vivo functional studies revealed that the elevated level of retinoic acid (RA) caused by de-repression of RA metabolic process genes as a result of RBP-J deletion in HFSCs triggers ectopic McSCs differentiation in the niche. Mechanistically the increased level of RA sensitizes McSCs to differentiation signal KIT-ligand by increasing its c-Kit receptor protein level in vivo. Using genetic approach, we further pinpointed HFSCs as the source of KIT-ligand in the niche. We discover that HFSCs regulate the metabolite RA level in vivo to allow self-renewal of neighboring McSCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>metabolite</kwd><kwd>anti-differentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key R&amp;D Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0103500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014CB849602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012CB518700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metabolite mediates communication between stem cells and influences stem cell maintenance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The concept of a ‘SC niche’ was first proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schofield (1978)</xref>, even though there was no direct evidence that such a niche actually existed at that time. Since then, large strides have been made towards understanding the cellular and molecular composition of SC niches in multiple experimental systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sailaja et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Now it’s widely accepted that niche space plays dominant roles in SC fate establishment, maintenance, activation and SC related disease initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scadden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clevers et al., 2014</xref>). Recently several studies have revealed that SCs themselves actively organize the very niche space they occupy in vivo. For example during early zebra fish development, the arrival of hematopoietic SCs triggers dynamic remodeling of the perivascular niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>). In medaka, neural SCs induce the formation of their physical niche during organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seleit et al., 2017</xref>). However, less is known about the role SCs might play in regulating the niche signaling environment, beyond their demonstrated capacity to passively receive signaling inputs.</p><p>Mouse dorsal skin HFs regenerate continuously. Their cyclical bouts of growth (anagen), regression (catagen) and rest (telogen) are driven by the proliferation and stepwise differentiation of HFSCs residing in the bulge area. McSCs also reside in the bulge, and the secondary hair germ (sHG) located below the bulge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishimura et al., 2002</xref>). Both types of SCs remain undifferentiated in their shared niche space and are coordinately activated at the onset of anagen to generate a pigmented hair shaft. Studies have identified numerous signaling inputs received by HFSCs and McSCs respectively or collectively in their shared niche space. For example, BMPs and FGF18 are essential to maintain HFSCs in a dormant state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>). TGF-b signaling is required to suppress McSC proliferation and differentiation, while active Notch signaling via Hes1 is required for McSCs survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moriyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nishimura et al., 2010</xref>). At the onset of anagen, the dynamic changes of multiple signaling molecules activate hair regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greco et al., 2009</xref>). Among them, Wnt signaling coordinates the activation of both HFSCs and McSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rabbani et al., 2011</xref>); KIT-ligand is necessary for McSC mobility and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishikawa et al., 1991</xref>); Nfib/Edn signaling can regulate the differentiation of McSCs in collaboration with KIT or Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takeo et al., 2016</xref>). Compared to these well-studied morphogens, whether metabolites can influence SC fate during tissue regeneration in vivo is still largely unknown.</p><p>Retinoic acid (RA) is the major product of carotenoid oxidation pathway and it can also be transformed from Vitamin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marill et al., 2003</xref>). As a small molecule, RA can diffuse freely through cell membrane and is essential for normal regulation of a wide range of biological processes including development, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zile, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glover et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelley et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Niederreither et al., 2001</xref>). In skin, RA has long been used as additive in makeup or acne cream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Orfanos et al., 1987</xref>). There are lots of studies about RA and keratinocytes or fibroblasts. In makeup, RA is used to increase collagen synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwartz et al., 1990</xref>) and reduce keratinocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yaar et al., 1981</xref>). In acne cream, RA acts mainly as comedolytics, but anti-inflammatory actions have also been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chivot, 2005</xref>). However, there are much fewer reports about how RA regulates melanocytes, especially in vivo.</p><p>RBP-J is a Notch pathway co-factor. When Notch signaling is inactive, RBP-J binds its target genes and recruits repressive transcription factors (TFs) that silence gene transcription. Once a Notch ligand (either Dll1-4 or Jag1-2) binds to a Notch receptor (mainly Notch1-3 in skin), the receptor is then cleaved, and the intracellular domain (ICD) translocates into the nucleus and binds to RBP-J. Subsequently, instead of recruiting repressive TFs, the complex starts to activate the transcription of downstream genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borggrefe and Oswald, 2009</xref>). Previously, it has been reported that Notch pathway is essential for skin epidermal cell differentiation, HF formation, dermal papillar niche function and crosstalk between the epidermis and the HF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kopan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rangarajan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanpain et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, we found here that during normal homeostasis, the Notch pathway co-factor RBP-J functions in HFSCs to suppress retinoid metabolic process genes. The increased level of RA resulted from loss of RBP-J in HFSCs elevates the c-Kit protein level on McSCs and sensitizes them towards KIT-ligand normally present in the niche. This reveals that beyond the SCs demonstrated capacity to passively receive signaling inputs, they also play an essential role of safeguarding the differentiation refractory niche environment by regulating metabolite level in vivo. The fact RA is the messenger mediating the crosstalk between two types of SCs in a shared niche, reveals the previously unknown role of metabolites in regulating SC function during tissue regeneration and possibly disease development in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Specific ablation of RBP-J in HFSCs results in ectopic differentiation of neighboring McSCs in the shared niche</title><p>Our previous studies discovered that the niche environment plays a dominant role in HFSC fate establishment during morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Since maintaining the undifferentiated state is a defining feature of SCs, we decided to address the key question of how niche helps maintain SCs stay undifferentiated.

But unexpectedly, we noticed the bulge region in the <italic>Sox9-CreER::RBP-J cKO</italic> HFs show ectopic pigmentation at the telogen to anagen transition stage, which is not observed in the <italic>WT</italic> HFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). This is very peculiar because the McSCs, which also reside in the bulge region, are supposed to be undifferentiated, and only their downstream progenies located in the lower HF bulb region undergo terminal differentiation to help generate pigmented hair shaft during anagen. Based on melanin specific Masson-Fontana staining and quantification, more than 60% of the <italic>Sox9-CreER::RBP-J cKO</italic> HFs start to show ectopic pigmentation in the bulge region at telogen to anagen transition stage. This is even more obvious in early anagen when about 90% of the bulge become pigmented, in comparison less than 20% of the <italic>WT</italic> HFs show pigmentation in the bulge region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>This hair cycle-dependent ectopic differentiation of McSCs revealed a crosstalk between the HF epithelial cells with McSCs. But the broad expression pattern of <italic>Sox9-CreER</italic> in all HF epithelial cells cannot pinpoint the specific responsible cell type for this phenotype. Additionally, we also observed aberrant terminal differentiation and total degeneration of the HF structure in the first anagen after morphogenesis ablation of <italic>RBP-J</italic> in <italic>Sox9-CreER::RBP-J</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). This is consistent with previous publication that as the main co-factor of the canonical Notch pathway RBP-J is required for HFSC downstream progenies terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demehri and Kopan, 2009</xref>). The degenerated HF structure prevents further dissection of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the crosstalk between epithelial cells and McSCs in the shared niche environment.</p><p>To solve these problems, we generated a <italic>Krt6-CreER</italic> knockin mouse line to specifically KO <italic>RBP-J</italic> in telogen CD34+ HFSCs but not the sHG cells, which proliferate and generate downstream progenies undergoing differentiation in lower anagen HFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greco et al., 2009</xref>). To this end, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to insert the <italic>IRES-CreER</italic> cassette after the <italic>Krt6a</italic> exon9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The resulting successful insertion was confirmed by genotyping and sequencing. The labeling specificity of <italic>Krt6-CreER</italic> was determined by using the <italic>Krt6-CreER::Ai6</italic> mice. Ai6 allele marks all the <italic>Krt6-CreER</italic> expressing cells as GFP+. When tamoxifen was injected during the second telogen, we found that CD34+ HFSCs and Krt6+ companion layer cells (CPL) are efficiently labeled in close to 100% of the HFs, but only less than 10% of HFs contain occasionally labeled cells in the sHG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

When cKO follicles enter anagen, cells in the lower HF generated by telogen sHGs cells are all RBP-J positive, while the upper HF bulge cells are all RBP-J negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Consequently, anagen follicles in the first round are normal in the <italic>Krt6-CreER::RBP-J</italic> mice. This allows us to carry out in-depth cellular and molecular study of the McSC phenotype observed. McSCs do not express <italic>Krt6</italic> and the number of McSCs in the bulge and their downstream progenies located in the bulb of anagen HFs are normal following telogen cKO of RBP-J in <italic>Krt6-CreER::RBP-J</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Consistent with the observed hair cycle dependent bulge pigmentation phenotype in <italic>Sox9-CreER::RBP-J</italic> mice, we did not observe ectopic pigmentation or McSC abnormal differentiation in the telogen bulge after RBP-J ablation in <italic>Krt6-CreER::RBP-J</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>). Only when hair follicles spontaneously enter anagen can pigmentation be observed in cKO HFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Because the <italic>RBP-J cKO</italic> HFSCs generate the sHG cells and the eventual downstream progenies in later rounds of hair cycles, we observed abnormal terminal differentiation and total degeneration of the HF structure in <italic>Krt6-CreER::RBP-J</italic> mice at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The eventual HF degeneration in mutant skin precludes the long-term observation of McSC ectopic differentiation phenotype.</p><p>To pinpoint if <italic>RBP-J</italic> null HFSCs are solely responsible for causing the McSCs ectopic differentiation phenotype, we used wax to remove hair shaft and the attached CPL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). HF wax at telogen only removes the club hair and the attached Krt6+ CPL cells but not the HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Consequently, the only <italic>RBP-J cKO</italic> cells left in HF are the HFSCs, and the <italic>RBP-J cKO</italic> CPL cells are removed from the equation. Removal of CPL cells at telogen also triggers anagen entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This allows us to follow the hair cycle dependent ectopic differentiation of McSCs in a temporally controlled fashion.</p><p>Cell apoptosis and proliferation are the same in bulge area between WT and cKO follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J</xref>). After HF wax induced anagen entry, the <italic>cKO</italic> HFs start to show ectopic pigmented in bulge at the telogen to anagen transition stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,J</xref>). Starting at D3 post wax, 90% of the <italic>cKO</italic> HFs contain pigmented bulge, compared to less than 20% of <italic>WT</italic> HFs with the same phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). We also detect increased Tyrp1 levels in McSCs of the <italic>cKO</italic> HFs starting at D2 post wax when the HFs are still in telogen, while in <italic>WT</italic> HFs the expression of Tyrp1 is restricted to differentiated melanocytes located in the bulb of anagen HFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Since the phenotype occurs after removal of the CPL cells, we conclude that McSCs are influenced in a paracrine fashion by loss of <italic>RBP-J</italic> specifically in HFSC. It reveals an essential role of HFSCs in maintaining a differentiation refractory niche environment for the neighboring McSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RBP-J functions as a repressor in HFSCs to suppress retinoid metabolic process genes</title><p>To understand the molecular mechanism mediating the crosstalk between HFSCs and McSCs in a shared niche, we first characterized the expression pattern of RBP-J and its Notch pathway co-factors in HFs.

In contrast, the active form of Notch1 ICD (N1ICD) is only detected in the terminally differentiated cells in the pre-cortex cells of anagen HFs or CPL cells in telogen HFs, but not in the HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To examine the expression patterns of other Notch receptor ICDs and active canonical Notch pathway downstream genes, we used FACS to isolate HFSCs and the differentiated matrix cells of anagen HFs using <italic>Nfatc1-CreER::Ai14::Krt14H2BGFP</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Tamoxifen was injected at P12 to label HFSCs as Ai14+ cells in upper HFs. HFSCs are isolated as Sca1-GFP+RFP+ cells. Sca1-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells are sorted as matrix cells due to their frequent cell division that dilutes H2BGFP signals.

Based on our Gene Ontology_Biological Process (GO_BP) analysis of RNA-seq results and previous known factors that regulate melanocyte differentiation, we systematically examined the significantly enriched biological processes or signal pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The top category of our GO_BP analysis is lipid metabolic process. Using maker staining or western blot analysis we found no difference in lipid deposition or organelles with lipid rich membrane structures between <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Krt6-CreER::RBP-J cKO</italic> HFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>). Another highly ranked category is positive regulation of cell death. Since cell death and DNA damage have previously been reported to cause melanocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inomata et al., 2009</xref>), we examined different forms of cell death and DNA damage commonly related to cell death.

Since Wnt signaling has been reported to mediate both HFSCs and McSCs activation at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rabbani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2013</xref>), we specifically checked the level of Wnt signaling.

To functionally test the relevance of Wnt signaling, we used the Wnt inhibitor LGK974 to inhibit the total Wnt level in the niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2I</xref>). We found after LGK974 administration, hair cycle was arrested in telogen and active Wnt signal marker nuclear β-catenin was dramatically decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2I</xref>), indicating efficient blocking of Wnt signaling. However, ectopic differentiation of the McSCs still persisted in the <italic>cKO</italic> HFs after LGK974 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2J</xref>).

At 2 nM ~200 nM RA dosage,~50% of dorsal skin HFs show ectopic pigmentation in the bulge at D4 after wax.

Since c-Kit is the receptor of the KIT-ligand and plays an essential role in melanocyte maturation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 1999</xref>), we used FACS to quantify the c-Kit protein level on McSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). We found that although percentage of total c-Kit+ McSC is not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the percentage of c-Kit<sup>high</sup> cells among the c-Kit+ cells increased 2-fold in the <italic>Krt6-CreER::RBP-J cKO</italic> and <italic>Sox9-CreER::RBP-J cKO</italic> mice compared to <italic>WT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Since RA synthesis inhibitor WIN18446 can efficiently rescue the ectopic pigmentation phenotype in <italic>cKO</italic>, we then asked whether or not the increased level of c-Kit on McSCs from <italic>cKO</italic> skin was due to the changed RA level in vivo. After WIN18446 treatment, the percentage of c-Kit<sup>high</sup>/c-Kit+ did not change in <italic>WT</italic> skin, but the increased percentage of c-Kit<sup>high</sup>/c-Kit+ from <italic>Krt6-CreER::RBP-J cKO</italic> skin was dramatically decreased to level slightly lower than <italic>WT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

So we were curious about where the source of the KIT-ligand would be for the McSC c-Kit receptor to get activated and initiate the ectopic differentiation program. The hair cycle dependent ectopic differentiation of McSCs peaks at D3 post anagen initiation. At this stage the HFs are elongated with the matrix and dermal papilla far away from the bulge region where the ectopic pigmentation occurs. Considering the distance between the matrix and bulge at this time point, we turned our focus to the closest neighbor of McSCs: the HFSCs. First we did qPCR analysis of KIT-ligand <italic>SCF</italic> in FACS isolated HFSCs from <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Krt6-CreER::RBP-J cKO</italic> dorsal skin at both telogen and anagen. At both hair cycle stages we did detect <italic>SCF</italic> expression in the HFSCs but there was no difference between the <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>cKO</italic>. However, when HFSCs transitioned from telogen to anagen, there were significant increase in the level of <italic>SCF</italic> mRNA in both <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>cKO</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>To functionally test whether or not the observed increase of KIT-ligand <italic>SCF</italic> in HFSCs at the telogen to anagen transition stage is the source of differentiation signal that triggers the hair cycle dependent ectopic differentiation of McSCs in the mutant niche, we genetically ablated <italic>SCF</italic> together with <italic>RBP-J</italic> to see if this can rescue the phenotype. When compared to <italic>Krt6-CreER::RBP-J cKO</italic>, the <italic>Krt6-CreER::RBP-J::SCF cKO</italic> completely rescued the McSC ectopic differentiation phenotype in the bulge area without affecting terminal differentiation of melanocytes in the matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of melanocyte differentiation marker Tyrp1 was also down regulated in the <italic>Krt6-CreER::RBP-J::SCF cKO</italic> HFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This genetic rescue experiment confirms that it is the KIT-ligand originated from HFSCs that activates the c-Kit-MEK pathway to induce McSC ectopic differentiation in the mutant niche. We also checked SCF level in rapamycin treated mice and found although hair cycle is delayed after rapamycin treatment, SCF level is still increased in HFSCs comparing to that in telogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which can explain the occurrence of ectopic pigmentation. It’s worth emphasize that the level of KIT-ligand <italic>SCF</italic> in HFSCs was not changed between <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Krt6-CreER::RBP-J cKO</italic> skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). So this striking rescue effect by ablation of <italic>SCF</italic> revealed that the McSCs niche environment is not devoid of differentiation signals. McSC maintain self-renewal ability by expressing low level of c-Kit to remain insensitive to the differentiation signals. While their neighboring HFSCs are not just passive receiver of signaling inputs from the niche, they actively suppress differentiation-sensitizing signals in the niche, such as RA level, to help maintain a differentiation refractory niche environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Fate determination of normal and malignant epidermal cells can be influenced by RA level in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kopan et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kopan and Fuchs, 1989</xref>), but it is not known whether endogenous RA can regulate skin SC function in vivo. Here we uncovered an unexpected role of HFSC regulating the RA level in vivo by RBP-J suppressed retinoid metabolic process genes. The increased endogenous level of RA emanating from HFSCs as a result of RBP-J loss disrupts the self-renewal of McSCs in the same niche space. The fact a metabolite, RA, is the messenger mediating the cross talk of two types of SCs in a shared niche, revealed the previously unknown function of metabolite as a signaling molecule in vivo. Next it would be essential to probe more broadly into whether physiological variations of other metabolite levels could impact on SC fate choices and function during tissue regeneration and disease development, as indicated by recent finding in hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous et al., 2017</xref>).

In our RNA-seq, Nfib expression is the same in Ctrl and cKO HFSCs (232.198 v.s. 203.073). In the Nfib mutants mice the melanocyte number is increased in bulge that is not observed in our RBP-J mutants. Edn family genes are either not expressed or shows decreased expression in cKO HFSCs. (Edn1: 0.237 v.s. 0.155; Edn2: 4.10 v.s. 1.75; Edn3: 0.073 v.s. 0). We have also functionally ruled out Wnt playing a role in the phenotype. Besides the well-studied morphogens, we discover that metabolites represent an entirely new realm of signaling molecules that mediates SC and niche cross talk, and their potential functions warrant further studies in the other systems under homeostasis and pathological conditions.</p><p>Given the current understanding that niche plays dominant roles in SC fate determination, maintenance, and even disease initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scadden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clevers et al., 2014</xref>), SCs are often perceived as passive recipients of the niche signaling and act as they were told. Recent reports started to emerge that in some cases SCs actually play instructive roles in the physical niche formation during morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seleit et al., 2017</xref>). Whether these are exceptions rather than the rule, and whether after the niche has been established, SCs can also regulate the niche signaling environment are less clear. Unexpectedly, we found here that the niche shared by HFSCS and McSCs is not devoid of differentiation signal. In fact the HFSCs secreted KIT-ligand is sufficient to induce the differentiation of neighboring McSCs in the niche, when the c-Kit protein level on McSCs is elevated by increased RA levels in the niche. During normal homeostasis, the Notch pathway co-factor RBP-J functions in HFSCs to suppress the retinoid metabolic process genes. This reveals that HFSCs play an instructive role in maintaining a differentiation refractory niche environment for the neighboring McSCs.</p><p>Retinoid is a common ingredient in daily makeup or cream for acne treatment. If RA can induce McSC differentiation and possible stem cell loss later on, it will become a concern. To test if McSCs will lose their number, we treated C57 WT mice with topical RA and followed McSC number after one hair cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We found that under concentration (1 μg) similar to daily use (1 ~ 5 μg), there is no obvious difference of McSC number comparing to vehicle group, which means RA is safe and will not lead to McSC loss during our daily care. Interestingly, when we treated with lower concentration (1 ng), there is a slight but significant increase in McSC number. This may result from some compensational mechanism between stem cells and possibly could be used to restore melanocyte number in natural hair graying process and diseases that result in melanocyte loss.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and animal treatment</title><p><italic>Sox9-CreER</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Krt6-CreER</italic> were generated by the NIBS transgenic center.

They showed that Rpbj, a downstream component of the Notch pathway, directly represses a key gene for the retinoid metabolic pathway Adh1. Depletion of RBPj in bulge stem cells leads to increase levels of RA, which they showed to be functionally important to induce McSC differentiation in the niche by elevating the c-kit receptor on McSCs. Interestingly, they found that the SCF is expressed by the bulge stem cells and is elevated during telogen to anagen transition, which might account for the specific ectopic differentiation timing seen in RBPj mutants (telogen to anagen transition). Confirming this model, double knockout of RPBJ and SCF in bulge stem cells suppresses McSCs differentiation. Overall, this is a high quality and important work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers' thought your manuscript needed a few points clarified that can likely be handled with textual changes.</p><p>1) Clarification of how quantifications were performed.

The authors analyze Ki67+ cells but melanocyte stem cells may not express Ki67. The results could be explained by proliferation of melanocyte stem cells and by increasing numbers, more cells differentiate.</p><p>3) Does RA increase cKit expression or the number of ckit high cells?

The authors' story is a substantial departure from these previous papers regarding cellular and molecular mechanisms. This said, discussing some of these previous findings in greater depth will help the readers to appreciate the authors' findings in the right context and also help to differentiate the authors' findings from the previous ones even better.

Normally McSCs located in bulge area express DCT but not Tyrp1, which is a marker for differentiated melanocytes. So the ectopic Tyrp1+ McSCs are detected by Tyrp1 and DCT co-staining. We quantified hair follicle bulges with Tyrp1 positive staining signal in DCT+ cells and calculated their percentage. This has been explained more clearly in figure legends where the quantification applies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The analysis of cell proliferation should be improved.

In addition to Ki67 staining we also used quantification of McSC number as a direct readout of whether or not more McSCs are present in the niche under different conditions. Since we did not detect any difference in McSC number we put all these negative results in the supplementary data: in Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, we used DCT staining to quantify the McSC number in WT and <italic>Krt6CreER::RBPJ cKO HFs</italic> and found no difference in cell numbers; in Figure 3—figure supplement 2K, we quantified the McSC number in WT and <italic>Krt6CreER::RBPJ cKO HFs</italic> treated with Wnt inhibitor LGK974 and found no difference in cell numbers; in Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, we quantified the McSC number in bulge and melanocytes number in bulb of WT and <italic>Krt6CreER::RBPJ cKO HFs</italic> treated with RA synthesis inhibitor WIN 18446 and found no difference in cell numbers; in Figure 7—figure supplement 1D, we quantified the McSC number in WT HFs treated with different dosage of RA and found no difference in cell numbers. So based on these results we excluded proliferation as the cause of abnormal differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does RA increase cKit expression or the number of ckit high cells? This part of the manuscript is not clear to me and seems essential for the proposed model.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. Based on our quantification of MsSC number using DCT staining described above, we did not detect increase in cell number. This is confirmed using FACS quantification of the c-Kit+ cells presented in Figure 6—figure supplement 1A. But the percentage of c-Kit<sup>high</sup> among the c-Kit+ McSCs are changed after RA synthesis inhibtor WIN18446 treatment of the cKO HFs (Figure 6A). RA treatment increases c-Kit protein level (Figure 6B) and transforms a part of c-Kit+ but low cells into cKit high cells that we quantified using FACS (Figure 6A). So RA increases the c-Kit protein level and this results in increased number of c-Kit high cells, without change the overall number of McSCs. We have modified the description of this part in Results section to make the conclusion clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) HFSCs are known to regulate McSCs via Wnt and Edn signaling.

In the Introduction we already included the Nfib/Wnt/Edn functions published previously. Now we have added more in depth comparison in the Discussion part. In our RNA-seq, Nfib expression is the same in Ctrl and cKO HFSCs (232.198 v.s. 203.073). In the Nfib mutants mice the melanocyte number is increased in bulge that is not observed in our RBP-J mutants. Edn family genes are either not expressed or shows decreased expression in cKO HFSCs. (Edn1: 0.237 v.s. 0.155; Edn2: 4.10 v.s. 1.75; Edn3: 0.073 v.s. 0). We have also functionally ruled out Wnt playing a role in the phenotype we observed. So based on these results we conclude the phenotype in our mutant is caused by novel mechanism different from previously published findings of how HFSCs regulate McSC functions. We have included these information in the Discussion part, which we agree will help the readers to appreciate our finding in the right context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The manuscript can benefit from some trimming.

We have trimmed down a lot of the description about our negative result parts and elaborated more on the important and essential discoveries. Especially about the points emphasized above. Hopefully the readers will be able to follow our data more easily and appreciate our finding.</p></body></sub-article></article>
