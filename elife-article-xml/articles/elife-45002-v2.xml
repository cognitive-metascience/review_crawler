production. Given the extremely high level of RP synthesis in rapidly growing cells, alteration of any step in the ribosome assembly process may impact growth by leading to proteotoxic stress. Although the transcription factor Hsf1 has emerged as a central regulator of proteostasis, how its activity is coordinated with ribosome biogenesis is unknown. Here, we show that arrest of ribosome biogenesis in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> triggers rapid activation of a highly specific stress pathway that coordinately upregulates Hsf1 target genes and downregulates RP genes. Activation of Hsf1 target genes requires neo-synthesis of RPs, which accumulate in an insoluble fraction and presumably titrate a negative regulator of Hsf1, the Hsp70 chaperone. RP aggregation is also coincident with that of the RP gene activator Ifh1, a transcription factor that is rapidly released from RP gene promoters. Our data support a model in which the levels of newly synthetized RPs, imported into the nucleus but not yet assembled into ribosomes, work to continuously balance Hsf1 and Ifh1 activity, thus guarding against proteotoxic stress during ribosome assembly.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45002.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When yeast cells are growing at top speed, they can make 2,000 new ribosomes every minute. These enormous molecular assemblies are the protein-making machines of the cell. Building new ribosomes is one of the most energy-demanding parts of cell growth and, if the process goes wrong, the results can be catastrophic. The proteins that make up the ribosomes themselves are sticky. Left unattended, they start to form toxic clumps inside the compartment that houses most of the cell’s DNA, the nucleus.</p><p>A protein called Heat shock factor 1, or Hsf1 for short, plays an important role in the cell's quality control systems. It helps to manage sticky proteins by switching on genes that break down protein clumps and prevent new clumps from forming. Hsf1 levels start to rise whenever cells are struggling to keep up with protein production. If it is half-finished ribosomes that are causing the problem, cells can stop making ribosome proteins. The protein in charge of this in yeast is Ifh1. It is a transcription factor that sits at the front of the genes for ribosome proteins, switching them on. When yeast cells get stressed, Ifh1 drops away from the genes within minutes, switching them off again. Yet how this happens, and how it links to Hsf1, is a mystery.</p><p>To start to provide some answers, Albert et al. disrupted the production of ribosomes in yeast cells and examined the consequences. This revealed a new rescue response, that they named the “ribosome assembly stress response”. Both Hsf1 and Ifh1 are sensitive to the build-up of unfinished ribosomes in the nucleus. As expected, Hsf1 activated when ribosome proteins started to build up, and switched on the genes needed to manage the protein clumps. The effect on Isfh1, however, was unexpected. When the unassembled ribosome proteins started to build up, it was the clumps themselves that pulled the Ifh1 proteins off the genes. The unassembled ribosomes proteins seemed to be stopping their own production. Low levels of clumped ribosome proteins in the nuclei of unstressed cells also helped to keep Hsf1 active and pull Ifh1 off the ribosome genes. It is possible that this provides continual protection against a toxic protein build-up.</p><p>These findings are not only important for understanding yeast cells; cancer cells also need to produce ribosomes at a very high rate to sustain their rapid growth. They too might be prone to stresses that interrupt their ribosome assembly. As such, understanding more about this process could one day lead to new therapies to target cancer cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ribosome biogenesis</kwd><kwd>ribosomal protein</kwd><kwd>heat shock factor 1</kwd><kwd>Ifh1</kwd><kwd>topoisomerase</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_170153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shore</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ribosome assembly is monitored to promote proteostatis through a system whereby unassembled ribosomal proteins lead to activation of heat shock factor 1 and inactivation of the RP gene activator Ifh1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ribosome assembly is the most energy demanding process linked to cell growth and requires coordinated production of processed ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), ribosomal proteins (RPs) and ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) factors. This massive biosynthetic program permits rapidly growing yeast cells to produce about 2000 ribosomes per minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Warner, 1999</xref>), which is critical for sustaining high rates of growth (mass accumulation) and proliferation. At the same time, though, ribosome assembly poses a constant threat to cellular protein homeostasis and continued growth, since it requires the coordinated and large-scale assembly of four rRNAs with 79 different RPs, the latter of which are known to be highly prone to aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pillet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rand and Grant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weids et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, unassembled RPs in metazoans have long been known to activate p53, through titration of its negative regulator MDM2, and conserved p53-independent pathways that respond to perturbations in ribosome assembly are now beginning to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">James et al., 2014</xref>). Given the absence of p53 in yeasts, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is a promising model system in which to uncover ancestral processes that might monitor ribosome assembly to regulate growth and protein homeostasis in eukaryotes.</p><p>Heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) is a central actor in Protein Quality Control (PQC) and protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in eukaryotes, in both stressed and unstressed cell, and in pathological situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, Hsf1 is a direct modulator of tumorigenesis and becomes essential, as it is in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solís et al., 2016</xref>), to support growth of malignant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santagata et al., 2013</xref>). Hsf1 prevents protein aggregation and proteome imbalance by driving the expression of a small regulon including genes encoding essential chaperones (Hsp70/Hsp90), nuclear/cytoplasmic aggregases, and proteasome components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solís et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mahat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, studies in budding yeast reveal that the Ribosome Quality Control complex (RQC), conserved from yeast to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>), increases Hsf1 activity under conditions of translation stress. However, many essential aspects of Hsf1 regulation remain to be elucidated, in particular whether its transcriptional activity is linked to ribosome biogenesis itself. Recently, a conserved PQC mechanism referred to as Excess Ribosomal Protein Quality Control (ERISQ) was described that specifically recognizes unassembled RPs in the nucleus and targets them for proteasome degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sung et al., 2016b</xref>), thus illuminating observations made 40 years ago showing that excess RPs are rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gorenstein and Warner, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Warner, 1977</xref>). Sung and colleagues showed that the ubiquitin ligase Tom1 plays an important role in ESRIQ by preventing the accumulation of detergent-insoluble RPs. The potential role of Hsf1 in ERISQ has not yet been explored.</p><p>Given the tremendous investment of cellular resources involved in ribosome production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Warner, 1999</xref>) and the fact that a decrease of ribosome abundance protects cells against proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guerra-Moreno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mills and Green, 2017</xref>), it might be expected that cells have evolved mechanisms to rapidly decrease RP gene transcription in the face of defects in ribosome assembly, in order to both save energy and reestablish cellular proteostasis. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, RP gene transcription is known to be tightly regulated according to growth conditions through the stress-sensitive transcription factor (TF) Ifh1. Thus, Ifh1 is rapidly released from RP promoters only minutes following inhibition of the conserved eukaryotic growth regulator Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schawalder et al., 2004</xref>). Although it has been shown that Ifh1 promoter binding is coordinated with RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) activity upon prolonged TORC1 inhibition to help balance RP and rRNA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rudra et al., 2007</xref>), how Ifh1 is removed from RP gene promoters to immediately downregulate their expression following stress remains a mystery. Furthermore, possible links between RP gene expression, ribosomal assembly and the protein homeostasis transcription program driven by Hsf1 remain important open questions.</p><p>In this study, we uncover a novel regulatory pathway, hereafter referred to as the Ribosomal Assembly Stress Response (RASTR), that allows rapid and simultaneous up-regulation of protein homeostasis genes and downregulation of RP genes following disruption of various steps in ribosome biogenesis (rRNA production, processing or RP assembly). We show that RASTR is highly specific to the RP and Hsf1 regulons, with little or no effect on a much larger group of genes implicated in the Environmental Stress Response (ESR). Importantly, RASTR requires neo-synthesis of RPs following stress and is linked to the accumulation of RP aggregates, which we propose lead to Hsf1 activation, through chaperone competition, and to the sequestration of Ifh1 in an insoluble nucleolar fraction. Notably, we show that protein synthesis inhabitation via cycloheximide treatment leads to a transcriptional response opposite to that of RASTR, supporting a model in which unstressed cells constantly monitor nuclear levels of unassembled RPs and use this information to balance expression of Hsf1 target genes with those encoding RPs. Finally, we demonstrate that RASTR is the initial transcriptional response to inactivation of TORC1 kinase, supporting a key role for this regulatory pathway in the activation of a protein homeostasis transcriptional program that allows cells to cope with the proteotoxic consequences of disruptions to ribosome biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Topoisomerase depletion triggers a rapid repression of RP genes and activation of proteostasis genes</title><p>In an effort to better understand the role of the two major eukaryotic DNA topoisomerases in protein-coding gene transcription, we generated yeast strains in which Top1, Top2, or both of these enzymes are rapidly degraded by the auxin-induced degron (AID) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>) and confirmed by western blotting that significant depletion of either protein was obtained between 10 and 20 min following auxin addition to the medium, and that Top2 depletion, as expected, prevents cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We then performed ChIP-seq analysis of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in the Top1-AID, Top2-AID and Top1/2-AID strains at 20 and 60 min following auxin addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brill et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brill and Sternglanz, 1988</xref>), the absence of Top2 had little or no effect on RNAPII distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, Top1 depletion triggered a rapid response at two specific groups of genes: upregulation of Hsf1 target genes and downregulation of RP genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Remarkably, this response was transient, as both groups of genes returned to normal levels (i.e. before auxin addition) by 60 min. This re-equilibration was dependent upon Top2 since it failed to occur in the Top1/2-AID strain, where prolonged auxin treatment led to significant dysregulation of many other RNAPII-transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45002.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rapid degradation of Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) induces a transient induction of Heat Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1) target genes and down-regulation of ribosomal protein (RP) genes.</title><p>(<bold>A, B, C</bold>) Scatter plots (top panels) and box plots (bottom panels) comparing RNAPII binding (as measured by Rpb1 ChIP-seq) in Top1-AID (<bold>A</bold>), Top2-AID (<bold>B</bold>) and Top1/2-AID (<bold>C</bold>) strains at the indicated times following either auxin or vehicle addition to the media.

This analysis shows clearly that Top1 depletion, as well as depletion of both Top1 and Top2 (at the early 20 min time point), triggers a highly specific stress response linked to RP genes and Hsf1 target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Such a targeted response is unlikely to result from a global topological effect on RNAPII recruitment but would instead appear to be the consequence of the activation of a specific signaling pathway that is more restricted in nature than the ESR.</p><p>To explore the target(s) of this hypothetical signaling pathway at RP genes, we monitored by qPCR ChIP the promoter association of three TFs (Rap1, Fhl1 and Ifh1) that operate at the majority (&gt;90%) of these 138 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knight et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the activator Ifh1 is rapidly released from RP gene promoters after topoisomerases depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), whereas Rap1 and Fhl1, which bind directly to RP promoter DNA, are not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). To confirm that Hsf1 is indeed required for upregulation of genes following Top1 depletion, we used the anchor-away technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>) to rapidly remove Hsf1 from the nucleus (30 min treatment with rapamycin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solís et al., 2016</xref>) before initiating Top1-AID degradation by auxin addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Efficient nuclear depletion of Hsf1 was confirmed by the inability of the Hsf1-FRB, Top1-AID strain to form colonies in the presence of rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Note that the strain used in this and all other anchor-away experiments contains the <italic>TOR1-1</italic> mutation and is thus resistant to the normal physiological consequences of rapamycin treatment, which inactivates the growth-promoting TORC1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heitman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>). This experiment revealed that Hsf1 nuclear depletion completely abolishes activation of stress genes following Top1 depletion without affecting down-regulation of RP genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Therefore, activation of stress-induced genes following Top1 depletion is completely Hsf1-dependent, whereas repression of RP genes is independent of Hsf1 or the induction of its target genes. We would also note that the stress pathway induced by Top1 depletion is unusually restricted in comparison to many other stress responses that are often grouped together as the Environmental Stress Response (ESR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>), since Msn2/4 target genes are not induced and RiBi genes are not downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Top1 depletion arrests ribosome biogenesis and activates a ribosomal assembly stress response</title><p>Although it may seem surprising that depletion of topoisomerases can induce a Hsf1-dependent stress response, formation of distinct nuclear foci by the Btn2 aggregase and perinuclear accumulation of the proteasome subunit Pre6 following Top1/2 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) both point to the induction of proteotoxic stress in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 2015a</xref>). Top1 was initially identified through a mutation (<italic>mak1</italic>) defective in large ribosomal subunit production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thrash et al., 1985</xref>) and was later shown to be required for proper rRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brill et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El Hage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">French et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we observed a strong reduction of pre-rRNA synthesis as shown by decreased [<sup>3</sup>H]-adenine pulse-labeling of the RNAPI-transcribed 35S pre-rRNA, and two co-transcriptionally cleaved products, 27S and 20S pre-rRNAs, as early as 10 min after initiation of Top1 (or Top1 and Top2) depletion by addition of auxin to the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This decreased rRNA synthesis is accompanied by an elongation defect, as shown by the accumulation of truncated pre-rRNAs that were initially described by the Tollervey laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El Hage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Further downstream, the rapid defect in rRNA production caused by inhibition of RNAPI elongation leads to unbalanced production of 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, with a marked deficiency of the large (60S) subunit relative to the small (40S) subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This would be expected to create a disequilibrium between RP and rRNA production, and more specifically an excess of unassembled RPs. Consistent with this, we detect accumulation of both and large and small subunit proteins (Rpl3 and Rps8, respectively) in trailing fractions of polysome gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that RPs fail to be incorporated normally into ribosomes immediately following topoisomerase degradation. In addition, this sedimentation profile may also reflect the presence of disassembling or incompletely assembled pre-60S particles.

To challenge this idea, we measured the transcriptional response to three different perturbations to ribosome biogenesis: depletion of two essential ribosome assembly factors (Utp8 and Utp13) and treatment of cells with diazaborine. Utp8p is a member of the t-UTP subcomplex of 90S pre-ribosomes and its depletion inhibits rDNA transcription, leading to a reduction of the primary 35S pre-rRNA transcript and subsequent processing intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallagher et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, depletion of Utp13 (a member of the UTP-B subcomplex) interferes with downstream processing and synthesis of 40S subunits and causes decreased 18S rRNA levels without affecting the levels of the 25S or 5.8S rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallagher et al., 2004</xref>). Diazaborine, an inhibitor of the essential Drg1 AAA-ATPase, rapidly blocks mid-late steps of 60S subunit maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Loibl et al., 2014</xref>). Remarkably, all these treatments triggered a similar transcriptional response to that which occurs following Top1 depletion, namely a specific downregulation of RP genes and upregulation of Hsf1 target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which we refer to as the ‘Ribosome Assembly STress Response’ (RASTR).</p><p>Hsf1 activity is stimulated by many different types of cellular stress, including stalled ribosomes. A pioneering study reported that a set of proteins termed the RQC binds to 60S ribosomal subunits containing stalled polypeptides and leads to their degradation. In the process, the RQC triggers a specific stress signal that leads to Hsf1 target gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, cells lacking a component of the RQC, the Tae2 protein, fail to activate Hsf1 following translational stress. To ask if RASTR might be related to the RQC, we induced Top1/2 degradation in <italic>tae2-</italic>Δ cells. We found that activation of two Hsf1 target genes (<italic>SSA1</italic> and <italic>HSP42</italic>) and downregulation of two RP genes (<italic>RPL30</italic> and <italic>RPL39</italic>) was unaffected by deletion of <italic>TAE2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and conclude that RQC does not play a role in RASTR. These results highlight that cells have developed distinct mechanisms to adapt the Hsf1 transcriptional program to defects in both ribosome activity and ribosome assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ifh1 sequestration in an insoluble nuclear fraction during RASTR is driven by RP accumulation</title><p>Although many studies would support the notion that Hsf1 activation during RASTR occurs through sequestration of its inhibitory partner Hsp70 by RP aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>), it is less clear how ribosome assembly stress could trigger release of Ifh1 from RP gene promoters. We reported previously that the association of Ifh1 with RP gene promoters in growing cells is rapidly disrupted (within 5 min) following inhibition of the growth-promoting TORC1 kinase by addition of rapamycin to the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schawalder et al., 2004</xref>). More recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2016</xref>), we found that stable release of Ifh1 from RP gene promoters (measured 20 min after rapamycin addition) requires its C-terminal domain together with a complex of proteins containing casein kinase 2 (CK2) and two RiBi factors, Utp22 and Rrp7, with which Ifh1 interacts to form the CURI complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rudra et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, in <italic>ifh1-</italic>ΔC cells the truncated protein is rapidly released but later returns to RP gene promoters following TORC1 inhibition. This led us to propose two distinct mechanisms controlling the promoter release of Ifh1 following stress: one operating at a short timescale (&lt;5 min) and the other on a long timescale (~20 min). Interestingly, ifh1-ΔC promoter release is stable following Top1 depletion, suggesting that an unknown mechanism regulates Ifh1 during RASTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45002.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Evidence that Ifh1 is rapidly removed from RP gene promoters and sequestered in an insoluble nucleolar fraction pursuant to unassembled RP accumulation following RASTR initiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ifh1 occupancy at the <italic>RPL30</italic> and <italic>RPL37A</italic> promoters 20 min following vehicle, rapamycin or auxin treatment of Top1/2-AID strains expressing either WT Ifh1 (<italic>IFH1</italic>) or a C-terminal truncated allele (<italic>ifh1-∆C</italic>).

Several lines of evidence are consistent with this hypothesis. To begin with, in cells lacking Tom1, an E3 ligase required for degradation of unassembled RPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sung et al., 2016b</xref>), but not in <italic>TOM1</italic> cells, Ifh1 accumulates in prominent nuclear foci even in the absence of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This suggests that Ifh1 aggregates in cells that are unable to efficiently degrade excess RPs, even under optimal growth conditions. Consistent with this, the published mass spectrometry data of insoluble fractions from cells either treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib or lacking Tom1 clearly identified Ifh1, together with RPs, RiBi proteins and two Hsp70 proteins, Ssa1 and Ssa2, inhibitory partners of Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data indicate that Ifh1 could be trapped in an insoluble cellular fraction in the absence of Tom1 and thus decrease the pool of Ifh1 able to bind with RP gene promoters. To test this possibility, we combined deletion of <italic>TOM1</italic> with a mutant allele of <italic>IFH1</italic> (<italic>ifh1-AA</italic>) that weakens its interaction with RP gene promoters. Remarkably, <italic>tom1-</italic>Δ is synthetically lethal with <italic>ifh1-AA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) supporting the notion that RP aggregation could directly impact on Ifh1 promoter binding. Lastly, to exclude the possibility that the genetic interaction between <italic>TOM1</italic> and the mutated allele of <italic>IFH1</italic> could be linked to the growth defect of this mutation, we examined another mutated allele of IFH1 (<italic>ifh1-6</italic>) that triggers a similar growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Importantly, we showed in a previous study that this <italic>ifh1-6</italic> mutant protein remains bound at high levels to RP genes promoter even under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2016</xref>).

We also noted a strong increase in RiBi factors, primarily those implicated in biogenesis of the large ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Importantly, Ifh1 was never detected in an insoluble fraction in the absence of stress but was invariably detected in these fractions following topoisomerase depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

It is important to note that Ifh1 binding is highly specific to RP genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knight et al., 2014</xref>) and that the transcriptional effect of its nuclear depletion is restricted to RP genes and a very small number of additional targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

Indeed, Hsf1 target gene activation under these conditions is lower than in untreated cells and not significantly different than that seen in cells treated with cycloheximide alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These findings clearly demonstrate that RASTR is dependent upon de novo protein synthesis. Importantly, it was recently reported that cycloheximide treatment efficiently prevents aggregation of newly synthesized RPs following proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>). Perhaps as a direct consequence of this, we found that CHX treatment also leads to strong reduction of Ifh1-eGFP nuclear foci that are observed in cells lacking the ubiquitin ligase Tom1, which is specifically required for efficient degradation of unassembled RPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sung et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Similarly, cycloheximide treatment also prevents the release of Ifh1 from RP gene promoters in response to the activation of RASTR by topoisomerase depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Considered as a whole, these data suggest that both RP and Ifh1 subnuclear structures (aggregates) are dynamic, promoted by de novo RP production upon RASTR initiation, and capable of influencing Ifh1 promoter binding. Consistent with this view, we observed a large increase in cells that accumulate RP (Rpl25) or Ifh1 nuclear aggregates during RASTR that is abolished in the presence of cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>).</p><p>Taken together with the strong reduction of Hsf1 target gene activation following Ifh1 cytoplasmic anchoring, both in the presence and absence of topoisomerase degradation, our observations on the effect of cycloheximide highlight the interwoven nature of RP and Hsf1 target gene regulons and support the notion that unassembled, aggregated RPs constitute the primary RASTR-induced signal capable of regulating both Ifh1 and Hsf1 activities, albeit in an opposite direction. More generally, these data indicate that newly synthetized RPs, in both stressed and unstressed cells, operate as a central hub in coordinating the expression of RP genes themselves with the Hsf1-dependent activation of chaperone and proteasome genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>RASTR is the first transcriptional response to environmental stress</title><p>We next turned our attention to the potential involvement of RASTR during more general stress responses that might also rapidly affect ribosome assembly. In an initial set of experiments, we inactivated the conserved growth-promoting TORC1 kinase by treatment of cells with rapamycin, which is known to mimic a major part of the environmental stress response, including osmotic and redox stress, as well as carbon, nitrogen, phosphate or amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>). As reported previously, rapamycin triggers a rapid arrest of rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and a decrease of RP and RiBi gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

Remarkably, this specifically prevented RP gene repression and Hsf1 target gene activation at 5 min following rapamycin addition, whereas at the longer time point (20 min) RP genes and Hsf1 were regulated independently of cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Consistent with the early block in RP gene downregulation being due to a failure to initiate RASTR immediately following rapamycin addition, we showed that cycloheximide pre-treatment prevents release of Ifh1 from RP gene promoters at 5 min, but not at 20 min following rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>The effects of rapamycin treatment described above are fully consistent with our previous report demonstrating that regulation of RP gene transcription following TORC1 inactivation by rapamycin operates through two distinct mechanisms at short and long timescales, with the latter dependent on RNAPI activity and the CURI complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2016</xref>). The short timescale mechanism described here, which is dependent upon continued protein synthesis and presumably mediated by RASTR, allows cells to rapidly arrest RP production and avoid or minimize proteotoxic stress induced by arrested ribosome assembly. The second mechanism permits the resumption of RP production only when rRNA synthesis also resumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2016</xref>). These two mechanisms could be particularly useful to rapidly adapt ribosome production to new growth conditions.</p><p>To explore the possible generality of rapid RASTR-mediated shut-down of RP gene transcription in response to stress, we measured the transcriptional response to heat shock, which is known to transiently downregulate both RP gene and rRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kos-Braun et al., 2017</xref>). As expected, we observed strong downregulation of RP genes and upregulation of Hsf1 target genes only 5 min following a shift in temperature to 40°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>, left panels) that was also accompanied by strong upregulation of Msn2 target genes and downregulation of RiBi genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, left panel). The heat-shock transcriptional response is thus much broader than that to ribosome assembly stress, despite their common effects on RP and Hsf1 target gene expression. Remarkably, though, we found that cycloheximide pre-treatment prevents the strong and immediate repression of RP genes following heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>; right panels; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>), consistent again with the idea that this facet of the heat-shock response is identical to that which occurs during RASTR. Importantly though, Hsf1 target genes are still activated following heat shock in the presence of cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>; right panels), presumably because the unfolding of thermo-labile proteins induced by heat shock is alone sufficient to activate Hsf1 even in the absence of continuing RP synthesis. Nevertheless, the striking requirement for de novo protein synthesis for RP gene downregulation following heat shock strongly suggests that RASTR plays an integral role in this component of the heat-shock response and thus may constitute the earliest transcriptional response, at the level of RNAPII, to a wide variety of stress conditions.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45002.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>RP gene downregulation following heat shock is blocked by cycloheximide.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatter plots comparing RNAPII ChIP-Seq in cells pre-treated or not with cycloheximide (CHX) followed by 5 min of heat shock (y-axis, HS) versus non-stressed cells (x-axis, no HS, no CHX).

Our data and several previous reports suggest that rapid ribosome biogenesis is a potentially proteotoxic process, in large part due to accumulation of unassembled RPs, whose production needs to be carefully coordinated at the transcriptional level, at least in yeast, together with that of chaperones and proteasome components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In this perspective, RASTR may play an essential role in minimizing the proteostasis burden imposed by high ribosome production rates, particularly under fluctuating environmental conditions.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45002.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>RP and Hsf1 target genes are regulated as a function of unassembled RP levels in both growing and stressed cells.</title><p>In rapidly growing, un-stressed cells, RNAPII initiation at RP and Hsf1 target genes is continuously adjusted according to the levels of un-assembled RPs (central sector). Under various stress conditions (including RASTR, heat shock, TORC1 inhibition, perhaps many others), levels of unassembled RPs increase dramatically, and RPs accumulate with nucleolar proteins, Ifh1 and chaperones in an insoluble nuclear or nucleolar fraction. This leads to the rapid upregulation of Hsf1 target genes (e.g. chaperones and proteasome components), presumably through Hsp70 titration, and to the coincident downregulation of RP genes, through Ifh1 sequestration (bottom left sector, ‘RP excess’). Conversely, a decrease in RP production (as provoked here by cycloheximide treatment) will lead to an opposite transcriptional response (bottom right sector, ‘RP depletion’). In summary, we propose that levels of unassembled nuclear RPs act to constantly adjust RP and Hsf1 target gene expression, allowing the cell to balance growth with protein homeostasis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45002-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our data indicate that disequilibrium at any step-in ribosome biogenesis (rRNA transcription, early or late rRNA processing or assembly) will lead to RASTR activation until the pool of unassembled RPs decreases. Consequently, proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kos-Braun et al., 2017</xref>), dNTP depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gómez-Herreros et al., 2013</xref>), DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conconi et al., 2005</xref>), nutrient and thermal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsang et al., 2003</xref>), all of which are known to alter rRNA transcription or processing, or ribosome assembly (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">James et al., 2014</xref>), are likely to activate RASTR, as do the genetic perturbations at different step of ribosome assembly described here. Taken together with previous reports, our data thus point to a critical role for RASTR in the transcriptional networks regulating both growth and protein homeostasis.</p><p>It is important to note that RPs are among the most abundant ubiquitinylated proteins that accumulate in the nucleus of proteasome-deficient <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sung et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mayor et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that the synthesis of RPs and their assembly into ribosomes must be tightly coordinated with the cell’s proteostasis capacity. Consistent with this view, we show here that induction of ribosome assembly stress is correlated with the rapid accumulation of RPs in a detergent-insoluble fraction and that blocking de novo RP production, either by anchoring away Ifh1 or treating cells with cycloheximide, diminishes or abolishes a key transcriptional consequence of RASTR, namely upregulation of Hsf1 target genes. Our observations thus strongly suggest that RP aggregates are an important activating signal for RASTR. Nevertheless, we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>) detect a large number of additional proteins that accumulate in an insoluble fraction upon ribosome assembly stress, including many RiBi proteins (e.g. numerous rRNA helicases and processing factors), the RP gene activator Ifh1, and chaperones. At present, we do not know the precise molecular nature of these aggregates, which presumably accumulate in the nucleolar space, or even whether they represent a common structure. In any event, our data suggest that RP- and Ifh1-containing aggregates are highly dynamic since the promoter release of Ifh1 and activation of Hsf1 following Top1 degradation are rapidly reversed by Top2 compensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and Ifh1 aggregates that appear in <italic>tom1-</italic>Δ cells quickly diminish following cycloheximide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We imagine that this provides a strong selective advantage by allowing cells to rapidly recover from a transient disruption of ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>Accumulation of proteins in insoluble fractions or aggregates underlies numerous diseases, as well as aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saarikangas and Barral, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tuite and Melki, 2007</xref>). However, certain protein aggregates appear to be dynamic structures that contribute to cellular fitness by protecting the cell during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cherkasov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Douglas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grousl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller et al., 2015b</xref>). For example, stress granules and P-bodies, two of the most intensively studied insoluble macromolecular aggregates, have emerged as important cytoplasmic regulators of gene expression by controlling the processing, sequestering and/or degradation of specific RNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Decker and Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mahboubi and Stochaj, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, it has recently been reported that nucleolar proteins can form sub-compartmental structures by promoting liquid-liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feric et al., 2016</xref>). Although further work will be required to characterize the composition, assembly and function of these nucleolar membrane-less structures, they are attractive candidates for regulatory hubs that could act by sensing ribosome biogenesis stress and controlling adaptive responses. With respect to the present study, we imagine that liquid phase-separated structures in the nucleolus could be directly involved in sequestration of Ifh1 during RASTR, as well as the titration of Hsp70 that we propose leads to Hsf1 activation. A challenge for future studies will be to characterize the physical properties of these postulated structures and their relevance to the transcriptional outputs that we measure here.</p><p>We showed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2016</xref>) that in strains where RNAPI is constitutively active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laferté et al., 2006</xref>) Ifh1 is released from RP gene promoters shortly after TORC1 inhibition by rapamycin treatment (~5 min) but returns only 15 min later. This promoter re-binding does not occur in wild-type cells due to the action of two RiBi proteins (Utp22 and Rrp7) that can sequester Ifh1 in the CURI (Casein Kinase 2/Utp22/Rrp7/Ifh1) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rudra et al., 2007</xref>) allowing to re-align RP gene expression with RNAPI activity. These findings revealed that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has developed temporally distinct mechanisms to regulate RP gene expression. One of the keys finding in the present study is to confirm the existence of a two-step process in RP gene regulation and to link the first step to control of the Hsf1 regulon. We propose that this short timescale mechanism results from a rapid rise in unassembled RPs that occurs immediately following TORC1 inhibition, or other stresses that disrupt ribosome assembly, such as depletion of Top1 or RiBi factors.</p><p>Following ribosome assembly stress, we imagine that the rapid induction of Hsf1 target genes, in combination with the arrest of RP gene transcription, contributes to the eventual clearing of proteotoxic unassembled RPs from the nucleus, thereby removing the signal that promotes RASTR and leads to Ifh1 promoter release and Hsf1 activation. Accordingly, RP production is abolished by 20 min following TORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reiter et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that RASTR becomes inoperant, thus explaining the downregulation of Hsf1 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and the switch to a secondary regulatory mechanism, involving sequestration of Ifh1 in the CURI complex, to align RP expression with rRNA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this view, the short time scale mechanism of RP gene downregulation is abolished by attenuating proteotoxicity through translation inhibition (cycloheximide treatment) whereas the long time scale process is insensitive to translation arrest but can be prevented by expression of a constitutively active RNAPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laferté et al., 2006</xref>). These two independent mechanisms adapt RP gene expression to both rRNA production and ribosome assembly, thus minimizing the accumulation of unassembled RPs.</p><p>As alluded to above, ribosome assembly stress in higher eukaryotes has been studied extensively in the context of ribosomopathies, diseases often associated with RP gene haplo-insufficiencies, RP gene point mutations or mutations in RiBi factors. One hypothesis put forward to explain these observations is that unassembled RPs trigger a feedback mechanism that decreases transcription of ribosome biogenesis genes by inhibiting c-Myc function and arrests cell growth through p53 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). It has also been recently reported that the rRNA helicase DDX21 binds to and activates RP gene promoters in a manner that may be sensitive to the status of ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calo et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that unassembled RPs could mediate an ancestral process to regulate ribosome biogenesis conserved from prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nomura, 1999</xref>) to eukaryotes. Transcriptome analysis immediately following ribosome assembly stress in mammalian cells will be required to understand the interplay between these different mechanisms and may also uncover novel pathways.</p><p>Our work also provides insights into the connection between ribosome assembly and Hsf1 that was first revealed in a report from the Churchman lab that appeared as our work was being prepared for publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tye et al., 2018</xref>). Hsf1 is a key sensor of proteotoxic stress in all eukaryotes that controls a common set of chaperones conserved from yeast to human. One protective function reported for Hsf1 is its ability to reduce protein aggregate formation leading to neurogenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neef et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, Hsf1 also exerts a pro-oncogenic function through its ability to promote proteostasis in rapidly growing tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mendillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Santagata et al., 2011</xref>). Despite its central function, a holistic understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that govern Hsf1 activity still missing. Our work and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tye et al. (2018)</xref> demonstrates that Hsf1 activity is tightly linked to ribosome biogenesis in yeast, in a manner independent of the previously described RQC mechanism that contributes to the dissociation of aberrant nascent polypeptides from the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>). These two mechanisms highlight the central importance of ribosome assembly and activity in regulation of cellular protein homeostasis through Hsf1. Although it is currently unknown if RASTR is conserved in metazoans, we note that RPs are also subjected to a high turnover rate compared to other nuclear components in mammalian cells and that proteasome or ribosome assembly inhibition trigger a rapid accumulation of RPs in the nucleus, whereas arrest of translation has an opposite effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lam et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, it was reported that cycloheximide treatment also abolishes Hsf1 activity in mammalian cell by an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santagata et al., 2013</xref>). We propose that a dynamic balance between unassembled and assembled RPs could be sensed by Hsf1 to constantly adjust protein homeostasis transcription programs in eukaryotes with translational flux, proteolysis and the rate of ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), since disruption or hyperactivation of any of these processes will rapidly change nuclear levels of free RPs. Given the growing body of evidence linking Hsf1 activity to numerous diseases associated with proteotoxic stress, but also rapid cell growth in cancer, it will be of great interest to challenge this model in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Cycloheximide</td><td>Sigma</td><td>C7698</td><td>Materials and methods subsection: Yeast strains and growth</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Rapamycin</td><td>Sigma</td><td>R8781</td><td>Materials and methods subsection: Yeast strains and growth</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Auxin</td><td>Sigma</td><td>1288G</td><td>Materials and methods subsection: Yeast strains and growth</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Diazaborine</td><td>Provided by <break/>H Bergler.

The cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature and quenched by adding 125 mM glycine for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with ice-cold HBS and resuspended in 3.6 mL of ChIP lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-Na pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Samples were aliquoted in Eppendorf tubes and frozen. After thawing, the cells were broken using Zirconia/Silica beads (BioSpec). The lysate was spun at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C and the pellet was resuspended in 300 μl ChIP lysis buffer + 1 mM PMSF and sonicated for 15 min (30 s ON - 60 s OFF) in a Bioruptor (Diagenode). The lysate was spun at 7000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. Antibody (1 μg / 300 μL of lysate, Abcam ab5131) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 1 hr at 4°C. Magnetic beads were washed three times with PBS plus 0.5% BSA and added to the lysates (30 μL of beads/300 μL of lysate). The samples were incubated for 2 hr at 4°C. The beads were washed twice with (50 mM HEPES-Na pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.03% SDS), once with AT2 buffer (50 mM HEPES-Na pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), once with AT3 buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and twice with TE. The chromatin was eluted from the beads by resuspension in TE + 1% SDS and incubation at 65°C for 10 min. The eluate was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and incubated overnight at 65°C to reverse the crosslinks. The DNA was purified using High Pure PCR Cleanup Micro Kit (Roche). DNA libraries were prepared using TruSeq ChIP Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 and the reads were mapped to the sacCer3 genome assembly using HTSStation (shift = 150 bp, extension = 50 bp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">David et al., 2014</xref>). To compare depleted versus non-depleted cells, we divided the signal from the + auxin and/or rapamycin and/or cycloheximide samples by the signal from the – auxin and/or rapamycin and/or cycloheximide (vehicle) samples and log2 transformed this value.

Chilled samples were treated by tip sonication (20%, 10 s, 2x) and centrifuged for 20 min at 600 g at 4°C. Aggregated proteins were pelleted at 16,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. After removing supernatants, insoluble proteins were washed once with Wash I buffer (20 mM Na-phosphate pH 6.8, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 2% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail), and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Insoluble proteins were washed with Wash II buffer (20 mM Na-phosphate pH 6.8, ice-cold), pelleted and sonicated (2x for 10 s) in 40 μl of Wash II buffer. For analysis by SDS-PAGE (4–12% acrylamide) and subsequent western blotting, proteins were first boiled in Laemmli buffer. 1x of the total cell lysate and 25x of the insoluble pellet fraction were separated and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting. Proteins were identified by shotgun mass spectrometry analysis at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH, Zurich) following TCA precipitation (20%) and acetone washing, according to posted procedures. Database searches were performed by using the Mascot (SwissProt, all species; SwissProt, yeast) search program, using very stringent settings in Scaffold (1% protein FDR, a minimum of 2 peptides per protein, 0.1% peptide FDR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Polysome gradients</title><p>Yeast cells growing exponentially were treated or not with auxin for 20 min. 50 µg/mL cycloheximide (Sigma) was added directly to the culture medium.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John Woolford (Reviewer #2); Marlene Oeffinger (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This report shows that depletion of Top1, which leads to arrest of Pol I elongation, evokes a specific induction of the Hsf1 regulon, and not the general ESR, which can be blocked by anchor away of Hsf1; and also evokes the rapid downregulation of nearly all ribosome protein genes (RPGs), which can be attributed to loss of the transcription factor Ifh1 from RPG promoters. They term this response RASTR for Ribosome Assembly Stress Response. Evidence is presented that the signal for both responses, Hsf1 target induction and RPG repression, is a defect in 60S ribosome biogenesis associated with accumulation of nuclear aggregates of unassembled RPs, which sequester Ifh1 from RPG promoters. They show that blocking new synthesis of RPs by anchor away of Ifh1 blocks induction of Hsf1 targets on depletion of Top1. Moreover, they show that cycloheximide (CHX) treatment blocks both aspects of RASTR, presumably by preventing accumulation of newly synthesized RPs in nuclear aggregates capable of sequestering Ifh1, (although this effect of CHX on aggregation of RPs and Ifh1 was not directly demonstrated). CHX also appears to block the RASTR that is triggered immediately by Rapamycin presumably owing to an immediate inhibition of rRNA processing before the onset of RP repression, leading to accumulation of RP aggregates that sequester Ifh1. However, again, this interpretation was not supported by direct evidence of nuclear aggregates of RPs and Ifh1 at early, but not later, times of Rapamycin treatment, which are eliminated by CHX treatment. The authors conclude that unassembled RPs in nuclear aggregates serve to activate the Hsf1 regulon and down-regulate RPG transcription by sequestering Ifh1 as a means of tightly regulating RP expression and responding to the toxicity of RP aggregates, which functions both in normal cells and during conditions of unbalanced RP and rRNA production when ribosome biogenesis is impaired, when TORC1 is acutely inhibited by Rapamycin, and during heat-shock.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Additional experiments are required to establish that the accumulation of ribosomal proteins and Ifh1 in nuclear aggregates is diminished in cells treated with cycloheximide (CHX) to justify the interpretations of multiple experiments in Figures 5-6, in which CHX is found to block RASTR in response to Top1 depletion or at the early time points of rapamycin treatment. The authors should also confirm that Ifh1 promoter occupancy is reduced in tom1 cells to bolster their interpretation of the genetic data in Figure 3D. Revisions of text are also needed throughout the paper to better explain the rationale behind certain experiments or their design, and to expand the Discussion to consider the signals for triggering RASTR (does it involve unassembled 40S proteins, is it limited to the early stages of ribosome assembly), the conditions that lead to cessation of the response, and situations in WT cells in which it would be triggered (all described in the major comments of reviewer #2 and #3).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This report shows that depletion of Top1, which leads to arrest of Pol I elongation evokes a specific induction of the Hsf1 regulon, and not the general ESR, which is blocked by anchor away of Hsf1; and also to rapid downregulation of nearly all ribosome protein genes (RPGs), which can be attributed to loss of the transcription factor Ifh1 from RPG promoters.

Unlike in cells treated with Rapamycin, in which Ifh1 also is sequestered, the removal of Ifh1 from RPG promoters in RASTR does not required the Ifh1 C-terminal domain.

Further experiments explain how this occurs. When ribosome assembly is blocked by aborting rRNA transcription or preventing assembly factor function, excess unassembled ribosomal proteins aggregate. This leads to sequestration of Hsp70, an inhibitor of Hsf1, as well as Ifh, which is necessary for transcription of RP genes.</p><p>The RASTR mediated pathway is rapid and apparently short-lived, activated within 5 minor aborting assembly, but returning to previous levels of expression of r protein proteostasis genes within an hour. It is not yet known whether r proteins, Ifh1, and Hsp70 are present in separate pools of aggregates, or whether or how they traffic into or out of aggregates.</p><p>Because ribosomal proteins are synthesized at such high levels in rapidly growing cells, RASTR represents a significant mechanism to prevent proteostasis when assembly is imbalanced by any means.</p><p>Some data are presented to distinguish RASTR from other stress response pathways, and to distinguish long term responses from the short term RASTR pathway. I found this portion of the Results and Discussion difficult to follow at times. The manuscript could perhaps be made more clear, especially for a general readership, by including a short paragraph early in the Discussion clearly outlining in one place the different pathways. To what exactly might each pathway respond and why? For example, what are general means by which imbalance in synthesis of ribosome components could be created in wild type cells (or by mutation?) and what then enables a return to normal synthesis once RASTR is inactivated? Is it diminished pools of aggregates? Then what about the primary triggers for the pathway? It also might be worth repeating here exactly where and how the CURI complex fits in to these effects.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the submitted manuscript by Albert et al., the authors identify the Ribosomal Assembly Stress Response (RASTR), a novel regulatory pathway that responds to excess numbers of RPs and their aggregation, and allows a simultaneous up-regulation of protein homeostasis genes and down-regulation of RP genes upon disruption of ribosome biogenesis at different stages, providing a mechanism for the cell to counteract RP proteotoxicity.</p><p>Overall, the data presented here is very interesting and experimentally sound. The data is mostly well-presented and the manuscript generally concise; however, a few points should be addressed by the authors.</p><p>- Throughout, the authors focus on the accumulation and fate of large subunit RPs and in Figure 2C and D, only large subunit RPs are shown by western blot. Have the authors looked at small subunit RPs? Given that the stresses shown here affect pre-rRNA transcription and assembly of RPs with pre-rRNA is co-transcriptional, the sRPs should also be affected and involved in the RASTR. The authors should address this point in their Discussion at the very least.</p><p>- The authors selected Utp8 and Utp13 to mimic a ribosome assembly stress response as observed with Top1 and Top1/2 deletion; why were these two proteins chosen specifically? This should be explained for an audience less familiar with ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>- Along these lines, the authors say that disruption of ribosome biogenesis at several levels – pre-rRNA transcription/processing, assembly – will activate RASTR.

To address this issue, we first point out more clearly in the revised text that the Deshaies lab (Sung et al., 2016) have already shown by MS analysis that RP aggregation following proteasome inhibition is strongly diminished upon cycloheximide (CHX) addition. Since the aggregation assay that they used didn’t allow them to discriminate between cytosolic and nuclear aggregates we decided to use an alternative approach (live cell imaging) to observe accumulation of RPs and Ifh1 in protein aggregates. To this end, we expressed Super-Fold GFP-tagged versions of Ifh1 and Rpl25 and observed their aggregation (foci formation) in the presence or absence of CHX. Significantly, we found that Ifh1 forms small punctate structures in a <italic>tom1-Δ</italic> strain (new Figure 3D). Remarkably, these nuclear structures rapidly diminish (20 min) after CHX treatment (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). Furthermore, we have now added data showing that the accumulation of Ifh1 in nuclear aggregates observed during RASTR (old Figure 3C) is abolished in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) (new Figure 5G),in agreement with the proposed model, now in Figure 8. Lastly, we observed during RASTR activation that Rpl25-eGFP rapidly forms a nuclear structure that is not observed in the presence of CHX (new Figure 5F). Taken together, we believe that our new results provide very clear evidence that CHX blocks (or strongly diminishes) the formation of both RP and Ifh1 aggregates following RASTR activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors should also show that Ifh1 promoter occupancy is reduced in tom1 cells to bolster their interpretation of the genetic data in Figure 3D.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we performed Ifh1 ChIP in <italic>tom1-</italic>Δ cells, which showed that Ifh1 binding at <italic>RPL30</italic> appears to be reduced compared to that in <italic>TOM1</italic> cells (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). However, this reduction is small, and we are hesitant to place too much weight on quantitative comparisons of ChIP enrichment in different strains. Nevertheless, this small difference in Ifh1 binding is in agreement with the near wild-type growth rate of the <italic>tom1-Δ</italic> strain, suggesting that the level of Ifh1 promoter occupancy in <italic>tom1-Δ</italic> remains sufficient to promote near normal RP gene transcription. Importantly, though, cycloheximide treatment triggers a significant increase in Ifh1 promoter binding in <italic>tom1-Δ</italic> strains compared to wild type (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1C), consistent with the disappearance of Ifh1 nuclear aggregates upon CHX treatment in the <italic>tom1-Δ</italic> strain (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). These data support the idea that <italic>tom1-Δ</italic> does indeed increase the amount of Ifh1 trapped in an insoluble nuclear fraction that can be rapidly released upon CHX treatment to increase binding at RP promoters.</p><p>Lastly, to exclude the possibility that the genetic interaction between <italic>TOM1</italic> and the hypo-morphic <italic>ifh1-AA</italic> allele (shown previously in Figure 3D) could be linked to the growth defect of this mutation, we examined another mutated allele of <italic>IFH1 (ifh1-6</italic>) that triggers a similar growth defect (new Figure 3E).</p><p>Importantly, the ifh1-6 mutant protein remains bound at high levels to RP gene promoters even under stress conditions, whereas ifh1-AA interacts weakly with RP gene promoters, even under optimal growth conditions (Albert et al., 2016). Remarkably, <italic>tom1-Δ</italic> is synthetically lethal only with ifh1-AA (new Figure 3E), supporting the notion that this genetic interaction is directly linked to the ability of Ifh1 to bind RP gene promoters. Altogether, we believe that these data strongly support the idea that one part of the pool of Ifh1 is trapped in an insoluble nuclear fraction in absence of Tom1 and prevented from binding to RP gene promoters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an interesting and timely manuscript describing discovery of the so-called Ribosome Assembly Stress Response (RASTR) pathway: When ribosome assembly is blocked, transcription by Hsf1 to activate protein homeostasis genes (encoding chaperones, aggregates, and proteasomal proteins) is upregulated, and ribosomal protein gene transcription is down-regulated. Further experiments explain how this occurs. When ribosome assembly is blocked by aborting rRNA transcription or preventing assembly factor function, excess unassembled ribosomal proteins aggregate. This leads to sequestration of Hsp70, an inhibitor of Hsf1, as well as Ifh, which is necessary for transcription of RP genes.</p><p>The RASTR mediated pathway is rapid and apparently short-lived, activated within 5 minor aborting assembly, but returning to previous levels of expression of r protein proteostasis genes within an hour. It is not yet known whether r proteins, Ifh1, and Hsp70 are present in separate pools of aggregates, or whether or how they traffic into or out of aggregates.</p><p>Because ribosomal proteins are synthesized at such high levels in rapidly growing cells, RASTR represents a significant mechanism to prevent proteostasis when assembly is imbalanced by any means.</p><p>Some data are presented to distinguish RASTR from other stress response pathways, and to distinguish long term responses from the short term RASTR pathway. I found this portion of the Results and Discussion difficult to follow at times. The manuscript could perhaps be made more clear, especially for a general readership, by including a short paragraph early in the Discussion clearly outlining in one place the different pathways. To what exactly might each pathway respond and why? For example, what are general means by which imbalance in synthesis of ribosome components could be created in wild type cells (or by mutation?).</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent questions, and we agree that the original manuscript was overly concise, to the point where even well-informed general readers might have difficulty following the arguments. To improve clarity, we have expanded both the Discussion and Introduction, emphasizing more the identity and role of the CURI complex in balancing rRNA and RP production at extended periods following stress (TORC1 inhibition) and pointing out that RASTR is a mechanistically distinct and faster acting response. We also include speculation regarding the physiological and genetic perturbations that might activate these two different responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What then enables a return to normal synthesis once RASTR is inactivated? Is it diminished pools of aggregates?</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out above, our new data strongly suggest that the return to normal RP and Hsf1 target gene expression is promoted by the diminution of pools of aggregates, of both Ifh1 and RPs. This is now clearly stated in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Then what about the primary triggers for the pathway? It also might be worth repeating here exactly where and how the CURI complex fits in to these effects.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We add speculation in the Discussion to the effect that the long-term regulation through the CURI complex may be driven by the release of its two rRNA processing components, Utp22 and Rrp7 from nascent rDNA, freeing them for interaction with Ifh1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In the submitted manuscript by Albert et al., the authors identify the Ribosomal Assembly Stress Response (RASTR), a novel regulatory pathway that responds to excess numbers of RPs and their aggregation, and allows a simultaneous up-regulation of protein homeostasis genes and down-regulation of RP genes upon disruption of ribosome biogenesis at different stages, providing a mechanism for the cell to counteract RP proteotoxicity.</p><p>Overall, the data presented here is very interesting and experimentally sound. The data is mostly well-presented and the manuscript generally concise; however, a few points should be addressed by the authors.</p><p>- Throughout, the authors focus on the accumulation and fate of large subunit RPs and in Figure 2C and D, only large subunit RPs are shown by western blot. Have the authors looked at small subunit RPs? Given that the stresses shown here affect pre-rRNA transcription and assembly of RPs with pre-rRNA is co-transcriptional, the sRPs should also be affected and involved in the RASTR. The authors should address this point in their Discussion at the very least.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, and we agree that sRPs should be affected by and involved in RASTR. Consistent with this, we detect by mass spectrometry both large and small subunit RPs (43 Rpl and 30 Rps proteins) in the insoluble fraction following topoisomerases depletion (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1B) and we detect accumulation of a small subunit protein, Rps8, in trailing fractions of polysome gradients (new Figure 2C). We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors selected Utp8 and Utp13 to mimic a ribosome assembly stress response as observed with Top1 and Top1/2 deletion; why were these two proteins chosen specifically? This should be explained for an audience less familiar with ribosome biogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We now explain in the revised text why these factors were selected. Please see our reply to comment #4 of the reviewer #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Along these lines, the authors say that disruption of ribosome biogenesis at several levels – pre-rRNA transcription/processing, assembly – will activate RASTR. What about later stages in assembly/processing than the one tested in the 90S complex? Is the response related to early RiBi pathways steps?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important point. In the manuscript we show that diazaborine, an inhibitor acting at the mid-late steps of 60S biogenesis, activates RASTR, suggesting that this pathway is not limited to early steps. Nevertheless, it’s important to note that blocking maturation of late cytoplasmic large subunit precursors results in a rapid depletion of early acting factors in the nucleolus due to trapping of these factors in the accumulating late populations (Zisser et al. [2018] <italic>NAR</italic> 46: 3140). The failure to recycle these proteins results in a rapid feedback at an early maturation step. We speculate that both early and late stages of assembly will rapidly activate RASTR but acknowledge that further work will be required to nail this down.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 2—figure supplement 1D: tae2-Δ cells – the figure/experiment described in the text does not match the panel/legend – please make sure it is the correct data panel or labeled to be made clearer to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this mistake.
