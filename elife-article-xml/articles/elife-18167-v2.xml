unparalleled performance of the human cerebral cortex. Paired recordings and multiple probability fluctuation analysis revealed similar quantal sizes, but 4-times more functional release sites in human pyramidal cell to fast-spiking interneuron connections compared to rats. These connections were mediated on average by three synaptic contacts in both species. Each presynaptic active zone (AZ) contains 6.2 release sites in human, but only 1.6 in rats. Electron microscopy (EM) and EM tomography showed that an AZ harbors 4 docked vesicles in human, but only a single one in rats. Consequently, a Katz’s functional release site occupies ~0.012 μm<sup>2</sup> in the human presynaptic AZ and ~0.025 μm<sup>2</sup> in the rat. Our results reveal a robust difference in the biophysical properties of a well-defined synaptic connection of the cortical microcircuit of human and rodents.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18167.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18167.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>release site</kwd><kwd>EPSC</kwd><kwd>interneuron</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>cerebral cortex</kwd><kwd>quantal analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INTERIMPACT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamás</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>293681</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nusser</surname><given-names>Zoltan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Magyar Tudományos Akadémia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MTA-SZTE Agykergi Neuronhalozatok Kutatocsoport</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamás</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Magyar Tudományos Akadémia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lendület, LP2012-29</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nusser</surname><given-names>Zoltan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Magyar Tudományos Akadémia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Janos Bolyai Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holderith</surname><given-names>Noémi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003827</institution-id><institution>Nemzeti Kutatási és Technológiai Hivatal</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VKSZ_14-1-2015-0155</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamás</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Nemzeti Agykutatasi Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NAP-A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Molnár</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The compactness of synaptic release sites coupled with their four-fold number in humans compared to rats provides unprecedented scaleability in operation of human synapses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human cerebral cortex is considered to be one of the most complex biological structures, endowing us to perform sophisticated cognitive tasks. The layered architecture, cellular elements and synaptic connectivity of the human neocortex have been investigated and compared to those of other mammals such as primates, carnivores, and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Komlosi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mohan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Molnar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Olah et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prince and Wong, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schwartzkroin and Knowles, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Verhoog et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yanez et al., 2005</xref>). Although, there are species-specific differences in the layering, long-range connections and intrinsic electrical and morphological properties of nerve cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mohan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), the cellular elements and local synaptic circuits were found to be rather stereotyped. For example, similar types of cortical GABAergic interneurons (INs), pyramidal cells (PCs) and comparable local synaptic connectivity patterns were reported in rodent and human neocortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Molnar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Olah et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yanez et al., 2005</xref>). However, classic theories suggest that synaptic properties also contribute to cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bliss and Lomo, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buzsaki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hebb, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Singer, 1995</xref>) and recent studies revealed differences in synaptic communication between cell types that are highly conserved among mammals. Human cortical PC to PC connections display spike timing-dependent long-term plasticity similar to that found in rodents, but with altered plasticity-inducing activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Verhoog et al., 2013</xref>). It has also been demonstrated that the outputs of human PCs can be so powerful that individual presynaptic action potentials result in suprathreshold postsynaptic responses in GABAergic neurons and polysynaptic series of events downstream in the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Komlosi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Molnar et al., 2008</xref>). These powerful PC to IN connections are not characteristic to nonhuman tissue and were speculated to be important in reliable propagation of information in the human neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Woodruff and Yuste, 2008</xref>). Here we aimed at determining set out to determine whether underlying biophysical properties and structural features of these connections are different in our species compared to one of the most widely used rodent model organisms, the rat.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantal parameters of pyramidal cell to fast spiking interneuron EPSCs in the human and rat cerebral cortex</title><p>We compared the functional properties of synaptic connections made by PCs onto fast-spiking INs in the layer 2/3 of human (n = 39) and rats (n = 26; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) neocortex.

Both presynaptic PCs and postsynaptic INs were whole-cell recorded with biocytin-containing intracellular solutions, allowing <italic>post hoc</italic> identification of the recorded cell types and the number of synaptic contacts between them. Neurons were chosen based on their typical membrane and firing properties. Postsynaptic INs were identified as either axo-axonic (AACs, human: n = 6) or basket (BCs, human: n = 18; rat: n = 8) cells based on their characteristic axonal cartridges or axonal branches forming perisomatic baskets, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and F</xref>).

Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), recorded from INs in response to single presynaptic action potentials showed a wide range of amplitudes in both species (human: 9.0–1477.1 pA; rat: 7.7–236.3 pA), with a significantly larger mean amplitude in human INs (human: 258.8 ± 272.8 pA; rat: 75.8 ± 58.7 pA; p&lt;0.001, MW U-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and G</xref>).

To assess the number of putative synaptic contacts, team members without access to the <italic>N<sub>frs</sub> </italic>searched for close appositions of presynaptic axon terminals and postsynaptic dendrites under light microscopy (LM). The presynaptic axon from the parent PC soma to the target IN dendrites were reconstructed in nine human (n = 2 PC to AAC and n = 7 PC to BC pairs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and fifteen rat (n = 15 PC to BC pairs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) pairs that partially overlapped with MPFA analyzed cell pairs. Comparison of the number of LM detected synaptic contacts (<italic>N<sub>lm</sub></italic>) between human (3.3 ± 1.5; range: 1–6) and rat (2.9 ± 1.5, range: 1–6) revealed no significant difference (p = 0.35, MW U-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Consequently, dividing the mean <italic>N<sub>frs</sub> </italic>with the mean <italic>N<sub>lm</sub> </italic>indicated that each presynaptic bouton contains on average 6.2 and 1.6 functional release sites in human and rat, respectively. This ratio was also larger for human connections when calculated from those pairs for which both MPFA and LM reconstructions could be performed (human: <italic>N<sub>frs</sub>/N<sub>lm </sub></italic>= 5.7 ± 5.1, range 1.6–13.3, n = 4; rat: <italic>N<sub>frs</sub>/N<sub>lm </sub></italic>= 2.6, n = 1). These results demonstrate that differences in the number of synaptic junctions between PCs and fast-spiking INs is not responsible for the observed 4.4-fold larger <italic>N<sub>frs</sub></italic>, therefore each presynaptic PC axon terminal must contain a larger <italic>N<sub>frs</sub> </italic>in human.</p><p>Finally we assessed potential ultrastructural correlates of the above described differences in the <italic>N<sub>frs</sub> </italic>in individual axon terminals. We performed three-dimensional reconstructions of presynaptic axon terminals from 20 nm thick serial EM sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Biocytin-filled, <italic>post hoc</italic> recovered human (n = 3) and rat (n = 3) INs were chosen and axon terminals that established asymmetrical synaptic contacts on selected dendrites (see Supplementary Materials and methods) were fully reconstructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C,H,J</xref>). First we compared the size of presynaptic AZs and found that both human and rat active zones (AZs) have variable sizes (human: 0.02–0.26 μm<sup>2</sup>; rat: 0.02–0.08 μm<sup>2</sup>), but the human AZs were on average twice as large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>). Each bouton contained only a single AZ in both species. When we counted docked vesicles in these AZs using the 20 nm thin serial section approach we found a significantly larger number in human (4.2 ± 2.2 / AZ) compared to rats (1.3 ± 0.8 / AZ; p&lt;0.001, MW U-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q</xref>), resulting in a twice as large docked vesicle density in human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3R</xref>). However, as the precise identification of docked vesicles is challenging in conventional EM even if very thin (20 nm) sections are used, we repeated these measurements using EM tomography; the best currently known method for this application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Imig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Siksou et al., 2007</xref>). Analysis of EM tomograms in 3 human (n = 33 synapses) and 3 rat (n = 31 synapses) samples revealed a similar two-fold difference in the mean docked vesicle density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3R</xref>). These results confirmed that reconstructions from very thin serial EM sections also provide a reliable measure of the number of docked vesicles. The large variability in the AZ area and number of docked vesicle prompted us to investigate their relationship and found a positive correlation between these parameters in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3S</xref>; human: ρ = 0.71; rat: ρ= 0.54, Spearman correlation). Moreover, the docked vesicle density and the size of the proximal vesicle pool normalized to the AZ area in axon terminals (n = 15 from both species, for definition see Methods) showed no significant correlation both in human (ρ = 0.15, P = 0.59, Spearman correlation), and rat samples (ρ = −0.09, p = 0.76; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we found significantly larger bouton volumes in humans (0.14 ± 0.09 µm<sup>3</sup>, n = 20) compared to rats (0.05 ± 0.02 µm<sup>3</sup>, n = 17; p&lt;0.01, MW U-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18167.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Active zones (AZs) of excitatory synapses are twice as large and harbor 4 times more docked vesicles in human compared to rats.</title><p>(<bold>A, H</bold>) Electron microscopic images of 20 nm thick sections show axon terminals forming asymmetrical synapses on a human (<bold>A</bold>) and a rat (<bold>H</bold>) FS cell dendrite (intracellularly filled interneuron visualized with peroxidase: dark precipitate).

High resolution EM analysis identified corresponding species-specific differences in the AZ area and the number of docked vesicles. Our data allowed us to provide the first estimate of the size of Katz’s functional release site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">del Castillo and Katz, 1954</xref>) of cortical synapses; approximately 0.012 μm<sup>2</sup> AZ membrane area in human and 0.025 μm<sup>2</sup> in rats. Thus, the space that harbors a functional release site or a docking site seems to be substantially smaller in human AZs. This raises an interesting question: why the molecular machinery necessary for the assembly of a functional release site needs less space in human? Answering this question requires quantitative proteomic analysis of these AZs at nanometer resolutions. Furthermore, it will be also interesting to see whether this species-specific difference is valid for all central synapses or it is a unique feature of the cortical microcircuit.</p><p>Our data demonstrating that an AZ in rat PC axons contains on average a single functional release site is consistent with the ‘one site-one vesicle’ hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Korn et al., 1982</xref>) and with data previously published for rodent cortical and hippocampal excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Biro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gulyas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Silver et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, the same type of axon terminals in human contain on average 6 functional release sites, demonstrating that here multivesicular release (MVR; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rudolph et al., 2015</xref>) is the main mode of operation. However, it is important to note that our data clearly demonstrate large variability in the AZ area in both species and that the number of docked vesicles and docking sites correlates with the AZ area. Thus, MVR is not a human-specific feature of cortical synapses, but it is expected to occur at large AZs of this connection in rats, as it has been shown to take place in many other rat glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rudolph et al., 2015</xref>). Comparison of the <italic>N<sub>frs </sub></italic>and the number of docked vesicles allowed the calculation of the average docking site occupancy that is 0.8 in rats and ~0.7 in human synapses, similar to that calculated for the Calyx of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Neher, 2010</xref>), and somewhat higher than that found in cerebellar IN synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pulido et al., 2015</xref>).

Even if upscaling of release components simply follows larger neurons and synapses in the human microcircuit, it is important to note that scalability of multivesicular release in human synapses as opposed to all-or-none single vesicular rat synapses provides additional functional variability, which might subserve evolutionary optimization. The strong connections linking pyramidal cells and a select group of postsynaptic neurons in the same area of the neocortex could be strategically positioned for the emergence and maintenance of key cortical hubs characteristic of the human cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Haggmann et al. 2008</xref>). Long-range connections of PCs with strong local connections might also target distant INs with similarly powerful unitary EPSPs speculatively providing structural and functional basis for the formation of small world networks suggested to be important in linking connections to cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Park and Friston, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>All procedures were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki with the approval of the University of Szeged Ethical Committee.

Anesthesia was induced with intravenous midazolam and fentanyl (0.03 mg/kg, 1–2 µg/kg, respectively). A bolus dose of propofol (1–2 mg/kg) was administered intravenously. To facilitate endotracheal intubation, the patient received 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium. After 120 s, the trachea was intubated and the patient was ventilated with a mixture of O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O at a ratio of 1:2. Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoﬂurane at monitored anaesthesia care (MAC) volume of 1.2–1.5.

Slices were cut perpendicular to cortical layers at a thickness of 350 μm with a vibrating blade microtome (Microm HM 650 V) and were incubated at room temperature for 1 hr in the same solution.

We found no significant differences in EPSC charge values between the two rodent groups (81.6 ± 59.3 vs. 72.7 ± 60.0, p = 0.91, MW U-test). We calculated the relative age of rats involved in the study referenced to human age taking into account that 3.3 rat days equals one human year around sexual maturity (P38 in rats and 12 years in human, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sengupta, 2013</xref>). Thus, the age range of rats used in our experiments corresponds to approximately 6–20 years in humans. Recordings were performed at 36°C. Cells were visualized through water-immersion 40× objective using infrared differential interference contrast videomicroscopy at depths 60–130 μm from the surface of the slice. Micropipettes (3.5–5 MΩ) were filled with two types of low [Cl]<sub>i</sub> intracellular solution for whole-cell patch-clamp recording: (in mM): 126 K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP-Na<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 phosphocreatine, and 8 biocytin (pH 7.20; 300 mOsm), of the postsynaptic INs and 116 K-gluconate, 10 L-glutamic acid, 4 KCl, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP-Na<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 phosphocreatine, and 8 biocytin (pH 7.20; 300 mOsm) for presynaptic PCs. Membrane currents were recorded with a dual-channel amplifier an EPC 10 quadro amplifier (HEKA) filtered at 7 or 8 kHz (Bessel filter), digitized at 50–100 kHz, and analyzed with PULSE software. Series resistance (Rs) and whole-cell capacitance was checked continuously in the postsynaptic IN. The mean Rs for the first analyzed epochs during the recordings was 19.7 ± 6.9 MΩ and after 66–73% compensation it was 6.0 ± 2.2 MΩ.

PCs were stimulated with brief (3–15 ms) current pulses (+ 850 pA) delivered at 5 s intervals, the postsynaptic membrane potential was held at −70 mV. The stability of peak amplitudes or charge values in time throughout an epoch (73 and 78 events on average in each epoch in human and rat, respectively) was determined by running average and by checking fulfillment of slope &lt;0.05 relation of the fitted a regression line to the scatter plot of EPSC charge vs. time. Elapsed time from tissue removal until the start of MPFA experiments was 9.8 ± 4.1 and 5.3 ± 1.8 hr in the human and rat, respectively. In order to exclude unwanted decrease of EPSC amplitudes during long recordings, we performed control experiments on pyramidal cell to basket cell pairs (n = 5). During these experiments we used the same configuration to assess possible rundown effects. We made at least 50 min-long recordings (up to 90 min) with inter-event intervals of 5 s.

The areas of active zones were measured at perpendicularly cut synapses, where the rigid apposition of the pre- and postsynaptic membranes was clearly visible, and the docked vesicles were identified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Holderith et al., 2012</xref>). Active zones were identified by the parallel rigid membrane appositions where the synaptic cleft widened (because the PSD is masked by the dark DAB precipitate). Potential inhibitory synapses with flattened vesicles were discarded from the analysis. Bouton volumes of a subpopulation of boutons were measured from 20 nm serial reconstructions where the series contained the whole terminal (n = 9 human boutons, n = 8 rat boutons). We calculated the volume of the same subset of boutons from the area of the largest cross-section (assuming that boutons are spherical) and found a tight correlation (ρ = 0.9019, Spearman correlation) with the measured volume. Based on this correlation, we calculated the volume from the largest cross-section of those terminals where the AZ was measured, but the series did not contain the whole terminal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>EM tomography</title><p>200 nm thick sections were cut and collected onto copper slot grids. Fiducial markers (Protein-A conjugated to 10 nm gold particles, Cytodiagnostics - Absource Diagnostics GmbH, Munich, Germany) for tomographic reconstruction were introduced at both sides of the grids as described by Imig et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Imig et al., 2014</xref>). Single-axis tilt series of perpendicularly oriented synapses were acquired in FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTWIN transmission EM operating at 120 kV and equipped with an Eagle 4K HS digital camera (FEI Europe Nanoport, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Tilt series were recorded between ± 65° (with 2° increments between ± 45° and with 1° increments between 45–65°) at a magnification of 30,000 using FEI Xplore3D for automated tilt series acquisition. Tomographic volumes were reconstructed using the IMOD package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Imig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>) and exported as z-stacks for analysis. Active zone area and vesicle distance from the presynaptic membrane were measured with Reconstruct software. A vesicle was considered to be docked if the outer part of the lipid bilayer was in direct contact with the inner part of the presynaptic membrane bilayer. A vesicle was considered to be pre-docked if the distance between these lipid bilayers did not exceed 5 nm, and the membrane proximal vesicles are defined as the docked and pre-docked vesicles. For vesicle pool measurements, synaptic vesicles within 100 nm of the AZ were quantified from tomographic subvolumes and normalized to the AZ area according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Imig et al.,(2014)</xref> in human and rat samples (n = 15 each).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>GT is supported by the ERC INTERIMPACT project, the Hungarian Brain Research Program and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Functional differences between human and rat neocortical excitatory synapses&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder as the Senior editor and two reviewers: Marlene Bartos (Reviewer #1), who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and Imre Vida (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Molnar et al. addresses functional and ultrastructural differences between excitatory synapses in the rat and the human neocortex focusing on a well-defined connection between pyramidal cells and fast-spiking perisomatic inhibitory basket or axo-axonic cells by applying in vitro paired recordings combined with light and electron microscopic analysis. The main finding of the study is that at human synapses EPSCs have larger mean amplitudes mediated by a higher number of release sites in comparison to those in the rat. This functional difference correlates well with the divergent number of docked vesicles at presynaptic active zones in the two species. The work was judged by both reviewers as excellent. The results are of high quality, well-presented and the conclusions are supported by the data. The results provide important insights into how synapses operate in the human cortex and what differences may underlie the superior performance of human circuits despite the general similarities in terms of anatomical and physiological properties of neocortical synapses, cells and networks across various mammalian species.</p><p>The criticism formulated by the reviewers addresses very specific aspects of the manuscript and are therefore listed below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Did the authors observe any differences in the dynamic properties (short term or long term dynamics) of excitatory signals during paired recordings when trains of presynaptic spikes were evoked? Since synaptic plasticity has been identified at glutamatergic synapses targeting basket cells in the rodent cortex, it would be of high interest to see whether this form of plasticity also exist at principal cell to basket cell synapses in human tissue. If the data are available then they should be added to the study.</p><p>2) The reviewer was wondering how the age range in humans in this study (16-75 y) may be compared to the age range of rats (P18-65). Please provide available age relationships in the Methods section.</p><p>3) It would be interesting to the readership to include additional quantitative morphological data such as axonal and dendritic length from human basket and axo-axonic cells. The reconstructions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates that these data should be available. If so, please include them to the Results section.</p><p>4) Please move the extensive data set from Figure legend 1I to the Results section.</p><p>5) The authors should provide some explanations in the Introduction on why they have chosen specifically this synapse to address their questions.</p><p>6) Please answer the following questions and include the answers to the manuscript: From which layer were the recordings made? Why have been recordings performed in the presence of NMDA and a cannabinoid receptor antagonist? How is the number of docked vesicles related to the size of the vesicle pool per axon terminal? How do the size of the axon terminals (diameter and/or volume) differ in the human vs. rat brain? Provide information about the distribution of the axon terminal size.</p><p>7) The Methods section requires criteria for the identification of the active zone. Also, the identification of asymmetrical vs. symmetrical synapses on biocytin stained non-spiny/sparsely spiny dendrites is not trivial – please provide the criteria used.</p><p>8) One reviewer suggested to extend the Discussion by addressing the question whether the observed differences may be the result of &quot;evolutionary optimization&quot; to achieve a more intelligent brain or simply a byproduct of nonhomogeneous scaling of the nervous system (i.e. larger brain, larger neurons and synapses but unchanged release components will inevitably lead to increased number of structural release elements). Although this is beyond the scope of the current study, it would be interesting to address this in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18167.008</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The criticism formulated by the reviewers addresses very specific aspects of the manuscript and are therefore listed below:</italic> </p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Did the authors observe any differences in the dynamic properties (short term or long term dynamics) of excitatory signals during paired recordings when trains of presynaptic spikes were evoked?

Please provide available age relationships in the Methods section.</italic> </p><p>We calculated the relative age of rats involved in the study referenced to human age taking into account that 3.3 rat days equals one human year around sexual maturity (P38 in rats and 12 years in human, Sengupta, 2013). Thus, the age range of rats used in our experiments corresponds to approximately 6-20 years in humans. We added this sentence to the Methods section.</p><p>Sengupta, P., 2013.

The reconstructions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates that these data should be available. If so, please include them to the Results section.</italic> </p><p>Indeed we have a number of reconstructions representing the full extent of dendrites (basket cells, n = 9, 2912 ± 1076 µm; axo-axonic cells, n = 5, 2897 ± 1546 µm) and axons (basket cells, n = 7, 27489 ± 14080 µm; axo-axonic cells, n = 5, 20732 ± 3332 µm) of human neurons. Now, we have included the new data to the Results section as requested. Dendritic and axonal lengths were not significantly different between basket and axo-axonic cells (P=1 and P=0.41 respectively, Mann-Whitney U test).</p><p><italic>4) Please move the extensive data set from Figure legend 1I to the Results section.</italic> </p><p>Done.</p><p><italic>5) The authors should provide some explanations in the Introduction on why they have chosen specifically this synapse to address their questions.</italic> </p><p>We have changed the Introduction as requested.</p><p><italic>6) Please answer the following questions and include the answers to the manuscript: From which layer were the recordings made? Why have been recordings performed in the presence of NMDA and a cannabinoid receptor antagonist? How is the number of docked vesicles related to the size of the vesicle pool per axon terminal? How do the size of the axon terminals (diameter and/or volume) differ in the human vs. rat brain? Provide information about the distribution of the axon terminal size.</italic> </p><p>Recordings were made from layer 2/3, we modified the first sentence of the Results section.</p><p>Recordings were performed in the presence of an NMDA and a cannabinoid receptor antagonist (20 μM D-AP-5 and 10 μM AM251, respectively) to exclude NMDA channel openings which might reduce variances and induce long-term plasticity (Silver, 2003; Saviane and Silver, 2007) and to exclude undesirable retrograde modification of glutamatergic transmission (Lee et al. 2010, Péterfi et al. 2012) during MPFA. We changed the Results accordingly.</p><p>We extended our analysis to reveal potential relationships between the docked vesicle density and the size of the proximal vesicle pool normalized to the AZ area in axon terminals in our human and rat samples (n = 15 axon terminals from each species) and found no correlation (human: Spearman’s ρ = 0.15, P = 0.59; rat: Spearman’s ρ = -0.09, P=0.76) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>By measuring bouton areas we calculated the volume of axon terminals (see revised Methods) and found significantly higher volumes in human (0.14 ± 0.09 µm<sup>3</sup>, n=20) compared to the rat samples (0.05 ± 0.02 µm<sup>3</sup>, n=17). The distribution of axon terminal size is presented on the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>)</p><p><italic>7) The Methods section requires criteria for the identification of the active zone. Also, the identification of asymmetrical vs. symmetrical synapses on biocytin stained non-spiny/sparsely spiny dendrites is not trivial – please provide the criteria used.</italic> </p><p>Active zones were identified by the parallel rigid membrane appositions where the synaptic cleft widened (as PSD is not visible in the dark precipitate of the DAB). Potential inhibitory synapses with flattened vesicles were discarded from the analysis. We changed the Materials and methods section accordingly.</p><p><italic>8) One reviewer suggested to extend the Discussion by addressing the question whether the observed differences may be the result of &quot;evolutionary optimization&quot; to achieve a more intelligent brain or simply a byproduct of nonhomogeneous scaling of the nervous system (i.e. larger brain, larger neurons and synapses but unchanged release components will inevitably lead to increased number of structural release elements). Although this is beyond the scope of the current study, it would be interesting to address this in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We believe (without causal evidence presented in the manuscript) that a multitude of postsynaptic responses and potential network effects generated by multivesicular release could lead to advantages in an evolutionary process. We modified the last paragraph of the Discussion accordingly:</p><p>“Our results provide an in depth understanding of the mechanisms underlying the powerful, unitary EPSP-evoked suprathreshold series of events in the human neocortex (Molnar et al., 2008), which might be an essential cellular component underlying the generation of Hebbian-like cell assemblies. […] Long-range connections of PCs with strong local connections might also target distant INs with similarly powerful unitary EPSPs speculatively providing structural and functional basis for the formation of small world networks suggested to be important in linking connections to cognition (Park and Friston, 2013).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
