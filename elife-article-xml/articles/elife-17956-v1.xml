In <italic>Primula</italic> (primroses), heterostyly is controlled by the <italic>S</italic>-locus supergene that determines the reciprocal arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between the two morphs. However, the identities of the component genes remain unknown. Here, we identify the <italic>Primula CYP734A50</italic> gene, encoding a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme, as the <italic>G</italic> locus that determines the style-length dimorphism. <italic>CYP734A50</italic> is only present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype, it is specifically expressed in S-morph styles, and its loss or inactivation leads to long styles. The gene arose by a duplication specific to the Primulaceae lineage and shows an accelerated rate of molecular evolution. Thus, our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the <italic>Primula</italic> style-length dimorphism and begin to shed light on the evolution of the <italic>S</italic>-locus as a prime model for a complex plant supergene.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17956.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17956.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17956.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Flowers are highly specialized structures that many plants use to reproduce. Male organs called stamens on the flowers make pollen that can be transferred – usually by insect carriers or the wind – to a female structure called the stigma on another plant. However, since many flowers contain both male and female organs, it is also possible for the pollen to land on the stigma of the same flower, leading to a process called “self-fertilization”.</p><p>Many plants have developed mechanisms that prevent self-fertilization. For example, primroses produce two different types of flowers that arrange their stamens and stigmas differently. The stigma sits on the top of a stalk known as the style. Some primroses produce flowers with short stamens and a long style, resulting in the stigma being located high up in the flower (“pin” flowers), while others produce flowers with a short style and long stamens (“thrum” flowers). Primrose pollen is carried by insects and the different lengths of the styles and stamens make it more likely that pollen from a pin flower will land on the stigma of a thrum flower instead of a pin flower (and vice versa).</p><p>Although primrose flowers have fascinated botanists for centuries, the genes responsible for making the two types of flower had not been identified. Genetic studies indicated that different genes control the length of the stamens and style. However, these genes appear to be very close to each other on primrose DNA, which made it difficult to study them individually.</p><p>Huu et al. identified a gene called <italic>CYP734A50</italic> that is responsible for the difference in style length in the flowers of a primrose called <italic>Primula veris</italic>. The gene is only present in the plants that have thrum flowers across a wide range of primrose species and genetic mutations that inactivate the gene in these plants result in flowers with longer styles. <italic>CYP734A50</italic> encodes an enzyme that breaks down plant hormones called brassinosteroids, which normally promote growth. Treating thrum flowers with brassinosteroids increased the length of the styles. Future challenges are to identify the other genes that are responsible for producing pin and thrum flowers and to understand how this group of genes evolved.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17956.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17956.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>heterostyly</kwd><kwd>Primula</kwd><kwd>brassinosteroids</kwd><kwd>supergene</kwd><kwd>S-locus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3100-061674.00/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conti</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Claraz Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conti</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CYP734A50 is a heterostyly gene from primroses that underlies the differences in style length between the two forms by degrading growth-promoting hormones in the short styles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heterostyly is a prominent, wide-spread adaptation to promote outbreeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrett, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">1992</xref>).

The S-morph haplotype carries dominant alleles at all loci, resulting in short styles due to reduced cell elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Webster and Gilmartin, 2006</xref>) and anthers at the mouth of the flower; the L-morph haplotype carries the recessive alleles, causing long styles and low anthers. S-morphs are heterozygous for the two haplotypes, and L-morphs homozygous recessive; the absence of homozygotes for the S-morph haplotype likely results from a recessive lethal mutation on this haplotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kurian and Richards, 1997</xref>).

Thus, the same causal genes should co-segregate with morph phenotypes in all heterostylous <italic>Primula</italic> species. To test this for <italic>CYP734A50</italic>, we sequenced style transcriptomes of the distantly related <italic>P. forbesii</italic> S- and L-morphs (divergence time <italic>P. veris</italic> – <italic>P. forbesii</italic> ~20–25 Mya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Vos et al., 2014</xref>]). Again, the <italic>P. forbesii CYP734A50</italic> homologue was exclusively expressed in styles of S-, but not L-morphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Each of its five exons was PCR-amplified from 10 <italic>P. forbesii</italic> S-morphs, but none of 10 L-morphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Genome sequencing of pooled S- versus L-morphs detected no <italic>CYP734A50</italic>-specific reads in L-morphs, and read coverage in S-morphs was only half that of a closely related gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Thus, the presence/absence polymorphism of <italic>CYP734A50</italic> has been maintained as a trans-specific polymorphism in strict linkage with the <italic>G</italic> locus over more than 20 million years of evolution, indicating that it is under strong balancing selection, as predicted for a causal heterostyly locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mast and Conti, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The hypothesis that <italic>CYP734A50</italic> represents the <italic>G</italic> locus and limits cell expansion by degrading brassinosteroids makes three testable predictions. First, loss of <italic>CYP734A50</italic> activity should lengthen styles; second, S-morph styles should contain lower amounts of active brassinosteroids than L-morph styles; third, cell expansion of S-morph styles should be rescued by brassinosteroid treatment.</p><p>We assayed the <italic>CYP734A50</italic> genotype in seven derived long homostyles with independent evolutionary origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mast et al., 2006</xref>). Classic models predict that long homostyles originate via recombination in the <italic>S</italic> locus affecting both the <italic>G</italic> and the linked female-compatibility locus, hence they are self-compatible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewis and Jones, 1992</xref>); by contrast, in self-incompatible long homostyles only the <italic>G</italic> locus should be affected by mutation or recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, in <italic>Primula</italic> sect. <italic>Aleuritia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mast et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richards, 2003</xref>), <italic>CYP734A50</italic> was present in all tested S-, but none of the L-morphs of the heterostylous <italic>P. frondosa (n </italic>= 5 each) and <italic>P. farinosa (n </italic>= 5 each), and in none of the long-homostylous <italic>P. scotica (n </italic>= 8) and <italic>P. halleri (n </italic>= 9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Similarly in <italic>Primula</italic> sect. <italic>Primula, CYP734A50</italic> was present in all S-, but none of the L-morphs of the heterostylous <italic>P. elatior (n </italic>= 15 each) and <italic>P. juliae (n </italic>= 2 each), nor in the homostylous <italic>P. grandis (n </italic>= 11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Our <italic>P. forbesii</italic> population included self-compatible long homostyles; as expected, none of these (<italic>n </italic>= 6) contained the <italic>CYP734A50</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Natural <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> populations including long-homostyles occur in two regions in southern England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crosby, 1940</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">1949</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Unexpectedly, the <italic>CYP734A50</italic> locus was present in all tested long homostyles and in the S-morphs, but in none of the L-morphs from both regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, quantitative RT-PCR on RNA from styles of the three morphs indicated strongly reduced <italic>CYP734A50</italic> expression in the long homostyles compared to S-morphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This suggests that a promoter mutation or epigenetic silencing of <italic>CYP734A50</italic> is responsible for the long-style phenotype, providing an alternative route to the formation of self-compatible long homostyles in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We newly identified long-homostylous, yet apparently self-incompatible mutants from commercially grown <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> and <italic>P. x pruhoniciana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Exon 4 of <italic>CYP734A50</italic> was deleted in both, and no full-length transcript could be detected in the <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Lastly, we used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to downregulate <italic>CYP734A50</italic> expression in <italic>P. forbesii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). Two treated S-morph individuals showed reduced <italic>CYP734A50</italic> expression and formed longer styles than mock-treated or virus-treated S-morphs with unaffected <italic>CYP734A50</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). When the <italic>P. veris</italic> gene was overexpressed in tobacco, leaf and stem growth were not reduced as seen for other <italic>CYP734A</italic> family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohnishi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thornton et al., 2011</xref>), likely reflecting the considerable sequence divergence of the <italic>P. veris</italic> CYP734A50 protein (see below); this mirrors the failure of certain mouse <italic>SRY</italic> alleles to induce correct male development in a different genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the <italic>CYP734A50</italic> presence/absence polymorphism strictly cosegregates with the morph type in all heterostylous species sampled across the <italic>Primula</italic> phylogeny, and the gene is absent or inactivated in all seven cases of derived long homostyly. Together with the VIGS results, this strongly supports the conclusion that <italic>CYP734A50</italic> is the <italic>G</italic> locus of the <italic>Primula</italic> heterostyly supergene that determines the style-length polymorphism.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17956.016</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Endogenous brassinosteroid content in styles and response to exogenous brassinosteroid treatment in <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Castasterone levels in styles of <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>.

While castasterone was present in L-morph styles, it was virtually undetectable in S-morph styles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>); brassinolide was undetectable in styles of either morph. When treating developing <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> and <italic>P. forbesii</italic> flowers with brassinolide, treated S-morphs developed significantly longer styles in a concentration-dependent manner; by contrast, styles of L-morph plants did not show a consistent response, as did corolla-tubes in either morph, indicating that exogenous brassinolide treatment specifically enhances growth of S-morph styles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This effect was entirely due to increased cell elongation after brassinolide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>P. veris</italic> and <italic>P. forbesii</italic> genome and transcriptome sequences identified a closely related <italic>CYP734A50</italic> paralogue, <italic>CYP734A51</italic>, in both morphs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). A molecular phylogeny of angiosperm CYP734A proteins found in sequenced genomes indicated that <italic>CYP734A50</italic> arose via a gene duplication specific to the <italic>Primula</italic> lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Like the male sex-determining gene <italic>SRY</italic> in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O'Neill and O'Neill, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tucker and Lundrigan, 1995</xref>), a causal heterostyly gene present on only one of the two homologous chromosomes in a non-recombining region should be subject to two opposing effects. The effective population size for such a gene is approximately one fourth that of unlinked diploid genes, resulting in reduced efficacy of selection and stronger drift, including the accumulation of repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Uyenoyama, 2005</xref>); at the same time, purifying selection should maintain the function of the gene. Indeed, the four introns of <italic>P. veris CYP734A50</italic> were exceptionally long and contained multiple transposon-derived repetitive sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Comparing <italic>P. veris</italic> and <italic>P. forbesii CYP734A50</italic> gave a Ka/Ks ratio of 0.56, considerably higher than that of <italic>CYP734A51</italic> at 0.31.

Evolutionarily, <italic>CYP734A50</italic> arose via a lineage-specific gene duplication and presumably gain of style-specific expression. Two main models have been proposed to explain the evolutionary origin of distyly.

Style length and anther height were measured using ImageJ. 6–8 styles were dissected for total RNA extraction and the expression analysis was performed as described above with primers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes; rather, the maximum number of available plants was used. The number of replicates performed is indicated in the respective figure legends. No data points were excluded. Trait values in the BL treatment and VIGS experiment departed from normality in some groups, based on a Shapiro-Wilk-test; also, variance were unequal between some of the groups. Student's <italic>t</italic>-test is robust to deviations from normality when sample sizes are large (n &gt; 25) and comparable between the groups, both of which is the case here, and when using a two-sided test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sawilowsky and Blair, 1992</xref>); also a correction for unequal variances is available. We therefore compared style lengths and anther heights of BL-treated to mock-treated groups using a two-sided t-test assuming unequal variances. Similarly, we compared style lengths and anther heights of VIGS-treated S-morph plants with mock-treated S-morph plants, and untreated S-morph plants with mock-treated S-morph plants using a two-sided t-test assuming unequal variances. The Bonferroni method was used to correct for multiple testing.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the staff of the Botanical Garden of the University of Potsdam for plant care and Jurriaan de Vos, Rita Ganz and Annette Becker for material.

Inherently, this is a difficult task because of the lack of recombination events within a supergene locus, but here the authors do a superb job in working around this. Basically, they were looking for presence-absence signs of gene expression in tissue-specific RNAseq experiments.

This phenomenon, termed distyly, has only evolved once in this genus, although it has also evolved independently in other taxa. The authors used differential expression to identify a candidate gene, <italic>CYP734A50</italic>, that is only expressed in S-morphs. This cytochrome P450 is involved in degrading brassinosteroids, a class of hormones often associated with cell elongation. The authors further demonstrate that 1) style-specific expression of the gene is associated with the S-morph phenotype of multiple <italic>Primula</italic> species, 2) the presence/absence of the locus specifically segregrates with the S-morph phenotype in multiple species, 3) suppression of activity lengthens styles, 4) presence of activity results in lower brassinosteroid concentrations, 5) application of excess brassinosteroids can rescue the short style phenotype, and 6) presence/absence of the locus correlates with cell length. The data are clearly presented and discussed. I think that this is a really lovely paper that addresses a classic question in plant genetics and pollination biology. I have no suggestions for major revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript reveals the identity of the gene responsible for the expression of short styles in distylous species of the primrose family. The gene, <italic>CYP734A50</italic>, degrades brassinosteroids, which promote cell elongation. Absence of this gene leads to short short-styled individuals; indeed, the gene was found only in short-styled individuals of several species of the genus <italic>Primula</italic>, and estimates of transcript read coverage were consistent with the gene being hemizygous in short-styled individuals. Also consistent with the inference that <italic>CYP734A50</italic> is indeed the gene responsible for style length in <italic>Primula</italic> is the fact that it was absent not only in typical long-styled individuals, but also in long homostyled individuals of <italic>P. forbesii</italic> or <italic>P. grandis</italic> (though interestingly not in those of <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>, suggesting that homostyly in the latter may have evolved via a different route). Virus-induced gene silencing of <italic>CYP734A50</italic> showed reduced expression of the gene in short-styled plants, and the development of longer styles. Moreover, the brassinosteroid castasterone, which is degraded by <italic>CYP734A50</italic>, was present in L-morph but not S-morph styles. I am not qualified to comment on many of the methodological details behind these aspects of the study, but the case made by the authors seems convincing on the whole, and I found the study exciting. It is also very well written.</p><p>The authors carry out an analysis of sequence variation at <italic>CYP734A50</italic> and find that its Ka/Ks ratio is twice as high as that found for its paralog <italic>CYP734A51</italic>. I would like to see the P-value for this analysis given in the text itself. The authors infer from this difference that there has been reduced purifying selection on <italic>CYP734A50</italic>, consistent with an hypothesis of its likely reduced effective population size. But how can they rule out the alternative hypothesis that the greater number of non-synonymous substitutions have in fact been driven by selection, e.g., in establishing the novel function of this gene in stylar tissue of the S-morph? It would be interesting to know when the substitutions actually occurred? Are they common to all species of <italic>Primula</italic>, i.e., did they occur at the base of the tree, or have different non-synonymous substitutions accumulated in different lineages during diversification of the genus? The latter possibility would perhaps be consistent with the authors' hypothesis of relaxed purifying selection, whereas the former would be more consistent with their fixation by selection. This would be well worth considering with more analytic rigour.</p><p>The main results of this paper are, I think, very exciting and represent an important advance. However, I feel the authors do not do their paper justice in their discussion of its evolutionary implications. It is commonly thought that distyly almost always evolves through the selection of a dominant mutation that suppresses stylar growth in the S-morph, and that, subsequently, anther lengths of the two morphs are adjusted, i.e., that the starting point is a population with approach herkogamy, and that the first step towards distyly is the spread of a dominant mutation that reduces style length.

Inherently, this is a difficult task because of the lack of recombination events within a supergene locus, but here the authors do a superb job in working around this.

Note that to do so, we could not use the Jukes-Cantor correction, as we had done for the previous version of the manuscript, which explains the slightly different Ka/Ks values given in the text compared to the previous version. Fisher’s exact test was used to test whether there was a difference in the number of non-synonymous substitutions or of synonymous substitutions between the <italic>CYP734A50</italic> and the <italic>CYP734A51</italic> paralogues. This indicated a significantly higher rate of non-synonymous substitutions in <italic>CYP734A50</italic>, but no difference for the synonymous substitutions. This conclusion was robust to different treatments of missing data (complete versus pair-wise deletion). The results of this calculation are shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><p>To address the issue of relaxed purifying versus positive selection more rigorously, we have performed the branch-site tests developed by Zhang et al. as implemented in PAML. While test 1 can detect signatures of either relaxed or positive selection, but cannot discriminate between them, test 2 specifically asks for positive selection. The branch for <italic>PfoCYP734A50</italic> shows a significant signal in test 1, but not in test 2. These results are highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and the full test results are included as Figure 4—figure supplement 4. There is no evidence for positive selection acting on the <italic>CYP734A50</italic> copies. Therefore, these results indicate to us that the faster rate of protein evolution of the CYP734A50 copies relative to the CYP734A51 paralogues is most likely due to less efficient purifying selection, as predicted by theory.</p><p>However, we agree that we likely lack the sampling depth across the <italic>Primula</italic> phylogeny to fully rule out positive selection.</p><p><italic>The main results of this paper are, I think, very exciting and represent an important advance.
