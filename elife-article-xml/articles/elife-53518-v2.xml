The fruit fly is an ideal model system to research these mechanisms. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> field has extensive genetic tools. Furthermore, the relatively small, yet complex fly brain enables scientists to connect neurons into functional circuits, map neural lineages, and test the role of essentially any gene in neurodevelopment and/or behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Venken et al., 2011</xref>). Neurons are wired into neural networks that are connected through neuropils, neurite bundles with dense neurite arborization and numerous synapses. Neuropil structures in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains have been extensively characterized, showing stereotypy and enabling alignment of multiple brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rein et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ito et al., 2014</xref>). Further, systematic efforts in cataloging neurons based on morphology and genetic drivers will soon yield a complete neuron type list for the fly CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, the fly brain connectome is being constructed at the level of individual synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, both morphology and development of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain are trackable at the single-cell level. It is therefore possible to resolve fly brain development from neural stem cells to the connectome and ultimately engineer the brain.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> central brain develops from approximately 100 pairs of bilaterally symmetric neural stem cells, called neuroblasts (NBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Urbach and Technau, 2003</xref>). Most central brain NBs undergo around 100 cell cycles in two neurogenic periods, first building larval networks and then more complex adult neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref>). A typical neuronal lineage, born from a single NB, consists of serially derived lineage-specific pairs of post-mitotic neurons. Due to differential Notch (N) signaling, the paired neurons, made by transient ganglion mother cells (GMCs), can acquire very distinct morphological, physiological, and molecular phenotypes depending on binary sister fates, referred to as A (N<sup>on</sup>) and B (N<sup>off</sup>) fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Spana and Doe, 1996</xref>). Within a lineage, neurons of the same A or B fate constitute a hemilineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Truman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shepherd et al., 2019</xref>). Temporal patterning allows further neuronal fate diversification within a given hemilineage based on neuronal birth order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miyares and Lee, 2019</xref>). Such lineage-dependent fate specification and diversification underlie the construction of the fly brain connectome.</p><p>It is believed that lineages make up individual functional units in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This was made obvious by marking clonally related neurons produced from individual NBs. NB clones are stereotyped; they have both characteristic cell body positions and distinctive lineage-specific neurite projections. Using MARCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>) to induce NB clones in newly hatched larvae, we identifiedÂ ~100 distinct lineages in the fly central brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ito et al., 2013</xref>). Each NB produces lineage-specific neuronal progeny. Discrete lineage identities arise from the spatially patterned neuroectoderm where NB specification occurs, and involve evolutionarily conserved anteroposterior gap genes and dorsoventral patterning genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lichtneckert and Reichert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Urbach and Technau, 2008</xref>). In early embryos, individual NBs can indeed be identified based on combinatorial expression of various transcription factors (TF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Urbach and Technau, 2003</xref>). Altering the TF code can transform neuronal fate and wiring, suggesting that lineage identity controls aspects of neuronal type and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sen et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, fly and beetle have spatially conserved NBs with different TF profiles, further suggesting that NBs and their derived lineages can readily evolve with changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biffar and Stollewerk, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In order to discern how NBs guide neuronal diversification, we need to appreciate neuronal development at the single-cell level. In other words, we need to map individual neurons back to their developmental origins. Achieving this with stochastic clone induction (i.e. labeling GMC offspring as isolated, single-neuron clones and assigning the neurons to specific lineages based on lineage-characteristic morphology) is possible but laborious and can be extremely challenging for lineages that contain similar neurons. Targeted cell-lineage analysis using lineage-restricted genetic drivers is therefore preferred for mapping specific neuronal lineages of interest with single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awasaki et al., 2014</xref>). To date, only three of the about 100 distinct neuronal lineages have been fully mapped at the single-cell level in adult fly brains: the mushroom body (MB), anterodorsal antennal lobe (ALad1) and lateral antennal lobe (ALl1) lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jefferis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). These mapped lineages consist of 1) MB Kenyon cells (KC), 2) AL projection neurons (PN), and 3) AL/AMMC PNs and AL local interneurons (LN), respectively. All three lineages produce morphologically distinct neuron types in sequential order, indicating a common temporal cell-fating mechanism. However, the progenyâs morphological diversity varies greatly from one lineage to the next. The four identical MB lineages are composed of only three major KC types; moreover, paired KCs from common GMCs show no evidence for binary sister fate determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lee et al., 1999</xref>). By contrast, the two AL NBs produce progeny that rapidly change type (producing upwards of 40 neuron types) and the GMCs generate discrete A/B sister fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). In the ALl1 lineage, differential Notch signaling specifies PNs versus LNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, the paired PN and LN hemilineages show independent temporal-fate changes, as evidenced by windows with unilateral switches in production of distinct PNs or LNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the ALl1 PN hemilineage alternately yields Notch-dispensable AL and Notch-dependent AMMC PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). Together, these phenomena demonstrate a great versatility in lineage-guided neuronal diversification.</p><p>Assembling complex region-specific intricate neural networks for an entire brain requires exquisite cell specificity. In fact, cellular diversityâas characterized by gene expressionâis higher during development than in mature brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2017</xref>), signifying that the underpinnings of the connectome can be understood by studying development. Such developmental diversity is reflected by characteristic neurite projection and elaboration patterns. We therefore aim to elucidate the roles of NB lineage specification, temporal patterning and binary sister-fate decisions upon neuronal morphology. By doing this, we hope to gain insight about how a limited number of NBs can specify such enormous brain complexity. We chose to map a large subset of NB lineages, enough to make generalizations but not so many to confound analysis. To this end, we selected NBs expressing the conserved spatial patterning gene <italic>vnd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Urbach and Technau, 2003</xref>). With single-neuron resolution, we mapped 25 hemilineages derived from 18 <italic>vnd</italic>-expressing NBs. We observed hemilineage-dependent morphological diversity at two levels. First, neurons of the same hemilineage may uniformly innervate a common neuropil or differentially target distinct neuropils. Second, neurons show additional structural diversity in terminal elaboration, which depends on neuropil targets rather than lineage origins. Once you factor in the differences of the neuropil targets, hemilineages which seem grossly distinct actually show comparable temporal patterns in the diversification of neuron morphology. Many hemilineages exhibit recurrent production of analogous neuron types and/or cyclic appearance of characteristic morphological features, implicating dynamic fating mechanisms. Moreover, we discovered non-sister hemilineages that make similar or even identical neuron types with common temporal patterns. These observations suggest involvement of conserved lineage-intrinsic cell-fating mechanisms in the derivation of diverse neuronal lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mapping 18 neuronal lineages concurrently with <italic>vnd-GAL4</italic></title><p>In order to target a large subset of related neuronal lineages, we wanted to exploit a conserved patterning gene. Both anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning of the CNS are remarkably conserved from insects to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lichtneckert and Reichert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Urbach and Technau, 2008</xref>), including the tripartite organization of the brain (the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain correspond to the flyâs protocerebral, deutocerebral, and tritocerebral neuromeres). With the aim of making our findings applicable to all three neuromeres, we searched for a conserved dorsoventral patterning gene with relatively even distribution. Urbach and Technau reported 21 fly brain NBs expressing Ventral nervous system defective (Vnd, homolog of the Nkx2 family of homeobox transcription factors). These include 13 of the 72 protocerebral NBs, 4 of the 21 deutocerebral NBs, and 4 of the 13 tritocerebral NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Urbach and Technau, 2003</xref>). Therefore, we decided to target these Vnd-expressing NB lineages for a detailed, large-scale analysis.</p><p>To analyze Vnd<sup>+</sup> NBs, we created a GAL4 driver under the control of endogenous <italic>vnd</italic> regulatory sequences using gene targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). To immortalize the NB expression of Vnd into the neuronal progeny, we derived a Vnd-specific, lineage-restricted LexA driver using a cascade of site-specific recombinases. This cascade is triggered by <italic>vnd-GAL4</italic>, filtered through <italic>dpnEE</italic> (a pan-NB promoter), and then driven ubiquitously so that each of the NBâs daughter cells express LexA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To isolate/identify individual Vnd lineages, we utilized stochastic clonal induction of a conditional LexA reporter. We detected 18 stereotyped neuronal lineages with cell bodies within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central brain (modeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> based on data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

To unravel the extent to which lineage origins and temporal regulation govern neuronal morphology and target selection, we compared the progeny of each Vnd<sup>+</sup> NB in detail. We identified individual neurons based on morphology and determined the neuronal birth order for each of the 18 <italic>vnd-GAL4</italic> lineages. We simultaneously mapped all Vnd lineages by twin-spot MARCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu et al., 2009</xref>) using the Vnd-specific, lineage-restricted LexA driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We conducted transient clone induction in contiguous 2-hr windows from 18 hr after larval hatching (ALH) to 92 hr ALH and from 22 hr before pupa formation (BPF) to 16 hr after pupa formation (APF). We imaged 5771 brains containing twin-spot clones of the 18 Vnd lineages.</p><p>Twin-spot MARCM utilizes mitotic recombination to independently label the progeny of a cell division in different colors. This can occur in a cycling NB (labeling the progeny of a GMC in one color and the remainder of the lineage in another) or it can occur in a GMC (labeling the two daughter neurons in different colors). However, not every twin-spot MARCM labeling results in two colors. A clone with only one color can be the result of programmed cell death (PCD). Isolated single-cell clones or single-cell-paired NB clones indicate production of only one viable neuron from a GMC, whereas unpaired NB clones indicate PCD of an entire GMC sublineage. We manually annotated individual clones (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâD</xref>) and ascribed 20,916 clones to specific Vnd lineages in the brain. Although the total clone number for a given lineage varied from hundreds to thousands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), these differences likely resulted from differential PCD of the progeny or different lineage length. For instance, the recovered VESa1 and VESa2 clones were almost exclusively induced prior to 80 hr ALH, implicating stage-specific progeny production or viability.</p><p>In fact, only 7 of the 18 Vnd lineages (SMPp&amp;v1, CREa1, CREa2, AOTUv1, AOTUv3, AOTUv4, and LALv1) produce two viable hemilineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Regardless of lineage origin, the paired neurons across sister Vnd hemilineages consistently exhibit distinct morphology and have different neuropil targets, reflecting Notch-dependent binary sister fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâG</xref>; see below). The remaining 11 lineages exist as a lone hemilineage, as evidenced by the recovery of only unpaired single-neuron clones that share lineage-specific primary trajectories and often innervate common neuropils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2HâR</xref>; see below).</p><p>To map progeny diversity, we clustered single-neuron clones based on neuron morphology and timing of clone induction. For each of the 18 Vnd lineages, we identified morphologically distinguishable neuron types and further determined their approximate birth sequence based on the recovery window of each neuron type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Single neurons consistently occupied a much more restricted domain compared to full-size NB clones. Moreover, single-neuron clones exhibited birth order-dependent trajectories. Given these phenomena, we examined the extent of lineage coverage in our single-neuron collection by merging representative single neurons from all annotated morphological types and comparing the merged single cells with full-size NB clones. Aligning samples through a standard 3D fly brain template confirmed that all major trajectories from a NB clone were covered by single-neuron projections, ensuring that we have not missed any major neuron types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1âsource data 2</xref>). Together, our analysis demonstrates that we have systematically mapped the 18 Vnd lineages with single-cell resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A/B hemilineage-characteristic neurite trajectories</title><p>Assigning clonally related neurons to the A (N<sup>on</sup>) or B (N<sup>off</sup>) hemilineage is essential to resolve the impact of binary sister fate decision on neuronal differentiation. Unfortunately, twin-spot MARCM labels paired sister neurons with randomly segregated reporter genes, rather than in a hemilineage-specific manner. Thus, given that Notch underlies hemilineage specification, we genetically manipulated Notch to determine hemilineage identity.</p><p>We reduced Notch with RNAi in isolated NB clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Repressing Notch should promote B fate, resulting in reduction of the A-fate morphology and increase in the B-fate morphology. However, when examining NB clones consisting of two sister hemilineages, we noticed that a severe reduction in one hemilineage may not always be accompanied by an evident enhancement of its sister hemilineage. This could be due to death of ectopic neurons because of an incomplete fate transformation or limited space/resources. Further, the loss of neurons with A-fate morphology was incomplete, likely due to weak RNAi. This was particularly obvious among neurons born shortly after clone induction. Regardless of these shortcomings, we could unequivocally determine the Notch state for the 14 paired hemilineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1BâHâ</xref>). We also made our best possible judgement from available clones on the Notch state of the 11 unpaired hemilineages (data not shown). For consistency, we pseudo-colored neurons derived from A (N<sup>on</sup>) hemilineages in green, and neurons from B (N<sup>off</sup>) hemilineages in magenta when possible (e.g. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). When referring to hemilineages in text, we added âAâ or âBâ as a suffix (for the seven lineages with two viable hemilineages) or in parentheses (for lone hemilineages).</p><p>Knowing hemilineage identity allows us to create hemilineage masks for the seven Vnd lineages producing viable sister-neurons. This was accomplished by clustering single neurons (extracted from twin-spot MARCM clones) based on hemilineage origin. Warping all the individual neurons from the same hemilineage onto a common brain template thus yielded artificial hemilineage clones. Superimposing the hemilineage clones painted in different colors permits close examination of hemilineage distinctions, from cell body distribution, to neurite fasciculation and elaboration (green versus magenta in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the sister hemilineages exist as spatially separate entities in six of the seven paired Vnd lineages. In addition to the SMPp&amp;v1 lineage, in which the hemilineages have noticeably separate cell body locations (see arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), our analysis reveals hemilineage-specific cell body domains as well as discrete A and B bundles of cell body fibers in the CREa1, CREa2, AOTUv1, AOTUv3, and AOTUv4 lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâF,SâW</xref>). Only the LALv1 lineage has an extensively mixed A/B cell body region and an initial common bundle that extends posteriorly before branching into multiple A- and B-specific fascicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and X</xref>).</p><p>Regarding terminal elaboration, we see more focused, shorterÂ range innervation in most A hemilineages as compared to their paired B hemilineages. For instance, the LALv1A hemilineage exclusively innervates the central complex (CX). This contrasts the enormous coverage of the LALv1B hemilineage, which spans from the ventral subesophageal zone (SEZ) to the dorsal superior medial protocerebrum (SMP) and even reaches the optic lobe (OL) as well as crossing the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The correlation of Notch A/B fate with the extent of neurite targeting and innervation applies to other pairs of A/B hemilineages. For instance, the CREa1A and CREa2A hemilineages elaborate in the vicinity of their cell bodies (green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). By contrast, their paired CREa1B and CREa2B hemilineages target distant neuropils (magenta in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).</p><p>Contrasting the sharp distinctions across paired sister hemilineages, certain non-sister hemilineages look very alike and interestingly share identical Notch states. For instance, the CREa1A and CREa2A hemilineages exhibit grossly indistinguishable morphology (see below). The AOTUv4A and LALv1A hemilineages target same neuropils from distinct cell body clusters. In addition, the B hemilineage of AOTUv1 resembles the unpaired WEDd1(B) hemilineage in both cell body location and in the long-distance ventral targeting (magenta in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P and D</xref>).</p><p>Given that hemilineages are distinct, our following analyses of neuron diversity independently considered the 25 hemilineages. Nonetheless, in the seven lineages composed of sister hemilineages, we exploited the paired sister-neurons to compare sister-hemilineage development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Morphological complexity decreases with birth order</title><p>In the process of overlaying single-neuron clones onto full-size NB clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1âsource data 2</xref>), we noticed that the first larval-born neurons show uniquely extensive elaborations in five (20%) hemilineages: CREa1B, ALv1(A), VESa1(A), VESa2(A), and FLAa1(B). These first larval-born neurons consistently project farther than the remaining offspring. We thus see extra distant targets exclusively on the GMC side of twin-spot NB clones induced around quiescence exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For instance, the striking LO and SLP innervation by the first larval-born VESa2(A) neuron (green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) is completely absent from the largest larval-induced VESa2(A) NB clone (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In another seven hemilineages (CREa1A, CREa2A, AOTUv1A, AOTUv4A, SLPpm3(B), FLAa2(A), and WEDd1(B)), multiple early larval-born neurons substantially extend beyond the remainder of the lineage (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>).

Notably, only six (24%) Vnd hemilineages, ALv1(A), CREa2B, FLAa1(B), FLAa3(A), LALv1A, and SMPad1(A), consist of neurons that exclusively belong to a single topological class. If we exclude the uniquely elaborate first-born and austere last-born neurons, we can add three additional hemilineages, AOTUv4A, CREa1B and WEDa1(B), into this list of topologically pure hemilineages. However, there are also six (24%) Vnd hemilineages, AOTUv4B, LALv1B, SMPp&amp;v1A, SMPp&amp;v1B, VESa1(A), and WEDd1(B), composed of three to four topological classes of neurons in addition to the atypical beginning and ending neurons. Taking the SMPp&amp;v1 sister hemilineages as examples, we see P, H and S classes of N<sup>on</sup> progeny but T, H and M classes of N<sup>off</sup> progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Comparing sister hemilineages, the H-class N<sup>on</sup> and N<sup>off</sup> cousin neurons display no morphological resemblance despite belonging to the same topological class (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref> versus 6E). By contrast, within a given hemilineage, neurons of various classes often have strong resemblances. For instance, some H-class and P-class SMPp&amp;v1A neurons have nearly indistinguishable elaborations on the ipsilateral side (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O/P and Q/R</xref>). Common ipsilateral morphology also exists among the T, H and M classes of SMPp&amp;v1B neurons (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6BâD</xref>). Moreover, the S-class neurons look like simplified P-class neurons within the SMPp&amp;v1A hemilineage (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I/M</xref>).

Our nomenclature starts with lineage name followed by topology-class letter and a two-digit number. The lineage name is separated from the topology-class letter with a dash sign. To distinguish sister hemilineages, we add âAâ or âBâ after the lineage name to represent N<sup>on</sup> or N<sup>off</sup>. The two-digit serial number starts from 01 and is assigned by arranging neuron types of the same hemilineage-topology class by first clustering neuron types based on closeness in morphology and then determining cluster sequence as well as intra-cluster neuron sequence to roughly reflect birth order. We typically provide extra information in parentheses at the end, to indicate the key morphological feature (e.g. the most distal neuropil target) or simply the preexisting name if available. For H-class neurons with asymmetric neuropil targets, when their key asymmetric target is enclosed as extra information, we add â/â in front of and italicize the enclosed neuropil name. We may add âiâ or âcâ after the neuropil name to indicate âipsilateralâ or âcontralateralâ. Briefly, we have identified 467 morphological neuron types from 25 Vnd hemilineages in the fly central brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The five most heterogeneous hemilineages are: ALv1(A) (46 types), VLPa2(A) (37 types), LALv1B (31 types), LALv1A (29 types), and CREa1A (26 types). The five least heterogeneous are: FLAa1(B) (five types), FLAa3(A) (seven types), CREa1B (nine types), SLPpm3(B) (11 types), and VESa1(A) (12 types). The remaining 15 hemilineages yield 15 to 24 morphological neuron types. As a caveat, we could have over-estimated neuron types due to structural plasticity or we could have under-estimated neuron types due to lack of landmarks, particularly in neuropils that are not well-characterized.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Hemilineages vary greatly in gross complexity</title><p>A âdiverseâ hemilineage (one with many assigned neuron types) might consist of distinct neurons that uniformly target the same set of neuropils or grossly dissimilar neurons each innervating distinctive sets of neuropils. Given this phenomenon, we further clustered clonally related neuron types into âmorphological groupsâ based on patterns of neuropil targeting. For instance, the paired LALv1A and LALv1B hemilineages yield similar numbers (29 vs. 31) of morphologically distinguishable neuron types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1J</xref>). However, the LALv1A hemilineage produces only one dominant morphological group, whereas LALv1B neurons can be clustered into six different morphological groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Uniform CX neurons pair with diverse groups of non-CX neurons in LALv1.</title><p>(<bold>AâRâ</bold>) Representative pairs of LALv1A (N<sup>on</sup> green) and LALv1B (N<sup>off</sup> magenta) neuron types arranged in birth-order, shown in the context of all identified LALv1A neuron types merged together (grey).

The majority of LALv1A neuron types innervate specific FB layers. These FB neurons are preceded in birth order by several NO- or EB-targeting neurons and followed by multiple AB-targeting neurons. Within the large middle FB window, there are 23 distinguishable neuron types that arise in an invariant sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7S</xref>). The first three types innervate FB layer 3/4 and ipsilateral NO and show distinguishable proximal elaborations. The fourth neuron type is an outliner, skipping the FB and uniquely targeting the contralateral NO. The next six types selectively innervate a single FB layer, serially targeting layers 2, 4, 7, 8, 6, and 5. The following three types display bilayer targeting, and the next four types selectively target layer 3/4 again. A very similar sequence repeats once, with other multi-layer FB neurons followed by single-layer FB neurons (targeting layers 1 or 2). Interestingly, FB layer 3/4 receives innervation from many more LALv1A neuron types than other FB layers (12 types in total for layer 3/4, as opposed to 2â3 types each for other layers). Regarding the âproximalâ elaborations, multiple rounds of progressive changes in the coverage of LAL/CRE/VES/SP occur along the production of non-FB as well as layer-specific FB neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1J</xref>). One notable example is the recurrent manifestation of the extended dorsal projection connecting SP with specific FB layers (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L and O</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the relatively uniform LALv1A hemilineage, the sister hemilineage, LALv1B, consists of six morphological groups with distinct patterns of neuropil targeting (referred to as IB, PS1, SP, PLP, VLP, and PS2 group based on the principal or unique neuropil of innervation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7AââRâ</xref>). These six major groups arise sequentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7T</xref>). Neurons in a given morphological group can vary in topology, implicating again the versatility in adopting related topologies. However, different morphological groups contain distinct group-characteristic topological classes. This point is reaffirmed by the differential presence of P versus H class in the temporally separated PS1 and PS2 groups. Nonetheless, the PS1 and PS2 groups contain similar-looking S-class neurons, potentially arising through P-to-S versus H-to-S reduction in the PS1 versus PS2 group. Interestingly, the birth of P- or H-class neurons alternates with that of S-class neurons in both PS groups (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7CââFâ and OââRâ</xref>). Similar phenomena with recurrent production of comparable neuron types are observed in two additional groups: H-class neurons are born in windows separated by P-class neurons in the PLP group (magenta in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1J11-15</xref>), and vice versa in the VLP group (magenta in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1J16-30</xref>). Such multi-level temporal changes suggest parallel-acting temporal fating mechanisms that run at different paces to diversity neuronal fates in a combinatorial manner.</p><p>Moreover, Notch modulates temporal patterning as evidenced by unilateral switches in producing distinct neurons on the A or B side. There exist windows when only one hemilineage is changing types, such that multiple A or B neuron types are paired with a single B or A neuron type (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7EâFâ and HâIâ</xref>). Given the well-defined stereotyped organization of CX sub-compartments, we have high confidence that we identified all individual LALv1A neuron types based on morphology. However, we may have under- or over-estimated the number of LALv1B neuron types. Perhaps, there could exist unidentified types of VLP-targeting LALv1B P-class neurons, as we only distinguished two types of P-class VLP neurons from the same window of time when the sister LALv1A hemilineage contains seven types of FB neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1J16-20Â andÂ 29-30</xref>). Conversely, we may have overestimated the number of PS-targeting LALv1B neuron types, especially among late-born neurons which appear more plastic in their morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1J33-45</xref>).

This paradoxical phenomenon evidently results from the composition of many neuron types involved in constructing fine topographic maps. In particular, the postembryonic VLPa2(A) hemilineage is exclusively dedicated to the formation of the visual topographic map in the VLP neuropil (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1P</xref>).

Besides VLP and LH, the main neuropils targeted by relatively uniform Vnd hemilineages include: the FB (innervated by LALv1A and AOTUv4A), MB lobes (innervated by CREa1A and CREa2A), SP (innervated by SMPad1(A), SLPpm3(B), and FLAa3(A)), PS (innervated by AOTUv1B), WED/SAD (innervated by WEDa1(B)), and VES (innervated by the small FLAa1(B) hemilineage).

The first three groups almost exclusively consist of P-topology neurons, which relay information from the AOTU/SP to the LAL in the first LAL group, from the AOTU to the CRE in the second CRE group, and from the AOTU to the BU in the third BU group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9AâF</xref>). By contrast, the fourth IB group only contains M-topology neurons, which connect the AOTU/SP with the SP/IB/PS/ATL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9GâH</xref>). However, there lies an âectopicâ M-topology neuron type born at the transition from the first LAL group to the second CRE group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Nonetheless, this unique M-topology neuron resembles the preceding SP-to-LAL P-topology neurons in other aspects (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), reminiscent of versatile neuron topology. Successive changes in morphology further occur within groups.

All AOTUv3A neurons project across the brain midline through the same commissure. Their morphological diversity results from variability in the major branches that extend out at the common entry and exit points of the commissure (e.g. arrow/arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9M</xref>). There are three main configurations of the AOTUv3A neuronsâ major branches: (1) two posteriorly projecting branches at both entry and exit points (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9J and P</xref>), (2) one branch at the exit point (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9N</xref>), and (3) no branches (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9L</xref>). Various additional features increase diversity within each configuration, such as ipsilateral AOTU innervation (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9L</xref>), ipsilateral or bilateral LAL elaboration (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9O</xref>), and a long ventral extension at the entry point (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9M</xref>). Notably, there are some T-topology neuron types in this otherwise pure H-topology hemilineage (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9M</xref>), which connect the ipsilateral SAD with different contralateral neuropils. As to temporal patterning of neuron morphology, almost all morphological characteristics reoccur multiple times. For instance, we have recovered neurons with bilateral posteriorly projecting branches (âPS1â) in three separate temporal windows: at the beginning of larval neurogenesis, shortly after the first, and during the larval-to-pupal transition (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9J and P</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9R</xref>). In support of long-range temporal patterning (green in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1C</xref>), certain features favor early windows (e.g. AOTU innervation in the first âPS1â window), some favor late windows (e.g. posterior projection only at the exit point in âCLâ and âPS5â), and few appear in just one window (e.g. contralateral ICL targeting in âCLâ). In sum, the AOTUv3A hemilineage contains neurons with diverse trajectories in complex temporal patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Related lineages make similar neurons in comparable temporal patterns</title><p>Despite stark differences between sister hemilineages, we see striking similarities between select hemilineages from different NBs.

Notably, sister hemilineages can vary greatly in the extent of innervation. Hemilineages with excessive coverage areas are consistently associated with the N<sup>off</sup> state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,G</xref>).

First, the degree (coefficient) of variation in the length of the main trajectory is significantly higher on the N<sup>off</sup> than N<sup>on</sup> side (p-value=0.036 for one-tailed paired T test). Second, there indeed exist significantly higher numbers of topological neuronal classes in the B than A hemilineages (p-value=0.023 for one-tailed paired T test).

For instance, Notch can promote or suppress neuronal cell death depending on lineage identity. This can lead to unpaired hemilineages, in which only one viable neuron is produced after each GMC division. From the 11 Vnd unpaired hemilineages, seven are N<sup>on</sup> and four are N<sup>off</sup>. Given this random association, it is curious that we see correlation between Notch state and hemilineage complexity. We frequently observe higher gross diversity on the N<sup>off</sup> side (see above). The same applies to the previously mapped ALl1 lineage where the N<sup>on</sup> hemilineage consists exclusively of AL local interneurons, whereas its N<sup>off</sup> sister hemilineage consists of projection neurons innervating diverse neuropils, including AL, AMMC, LH, PLP, and VLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). However, the striking Notch-dependent LN/PN fate separation appears to be a characteristic of only the ALl1 lineage. We found instead that neurons of the same hemilineage can adopt various topologies. In fact, both general topology and terminal arborization seem primarily tailored by the targets innervated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). Further, unrelated hemilineages with striking similarities (e.g. CREa1A/CREa2A and LALv1A/AOTUv4A) consistently have the same Notch state. Such resemblance across non-sister hemilineages could simply reflect their evolutionary relatedness at the lineage level. Nonetheless, Notch may directly regulate neuropil targeting, as implicated by the complete segregation of the N<sup>on</sup> and N<sup>off</sup> neuronal processes observed in six of the seven (not LALv1) dual lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâG</xref>). Further, Notch can promote cell adhesion, either by acting as a cell adhesion molecule or by upregulating canonical cell adhesion molecules such as integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murata and Hayashi, 2016</xref>). Here, we speculate that Notch may strengthen neurite-neurite affinity, as higher affinity in A hemilineages could suppress neurite defasciculation resulting in more uniform trajectory (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>[green], C[green], F[green], G[green], I, K, L, N), and facilitate extension of long neurite fascicles (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,K,L,M,N</xref>). By contrast, reduced affinity in B hemilineages could promote gross diversity through serial defasciculation of primary projections. Further, reduced affinity across sister branches could enhance neurite elaboration within targeted neuropils. Nonetheless, additional factors (e.g. neuropil-characteristic topographic maps) might modulate the gross manifestation of Notchâs morphogenetic effects.</p><p>The orderly derivation of morphologically distinct neuron types within a given hemilineage is indicative of temporal fating. However, the final neuron morphology depends not only on temporal fate, but also on lineage identity and Notch binary sister fate, as well as the anatomy of target neuropils. Despite the complexities, similar temporal features are observable across diverse hemilineages. First, it is common to see beginning neurons with uniquely elaborate projections and ending neurons with reduced morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A</xref>). Second, there are temporally ordered neuropil targets characteristic of each hemilineage. Although rarely restricted to a single window, most morphological groups show select windows of production. These phenomena indicate long-range temporal patterning. However, recurrent neuropil targeting is also common. Moreover, a comparable series of related neuron types or progressive morphological changes can appear multiple times in a hemilineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14B</xref>). These recurrences suggest repetition of dynamic factors. Taken together, the temporal changes in neuron morphology and targeting indicate the combination of both long-range temporal patterning and reiteration of temporal windows.</p><fig id="fig14" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>Common themes of neuronal lineage temporal patterning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Neuron complexity decreases over time.

(<bold>C</bold>) Schematic illustration of potential temporal patterning mechanisms, including long-range temporal patterning orchestrated by graded Imp/Syp expressions and asynchronous cyclic changes elicited by unknown alternating/recurring factors. Cas and Svp, as classic temporal transcription factors (tTF), are expressed at the beginning of post-embryonic neurogenesis. Svp triggers the opposite Imp/Syp gradients that in turn shape the descending Chinmo protein gradient. The hierarchical Imp/Syp and Chinmo gradients (plus other undiscovered gradients) could subdivide a protracted neuronal lineage into multiple temporal windows with a progressive TF code (e.g. Mamo). Cas expression (cyan), in the beginning of the lineage may cause the initial exuberant neuron types. In parallel, there could exist various alternating/recurring factors which diversify each temporal window further in a combinatorial manner. Together the tTFs, progressive TF code and alternating/recurring factors lead to a complex layering of factors which are interpreted differentially by sister neurons (depending on Notch state) to reveal the neuronal TF code.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53518-fig14-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As to underlying molecular mechanisms, the observed birth order-dependent neuronal morphogenesis is unlikely due to the environmental differences over the course of larval neurogenesis, since the final neuronal targeting and innervation occur in a rather synchronized manner at the early pupal stage. Further, some of the temporal patterning phenomena may be explained by the intrinsic temporal factors that have been previously described in the literature. The Cas and Svp embryonic temporal transcription factors are expressed in NBs during early postembryonic neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>) and are thus candidates to promote the uniquely exuberant neurite projections in first-born neurons. Opposing temporal gradients of Imp and Syp RNA binding proteins in cycling NBs have been shown to control neuronal temporal fate in MB, AL, and complex type II lineages as well as global NB termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Imp/Syp are likely to govern long-range temporal patterning of most, if not all, neuronal lineages. Imp and Syp gradients shape the descending protein gradient of Chinmo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>). The hierarchical temporal gradients of Imp/Syp and Chinmo could define serial temporal windows with expression of various terminal selector genes. For instance, Mamo (a temporally patterned terminal selector gene) is selectively expressed in the window defined by both weak Chinmo and abundant Syp in MB and AL lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>However, we doÂ not know exactly how the opposite Imp/Syp protein gradients can defineÂ ~30 serial temporal fates in a protracted neuronal lineage. Interestingly, recurrent production of related neuron types has emerged as a dominant theme in the temporal patterning of Vnd lineages. Dynamic Notch signaling may underlie some alternating temporal fates, as Notch has been shown to control alternate production of AL and AMMC projection neurons in the lateral AL lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is unlikely that Notch alone can mediate multiple recurring features as seen in most Vnd hemilineages. We therefore propose involvement of parallel recurring factors to elicit unsynchronized repetition of distinct features. In sum, there likely exist multiple temporal fating mechanisms that act in concert to expand neuron diversity, thus resulting in complex temporal patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14C</xref>).</p><p>Given the need for large neuronal diversity, it was surprising to see the production of two identical, long series of dopaminergic neuron types by CREa1A and CREa2A. Strikingly, the NB homology extends throughout postembryonic neurogenesis. The FB neurons born prior to dopaminergic neurons in CREa1A are also morphologically indistinguishable from those in CREa2A. The only difference is the selective loss of the first larval-born CREa2A neuron. Contrasting the almost identical CREa1A and CREa2A hemilineages, their paired sister hemilineages (CREa1B and CREa2B) are easily distinguishable, as only CREa1B neurons cross the midline. These phenomena implicate that neighboring CREa1 and CREa2 lineages may have arisen from NB duplication followed by a change in midline crossing. Thus, we believe that one way for brain complexity to increase is through lineage duplication and subsequent divergence.</p><p>In conclusion, our high-resolution, comprehensive analysis of Vnd lineages reveals how a complex brain can be reliably built from differentially fated neural stem cells. This seminal groundwork lays an essential foundation for unraveling brain development from genome to connectome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-GFP (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat # A-11122;

For detail, please see the custom algorithms in supplementary materials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantitative analysis of single neuron morphology</title><p>For pairwise comparison of Vnd neuron types by NBLAST, we selected 464 segmented neurons that were warped into a standard adult fly brain template. We then generated the all-to-all score matrix using the NBLAST package available at GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jefferislab/NBLAST_on-the-fly">https://github.com/jefferislab/NBLAST_on-the-fly</ext-link>). Various analyses of the score matrix and visualization of the results were carried out by Python.</p><p>To measure the total length of main neuronal trajectory, we first created single-neuron skeletons (trees) using the ImageJ skeletonize3D macro (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/Skeletonize3D">https://imagej.net/Skeletonize3D</ext-link>). We then detected neuronal cell bodies based on the highest intensity value in the skeletons. After locating the root, we identified leaves and measured the lengths of terminal branches as well as internal segments using the Analyze Skeleton plugin in ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/AnalyzeSkeleton">https://imagej.net/AnalyzeSkeleton</ext-link>). We then took a serial pruning strategy to derive the main trajectory for each single neuron, by removing terminal branches shorter than 10, then 25, and finally 50 Î¼m. We ultimately combined all remaining segments to calculate the total length of main neuronal trajectory.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Janelia Workstation, Janelia FlyLight, and Janelia Fly Core for technical supports.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Your study of multiple neuroblast lineages in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult brain is a tour de force. It allowed you to confirm some of the basic principles that you and others have established for the generation of neurons, such as the temporal specification of neurons as well as the role of Notch in hemilineages. We also appreciated the novel concepts and in particular the evidence for duplicated lineages as well as the repeated nature of some of the series of neurons produced. This work will be undoubtedly a useful resource for many researchers.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Conservation and divergence of related neuronal lineages in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central brain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Claude Desplan as the Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor, who has added some more comments at the end, has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers and the editor in particular were extremely impressed with the extent of the work, his thoroughness and the potentially immense source of information that might emerge from these data. The visualization of the data is also extremely impressive.</p><p>However, as pointed out by reviewer #1, it is difficult to justify publication of this huge set of data to a broad audience without doing a much better job extracting important rules that might apply to other systems.</p><p>â One of these rules is the role of Notch in hemilineages, although of course this is well-established, and your lab has contributed extensively to this concept.</p><p>â Reviewer # 1 points out that one ânovel finding pertains to that hemilineages with greater axon/dendrite coverage associate with the N<sup>off</sup> state, implicating N<sup>on</sup> in inhibiting long-distance targetingâ.</p><p>If you could repeat at least one of the lineage studies in an all-N<sup>on</sup> or all-N<sup>off</sup> context to provide functional data to one of the main observations, this would greatly help the paper to be accepted.</p><p>â The other is the sequential production of neurons and the notion that temporal patterning likely plays a very important role. However, you do not provide a molecular support for this for central brain neuroblasts, and it is quite surprising that nothing is known about the factors that might play a role in Type I neuroblasts. I admit that this is inferred from previous work from Chris Doe's lab (and Claude's lab as well) but it would be important to devise a way to access these potential factors. I am sure that you great creativity could allow you to develop an approach to test for genes expressed at different times in different neurons. I would not ask you to do this now as this would require much time, but you must discuss the issue of temporal patterning of Type I central brain neuroblasts.</p><p>â There is another point that I find extremely exciting, which is the repeated nature of lineages portions. This is, to a large extent, buried in the massive data and the paper would greatly gain if this concept were to be significantly emphasized. Of course, one question would be whether there is a repeated sequence of temporal transcription factors. This would require a lot of work as we do not know what these tTFs are, but this should be discussed in more details.</p><p>â Reviewer #2 wants you to release this data with publication of the work (and I am sure that you intend to do so as you always did in the past) but you have to explain how this will be achieved technically and how it will be matched to the Virtual Fly Brain or other means to allow comparison with other works. This reviewer also rightfully asks for more rigor (and quantification whenever possible) in describing the new neurons.</p><p>In summary, this could be in our view very important work if you could help the reader extract important concepts, e.g. the repeated nature of the lineages and at least provide one set of functional data with Notch, which should be feasible in your hands. Otherwise, it would remain a resource aimed at a very small community of scientists interested in fly neural lineages.</p><p>I have added a few more technical comments at the end, but reviewer #2 has a long list of very useful comments that must be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is important work, and very impressive in its comprehensiveness. I have no major critique of the data presented. However, the study exclusively entails the mapping of lineages, without any functional assessment of genes potentially controlling lineage progression and/or axon/dendrite projections. Moreover, as far as I can judge, they describe no novel technologies.</p><p>The only novel finding pertains to that hemilineages with greater axon/dendrite coverage associated with the N<sup>off</sup> state, implicating N<sup>on</sup> in inhibiting long-distance targeting. However, this idea is not tested functionally.</p><p>In summary, I am not sure that these findings would be of broad interest, and hence be a good fit for the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Lee et al. performed a detailed and careful study of 18 out of the approximately 100 neuroblasts in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult brain. The work is a true tour de force, where they imaged 5,771 brains and manually annotated 20,916 clones, which they aligned to a standard fly brain, finally defining 467 morphological neuronal types, that include some previously undocumented MB PAM neurons. They also describe some principles in the generation of neurons by neuroblasts, including some rules already documented for other neuroblasts, such as the temporal specification of neuron types, and hemilineage specific cell death, as well as, more novel concepts, such as the generation of &quot;duplicated&quot; lineages from two different neuroblasts. This work will be undoubtedly a useful resource for many researchers. However, for it to be really useful, and also for non-experts to be able to appreciate and follow the manuscript, the following two main points need to be addressed before publication:</p><p>1) Most of the descriptions are very qualitative and hard to appreciate. I have no doubt that what the authors claim in the text is true and that for them, as experts who have been looking at these neurons for years, is obvious. However, many of these claims were impossible for me to evaluate. I give below a few examples, with suggestions on how to improve them:</p><p>â &quot;we see more focused, shorter-range innervation in most A hemilineages as compared to their paired B lineages&quot;. Given that they have already reconstructed the clones, can this be quantified, by for example plotting total cable length or total percentage of brain coverage for hemilineages A and B?</p><p>â Subsection âMorphological complexity decreases with birth orderâ can &quot;exuberant&quot; arborizations be described in more quantitative terms and the differences mentioned analysed statistically?</p><p>â &quot;AOTUv4A and LALv1A make similar FB neurons in comparable temporal patterns.&quot; and &quot;This phenomenon indicates that the two NBs produce two identical series of PAM neurons.&quot; I find nearly impossible to verify these two statements. The authors should do two things. First, they should calculate NBLAST scores, and statistically test their differences before making claims like &quot;similar&quot; or &quot;identical&quot;. Second, when comparing two neuron types they should show in the figure a graph with dot plots of the all by all NBLAST pairwise comparisons of the two hemilineages to be compared, as well as a representative image of each, side by side, so this difference can be appreciated. Having to jump from main figures to supplementary figures with tens of images and find the ones that look similar is extremely hard.</p><p>2) They describe and annotate many new neurons and neuron types, which has the potential to be very useful but only if this data is released to the community in a sensible format. I have the following suggestions:</p><p>â There should be a plan in place, which should be explicitly written in the manuscript under the section of &quot;Data availability&quot; for the release of all of the skeletons and clones that have been mapped to a common fly reference brain. Ideally, these should be uploaded post-publication to the &quot;Virtual Fly Brain&quot;: https://www.virtualflybrain.org/site/vfb_site/yourPaper.htm</p><p>â The nomenclature of the neurons and neurons types is not consistent. For example, in subsection âNeurons of same hemilineage origin vary in topologyâ to say that for the nomenclature &quot;typically&quot; or &quot;we may add&quot;, is not best practice. The data should be released with a consistent nomenclature that is the same for all neuron types, and is objective, things like &quot;main arborisation neuropile&quot; can be subjective, instead things like first or last arborisation neuropile might be more appropriate. It would indeed be best to discuss with VFB what the most appropriate nomenclature might be.</p><p>Added comments from Claude Desplan:</p><p>I do not have major concerns with the description of the 18 lineages as well as no major concerns with the observations made in the paper. However, given the density of information available in the manuscript, some parts of the Discussion must be extended (Particularly temporal patterning).</p><p>In Figure 2: you discuss a more focused and shorter-range innervation for most N<sup>on</sup> vs N<sup>off</sup> lineages. While you mention that this applies for both paired lineages and unpaired lineages (&quot;The correlation of Notch A/B fate with the extent of neurite targeting and innervation extends beyond lineage boundary, and also applies to unpaired hemi-lineages&quot;), this is visually not entirely clear based on the figure. While panels D and P are indeed morphologically similar, panels O, Q and R (N<sup>off</sup>, unpaired) resemble more the morphological pattern of N<sup>on</sup> sister-hemi-lineages A-G (green), shorter range innervation. H-N seem to be more long-range innervation resembling N<sup>off</sup> in the paired-lineages. Figure 2H-N should be discussed in more detail to clarify these principles. It is for example unclear to what extend we only have to consider dense/disperse or also targeting range and midline crossing.</p><p>Figure 7: Figure 7E-F and H-I is this something unique to the LaLv1 lineage or is this observed for the 7 paired lineages? &quot;Notch modulates temporal patterning as evidenced by unilateral switches in producing distinct neurons on the A or B side. There exist windows when only one hemi-lineage is changing types, such that multiple A or B neuron types are paired with a single B or A neuron type (e.g. Figure 7E-F' and H-I'). &quot;</p><p>Figure 9: This is an interesting observation for neuronal temporal patterning; One sister lineage produces neuronal types sequentially while the other produces several types recurrently. You need to discuss these ideas in terms of potential molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Figure 12: This is a good overview of the general principles discussed in the text. The Discussion brings up some potential mechanisms underlying these 3 principles; Cas/Svp, Imp/Syp/Chinmo. This figure would benefit from addition of these molecules in a model to support the text in the Discussion. Some additional cartoon on how sequential/recurrent patterning is regulated in sister lineages could be helpful here as well.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53518.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Reviewer # 1 points out that one ânovel finding pertains to that hemilineages with greater axon/dendrite coverage associate with the N<sup>off</sup> state, implicating N<sup>on</sup> in inhibiting long-distance targetingâ.</p><p>If you could repeat at least one of the lineage studies in an all-N<sup>on</sup> or all-N<sup>off</sup> context to provide functional data to one of the main observations, this would greatly help the paper to be accepted.</p></disp-quote><p>We wish we could validate the model and reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. We utilized Notch RNAi in the NB clone to determine the Notch state of the hemilineages in this study. Unfortunately, this clonal-level phenotypic analysis provides minimal mechanistic insight; rather the N<sup>on</sup> hemilineage morphology is altered â appearing like N<sup>off</sup> cells. It would require much more sophisticated systems to monitor and manipulate Notch activity in defined precursors (GMCs) and then follow the resulting phenotypes with single-cell resolution. Regrettably, we are unable to deliver such functional studies within the given timeframe.</p><p>Nonetheless, we managed to examine the A/B morphological differences further with quantitative analysis per reviewer #2âs advice (see below for details). We now ascribe the A/B morphological distinctions primarily to the presence of multiple topological classes and/or morphological groups of B neurons as opposed to a single dominant group/class of A neurons (see second paragraph of Discussion). Our model has been therefore updated to propose that Notch suppresses neurite defasciculation and thus promotes joint neurite extension and neuropil innervation by A neurons (see third paragraph of Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The other is the sequential production of neurons and the notion that temporal patterning likely plays a very important role.

After excluding classical tTFs (except cas/svpâs requirement for triggering Imp/Syp gradients) from post-embryonic type I lineages, we have implicated Imp/Syp RNA-binding proteins (recovered through NB RNAseq) in the temporal patterning of central brain neuronal lineages. However, we donât know how the opposite Imp/Syp protein gradients can define ~30 serial temporal fates in a single type I lineage. Given such fine temporal patterning, we envision involvement of additional intrinsic mechanisms which remain to be discovered.</p><p>We are therefore particularly excited to see recurrent production of related neuron types as an emerging common theme in the temporal patterning of Vnd lineages. Notably, multiple characteristic features may repeat non-coordinatively within a given hemilineage. This phenomenon suggests parallel recurring mechanisms that diversify type I lineage temporal fates in a combinatorial manner (see fifth and sixth paragraphs of Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â There is another point that I find extremely exciting, which is the repeated nature of lineages portions. This is, to a large extent, buried in the massive data and the paper would greatly gain if this concept were to be significantly emphasized.

This would require a lot of work as we do not know what these tTFs are, but this should be discussed in more details.</p></disp-quote><p>We are also highly enthusiastic about the repeated nature of temporal fates as assessed by morphology. To examine this interesting phenomenon in a more systematic manner, we further compared the morphology of serially derived neuron types using NBLAST. Remarkably, cyclic relatedness emerged as a dominant temporal pattern in 17 of the 25 Vnd hemilineages (e.g. CREa2B and SMPp&amp;v1A in Figure 12E).</p><p>As to possible molecular mechanisms, Notch signaling is an obvious candidate. We have previously shown that Notch underlies the alternate production of AL and AMMC projection neurons in the lateral AL B hemilineage. However, we doubt that Notch alone can account for multiple recurring features. Along this perspective and per reviewer #2âs comment on our previous summary figure, we provide additional illustration on potential molecular mechanisms including the known players and to-be-identified recurring temporal factors (see Figure 14C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[â¦]</p><p>1) Most of the descriptions are very qualitative and hard to appreciate. I have no doubt that what the authors claim in the text is true and that for them, as experts who have been looking at these neurons for years, is obvious. However, many of these claims were impossible for me to evaluate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the challenges in 2D presentation of complex 3D neuron structures. To alleviate the deficiency, we provide manual annotation on innervation patterns for individual neuron types (see Supplementary file 1 and 2). We also present segmented neurons with hemilineage masks in the standard fly brain template, to place single neurons in a larger context. And when needed, we show neurons from certain or multiple angles to make our points of argument as clear as possible (e.g. Figure 2S-Xâ and Figure 9I-P). Finally, we took the advice and conducted 3D neuron comparison by NBLAST, which largely validate our manual annotation on neuron similarities (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I give below a few examples, with suggestions on how to improve them:</p><p>â &quot;we see more focused, shorter-range innervation in most A hemilineages as compared to their paired B lineages&quot;. Given that they have already reconstructed the clones, can this be quantified, by for example plotting total cable length or total percentage of brain coverage for hemilineages A and B?</p></disp-quote><p>We gladly took this advice and tried to measure the total length of main trajectory (excluding terminal elaborations) as an estimate for the range of coverage. However, neurons can vary greatly in the branching pattern and length of branches. We found it extremely challenging to selectively and cleanly remove terminal arborization using a universal parameter. We have no sophisticated algorithm to custom-shave individual neurons either. After various attempts, we devised a sequential pruning strategy, aiming to restore the main trajectory by removing minor branches stepwise from short to long using 10, 25, and 50 Âµm as the length limits. We then measured the total length of the pruned neuron skeleton for individual A or B neuron types. We present the quantification of A versus B neuron types for the seven Vnd lineages with dual viable hemilineages in a boxplot (Figure 13âfigure supplement 1). Despite the presence of very broad B neurons paired with skinny A neurons (e.g. Figure 13A), the average total length of B neurons is significantly larger than that of A neurons only in the CREa1 and SMPp&amp;v1 lineages. Meanwhile, we assessed the total length distribution and found a significantly greater total length distribution in the B than A hemilineages (p-value of paired T test = 0.036). This is consistent with presence of multiple morphological groups or topological classes in most B hemilineages as opposed to only one dominant group/class of A neurons per lineage (e.g. Figure 13B).</p><p>In light of the above quantification, we speculate that Notch may suppress gross diversity in A hemilineages by inhibiting defasciculation of neurite bundles. Conversely, B neurons may acquire a wide range of topological classes and/or morphological groups due to lack of Notch inhibition on neurite defasciculation. For details, please see the second and third paragraphs of Discussion)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Subsection âMorphological complexity decreases with birth orderâ can &quot;exuberant&quot; arborizations be described in more quantitative terms and the differences mentioned analysed statistically?</p></disp-quote><p>It is qualitatively clear that the beginning larval-born neurons often acquire wildly projecting processes and many ending neurons show greatly reduced morphology. For instance, we can readily see the elaboration of first larval-born neurons way beyond the collective projections of the many more subsequently born neurons in full twin-spot NB clones, as shown in Figure 3. Further, it would require systematic efforts to achieve informative quantitative analysis on intricate diverse neuron morphology across highly heterogeneous lineages (as described above on the quantification of A/B hemilineage differences). Due to limited time/resources, we decided to keep our description of this easily observable phenomenon at the qualitative level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â &quot;AOTUv4A and LALv1A make similar FB neurons in comparable temporal patterns.&quot; and &quot;This phenomenon indicates that the two NBs produce two identical series of PAM neurons.&quot; I find nearly impossible to verify these two statements.

Having to jump from main figures to supplementary figures with tens of images and find the ones that look similar is extremely hard.</p></disp-quote><p>We gladly took this advice and conducted an all-to-all NBLAST pairwise comparison on 464 Vnd neuron types. After eliminating intra-hemilineage comparisons from the top 3% pool (NBLAST scores &gt; 0.3), we obtained 16 groups of related neuron types, which include two groups of analogous FB neuron types made by AOTUv4A and LALv1A as well as five groups of corresponding CREa1A and CREa2A neuron types. Another group consists of dot-to-dot AOTUv3B and AOTUv4B neurons. These results are consistent with our identifying them as âsimilarâ or âequivalentâ by manual annotation. We present the all-to-all NBLAST analysis with a new Figure 12 in the added final Results section.</p><p>However, due to the availability of only one high-quality segmented neuron per neuron type, we were unable to compare âsameâ neurons from different samples. From our available data, the comparison between AOTUv3B_M04 and AOTUv3B_M05 yielded the highest score of 0.59, higher than comparisons across corresponding CREa1A and CREa2A neuron types with scores around 0.45. Judging from this, it could be tricky to identify âsameâ neurons based on NBLAST scores.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) They describe and annotate many new neurons and neuron types, which has the potential to be very useful but only if this data is released to the community in a sensible format.</p></disp-quote><p>We will deposit the segmented neurons into Virtual Fly Brain upon acceptance of the paper.

We would also like to keep the nomenclature simple, yet informative, such that one can readily refer to and reasonably picture the referred neuron. There are therefore two parts in our nomenclature. The main (first) part is consistent and scalable, which informs about hemilineage and topology. Nonetheless, we add a second part in parentheses which allows flexibility, to provide extra morphological info or just previously used names. We say âtypicallyâ or âwe may addâ, because others may include different info for their interests.</p><p>We acknowledge the importance of having consensus nomenclature for the community.</p><p>However, the 2019 fly neuron nomenclature meeting held at Janelia failed to reach consensus.</p><p>We would also like to coordinate with the nomenclature of EM-reconstructed fly brain neurons. However, the currently available hemi-brain EM data do not cover contralateral projections, which are critical for many Vnd neurons.

It is for example unclear to what extend we only have to consider dense/disperse or also targeting range and midline crossing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the feedback and careful evaluation of the data, we can see your points. Meanwhile, we have revisited the proposed model on how Notch might affect A/B neuronal morphogenesis (see second and third paragraphs of Discussion). As stated above and detailed further below under quantitative analysis of single-neuron morphology, we now propose that Notch strengthens neurite-neurite affinity. Higher affinity in A hemilineages could suppress neurite defasciculation (thus reducing the number of morphological groups; e.g. Figure 2B[green], C[green], F[green], G[green], I, K, L, N) and facilitate extension of long neurite fascicles (e.g. Figure 2I, K, L, M, N). By contrast, reduced affinity in B hemilineages could promote gross diversity through serial defasciculation of primary projections. Further, reduced affinity across sister branches could enhance neurite elaboration within targeted neuropils. In support of this model, Notch may directly act as a cell adhesion molecule or indirectly mediate cell adhesion through up-regulating canonical cell adhesion molecules such as integrins (Murata and Hayashi, 2016). However, additional factors (e.g. neuropil-characteristic topographic maps) might modulate the gross manifestation of Notchâs morphogenetic effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7: Figure 7E-F and H-I is this something unique to the LaLv1 lineage or is this observed for the 7 paired lineages? &quot;Notch modulates temporal patterning as evidenced by unilateral switches in producing distinct neurons on the A or B side. There exist windows when only one hemi-lineage is changing types, such that multiple A or B neuron types are paired with a single B or A neuron type (e.g. Figure 7E-F' and H-I'). &quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Per our current annotation of morphological neuron types, all seven paired Vnd lineages exhibit some unilateral temporal changes. However, it is possible we could have failed to recognize all morphological types, especially in hemilineages that target neuropils which lack stereotyped substructural landmarks. Nonetheless, we are very confident in the observed unilateral temporal changes across the LALa1 A and B hemilineages, because these paired hemilineages show comparable levels of high diversity of morphological types (with 29 and 31 annotated neuron types, respectively). Moreover, we are confident that we identified all LALa1A neuron types, as they innervate distinct FB layers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 9: This is an interesting observation for neuronal temporal patterning; One sister lineage produces neuronal types sequentially while the other produces several types recurrently. You need to discuss these ideas in terms of potential molecular mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>There does exist recurrent relatedness at the sub-structural level in the AOTUv3 B hemilineage, as highlighted with arrows in Figure 9A-H and further validated by NBLAST analysis (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C). Because multiple features may recur at different frequencies, we could not confidently determine if the paired A/B hemilineages show coordinated or independent reoccurrences. We therefore did not to comment on patterns of recurrences across paired sister hemilineages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 12: This is a good overview of the general principles discussed in the text. The Discussion brings up some potential mechanisms underlying these 3 principles; Cas/Svp, Imp/Syp/Chinmo. This figure would benefit from addition of these molecules in a model to support the text in the Discussion. Some additional cartoon on how sequential/recurrent patterning is regulated in sister lineages could be helpful here as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We gladly took this advice. We provide a new schematic to illustrate possible underlying molecular mechanisms, including known players and the proposed recurring temporal factors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
