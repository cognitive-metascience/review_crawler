Crucial to the success of the immune system to control microbial infection is the metabolic plasticity of immune cells to activate antimicrobial mechanisms in macrophages and activate T cells in response to microbial invasion. Precise coordination between diverse metabolic pathways underlies this plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ganeshan and Chawla, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loftus and Finlay, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mathis and Shoelson, 2011</xref>), which is disrupted by pathogenic bacteria. Hence, host-directed therapies are increasingly considered forÂ adjunctive treatment of tuberculosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guler and Brombacher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mahon and Hafner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wallis and Hafner, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Studies suggest that <italic>Mtb</italic> pathogenicity is reinforced with participation of metabolic pathways from the host, including evidence suggestingÂ that <italic>Mtb</italic> adaptation to the host environment requires catabolism of host-derived lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Daniel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MuÃ±oz-ElÃ­as and McKinney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pandey and Sassetti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rohde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). This is assumed to be induced through <italic>Mtb</italic> regulating metabolic thresholds of the host macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mehrotra et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies suggested that there is a shift from oxidative phosphorylation towards glycolysis in macrophages infected with an avirulent strain (H37Ra) or dead Î³-irradiated <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>), and in <italic>Mtb</italic> (H37Rv)-infected mouse lungs using transcriptomic profiling and confocal imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). Lachmandas et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lachmandas et al., 2016</xref>) demonstrated that the switch to aerobic glycolysis observed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with dead <italic>Mtb</italic> lysate is TLR2-dependent, and is mediated in part throughÂ the AKT-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway. While this evidence supports the conclusion that dead <italic>Mtb</italic> reprograms host energy metabolism, the actual underlying mechanisms with live virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> infection enabling it to persist in humans remain elusive. Furthermore, the metabolic health of the <italic>Mtb-</italic>infected cell is poorly defined as there is a lack of knowledge on exactly what metabolic health comprises, and what should be measured. Thus, development of a technological advance to address these gaps in our knowledge is expected to uncover the fundamental role of host energy metabolism in allowing <italic>Mtb</italic> to persist for decades without causing disease.</p><p>Aberrant cellular bioenergetics have been associated with, and are often the cause of, diseases such as diabetes, cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiac disease. The dysfunctional energy metabolism in these diseases has been successfully investigated using extracellular fluxÂ (XF) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Devarajan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Salabei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cronin-Furman et al., 2013</xref>). XF analysis monitors the rate of oxygen consumed by cells (oxygen consumption rate, OCR) and the release of protons from the cells into the extracellular medium (extracellular acidification rate, ECAR) non-invasively in realÂ time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Measurements of cellular respiration and acidification form the foundation of our understanding of bioenergetics because cells use two main pathways to produce ATP, namely oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis. This technology is largely unexplored in the field of bacterial pathogenesis, with a few studies focused on <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hammond et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Saha et al., 2010</xref>), but studies on live virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> pathogenesis are lacking.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39169.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of cellular metabolism pathways and XF assays used to analyze metabolic pathways.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The XF measures oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of the cell, which is mostly consumed at complexÂ IV of the electron transport chain (ETC) in the mitochondria, and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), which is generated from lactic acid produced from pyruvate, the end-product of glycolysis, and carbonic acid produced from CO<sub>2</sub> released during the TCA cycle.

Lastly, we confirmed our findings with [U-<sup>13</sup>C]glucose stable isotope tracing experiments. By adapting a real-time, non-invasive bioenergetic platform to study the bioenergetics of the <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected host cell, we have generated new knowledge that may contribute towards a better understanding of <italic>Mtb</italic> persistence and development of novel approaches for host-directed therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Mtb</italic> infection depresses the rate of mitochondrial respiration in macrophages</title><p>Mitochondria are regarded as the energy factory of the cell that generates ATP through OXPHOS. It is reasonable to expect that on infection with <italic>Mtb</italic>, host energy metabolism is rewired, which has implications for understanding how <italic>Mtb</italic> causes disease. To examine the effect of mycobacterial infection on host OXPHOS, we made use of an extracellular flux analyzer (XF, Agilent Seahorse, Santa Clara, CA) and the mitochondrial respiration test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nicholls et al., 2010</xref>) to determine key respiratory parameters in mammalian cells. These include basal respiration (Basal Resp), which is the initial OCR measured before addition of any inhibitors minus the non-mitochondrial respiration; ATP-linked respiration (ATP-linked OCR), which is determined after addition of oligomycin that inhibits ATP synthase (Complex V) and thus approximates the respiration required to drive ATP synthesis; proton leak, which is the difference between the ATP-linked OCR and the non-mitochondrial respiration; maximal respiration (Max Resp), which is induced after addition of carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) that uncouples ATP synthesis from electron transport; spare respiratory capacity (SRC), which is the difference between maximal respiration and basal respiration; and non-mitochondrial respiration (Non-Mito Resp), which is the OCR after addition of rotenone, a complex I inhibitor, and antimycin A, a complexÂ III inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). SRC is an important parameter that reflects the ability of the cell to increase respiration to increase the supply of ATP in scenarios when the energy demand exceeds supply under conditions of stress or increased work load.</p><p>Several lines of evidence preclude any contribution of the infecting <italic>Mtb</italic> to the measured OCR of infected macrophages. Firstly, we have previously demonstrated that 10<sup>6</sup> <italic>Mtb</italic> consumed 10â20 pmoles O<sub>2</sub>/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lamprecht et al., 2016</xref>) in contrast to 100â200 pmoles O<sub>2</sub>/min consumed by 80 000 to 100 000 macrophages under theÂ basal conditions measured in this study. Thus, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, 10<sup>5</sup> <italic>Mtb</italic> would result in a negligible contribution (&lt;1 pmoles O<sub>2</sub>/min) to the OCR of the uninfected macrophages. Secondly, this basal OCR of <italic>Mtb</italic> was measured in media favourable for <italic>Mtb</italic> respiration and growth, whereas the intracellular macrophage environment is not conducive to âhealthyâ <italic>Mtb</italic> respiration. Thirdly, <italic>Mtb</italic> infection at MOI of 1 and 2.5 progressively decreases the basal respiration (OCR) of both THP-1 macrophages and hMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) relative to that of uninfected macrophages. Should <italic>Mtb</italic> contribute to basal respiration (OCR), we should see an increase in OCR with increasing number of <italic>Mtb</italic> infecting the macrophages. Fourthly, the growth media of the infected macrophages after the time of infection and treatment was removed and the cells were washed in the XF assay medium before the XF assay, to remove most extracellular mycobacteria. When the washes of the macrophages were plated out on 7H11 agar plates, less than 200 CFU were obtained per well from the washes of the infected hMDMs (MOI 5), and less than 100 CFU per well from the infected THP-1 cells (MOI 5). To demonstrate that these extracellular mycobacteria do not contribute to the OCR readings of the infected macrophages, the final wash was transferred to a separate XF cell culture microplate and a separate mitochondrial respiration assay was performed on any extracellular bacteria present in the washes. The OCR and ECAR readings obtained were below 0 pmol/min and at 0 mpH/min, respectively, and the extracellular bacteria did not respond to the sequential injections of oligomycin, FCCP and rotenone and antimycin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2AâD</xref>). Thus, the infecting mycobacteria do not contribute to the measured OCR of the infected macrophages under our conditions.</p><p>It is not possible to ensure that every cell will be infected in in vitro infections, thus the percentage of uninfected cells will contribute to the resulting XF profiles. We infected the macrophages with <italic>Mtb-</italic>green fluorescent protein reporter strain (<italic>Mtb</italic>-GFP) and used bright-field and fluorescence microscopy to determine the percentage of cells that were infected. We found that there was an increase in the percentage of infected cells with an increase in MOI of both the THP-1 cells and the hMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2EâG</xref>). Although the percentage of uninfected cells will contribute to the readout of the XF profiles, previous studies have demonstrated that lipids shed by intracellular mycobacteria, such as TDM and PIM2, spread via the endocytic network throughout the macrophage, and via exocytic vesicles to neighboring uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beatty et al., 2000</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 1994</xref>)Â and can elicit the production of proinflammatory cytokinesÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rhoades et al., 2003</xref>). Consequently, the bioenergetic metabolism of the âby-standerâ uninfected cells will also be modulated. Thus, the XF profiles are providing collective data of a mixed population of macrophages.</p><p>Overall, our data demonstrated that strain pathogenicity and burden have distinct effects on virtually all respiratory parameters. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> shows that infection of THP-1 macrophages with <italic>Mtb</italic> or BCG significantly decreased the respiratory parameters: Basal Resp, ATP-linked OCR, proton leak and Max Resp (and SRC in the case of <italic>Mtb</italic>), and increased Non-Mito Resp. Similar patterns were observed at lower MOIs of 1 and 2.5, but to lesser degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1AâD</xref>).

This results in the calculated basal respiration having a negative value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). As we have used standard equations to calculate the basal respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nicholls et al., 2010</xref>), we propose that when the non-mitochondrial respiration is greater than the initial OCR readings before the addition of any inhibitors, an additional mitochondrial respiration assay should be performed without the addition of the FCCP to determine the non-mitochondrial respiration, to obtain the values of basal respiration and proton leak.

The basal respiration of both <italic>Mtb</italic> and BCG infections at a MOI of 2.5 and 5 were less than that of uninfected THP-1 cells, and the proton leak of BCG was less than that of the uninfected THP-1Â cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3AâD</xref>).

SRC has consequences on how the macrophage responds to environmental stresses such as nutrient availability, redox state and changes in pH. Thus, an increase in the SRC of hMDMs following infection with potential vaccine candidates may aid identification of promising candidates. Strikingly, dead<italic>Â Mtb</italic> infection still alters the bioenergetic metabolism of the macrophage, in particular that of the THP-1 cells. This has implications for pharmacological killing of <italic>Mtb</italic>, as killing intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> will not fully restore the macrophageâs bioenergetic metabolism to that of the uninfected macrophage.

The most important conclusions from the current study are that unlike non-pathogenic or dead mycobacteria, <italic>Mtb</italic> uniquely decelerates both glycolysis and OXPHOS to enter a state of metabolic quiescence and consequently decreases the rate of ATP production of the macrophage.

It is difficult to define what constitutes the metabolic health of an immune cell becauseÂ of the metabolic plasticity necessary to fulfil their effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loftus and Finlay, 2016</xref>). Their functions are determined by the site of infection, the pathogen present, the extent of pathogenesis, and the redox and metabolic state of the microenvironment. Furthermore, virulence factors unique to each pathogen invariably alter the metabolism of immune cells to enhance survival of the pathogen and subvert adaptive immune responses. Hence, the metabolic health of an immune cell is likely to be defined by its ability to execute metabolic plasticity to fulfil its effector functions to protect the host. Given this, pathogens prove to be successful in establishing infection by inhibiting the metabolic plasticity of the immune cells. Here, we demonstrate for the first time how quantifiable bioenergetic parameters of the host, including the respiratory parameters, especially spare respiratory capacity; basal and compensatory glycolytic proton efflux rates; mitochondrial and glycolytic ATP production rates; in addition to the mitochondrial capacity of the host to oxidize glucose, glutamine or fatty acids, can be used to accurately measure and track disease established as a result of intracellular pathogens reprogramming host metabolism. These measurable parameters can be similarly applied to study host reprogramming induced by other intracellular pathogens such as <italic>Brucella abortus</italic>, <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic>, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> and <italic>Neisseria meningitidis.</italic> Furthermore, this platform will now open new avenues to rapidly and quantifiably assess drug and vaccine efficacy to reverse the pathogen-induced rewiring of host metabolism. These findings encourage further exploitation of this platform to measure the bioenergetic modulations of infection on polarized macrophages and other cell populations ex vivo following host-directed treatments of the TB mouse model.</p><p>A robust glycolytic response is considered a hallmark of positive metabolic change in most activated immune cells and is essential for sufficient ATP generation and anabolism of biosynthetic intermediates. However, live <italic>Mtb</italic> decelerates glycolysis in infected macrophages as evidenced by the reduced glycolytic proton efflux rates of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected hMDMs and THP-1 macrophages. Conversely, BCG infection increases the glycolytic proton efflux rate of the macrophages as expected and increases the glycolytic contribution to the total rate of ATP production. Thus, the shift in the bioenergetic profiles of BCG-infected macrophages from uninfected macrophages demonstrates an appropriate healthy metabolic response to eradicate an infection. The reduced glycolytic rate in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages points towards mechanisms of <italic>Mtb</italic> to subvert apt innate immune responses that would translate into suitable activation of the adaptive immune response.</p><p>This raises the important question: How does <italic>Mtb</italic> decelerate glycolysis? A plausible candidate is citrate as high levels of this metabolite allosterically inhibit phosphofructokinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Usenik and LegiÅ¡a, 2010</xref>). Phosphofructokinase catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate and ATP to fructose-1,6-biphosphate and ADP. This reaction is one of the key regulatory and rate-limiting steps of glycolysis and inhibition of this reaction downregulates glycolysis. Indeed, our <sup>13</sup>C tracing data demonstrates a reduced rate of glycolysis and high levels of citrate in the <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected hMDMs, pointing to phosphofructokinase as a target for pharmacological upregulation.</p><p>Secreted lactate is often used as a measure of glycolysis and increased lactate secretion has been used by researchers in the TB field to illustrate the switch to aerobic glycolysis in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lachmandas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Braverman et al., 2016</xref>). However, under our conditions, <italic>Mtb</italic> infection of hMDMs and THP-1 cells reduced lactate secretion, which was measured using stable isotopes and LC-MS/MS. Some of these differences can be attributed to our use of human monocyte-derived macrophages versus their use of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Braverman et al., 2016</xref>), the use of stimulation with <italic>Mtb</italic> lysate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lachmandas et al., 2016</xref>) or infection with Î³-irradiated <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>) rather than infection with live <italic>Mtb</italic> in addition to different protocols to generate hMDMs. However, our results do challenge current dogma that <italic>Mtb</italic> infection induces the Warburg effect in macrophages.</p><p>Ratios of OCR to ECAR have also been used to illustrate a switch from OXPHOS to glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>); however, ECAR is a measure of the extracellular acidification resultingÂ from both glycolysis and oxidation of pyruvate in the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mookerjee et al., 2015a</xref>). Thus, OCR/ECAR ratios (or ECAR/OCR) are not representative of the ratio of the rate of OXPHOS to the rate of glycolysis, although theyÂ are often interpreted as such (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lachmandas et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, measurements of the total proton efflux rate followed by inhibition of the mitochondrial ETC to measure the mitochondrial contribution to the total proton efflux rate enables calculation of the glycolytic PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mookerjee and Brand, 2015b</xref>). Using the proton efflux rate, we found that <italic>Mtb</italic> reduced the glycoPER in human macrophages in contrast to BCG that increased the glycoPER, which is the expected response from inflammatory macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">O'Neill and Pearce, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In sum, the energy phenotype reminiscent of quiescence that we observed in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected THP-1 macrophages and hMDMs may prove to be favourable for the development and maintenance of <italic>Mtb</italic> persistence. These findings suggest that pharmacological enhancement of glycolysis in the <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophage may initiate and improve the anti-mycobacterial properties of the macrophage.</p><p>Metabolic plasticity of the immune cells entails changing substrates for bioenergetic metabolism to perform effector functions. Pathogens often establish successful infections by altering the substrate preferences of the immune cells to create a niche promoting the pathogenâs survival and proliferation. Monitoring mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the presence of modulators affecting substrate utilisation or availability gives insight into the pathogen tempering of substrate preferences of the infected cells. For example, we found that infection of the hMDMs generates a dependency on Gln as opposed to no Gln dependency in uninfected cells, and infected THP-1 cells increase their dependency on Gln. This suggests the anapleurotic replenishment of Î±-KG as a result of citrate being used in other processes, such as fatty acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mehrotra et al., 2014</xref>). The decreased dependency on glucose observed in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected hMDMs correlates with the reduced glycolytic rate detected in these macrophages. In contrast, the increased mitochondrial dependency of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected hMDMs on fatty acid oxidation may resultÂ from <italic>Mtb</italic>-mediated induction of foamy macrophages. Foamy macrophages are formed through accumulation of lipid bodies composed of triglycerides and cholesteryl esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thiam et al., 2013</xref>), which are produced from malonyl Co-A and mevalonate, respectively. In turn, these substrates are produced from catabolism of citrate that is formed from the condensation of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singh et al. (2012)</xref> found that virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> strains induced a pronounced increase in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA. A potential source of increased acetyl-CoA synthesis is macrophage fatty acid oxidation, which would substantiate the increased mitochondrial dependency of <italic>Mtb-</italic>infected macrophages on fatty acids. The observed switch from dependence on endogenous to exogenous fatty acids induced by <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is likely aÂ resultÂ of 3-hydroxybutyrate inhibiting endogenous lipolysis to promote lipid body formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singh et al., 2012</xref>), forcing the macrophage to use exogenous fatty acids to maintain viability and produce acetyl Co-A for the ultimate formation of triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. Thus, the reduced dependency on glucose and the increased dependency on fatty acids identify glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation as potential targets for host-directed therapies</p><p>In conclusion, we identified new paradigms in TB host metabolism, including <italic>Mtb</italic> decelerating OXPHOS and glycolysis in the human macrophages resulting in decreased ATP production. The decelerated bioenergetics decreased the dependency of the macrophage on glucose with a compensating increased capacity for glutamine and dependency on fatty acids, of which <italic>Mtb</italic> induces a shift from oxidation of endogenous fatty acids to that of exogenous fatty acids. Our findings suggest that restoration of glycolysis and endogenous fatty acid oxidation would augment the development of inflammatory effector functions in the <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophage. In contrast, infection with the vaccine strain BCG increases glycolysis of human macrophages, characteristic of a healthy inflammatory response, in addition to increasing the macrophageâs spare respiratory capacity. Thus, the quantifiable respiratory and glycolytic parameters established in this study would enable direct measures in the assessment of the efficacy of future anti-TB drug leads and vaccine candidates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The macrophages were infected with <italic>Mtb-</italic>GFP at MOIs of 1, 2.5 and 5 for 16 h. The infected macrophages were washed three times with dPBS to remove most of the extracellular mycobacteria and 300 Âµl of dPBS was added to the wells. Cells infected with <italic>Mtb</italic>-GFP were viewed on a Nikon Eclipse Ti fluorescent microscope using a FITC filter at 15X magnification. Percentage of infected cells was then calculated by counting the total number of macrophages and the infected macrophages in five fields. A minimum of 100 cells was counted in each field.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Extracellular flux analysis</title><p>Oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates (OCR and ECAR, respectively) were measured using the Seahorse XF96 extracellular flux analyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Cells were seeded into the XF96 cell culture plate at cell densities of 80000 (hMDM) and 100000 (THP-1) cells per well to generate a confluent monolayer of cells. THP-1 and HMDMs were differentiated directly in the XF96 cell culture plate.</p><p>To assess the contribution of the extracellular bacteria to the OCR or ECAR of the infected macrophages, mycobacteria were adhered to the XF cell culture microplate by adding 10 Âµl of Cell-Tak reagent (135 Âµl Cell-Tak, 270 Âµl dH<sub>2</sub>O, 810 Âµl of 0.1 N sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.0), followed by adjusting the pH to 7.2â7.8 with 1 N NaOH) to each well. Cell-Tak was incubated for 30 min at 37ÂºC and then the wells were washed three times with dPBS.</p><p>Six different assays were performed using the XF96 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): mitochondrial respiration assay, extracellular acidification assay, glycolytic rate assay, mitochondrial fuel assay, fatty acid oxidation assay and a real-time ATP-Rate production assayÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The Wave Desktop 2.6 Software, available from the Agilent website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.agilent.com/en/products/cell-analysis/software-download-for-wave-desktop">https://www.agilent.com/en/products/cell-analysis/software-download-for-wave-desktop</ext-link>), was used to normalize the OCR and ECAR values to the protein content of each well (see âProtein Quantificationâ below) and export the data into GraphPad Prism Version 7.04 for statistical analysis. The Wave Desktop 2.6 software also has the capability to export the data into the XF Report Generators for calculation of the parameters from the specific assays including the mitochondrial respiration assay (Cell Mito Stress Test), extracellular acidification assay (Glycolysis Stress Test), Glycolytic Rate AssayÂ andÂ mitochondrial fuel assay (Mito Fuel Flex Test). The XF Real-time ATP Rate Report generator is available from the Agilent website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.agilent.com/en/products/cell-analysis/xf-real-time-atp-rate-assay-report-generator">https://www.agilent.com/en/products/cell-analysis/xf-real-time-atp-rate-assay-report-generator</ext-link>).</p><p>In the mitochondrial respiration assayÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), three or four OCR measurements (3 min of mixing, 4 min of measurement) were performed under basal conditions to determine basal respiration, followed by the addition of oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP synthase, and another three OCR measurements to determine the ATP-linked OCR and proton leak. FCCP, an ETC uncoupling agent, was injected to determine the maximal respiration and the spare respiratory capacity, which is the difference between the maximal and basal respiration. Lastly, rotenone (inhibitor of complex I) and antimycin A (inhibitor of complexÂ III) were injected to inhibit the electron transport chain to determine non-mitochondrial respiration, which is subtracted from the basal measurements to give basal respiration, the ATP-linked OCR to give the proton leak and the maximal OCR measurements to give maximal respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Final concentrations of mitochondrial modulators in the XF96 well were 1 ÂµM for carbonilcyanide <italic>p</italic>-triflouromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) for both THP-1 and hMDMs; 1.5 ÂµM for oligomycin for all cell types; and 0.5 ÂµM each of antimycin A and rotenone used in combination for THP-1 cells and 2.5 ÂµM each for hMDMs. Other reagents were used as perÂ theÂ manufacturerâs instructions (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).</p><p>After the respective differentiation and treatment/infection periods, growth medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with XF assay medium prior to adding 180 Âµl of XF assay medium for the XF run. In the case of the mitochondrial respiration test and the extracellular acidification test, the assay medium used was DMEM supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM GlutaMAX. The media for the mitochondrial respiration test was supplemented with 25 mM glucose.</p><p>In the extracellular acidification test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the first three basal ECAR readings (2 min of mixing and 3 min of measurement) were used to measure the non-glycolytic acidification. After addition of 10 mM glucose, three ECAR measurements were used to determine the extracellular acidification resultingÂ from glucose metabolism, after subtraction of the non-glycolytic acidification. This was followed by addition of oligomycin to inhibit the ATP synthase in the mitochondria, forcing the cell to use glycolysis solely to generate all the ATP demands of the cell. Three subsequent ECAR measurements gave a measure of the maximal glycolytic capacity after subtraction of the non-glycolytic acidification. The difference between the glycolytic capacity and the ECAR from glucose metabolism gives the glycolytic reserve, which is a measure of the capability of a cell to respond to energetic demands in addition to indicating how close the ECAR from glucose metabolism isÂ to the cellâs theoretical maximum. Glycolysis was then inhibited with addition of 2.5 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and three subsequent ECAR measurements demonstrated that the prior ECAR resultedÂ from glycolysis, hence giving a measure for non-glycolytic acidification.</p><p>For the fatty acid oxidation assayÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), growth media were exchanged for substrate-limited media (DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mM glucose, 1 mM GlutaMax, 0.5 mM carnitine (Sigma) and 1% FBS) 16 h prior to the assay. Forty-five minutes prior to the assay, substrate limited media were exchanged for the fatty acid oxidation assay medium (111 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> supplemented with 2.5 mM glucose, 0.5 mM carnitine and 5 mM HEPES on the day of the assay). Fifteen min prior to the assay, etomoxir (Sigma) was added to the respective wells to a final concentration of 40 ÂµM. XF palmitate-bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugate or BSA control was added to the appropriate wells prior to loading the XF cell culture plate into the XF to perform a mitochondrial respiration assay.</p><p>For the mitochondrial fuel testÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), growth media was exchanged with XF base medium (Agilent) supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMax and 10 mM glucose. Final concentrations of inhibitors used in the mitochondrial fuel test were: 3 ÂµM BPTES (Gln oxidation inhibitor), 16 ÂµM etomoxir (long-chain fatty acid oxidation inhibitor) and 2 ÂµM UK5099 (glucose oxidation inhibitor). The drug combinations were prepared and loaded into the ports of the XF cartridge as described for the Flexibility Test in the <italic>Agilent Seahorse XF Mito Fuel Flex Test Kit User Manual.</italic> Each infection was compared with uninfected macrophages as the control in separate XF runs.</p><p>For the glycolytic rate assay and the real-time ATP-rate production assay, growth media were exchanged with XF base medium, without phenol red, supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMAX<sup>TM</sup>, 10 mM glucose and 5 mM HEPES.</p><p>In the glycolytic rate assayÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), three initial OCR and ECAR measurements (3 min of mixing, 4 min of measurement) were used to determine the total proton efflux rate (PER). This was followed by simultaneous addition of antimycin A and rotenone to inhibit the electron transport chain (OXPHOS) and consequently the TCA cycle that results in the carbonic acid produced from the CO<sub>2</sub> generated by the TCA cycle. The next three OCR and ECAR readings were measured to determine the mitoPER (PER from mitochondrial respiration) and compensatory glycoPER (PER from glycolysis). Finally, 2-DG was injected to inhibit glycolysis and provide qualitative confirmation that the PER prior to the 2-DG injection resultsÂ from glycolysis.</p><p>In the real-time ATP rate assayÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), after three OCR and ECAR readings to determine total PER, oligomycin was added to inhibit ATP synthase in the mitochondria. The next three OCR readings were used to determine the rate of oxygen consumed for ATP production in the mitochondria. Antimycin A and rotenone were then injected simultaneously to inhibit the extracellular acidification from mitochondrial respiration to determine glycoPER which is equivalent to the glycolytic ATP rate of production.</p><p>All drugs for the respective assays were prepared at 10X their desired concentration and loaded into the XF cartridge into the respective ports. All assay media were pre-warmed to 37 ËC and pH corrected to 7.4 (mitochondrial respiration test, mitochondrial fuel test, and fatty acid oxidation assay, glycolytic rate assay) and 7.35 (extracellular acidification assay).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Metabolite extraction</title><p>THP-1 (3 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells per well) or hMDMs (3 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells per well) were seeded into six well plates and differentiated as previously described.

Then the supernatants of the cells were collected and the cells were washed in pre-warmed (37 ËC) PBS three times prior to adding ice-cold methanol to quench the metabolism of the cells. An equal amount of ice-cold water containing internal standards of 6-amino-nicotinic acid and nitrophenyl phosphate (to give a final concentration of 700 ng/ml) was added, and cells were lifted into the methanol-water using a cell scraper.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> induces decelerated bioenergetic metabolism in human macrophages&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dirk Bald (Reviewer #2); William R Jacobs (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes a bioenergetics analysis of macrophages infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> using extracellular flux technology. The authors test various parameters related to energy metabolism and carbon utilization in different macrophages infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The intent is to describe potential avenues in which <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb</italic>) rewires the metabolism profile of various macrophage lines to create a favorable niche allowing <italic>Mtb</italic> to thrive in a normally unfavorable environment.</p><p>Key findings:</p><p>1) <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection results in reduced glycolysis and decreased flux through the citric acid cycle, an effect that is not seen with BCG or dead mycobacteria.</p><p>2) Infection with tubercle bacteria leads to increased fatty acid utilization by mitochondria and a shift towards a quiescent phenotype. ATP production is also reduced in mitochondria upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p><p>3) The source of fatty acids used also shifts from endogenous to exogenous upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study needs to be framed in the context of existing literature, for example the study by Lachmandas et al. (2016). Whilst this current submission seems to be the first to apply extracellular flux analysis using a high-throughput automated system, others have reported on rewiring of energy (and primary carbon) metabolism in the host upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Consider this as you frame the background to your work. Providing the correct context, with a careful exposition of all the relevant material allows readers to more easily digest your work.</p><p>2) All reviewers concurred that the overall readability and presentation your manuscript is poor. The use of jargon obfuscates the findings and reduces impact. Methods are not described with sufficient detail and provide confusing information for example, different durations of infections 18 versus 10 hours (subsection âMetabolite extractionâ). Biological replicates, data analysis etc. are not clear. Note that <italic>eLife</italic> has a broad readership and the expectation is that manuscripts reach as many people as possible. Please consider this and recraft your presentation of the work to provide a clearer description. Good use of figures and diagrams can be very instructive.</p><p>3) Experimental weaknesses include:</p><p>i) What proportion of cells remain uninfected? This needs to be considered as these also contribute to the readout. Please consider a way of addressing this, it is an important point.</p><p>ii) Were there any dead host cells (and did the proportion of these change with time)? Again, very important as you would be looking at the average readout of the whole cellular population in the well during any given experiment.</p><p>iii) Did you confirm that there were no extracellular organisms? Regards point (ii), will it be useful if you describe flux analysis with a lower MOI than that reported? Using the same MOI throughout the paper will give your claims more support.</p><p>4) All reviewers raised concerns with the glycolysis effect and indicated that it needs to be characterized more carefully. Decreased glycolytic flux is supported by data shown in the histogram in Figure 3D. However, Figure 3C shows increased ECAR and a stronger ECAR increase after glucose addition for the <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages compared to uninfected control. This point needs to be clarified. Also, it would be important to confirm that the effects seen are due solely to the mycobacterial infected cells and not due to the addition of the glucose (also referring to the point above regards uninfected cells). Comparing AKT production/phosphorylation is important.</p><p>5) More controls (that provide no measurable difference in the readout) are needed. Things like differences in the basal respiration rate need to be clarified. The effect of adding dead mycobacteria is unclear, why was this experiment necessary? Clarify.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39169.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study needs to be framed in the context of existing literature, for example the study by Lachmandas et al.

As correctly pointed out, others have indeed reported on rewiring of metabolism in the host upon <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. However, a major shortfall of the study by Lachmandas et al. is that all the experiments on PBMC or monocytes were performed using stimulation with an <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv lysate and not live virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> as in our study. In the Lachmandas et al. article, please refer to the paragraph entitled âStimulationâ under âMaterials and Methodsâ on page 2581 (Lachmandas et al., 2016). In addition, another study investigating the rewiring of metabolism in <italic>Mtb</italic> infected macrophages, Gleeson et al. (2016) irradiated (killed) <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv (indicated by âiH37Rvâ in Figure 1) or the attenuated strain H37Ra was used as indicated in the figure legends of Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 (Gleeson et al., 2016). The reason for infection using <italic>Mtb</italic> lysates, irradiated H37Rv, or attenuated H37Rv is that these strains/preparations are non-pathogenic and therefore the experiments can be conducted outside a BSL3 environment. For this reason, we have included dead (heat killed) <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv as control in our infection studies to demonstrate how the metabolic rewiring induced by live <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv differs to that of dead <italic>Mtb</italic> and to underscore the need to interpret findings from experiments using dead <italic>Mtb</italic> or lysate infected macrophages with caution.</p><p>Nonetheless, we appreciate the reviewers comment and to provide context to our study, we have now included a paragraph of existing literature (Introduction).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) All reviewers concurred that the overall readability and presentation your manuscript is poor.

However, we are having difficulty assessing which words are âjargonâ as we are using terminology that is customary to the bioenergetic field. We have carefully scrutinized our manuscript and identified words that could be perceived as âjargonâ including, but not limited to: Spare respiratory capacity (SRC), ATP-linked OCR, proton leak, non-mitochondrial respiration, glycolytic proton efflux rate (PER; glycoPER), ATP production rate, compensatory glycolytic proton efflux rate, maximum respiration (Max Resp), glycolytic reserve, metabolic plasticity, metabolic health, non-glycolytic extracellular acidification, bulk acidification, bioenergeic phenogram, energetic phenotype, quiescent phenotype, mitochondrial flexibility and dependancy. However, these words are well-established terms in the bioenergetic field (Abildgaard et al., 2014; Keuper et al., 2014; Lim et al., 2015; Pisani et al., 2018; Ryan et al., 2018; van der Windt et al., 2012) of which many are used in the Agilent Seahorse XF assay User Manuals: (https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/103344-400.pdf; https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/103592-400_Seahorse_XF_ATP_Rate_kit_User_Guide.pdf</p><p>https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/XF_Glycolysis_Stress_Test_Kit_User_Guide.pdf</p><p>https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/XF_Cell_Mito_Stress_Test_Kit_User_Guide.pdf</p><p>https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/XF_Palmitate_BSA_Substrate_Quickstart_Guide.pdf</p><p>https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/XF_Mito_Fuel_Flex_Test_Kit_User_Guide%20old.pdf</p><p>Regardless, we followed the reviewersâ advice and have now explained the assays and their parameters in much more detail in the subsection âExtracellular Flux Analysisâ. Furthermore we significantly improved Figure 1, which now includes equations defining how the parameters were calculated to improve readability.</p><p>âMethods are not described with sufficient detail and provide confusing information for example, different durations of infections 18 versus 10 hours (subsection âMetabolite extractionâ).â: Regarding the carbon-tracing experiments referred to by the reviewers in subsection âMetabolite extractionâ, we have now expanded the description to make this clearer. Briefly, the total infection time for the carbon-tracing experiments was 18 hours. However, we only allowed incorporation of the radiolabeled glucose in the last 8 hours of infection to limit the number of cycles through the TCA cycle into which the radiolabeled carbon was incorporated to facilitate carbon-tracing.</p><p>âBiological replicates, data analysis etc. are not clear.â: We thank the reviewers for the comments concerning the biological replicates and data analysis. However, in the original manuscript, we have indicated the number of independent experiments performed and the statistical analysis used in each figure legend to generate the p-values that were depicted in the Figure. Furthermore, in the original Materials and methods section, we have a paragraph entitled âStatistical analysisâ, where we indicated that each independent experiment was performed with a minimum of six biological replicates. This refers to all the assays and experiments conducted for the manuscript (subsection âProtein Quantification<bold>â</bold>). We have now added the description âbiological replicatesâ to our n values in the legend of each figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Experimental weaknesses include:</p><p>i) What proportion of cells remain uninfected?

Regards point (ii), will it be useful if you describe flux analysis with a lower MOI than that reported? Using the same MOI throughout the paper will give your claims more support.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these comments and have addressed the concerns below.</p><p>âi) What proportion of cells remain uninfected?â:The proportion of uninfected cells were determined by infecting macrophages with <italic>Mtb</italic>-GFP at the same MOIs and experimental conditions as used for the XF assays. Using bright field and fluorescence microscopy, we counted the uninfected and infected cells and determined the percentage of cells that were infected. The percentage of infected cells increased as the MOI was increased (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2E-G), from Â± 50% at an MOI of 1 to more than 80% at an MOI 5. Although the percentage of uninfected cells will contribute to the readout of the XF profiles, previous studies have demonstrated that lipids shed by intracellular mycobacteria, such as TDM and PIM2, spread via the endocytic network throughout the macrophage, and via exocytic vesicles to neighboring uninfected cells (Beatty et al., 2000; Xu et al., 1994) and can elicit the production of proinflammatory cytokines by these neighbouring cells (Rhoades et al., 2003). Consequently, the bioenergetic metabolism of the âby-standerâ uninfected cells will also be modulated. Thus, the profiles of increasing MOI are providing an overview of the bioenergetics at different stages of infection. We have explained this in the Results section.</p><p>âii) Were there any dead host cells (and did the proportion of these change with time)?â:The reviewers are correct. Some infected macrophages do die over the time of infection; however, as we allow the monocytes to naturally adhere to the base of the wells of the XF96 cell culture microplate prior to differentiation and infection, the dead macrophages will naturally lift from the surface of the wells. Prior to the XF run, the adhered cells are washed twice with XF media, thus removing the lifted dead cells prior to the XF run. Hence, the dead cells will not contribute to the average readout of the whole cellular population that is adhered to the base of the well. Furthermore, to mitigate the differences in the cell number that are adhered to the base of each well and the effects of these differing numbers on the basal respiration (OCR) or ECAR, we normalized the OCR and ECAR measurements of each well to the protein content of each well, which was determined after the XF run. This is reflected in the units of the Y-axis of the XF profiles.</p><p>âRegards point (ii)[â¦]â: When we investigated MOIs lower than 1, negligible differences were observed in the XF profiles between the uninfected and infected cells after 24 hours of infection. Longer periods of infection in the XF cell culture microplates are problematic as culturing the high density of infected macrophages in the confluent monolayer required for XF analysis would require changing the media every 3-4 hours. This will require removing the cells from the optimal 37Â°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> environment of the incubator on a regular basis to change the media and changing the media could increase the risk of lifting the <italic>Mtb</italic> infected cells. We seed the monocytes and differentiate them directly in the wells of the XF96 microtiter plate as we have previously experienced excessive loss of viable macrophages when they were differentiated and infected in a separate flask and then lifted to reanneal to the XF96 cell culture microplate. For these reasons, we have used a MOI of 1 as the lowest MOI investigated.</p><p>With reference to using the same MOI throughout the paper, we have used a MOI of 5 in all the XF profiles illustrated in the paper, with the exception of the results of the real-time ATP rate assay (Figure 5F and 5G). The XF profiles of lower MOIs of 1 and 2.5 are illustrated in the Supplementary information. The reason for using several MOIs in our experiments is that it substantially improves the critical assessment and interpretation of our data, which otherwise, would have been severely limited. Also, since multiple MOIâs represent multiple bacillary burden, we anticipated this to be an obvious question to many investigators in the microbial pathogenesis field. Lastly, we also wanted to demonstrate the sensitivity of the XF to detect differences observed in vitro between initial and more advanced stages of infection. Overall, we believe it represents good science.</p><p>âiii) Did you confirm that there were no extracellular organisms?â: Yes, we did indeed examined the presence of extracellular organisms. To remove any extracellular bacteria prior to the XF run, we removed the culture medium and washed the adhered infected macrophages twiRhoades et al., 2003ce with the XF media prior to adding the XF media in preparation for the XF run. This was also standard protocol with the XF run to ensure that all the plasma and culture media was removed from the well prior to the XF run. In response to the reviewersâ comment, we plated out the XF media after the two washes of the macrophages on 7H11 agar plates. Less than 200 CFU were obtained per well from the washes of the infected hMDMs (MOI 5), and less than 100 CFU per well from the washes of the infected THP-1 cells (MOI 5). Lower CFU counts were obtained at the lower MOIs. Also, to demonstrate that these extracellular mycobacteria do not contribute to the host OCR or ECAR, the washes were transferred to a separate XF cell culture microplate and a separate mitochondrial respiration assay was performed on any extracellular bacteria present in the washes. The OCR readings obtained were below 0 pmol/min and the ECAR readings were equivalent to 0 mpH/mol, and the extracellular bacteria did not respond to the sequential injections of oligomycin, FCCP, rotenone and antimycin A. Thus, the few extracellular bacteria remaining in the well do not contribute to the OCR of the macrophages during the XF run. We have now included these data in the revised manuscript (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) All reviewers raised concerns with the glycolysis effect and indicated that it needs to be characterized more carefully. Decreased glycolytic flux is supported by data shown in the histogram in Figure 3D. However, Figure 3C shows increased ECAR and a stronger ECAR increase after glucose addition for the Mtb-infected macrophages compared to uninfected control. This point needs to be clarified. Also, it would be important to confirm that the effects seen are due solely to the mycobacterial infected cells and not due to the addition of the glucose (also referring to the point above regards uninfected cells). Comparing AKT production/phosphorylation is important.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this discrepancy to our attention. Regrettably, we inadvertently inserted the incorrect ECAR XF profile in Figure 3C, hence, we appreciate the reviewers meticulous attention to detail. We have now included the correct XF profile in Figure 3C, which does correlate with the findings discussed in the manuscript as depicted in the histogram in Figure 3D.</p><p>As our manuscript is a resource article demonstrating the use of extracellular flux analysis to examine the bioenergetic metabolism of the <italic>Mtb</italic> infection of the macrophages, we have not investigated mechanisms inducing the observed modulations of the bioenergetic metabolism. For this reason, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer that it would be relevant to our manuscript to compare AKT production/phosphorylation. Lachmandas et al. examined which cells, receptors and regulators promoted the <italic>Mtb</italic>-induced switch to glycolysis in humans as the primary aim of their paper. Their investigations with dead <italic>Mtb</italic> lysate stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) found that the switch in host metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis in human PBMC was mediated <italic>in part</italic> through the activation of AKT-mTOR pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) More controls (that provide no measurable difference in the readout) are needed. Things like differences in the basal respiration rate need to be clarified. The effect of adding dead mycobacteria is unclear, why was this experiment necessary? Clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these comments, however we do not fully understand this concern. We assume the reviewers are referring to the small differences in the observed basal respiration between experiments. These small differences in basal respiration between experiments arise from the fact that we differentiate the monocytes into macrophages in each XF well rather than differentiating them in bulk, lifting the cells and seeding them into the XF wells. We did investigate this initially, but lifting the infected differentiated macrophages severely affected the viability and bioenergetics of the macrophages. For this reason, the differentiated uninfected macrophages are <italic>always</italic> run as a control in each XF run. Lastly, the XF96 is an extremely sensitive instrument that measures OCR in the range of picomoles (10<sup>-12</sup>) oxygen consumed per minute and ECAR in mpH change per minute, thus any small variations in the OCR or ECAR will be detected at a picomole and mpH level.</p><p>There is the further variable of the different donors of the PBMCs from which we isolate the monocytes to differentiate into hMDMs that will also contribute to small differences in basal respiration. As the numbers of monocytes required for the XF assays are very high (80 000 per well per XF96 cell culture microplate), it is not possible to use the same donor for all the experiments. To eliminate donor bias, we combine the monocytes from three different donors for each XF experiment. Donor variation is inevitable and beyond our control.</p><p>Several lines of evidence point to dead <italic>Mtb</italic> as an essential control and emphasizes the scientific rigour of our experimentation. Firstly, dead <italic>Mtb</italic> is not virulent as it is unable to produce and secrete virulence factors that cause disease, whereas live <italic>Mtb</italic> is virulent. Secondly, previous studies have used <italic>Mtb</italic> lysate (Lachmandas et al., 2016) or Î³-irradiated (dead) <italic>Mtb</italic> (Gleeson et al., 2016), to infect the macrophages, and obtained significantly different findings from our study. Hence, we included the dead <italic>Mtb</italic> control to illustrate the clear differences in the bioenergetic metabolism of macrophages infected with live <italic>Mtb</italic> or dead <italic>Mtb</italic>. Thus, using <italic>Mtb</italic> lysate or Î³-irradiated <italic>Mtb</italic> infected macrophages do not give an accurate representation of the metabolic modulations induced by infection with live <italic>Mtb</italic>. Therefore, caution needs to be exercised when interpreting results generated with infection with <italic>Mtb</italic> lysate and Î³-irradiated <italic>Mtb</italic>. As requested, we have elaborated on this further in the Introduction and Discussion section. Thirdly, we used the dead <italic>Mtb</italic> control to demonstrate that pharmacological killing of <italic>Mtb</italic> in the macrophages will not necessarily restore the bioenergetic metabolism of the macrophage back to that of the uninfected macrophage. Again, the logical conclusion is that remnants of dead <italic>Mtb</italic> cells are still capable of inducing a bioenergetic response in the macrophage, but distinctly from live <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
