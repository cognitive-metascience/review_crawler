It has long been assumed that all animal cells divide by a similar molecular mechanism, but growing evidence suggests that cytokinetic regulation in individual cell types has more variation than previously realized. In the four-cell <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryo, each blastomere has a distinct cell fate, specified by conserved pathways. Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute drug treatment, we identified cell-type-specific variation in the cytokinetic requirement for a robust formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>-dependent filamentous-actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton. In one cell (P2), this cytokinetic variation is cell-intrinsically regulated, whereas in another cell (EMS) this variation is cell-extrinsically regulated, dependent on both Src<sup>SRC-1</sup> signaling and direct contact with its neighbor cell, P2. Thus, both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms control cytokinetic variation in individual cell types and can protect against division failure when the contractile ring is weakened.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36204.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The successful division of one cell into two is essential for all organisms to live, grow and reproduce. For an animal cell, the nucleus – the compartment containing the genetic material – must divide before the surrounding material. The rest of the cell, called the cytoplasm, physically separates later in a process known as cytokinesis.</p><p>Cytokinesis in animal cells is driven by the formation of a ring in the middle of the dividing cell. The ring is composed of myosin motor proteins and filaments made of a protein called actin. The movements of the motor proteins along the filaments cause the ring to contract and tighten. This pulls the cell membrane inward and physically pinches the cell into two. For a long time, the mechanism of cytokinesis was assumed to be same across different types of animal cell, but later evidence suggested otherwise. For example, in liver, heat and bone cells, cytokinesis naturally fails during development to create cells with two or more nuclei. If a similar ‘failure’ happened in other cell types, it could lead to diseases such as cancers or blood disorders. This raised the question: what are the molecular mechanisms that allow cytokinesis to happen differently in different cell types?</p><p>Davies et al. investigated this question using embryos of the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> at a stage in their development when they consist of just four cells. The proteins forming the contractile ring in this worm are the same as those in humans. However, in the worm, the contractile ring can easily be damaged using chemical inhibitors or by mutating the genes that encode its proteins.</p><p>Davies et al. show that when the contractile ring was damaged, two of the four cells in the worm embryo still divided successfully. This result indicates the existence of new mechanisms to divide the cytoplasm that allow division even with a weak contractile ring. In a further experiment, the embryos were dissected to isolate each of the four cells. Davies et al. saw that one of the two dividing cells could still divide on its own, while the other cell could not. This shows that this new method of cytokinesis is regulated both by factors inherent to the dividing cell and by external signals from other cells. Moreover, one of these extrinsic signals was found to be a signaling protein that had previously been implicated in human cancers.</p><p>Future work will determine if these variations in cytokinesis between the different cell types found in the worm apply to humans too; and, more importantly from a therapeutic standpoint, if these new mechanisms exist in human cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytokinesis</kwd><kwd>C. elegans</kwd><kwd>Src kinase</kwd><kwd>cell intrinsic</kwd><kwd>cell extrinsic</kwd><kwd>actomyosin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001312</institution-id><institution>Charles H.

While it has long been assumed that all animal cells divide by a similar molecular mechanism, it is becoming increasingly clear that the functional regulation of cytokinesis has more diversity, or variation in mechanistic and regulatory pathways, than previously appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Herszterg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Guillot and Lecuit, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Founounou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Herszterg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Santis Puzzonia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Choudhary et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wheatley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Stopp et al., 2017</xref>). In many animals (including humans), specific cell types or cell lineages within the organism are programmed to fail in cytokinesis and become bi- or multi-nucleate (e.g. osteoclasts in bone, megakaryocytes in blood, cardiomyocytes in the heart, hepatocytes in the liver) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lacroix and Maddox, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Tormos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zimmet and Ravid, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duncan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Takegahara et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, in some cell types, cytokinesis failure occurs normally during development and/or homeostasis and, in other cell types, cytokinesis failure can be pathogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lacroix and Maddox, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Tormos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zimmet and Ravid, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duncan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Takegahara et al., 2016</xref>), indicating a high degree of cellular variation in both the regulation of cytokinesis and the consequences of cytokinesis failure.</p><p>As further support for cell-type-specific cytokinetic variation, genomic analysis has revealed that organism-wide mutations in cytokinesis genes are associated with cell-type-specific disruption of cell division in flies, fish, worms, rodents, and even humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bione et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Moulding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Vinciguerra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liljeholm et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sgrò et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Taniguchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Muzzi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Giansanti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Paw et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Menon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Morita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jackson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Di Cunto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">LoTurco et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackman et al., 2007</xref>). In human patients, genome-wide association studies have revealed that genomic mutations in cytokinesis genes lead to cell-type-specific division failure and cell- or tissue-type-specific pathologies. For example, an autosomal dominant mutation in the human kinesin-6 MKLP1, a protein thought to be essential for cytokinesis in all animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Glotzer, 2009</xref>), leads to congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liljeholm et al., 2013</xref>). These patients have multinucleated erythroblasts due to a failure in cytokinesis but are otherwise asymptomatic, indicating that cells in other tissues and organs divide successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liljeholm et al., 2013</xref>). Mutations in Citron Kinase are associated with cytokinesis failure specifically in neuronal precursor cells, leading to multinucleated neurons and microcephaly in mice, rats, and human patients, but the development of other tissues and organs is not grossly disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sgrò et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Di Cunto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Harding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shaheen et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, a mouse knockout of the microtubule and actin-binding protein GAS2L3 dies shortly after birth due to specific defects in cardiomyocyte cytokinesis during heart development, but the overall development of other tissues is not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Stopp et al., 2017</xref>). These findings suggest that cell-type-specific mechanisms modulate the diversity of cytokinesis in animal cells, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie this diversity are poorly understood, even at a basic level.</p><p>There are two fundamental cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms that could underlie cytokinetic variation: cell-intrinsic regulation (e.g. cell polarity, inherited proteins and RNAs) and cell-extrinsic regulation (e.g. cell-fate signaling, cell-cell adhesions). There is some evidence in support of each model. In support of cell-intrinsic regulation, we and others found that cell polarity proteins can promote robust cytokinesis during asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jordan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cabernard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Roth et al., 2015</xref>), and asymmetrically inherited RNA granules in germ lineage cells contain a key splicing regulator involved in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Audhya et al., 2005</xref>). In support of extrinsic regulation, cell-cell adhesion junctions have been implicated in regulating contractile ring constriction in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Guillot and Lecuit, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Founounou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Herszterg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bourdages and Maddox, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pinheiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lázaro-Diéguez and Müsch, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Daniel et al., 2018</xref>), and cell-fate signaling molecules, such as Wnt and Src, have been linked to cytokinesis in some contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fumoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kasahara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Soeda et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic regulatory mechanisms could contribute to cel- type-specific diversity in cytokinesis.</p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> four-cell embryo is a powerful, optically clear system to probe the mechanisms of cell-type-specific variation in cytokinesis. All four-cell divisions occur within a ~20 min time frame, and cytokinesis can easily be monitored in each individual blastomere, or cell within the embryo, by light microscopy. Worm development follows a defined cell lineage pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>), and the cell-fate patterning of each blastomere in the four-cell embryo is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rose and Gönczy, 2014</xref>). At the four-to-eight-cell division, each of the four cells are already specified to form distinct cell linages by conserved, well-characterized cell-fate signaling pathways (e.g. Notch/Delta, Wnt, Src; for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rose and Gönczy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Priess, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bowerman, 1995</xref>]). The two-cell embryo divides to form two anterior blastomeres, ABa and ABp, and two posterior blastomeres, EMS and P2. While the anterior blastomeres are born as identical sisters, activation of Notch family receptors in ABp by a Delta-like ligand on the surface of P2 induces ABp to adopt a different cell fate than ABa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mickey et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bowerman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mango et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Moskowitz et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Shelton and Bowerman, 1996</xref>). The two posterior blastomeres, EMS and P2, are born from an asymmetric cell division and cell-cell contact-mediated Wnt and Src signaling between P2 and EMS promote asymmetric cell division and cell fate specification in both cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Goldstein, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rocheleau et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Thorpe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bei et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Schierenberg, 1987</xref>).

We used fast-acting temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles to inactivate two cytokinesis proteins essential for contractile ring constriction in the one-cell embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davies et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Liu et al., 2010</xref>): the motor myosin-II (NMY-2 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, hereafter myosin-II<sup>NMY-2</sup>) and the diaphanous formin CYK-1 (hereafter formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>). We identified cell-type-specific variation in four-cell embryos in the molecular requirement for formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>, but not myosin-II<sup>NMY-2</sup>. Specifically, we found that while cytokinesis in two blastomeres, ABa and ABp, is sensitive to reduced formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity, cytokinesis in the other two blastomeres, EMS and P2, is resistant to defects in formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>-mediated F-actin assembly. Likewise, cytokinesis in ABa and ABp cells is sensitive to treatment with low doses of LatrunculinA (LatA), a drug that block F-actin polymerization, whereas cytokinesis in EMS and P2 cells is resistant to LatA. We further found that EMS and P2 cells have greatly reduced F-actin levels at the division plane upon formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> disruption, despite considerable and often successful equatorial constriction during cytokinesis, suggesting that cytokinesis in these cells is less dependent on F-actin in the contractile ring. To determine if EMS- and P2-specific variation in cytokinesis regulation is due to cell-intrinsic or -extrinsic regulation, we isolated individual blastomeres by embryo microdissection and examined the effect on cytokinesis when kept in isolation or when sister blastomeres were paired. We found that P2 cells are protected against cytokinesis failure after formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> disruption even when isolated from the embryo, indicating cell-intrinsic regulation of cytokinesis, whereas EMS cells are not protected against cytokinesis failure upon isolation. EMS cytokinetic protection is restored upon pairing with P2, but not with ABa/ABp cells, indicating that cytokinesis in EMS is subject to cell-extrinsic regulation by P2. Finally, we found that cytokinesis in EMS is dependent on the proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinase Src<sup>SRC-1</sup>, a critical player in EMS cell fate specification that is known to be activated in EMS by direct contact with P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bei et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arata et al., 2010</xref>).

In <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant one-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos at 16°C, F-actin is present in the contractile ring (although at lower levels than in control embryos) but, upon upshift to 26°C, linear F-actin is no longer visible and cytokinesis fails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davies et al., 2014</xref>]). It is possible that in EMS and/or P2, another formin-related protein could function redundantly with formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> to ensure F-actin assembly during cytokinesis in these specific cells. Transcriptional analysis has revealed there are two other formin-related genes (<italic>inft-2</italic> and <italic>frl-1)</italic> expressed at the four-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hashimshony et al., 2015</xref>), but no formin-related gene is significantly over-expressed in either EMS or P2, relative to in ABa or ABp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Tintori et al., 2016</xref>).

Together, our data demonstrate that both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms modulate cytokinesis in individual blastomeres in the absence of robust F-actin levels in the contractile ring.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we used thermogenetics, drug treatment, and embryo microdissection to probe the mechanisms of cell-type-based variation in the regulation of cytokinesis among individual blastomeres within the four-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo. We found cell-type-specific differences in both the functional levels and temporal window of activity required for formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity, but not myosin-II<sup>NMY-2</sup> activity, during cytokinesis. We found that, similar to in the one-cell embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davies et al., 2014</xref>), formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> inhibition resulted in cytokinesis failure in ABa and ABp blastomeres. In contrast to the one-cell embryo and ABa/ABp cells, both EMS and P2 blastomeres were protected against cytokinesis failure and divided successfully with consistent frequency upon inhibition of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> and in the absence of a robust F-actin contractile ring. This is not likely due to an F-actin-independent role for formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>, as we found cytokinesis in EMS and P2 was also more resistant to LatA, a pharmaceutical inhibitor of F-actin polymerization, than cytokinesis in ABa/ABp. Cell isolation and blastomere pairing experiments revealed that P2 is protected against cytokinesis failure due to cell-intrinsic regulation and independent of contact with other blastomeres. In contrast, we found that EMS is protected against cytokinesis failure by extrinsic regulation due to direct cell-cell contact with P2 and Src<sup>SRC-1</sup> mediated cell-fate signaling. This work establishes the early <italic>C. elegans</italic> four-cell embryo as a system to study cytokinetic diversity and suggests that, at least in the early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo, both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms contribute to cell-type-specific cytokinetic diversity. This finding leads to three outstanding questions: First, how can cells divide in the absence of robust F-actin levels in the contractile ring? Second, what are the cell and molecular mechanism(s) that contribute to cytokinetic diversity? Third, what is the advantage of specifically protecting these cells against cytokinesis failure?</p><p>Although we could not detect enriched F-actin at the contractile ring in EMS or P2 in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> embryos at the restrictive temperature, we assume that a ‘normal’, although F-actin-poor, contractile ring still forms in the cells that divide successfully. In our hands, relative to the one-cell embryo, contractile ring F-actin levels are reduced at the four-cell stage and fluorescent signals from other cortical F-actin populations (such as the cell-cell junctions) make it much more challenging to specifically quantify F-actin levels at the contractile ring in individual cells within multicellular embryos. Thus, we assume that the contractile ring signal in EMS and P2 is simply too dim for us to detect over background signals from other cortical F-actin populations in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutants. In EMS and P2 cells that divide successfully upon formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> inactivation, contractile ring constriction progresses more slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that these cells are utilizing a sub-optimal contractile ring. Indeed, myosin<sup>NMY-2</sup> is still essential for cytokinesis in EMS and P2, indicating a ‘normal’ constricting actomyosin contractile ring is likely driving division in these blastomeres. Nonetheless, it is clear that, unlike one-cell embryos and ABa/ABp cells, EMS and P2 blastomeres are still somehow able to divide successfully with a substantially weakened F-actin contractile ring, whether weakened by inhibition of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> or application of low doses of Latrunculin A.</p><p>An obvious distinction of these more robustly dividing cells is that EMS and P2 divide asymmetrically, whereas ABa and ABp divide symmetrically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rose and Gönczy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arata et al., 2010</xref>). In the one-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo, we previously found that anterior-posterior cell polarity and the PAR proteins are essential for robust cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jordan et al., 2016</xref>). The PAR proteins localize to opposing cortical domains in P2 but are not obviously asymmetrically distributed in EMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arata et al., 2010</xref>). Little is known about cell polarity establishment and/or maintenance in EMS, but in P2, cell polarity is cell-intrinsically established, though proper orientation of polarity relative to the spindle is dependent on cell-extrinsic signaling from EMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arata et al., 2010</xref>). It is possible that cell polarity and the asymmetrically functioning PAR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jordan et al., 2016</xref>) or G-protein-coupled receptors, which have been implicated in cytokinesis in asymmetrically dividing <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cabernard et al., 2010</xref>), could promote cytokinesis specifically in EMS and/or P2. Unfortunately, cell polarity in these later divisions is difficult to study, due to the lack of available conditional tools to disrupt cell polarity proteins specifically in four-cell embryos, while allowing normal cell polarity establishment and maintenance in asymmetrically dividing parental cells in the one- and two-cell embryos (i.e. fast-acting ts PAR mutants). While we found that whole embryo PAR protein disruption (by <italic>par-6(RNAi)</italic>) eliminates protection of cytokinesis in EMS and P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>), under these conditions, normal cell fate specification of the four-cell embryo is lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowerman et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, we cannot distinguish between a specific role for cell polarity during cytokinesis in EMS and P2 cells from a non-specific effect of completely changing the cell-fate patterning of the parental lineages.</p><p>One intriguing possibility is that other non-canonical (contractile ring-independent) mechanisms facilitate cytokinesis in EMS and/or P2 such as cytofission or polar cortical relaxation. In mammalian cultured cells, traction-mediated cytofission, driven by daughter cell elongation, crawling, and cell-substrate adhesion, can promote cell division in the absence of an actomyosin contractile ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Choudhary et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wheatley et al., 1997</xref>). Cytofission is not likely to be the main driver of cytokinesis in these cells since, even upon blastomere isolation, we do not observe cell crawling behavior or increased daughter cell elongation in EMS or P2. Another possible driver of cytokinesis outside of the contractile ring is polar cortical relaxation, in which reduced cortical contractility outside of the division plane in the polar regions of the cell is proposed to facilitate actomyosin contractile ring constriction at the cell equator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wolpert, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kunda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rodrigues et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mangal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lewellyn et al., 2010</xref>). Polar cortical relaxation has been proposed to be regulated by Aurora A kinase activity, astral microtubules, and PP1-dependent phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kunda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rodrigues et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mangal et al., 2018</xref>). Perhaps in EMS and/or P2, one or more of these cortical polar relaxation pathways outside of the contractile ring is upregulated to ensure robust cytokinesis in these blastomeres.</p><p>In EMS, we found that cytokinesis is extrinsically protected and this protection is correlated with cell-fate signaling from P2. Thus, it is possible that extrinsic cell fate signaling has direct downstream effects on the cytokinetic machinery in EMS. Both cell fate specification and asymmetric cell division in EMS are downstream of two partially redundant signaling pathways that influence similar downstream targets and depend on cell-cell contact between P2 and EMS: Wnt/Frizzled and Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK)/Src signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Goldstein, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rocheleau et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Thorpe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bei et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Schierenberg, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sugioka and Sawa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berkowitz and Strome, 2000</xref>).

In parallel, transmembrane-domain-containing RTK<sup>MES-1</sup> on P2 stimulates the same RTK<sup>MES-1</sup> on EMS in trans, promoting Src<sup>SRC-1</sup> activation in both cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bei et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sugioka and Sawa, 2010</xref>). Indeed, we found that both a high cell-cell contact area and proper spindle orientation, two indicators of successful cell fate signaling from P2 to EMS, are highly correlated with successful cytokinesis in EMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), and that depletion of Src<sup>SRC-1</sup> specifically causes division failure in the EMS cell, but not the P2 cell. In support of cell-fate signaling in cytokinetic diversity, both Wnt and Src-family kinase signaling have been implicated in both positive and negative regulations of cytokinesis in other cell contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Santis Puzzonia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fumoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kasahara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Soeda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kamranvar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avanzi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sánchez-Bailón et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ikeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jungas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kakae et al., 2017</xref>), and in human cancer cell lines Wnt5a, its receptor Frizzled<sup>Fz2</sup>, as well as a mediator of Wnt signaling, Dishevelled<sup>Dvl2</sup>, all localize to the midbody at the division plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fumoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kikuchi et al., 2010</xref>).

The <italic>C. elegans</italic> P lineage forms the germline and cells within that lineage (including P2) inherit distinct levels of cellular organelles, cell polarity proteins, and transcriptional regulators compared to the other three blastomeres in the four-cell embryo.

One possibility is that germline-specific inherited factors promote cytokinetic robustness in that lineage. For example, CAR-1 is an Sm-like protein essential for cytokinesis in the one-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo and is specifically inherited in the P lineage, including the P2 cell, via association with germline enriched non-membrane-bound, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) organelles called P-granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Audhya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Squirrell et al., 2006</xref>).

Additionally, both EMS and P2 undergo asymmetric cell divisions with each daughter cell inheriting specific organelles, transcriptional regulators, and other factors, so these blastomeres may undergo more selective pressure to develop protective mechanisms to ensure successful asymmetric cell division.</p><p>Together, our data show that both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms contribute to cytokinetic diversity and promote robust cytokinesis when the contractile ring is weakened in specific cell types within the four-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo. Due to the similarities between cell fate signaling and cytokinetic machinery between worms and humans, we predict that similar regulation contributes to cytokinetic variation within cells of the human body to promote sensitivity or resistance to cytokinesis failure and therefore potentially mediate the onset or prevention of cell-type-specific pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain maintenance</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> were maintained on standard nematode growth media (NGM) plates seeded with OP50 <italic>E. coli</italic> as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Cytokinetic phenotypes were scored using maximum projections of the Z-sections collected over the course of cell division. Cells were only scored if imaging began before anaphase onset and continued until the next cell cycle, when the daughter cell nuclei underwent anaphase and/or division failure. For the phenotypic analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, cells were binned into five cytokinetic phenotypes; ‘completes’=cell under observation divided successfully and the contractile ring remained closed when the daughter cell nuclei entered the next division cycle; ‘fails, full constriction’=contractile ring constriction continues until no observable gap is seen with the PH::GFP membrane marker, but then regresses and cytokinesis fails; ‘fails, partial constriction’=the cytokinetic furrow tip ingresses such that a double membrane forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lewellyn et al., 2010</xref>) but the contractile ring does not close before regressing; ‘fails, weak constriction,’ slight furrow ingression occurs, with weak membrane deformation, before regressing; ‘fails, no constriction,’ no furrowing or contractile ring ingression is observed following anaphase onset. Maximum intensity projections of GFP::PH and H2B::mCherry were used to monitor the time of anaphase onset and cytokinetic phenotype. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, contractile ring diameter was measured by creating an X-Z projection so the whole contractile ring could be observed. For each time point, the Z-plane at which the ring diameter was widest was used for this measurement. Contractile ring diameter was plotted as a percentage of the initial diameter (at metaphase) over time. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, the cell volume of isolated blastomeres was estimated by measuring the maximum cross-sectional area of each blastomere prior to anaphase (during mitosis), then calculating the radius and volume, assuming that the cells are spherical. Radius = √(Area/π); Volume = (4πr<sup>3</sup>)/3. The volume of cells in intact embryos was calculated as the sum of 23 or more 1 μm Z-section volumes, by measuring the cell area at each Z-plane. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, the area of contact between EMS and P2 was estimated assuming a circular contact interface and measuring the diameter of this interface in a maximum projection of multiple Z-sections, in the frame prior to anaphase onset in EMS. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, the EMS spindle angle was defined in the X-Y plane by drawing a line through the two chromosome masses in the first frame after anaphase onset in the EMS cell; this angle was measured relative to the long axis of the EMS-P2 doublet.</p><p>For the quantitative image analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, F-actin levels in the one-cell embryo were analyzed using the maximum or sum intensity projection images of a four optical slice Z-section through the cell cortex. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, F-actin levels in individual blastomeres in the four-cell embryo were analyzed from a Z-section through entire embryo using a maximum intensity projection (rather than a sum projection) to (1) increase the enriched cortical signal (where F-actin is localized), (2) reduce the effect of cell volume and position within the embryo on the measurements, and (3) to reduce the contribution of fluorescence signals analyzed from cytoplasm, cell-cell junctions, and adjacent cells. Line scans were 30.83 μm (P0 cells) 17.13 μm (EMS, ABa, and ABp cells) or 13.70 μm (P2 cells) long by 11.99 μm (P0 cells) or 3.42 μm (EMS, ABa, ABp, and P2 cells) wide, along the cell length perpendicular to the division plane. When cell polarity could be observed (in P0, EMS, and P2), the line was always oriented in the anterior to posterior direction. These line scans were normalized by subtracting the average of the initial and final 4.11 μm. Graphs showing the average fluorescence intensity at the division plane use the average value of the central 4.11 μm region of these line scans. Line scans were 13.70 μm long by 3.43 μm wide, along the cell length perpendicular to the division plane. When cell polarity could be observed (EMS and P2), the line was always oriented in the anterior to posterior direction. These line scans were normalized by subtracting the average value for a line scan adjacent to the embryo. Graphs showing the average fluorescence intensity at the division plane use the average value of the central 2.74 μm region of these line scans. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, accumulation of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>::eGFP was analyzed using a Z-series maximum intensity projection to select for the signal from the cortex next to the coverslip. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>::eGFP was analyzed using a Z-series sum intensity projection through the cell to measure the total levels of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>::eGFP at the division plane (including cytoplasmic signal). In multicellular <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, we prefer maximum over sum intensity projection analysis to quantify fluorescence intensity differences, especially for cortically enriched proteins (e.g. formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>::eGFP, F-actin). Accurately comparing fluorescence intensity levels in the multicellular four-cell embryo is more challenging than in the one-cell embryo because: (1) individual cells within the four-cell embryo vary in both their position within the four-cell embryo and in their axis orientation during cell division (ABa and ABp divide perpendicular to the long embryo axis whereas EMS and P2 divide parallel to this axis); (2) there is rotational variation of individual embryos relative to the coverslip in every image series; (3) individual cells within the four-cell embryo are of different volume and thus occupy different numbers of Z-sections within the image stack, (4) signals from adjacent cells contribute differently to the fluorescence intensity measured for each cell within the four-cell embryo, and (5) formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>::eGFP is largely enriched at the cell cortex, but also occupies the cell cytoplasm. These issues impact sum projection analysis to a much greater extent than maximum projection analysis and in our opinion, render sum projection analysis less reliable for measuring the levels of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>::eGFP (or other cortical proteins) at the contractile ring in the four-cell embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>CRISPR</title><p>Formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>::eGFP expressing worms were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 to tag the endogenous <italic>cyk-1</italic> gene locus using a method described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dickinson et al., 2015</xref>).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Cell-intrinsic and extrinsic control of cytokinetic plasticity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Mohan Balasubramanian) and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers found the thermogenetics approach very interesting and also believe that the cell-type specific function of formin as novel and exciting. However, some major concerns were raised, which are reproduced verbatim below. In short, I see five key points that need consideration and addressing. I believe the suggested experiments may alter your conclusions significantly and may take well over two months to complete (our limit for revisions) and hence our decision to not consider it further.</p><p>However, if you are able to address the key points that I list below, we will be happy to consider a new manuscript from you. This we expect will move your story from being descriptive to mechanistic.</p><p>Main points to address: Many of these points have been raised by two or all of the reviewers.</p><p>1) Cyk1 ts mutant, whether it is defective for actin assembly at 15C, whether Cyk1 has an actin independent function. (raised by reviewer 2)..</p><p>2) Accuracy of quantitation approach of actin levels, use of other markers and other considerations raised by reviewers 2 and 3.</p><p>3) The strength of evidence on whether other formins are dispensable for cytokinesis in the 4 cell embryo (all reviewers).</p><p>4) Links between polarity proteins and cell type specific cytokinesis (raised by 2 and 3).</p><p>5) Links between Wnt/Src and cell type specific cytokinesis (reviewers 1 and 2).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The process of physical separation of two cells, Cytokinesis, is regulated by numerous cell autonomous and non-autonomous cues. While constriction of an equatorial actomyosin network powers plasma membrane closure, the ability to regulate its spatiotemporally varies among cell types. In this work the authors present a thorough illustration of this principle in 4 cell stage of <italic>C.elegans</italic>. Using fast acting temperature sensitive alleles the authors show that cell fate influences the ability of a cell type to withstand Formin and actin perturbation. This is regulated both in a cell intrinsic and extrinsic fashion requiring neighbouring cell contacts.</p><p>The methodology and presentation of data is undoubtedly impressive. However, several conclusions appear to be an over-estimates the data. The text is well written yet offers little information on the process of cytokinesis and focuses almost exclusively on its outcome and failure. The authors on several occasions make categorical statements that at least to me appear inconclusive.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>1) Figure 3-figure supplement 1</p><p>&quot;This suggests that another formin-related protein is not compensating for loss of formin CYK-1 activity&quot;</p><p>I concur that none of the formins at least individually show a strong synthetic defect with CYK-1ts. However that doesn't rule out the possibility that formins may act synergistically. Therefore, the conclusive statement doesn't stand merit.</p><p>2) &quot;This suggests that EMS-P2 cell-cell contact mediates cell-extrinsic cues that protect against cytokinesis failure due to forminCYK-1 disruption in EMS&quot;.</p><p>The set of observations leading to this particular conclusion involves examining EMS-P2 pair after CYK-1 inactivation. Currently, it is not possible therefore to distinguish between the specific requirements of P2 versus requirement of an unspecified neighbouring cell. Whether the ABp-EMS pair would behave similarly cannot be hypothesised. Therefore the conclusion, I believe, is the presence of a neighbouring cell. Unless the authors prove or show specific mechanisms originating from P2, the current conclusion seems a stretch.</p><p>3) The Cell-extrinsic vs intrinsic angle indeed adds a dimension to this work. One would be curious to know, particularly in the EMS, whether the myosin-II ts yields an expected phenotype.</p><p>4) Figure 5.</p><p>I am unable to follow the logic here clearly. The spindle morphology has a direct impact on cytokinesis (beyond its spatial positioning). Spindles are therefore a cause of any cytokinesis defect under study. Proper spindle alignment (Figure 5E), does not guarantee successful cytokinesis. In CYK-1 ts, the distribution is visibly wider with some cases of proper spindle alignment and yet cytokinesis fails. I agree cases of successful cytokinesis seems to be correlative to proper spindle alignment. But this as a whole is incomplete and inconclusive. The authors do not make an attempt to conclude this section and one fails to see what exactly the authors allude to here.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript reports the cell-type dependent phenotypes of a temperature-sensitive allele of cyk-1 formin in 4-cell stage <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos. Inactivation of this f-actin nucleator during the first cell division by temperature upshift results in highly penetrant cytokinesis failure. Interestingly, while division of ABa and ABp cells was strongly inhibited by a similar temperature upshift during 4 cell stage, P2 and EMS divisions were more resistant and even at 26°C (the highest temperature that allows robust cell divisions in the wild type embryos) about 30-50% of these divisions completed successfully. Further, by blastomere isolation and recombination experiments, the authors revealed that cytokinesis of the EMS cell with reduced CYK-1 activity depends on the cell-cell contact between the EMS and P2 cells while the P2 division is independent of the contact with other cells. Based on these observations, the authors conclude that both the cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms protect against division failure due to defective contractile ring.</p><p>Establishment of an experimental system that allows further study of cell-type dependent variation in the mechanism of cytokinesis is a highly valuable achievement. However, there are major shortfalls in the current manuscript as below.</p><p>1) The authors implicitly assume that 1) the temperature sensitivity of cytokinesis failure is derived of the temperature sensitive inactivation of CYK-1 (ts) mutant protein and 2) the levels of residual CYK-1 activity after temperature upshit are invariable across the four different cell types (or completely inactivated in all the four cells). However, neither of these assumptions have been confirmed.</p><p>In Davies (2014), they compared CYK-1 FH1FH2C fragments with and without the L1015H mutation found in the cyk-1(ts) allele and showed that this mutation inactivates the in vitro actin polymerizing activity at 25°C. However, it remained unclear whether the CYK-1 mutant is active at 15°C or not (this actually should have been examined at the publication of the 2014 paper). Thus, currently, we can't exclude the possibility that the CYK-1 L1015H mutant protein is inactive at 15°C as well, and the mutant cell can complete cytokinesis at 15°C, but not at higher temperature, because of the presence of an unknown redundant pathway whose activity is intrinsically temperature-sensitive. If this was the case, the cell-type dependent ts phenotypes would not be reflecting the variable responses to the defective actin polymerisation but be indicating the variable activities of this redundant pathway.</p><p>Even if the temperature-sensitive cytokinesis failure of cyk-1(ts) was caused by the temperature-sensitive activity of the mutant protein, currently, there is no direct evidence that the cellular CYK-1 activity is inactivated uniformly across the four cell types. The cell type specificity might be caused by the variable level of the residual activity of CYK-1. If so, observed data should be interpreted as indicating the variations in a cellular mechanism for the expression of the CYK-1 activity, rather than the plasticity against the defective contractile ring.</p><p>2) The manuscript is rather descriptive and misses clear insight into the molecular mechanisms. In Jordan (2016), the authors reported the synthetic effects between the cyk-1(ts) and depletion of PAR proteins. Are the expression levels/cortical localization of the PAR proteins in the 4 cell types consistent with the cell type dependent phenotypes in cyk-1(ts) embryos? Does inactivation of the WNT or SRC signalling affect cytokinesis of the cyk-1(ts) mutant EMS cell?</p><p>3) Data about the f-actin levels in the cleavage furrow (Figure 3) are not convincing. About 50~70% of the cyk-1(ts) mutant EMS and P2 cells fail cytokinesis while 30~50% complete it. The successful cells might have more robust contractile ring than the unsuccessful ones. Successful cells and failed cells should be analyzed separately as the author did in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The mechanisms of cytokinesis remain elusive despite decades of work. The lack of resolution of a universal mechanism may stem in part from the employment of a wide range of model cell types. It is unclear whether reported differences reflect cell-type specific distinctions or a general absence of redundant mechanisms in some systems. Davies and colleagues compared the molecular requirements for cytokinesis of several cells in the early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo. They combined the well-characterized fate specification of the cells with powerful, time-resolved perturbations of major conserved cytokinesis proteins via temperature sensitive mutant alleles. The manuscript is a technical tour-de-force, with exquisite cell manipulation experiments in addition to temperature shift work with intact embryos. It is exceptionally comprehensively referenced, and will set a new standard for the field. That said, since the authors are not able to resolve the problem of how certain cells divide following strong reduction of F-actin by CYK-1 (ts) upshift, I recommend a finite list of things to try and to consider. I feel confident that after these concerns are addressed, this manuscript will be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>1a) F-actin levels and distribution need to be quantified and presented for the AB lineage, comparing control and formin ts shifted embryos.</p><p>1b) The lack of an effect of targeting other formins is not fully satisfying, since no positive control is provided to ensure that they are depleted. One potential way to augment the exploration of these other formins is to consult a recent comparative transcriptomics study that may be able to verify which formins are expressed in the various early blastomeres (Tintori et al., Dev. Cell. 2016).</p><p>1c) Have the authors verified their analysis of F-actin levels using a second, distinct F-actin probe (LifeAct or the ABD of moesin)? It seems possible that these probes detect slightly different sub-populations of F-actin. I do not expect the authors to introduce fluorescently-labeled phalloidin or recombinant G-actin into embryos to distinguish different F-actin pools as has been done (see for example Burkel, von Dassow and Bement, Cytoskeleton 2007). The authors could label a non-formin-nucleated pool with a GFP-actin (Chai, Ou and colleagues, Nature Protocols, 2012).</p><p>1d) The authors should examine the localization of fluorescently-tagged CYK-1 during cytokinesis of the 4 cells they study.</p><p>2) In cases where cytokinesis is more successful than expected (insensitive cells), is initiation late?

Is there compensation for the loss of function by an increase in things jiggling around? Similarly, why is shifting earlier not always worse (i.e. Figure 2B, EMS and P2, formin mutant)? Are un-scored embryos dying and scored, live ones less severely affected somehow?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms promote cell-type specific cytokinetic diversity&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor), Mohan Balasubramanian (Reviewing Editor), and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers have raised a number of points and I have compiled the list of essential revisions below. The points raised do not require any additional experiments (unless you already have new data), but I would encourage you to state the conclusions without exaggeration and explain all of the points raised below satisfactorily.</p><p>In the discussion between reviewers, point 5 was emphasised as being important by ALL three reviewers.</p><p>1) Unfortunately, our suggestion of repeating an in vitro experiment to check the actin polymerization-promoting activity of the mutant version of CYK-1 at 16°C was neglected (or not presented). However, the authors measured the levels of F-actin in the contractile ring in the mutant embryos. Since the readout of this assay is the influence of the formin mutation on the complex cellular process of F-actin polymerization, it can also address our question though only indirectly. Anyway, irrespective of cell types and probes, the furrow F-actin levels in cyk-1(ts) mutant embryos at 16 °C were lower than those in wildtype embryos at 16 °C (Figure 4E, Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and Figure 4—figure supplement 3B). This suggests that CYK-1 L1015H mutant protein is not fully functional as the wildtype protein, as the authors admitted in the letter of rebuttal. However, although I am afraid that I might have just overlooked, I could not find any mention about this fact, which is important for the readers to understand the technical and conceptual limitation of the authors' approach, in the main text.</p><p>In the rebuttal, the authors wrote, &quot;we have now measured the levels of F-actin in the contractile ring at both permissive and restrictive temperatures (16°C and 26°C) in control and formin cyk-1(ts) mutant embryos&quot;. However, I couldn't find any data for the ring F-actin levels in wildtype embryos at the restrictive temperature. Knowing now that CYK-4 ts mutant protein is not fully functional even at the permissive temperature, we can't exclude the possibility that the cytokinesis phenotype by acute temperature upshift might be triggered by acute inactivation of an unknown redundant mechanism for actin polymerization, which might be responsible for protecting the EMS and P2 cells from cytokines failure. In case of Figure 4E 'P2 cells', for example, drop of F-actin levels in cyk-1(ts) embryos from ~3 to ~0 by temperature upshift could be due to a) further inactivation of the mutant CYK-1 protein or b) inactivation of an unknown factor that contributes to the ring actin polymerisation. Data about F-actin levels in the wildtype embryos will be helpful for discriminating these possibilities. If the temperature upshift didn't affect the F-actin levels in the wildtype embryos or promoted it, this would provide a strong support for scenario a). On the contrary, if the temperature upshift drops the F-actin levels in the wildtype embryos from ~6 (16°C) to ~3 (26°C) or lower, it would be reasonable to conclude that the scenario b) is more likely.</p><p>2) I am afraid that I might be completely wrong, but I guess that the authors might already have the data of F-actin levels in wildtype embryos at 26°C since this is a very basic control. Whichever the results were, with the new data of the latrunculin A-sensitivity, the authors' key discovery in the current manuscript that the EMS and P2 cells are protected against cytokinesis failure due to the perturbed actin cytoskeleton will not be affected. Depending on the results, the authors might need to revise their basic assumption that the temperature shift causes a phenotype by acutely inactivating the mutant protein with a 'fast-acting ts mutation', on which they have been relying in previous publications. However, it is highly unnatural if the data of F-actin levels in wildtype embryos at 26°C is not shown. I strongly recommend showing the data of the F-actin levels in wildtype embryos at 26°C in at least one of Figure 4E, Figure 4—figure supplement 1C or Figure 4—figure supplement 3B (or Figure 1—figure supplement 1 although this is not really ideal), and properly discuss their implications on the possible mechanism for the acute induction of cytokinesis failure by temperature shift.</p><p>3) Figure 4—figure supplement 2C 'EMS'</p><p>A light blue half circle, probably derived from the markers of the graph points, is overlaid on a cartoon of a 6-cell stage embryo.</p><p>4) Figure 3—figure supplement 1</p><p>If we simply compare the control P2 cells (30 completion vs 40 failure, total n=70) with the inft-2(RNAi) (27 completion vs 14 failure, total n=41) by Fisher's exact test, the p-value will be 0.030. By Pearson's chi square test, it will be 0.032. This might be implying that inft-2, which is expressed at the 4-cell stage, might have an inhibitory role in the ring F-actin polymerization in the P2 cells although this is perfectly consistent with the authors' statement &quot;we found that individual depletion of the other formin-related proteins did not decrease the frequency cytokinesis failure in any of the 4 blastomeres in formin cyk-1(ts) mutants.&quot; These simple calculations might not be appropriate for a complex dataset such as in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, to which care about multiple comparisons has to be paid, and the authors might have performed proper corrections, which might have made it &gt;0.05, the significance level used in other figures.

We found that contractile ring F-actin levels were lower in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant embryos than in control embryos at 16ºC (permissive temperature), and contractile ring F-actin levels were undetectable in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant embryos at 26ºC (restrictive temperature). This suggests the <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant is indeed temperature sensitive for formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>-mediated F-actin polymerization at 26ºC and, despite providing sufficient formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity to support organismal viability and germline function (Jordan et al., 2016), is not fully wildtype at 16ºC. To address these overall reviewer concerns in a different way, we also targeted F-actin polymerization independent of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity, by treating embryos with a pharmaceutical inhibitor of F-actin (Latrunculin A). These new results support our original hypothesis that the EMS and P2 cells are protected against cytokinesis failure when the actin cytoskeleton is weakened, and they are now included in this revised manuscript. For more details, please see also our responses to individual reviewer comments about both points below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The strength of evidence on whether other formins are dispensable for cytokinesis in the 4 cell embryo (all reviewers).</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have now added references about the expression of other formin-related genes and adapted the text as suggested by the reviewers. The diaphanous formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> is the only formin shown to have a role in assembling contractile ring F-actin during cytokinesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, there are two other formin-related proteins expressed in 4-cell stage embryos: FRL-1 and INFT-2 (Hashimshony et al., 2015). Single cell RNAseq data from individual blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo revealed that none of the worm formin-related genes, including <italic>cyk-1,</italic> are significantly enriched in either EMS or P2, compared to in ABa or ABp cells (Tintori et al., 2016). Our mini-RNAi screen for additional formin-related proteins that might compensate for loss of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity was done at restrictive temperature (26ºC) in the <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant background. We expected, that if another formin was functioning redundantly with formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>, then depletion of that formin would increase the rate of cytokinesis failure in EMS and/or P2. We did not find this to be the case, as depletion of the six <italic>C. elegans</italic> formin-family members did not increase the frequency of cytokinesis failure in any of the cells within the 4-cell embryo in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutants. However, we agree that we cannot rule out insufficient protein depletion or that multiple formin-related proteins may work together to promote cytokinesis in these cells when formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity is reduced and we now state this clearly in the manuscript text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Links between polarity proteins and cell type specific cytokinesis (raised by 2 and 3).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that cell polarity could be affecting cytokinesis in a cell type specific manner during asymmetric cell division. Both of the robustly dividing cells, EMS and P2 divide asymmetrically (Arata et al., 2010; Heppert et al., 2018), and in previous work we found that PAR proteins aid robust cytokinesis in the 1-cell embryo (Jordan et al., 2016). However, the exact mechanisms of polarity establishment and/or maintenance in EMS and P2 are not as well studied as in the 1-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo. The PAR proteins localize to opposing cortical domains in P2, but are not as obviously asymmetrically distributed in EMS (Arata et al., 2010). Cell polarity in these later divisions is difficult to study due to the lack of conditional tools that disrupt the cell polarity proteins specifically in 4-cell embryos, while allowing normal cell polarity establishment and maintenance in asymmetrically dividing 1- and 2-cell embryonic parental cells (<italic>i.e.</italic> fast-acting ts PAR mutants). Thus, to address this reviewer comment, we have now added data showing <italic>par-6(RNAi)</italic> eliminates the cell-type specific protection of EMS and P2 against cytokinesis failure in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant 4-cell embryos at restrictive temperature (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). We also note that in <italic>par-6(RNAi)</italic> treated embryos at the 4-cell stage, cell fate specification and lineage patterning have been massively disrupted due to the loss of polarity in the asymmetric 1- and 2-cell divisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Links between Wnt/Src and cell type specific cytokinesis (reviewers 1 and 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now examined cytokinesis in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant embryos at 26ºC following <italic>control(RNAi)</italic> or <italic>Src<sup>src-1</sup>(RNAi)</italic>. We found that cytokinesis in EMS is dependent on Src<sup>SRC-1</sup> signaling, whereas cytokinesis in P2 is Src<sup>SRC-1</sup> independent. These results are now included in the revised manuscript (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The process of physical separation of two cells, Cytokinesis, is regulated by numerous cell autonomous and non-autonomous cues. While constriction of an equatorial actomyosin network powers plasma membrane closure, the ability to regulate its spatiotemporally varies among cell types. In this work the authors present a thorough illustration of this principle in 4 cell stage of C.elegans. Using fast acting temperature sensitive alleles the authors show that cell fate influences the ability of a cell type to withstand Formin and actin perturbation. This is regulated both in a cell intrinsic and extrinsic fashion requiring neighbouring cell contacts.</p><p>The methodology and presentation of data is undoubtedly impressive. However, several conclusions appear to be an over-estimates the data. The text is well written yet offers little information on the process of cytokinesis and focuses almost exclusively on its outcome and failure. The authors on several occasions make categorical statements that at least to me appear inconclusive.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for their constructive criticisms and we are pleased that they found the data and methodology in our original submission impressive. We have now added substantial new data and made changes to the text and figures based on their suggestions, and we are hopeful this reviewer will now find the manuscript suitable for publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Points:</p><p>1) Figure 3—figure supplement 1</p><p>&quot;This suggests that another formin-related protein is not compensating for loss of formin CYK-1 activity&quot;</p><p>I concur that none of the formins at least individually show a strong synthetic defect with CYK-1ts. However that doesn't rule out the possibility that formins may act synergistically. Therefore, the conclusive statement doesn't stand merit.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and we have adjusted the text accordingly. It is true that our RNAi mini-screen results cannot exclude the possibility that multiple formin-related proteins function synergistically during cytokinesis in the absence of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity. The diaphanous formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> is the only formin known to have a role in contractile ring F-actin assembly in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and only two other formin-related proteins are expressed in the 4-cell embryo (<italic>frl-1</italic> and <italic>inft-2;</italic> (Hashimshony et al., 2015)), which could act redundantly when formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity is reduced in EMS and/or P2 cells. Single cell RNAseq data of individual blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo indicates that no other formin-related protein is significantly enriched in either EMS or P2 compared with either the ABa or ABp cells (Tintori et al., 2016). Because we do not see a robust F-actin contractile ring during cytokinesis in EMS and P2 cells in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-</sup><sup>1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant embryos at restrictive temperature using fluorescently-tagged F-actin reporters, we argue it is unlikely another formin ‘takes over’ to promote the assembly of contractile ring F-actin when formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity is reduced. Additionally, we have now perturbed actin polymerization independent of formin-disruption, by treating control, non-ts mutant, embryos treated with the pharmacological inhibitor of F-actin assembly, LatrunculinA (LatA). We found that, similar to what is observed in the <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant, ABa and ABp blastomeres consistently failed at cytokinesis when treated with low doses of LatA (50, 67, or 80 nM), whereas the EMS and P2 blastomeres successfully completed cytokinesis at a high frequency at the same LatA concentrations. Both of these results suggest that a simple model of cell-specific redundancy between different formin family members is not the likely mechanism of robust cytokinesis in EMS and P2 cells in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant embryos. Nevertheless, we have added this possibility to this section of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) &quot;This suggests that EMS-P2 cell-cell contact mediates cell-extrinsic cues that protect against cytokinesis failure due to forminCYK-1 disruption in EMS&quot;.</p><p>The set of observations leading to this particular conclusion involves examining EMS-P2 pair after CYK-1 inactivation. Currently, it is not possible therefore to distinguish between the specific requirements of P2 versus requirement of an unspecified neighbouring cell. Whether the ABp-EMS pair would behave similarly can not be hypothesised. Therefore the conclusion, I believe, is the presence of a neighbouring cell. Unless the authors prove or show specific mechanisms originating from P2, the current conclusion seems a stretch.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point and we have now taken both approaches suggested by the reviewer, and now include this critical control in the revised manuscript. We first assessed the frequency of cytokinesis success in isolated EMS blastomeres paired with ABd blastomeres from <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutants. In this experiment, ~50% of the time the cells are paired with ABa and ~50% of the time they are paired with ABp (after isolation, we term these cells ‘ABd’ for AB-daughter cells because they cannot be distinguished). We found that, similar to isolated (unpaired) blastomeres, EMS cannot undergo cytokinesis when in direct contact with ABd blastomeres. This suggests that a P2-specific signal is required to protect against cytokinesis failure in EMS when the contractile ring is weakened. These new data are included in the revised manuscript (Figure 7C).</p><p>To further address this reviewer concern, we also tested more directly if Src/Wnt cell fate signaling from P2 mediates protection against cytokinesis failure in EMS after depleting Src<sup>SRC-1</sup> by RNAi. We found that following RNAi-mediated depletion of Src<sup>SRC-1,</sup>protection of EMS cytokinesis in intact 4-cell embryos from <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutants is lost, despite intact cell-cell contacts with the ABa, ABp and P2 cells. This result supports a model in which cytokinesis in EMS is dependent on activation of Src<sup>SRC-1</sup> in EMS by direct contact with P2, as occurs during cell fate specification (Bei et al., 2002). These new data are included in the revised manuscript (Figure 8D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Cell-extrinsic vs intrinsic angle indeed adds a dimension to this work. One would be curious to know, particularly in the EMS, whether the myosin-II ts yields an expected phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree that this experiment will substantially add to the manuscript, as we do not have evidence of cell-type specific myosin-II<sup>NMY-2</sup> regulation during cytokinesis at the 4-cell stage. We found that in <italic>myosin-II<sup>nmy-2</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant embryos, all 4 blastomeres fail in cytokinesis equally at restrictive temperature (100% of the time). We expect upon isolation all 4 blastomeres would also fail in cytokinesis 100% of the time. While it is hypothetically possible that some cell-extrinsic pathway affects cytokinesis when myosin-II<sup>NMY-2</sup> activity is reduced, we do not have any evidence to support a cell extrinsic pathway contributing to cytokinesis failure in a <italic>myosin-II<sup>nmy-2</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant. In the <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant, we had in vivo evidence that there was a difference between cytokinesis in the cells in intact embryos versus in isolated blastomeres, as EMS and P2 were able to divide when formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity was reduced in intact embryos, but only P2 could divide upon isolation. We do not have this evidence in <italic>myosin-II<sup>nmy-2</sup>(ts)</italic> mutants. Embryo microdissection and blastomere isolation experiments are laborious and not suited to exploratory work, unless a direct hypothesis is being tested. Thus, in our opinion this experiment is out of the realm of reasonable experimental requests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5.</p><p>I am unable to follow the logic here clearly. The spindle morphology has a direct impact on cytokinesis (beyond its spatial positioning). Spindles are therefore a cause of any cytokinesis defect under study. Proper spindle alignment (Figure 5E), does not guarantee successful cytokinesis. In CYK-1 ts, the distribution is visibly wider with some cases of proper spindle alignment and yet cytokinesis fails. I agree cases of successful cytokinesis seems to be correlative to proper spindle alignment. But this as a whole is incomplete and inconclusive. The authors do not make an attempt to conclude this section and one fails to see what exactly the authors allude to here.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not stating the relationship between spindle angle and cell fate specification clearer in our original submission, or for in any way implying there an effect on overall spindle morphology. The spindle angle we measured is the angle of the EMS spindle relative to the P2-EMS cell-cell contact axis, not the spindle angle relative to the division plane (which are still perpendicular to each other, as occurs normally). To be clear, the axis of the cell division plane (and site of equatorial constriction) during cytokinesis is always perpendicular to the spindle angle in all EMS and P2 cells from control or <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> embryos in both intact and isolated blastomeres, as it is typically in animal cells undergoing cytokinesis. Thus, we do not believe mis-positioning the spindle angle relative to the division plane is affecting cytokinesis directly in this context and we do not see gross effect of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> disruption on spindle morphology.</p><p>The EMS spindle angle has been previously published as a read-out for correct P2 to EMS cell fate signaling in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> 4-cell embryo, and was the assay used to show that Wnt<sup>MOM-2</sup> and Src<sup>SRC-1</sup> signals act in parallel and non-redundantly for cell fate specification in EMS to promote cell division asymmetry and gut induction (Bei et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2010). However, we understand this is confusing and complicated. We have therefore significantly restructured this section to make the text clearer. We have now also added analysis showing that cytokinesis in EMS (within an intact embryo) is dependent on Src<sup>SRC-1</sup> signaling, thus greatly improving the strength of our argument that cell fate signaling, which results in EMS spindle angle orientation, promotes robust cytokinesis in this blastomere.</p><p>It is also important to state that at this point of our studies we do not fully understand how P2contact dependent Src<sup>SRC-1</sup> activation leads to protection against cytokinesis failure in EMS when the F-actin cytoskeleton is weakened with either the <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant or with low doses of LatA. Thus, it is entirely possible that spindle signaling contributes to this cell type specific protection in EMS and/or P2. In light of this, we have now added this possibility to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript reports the cell-type dependent phenotypes of a temperature-sensitive allele of cyk-1 formin in 4-cell stage C. elegans embryos. Inactivation of this f-actin nucleator during the first cell division by temperature upshift results in highly penetrant cytokinesis failure. Interestingly, while division of ABa and ABp cells was strongly inhibited by a similar temperature upshift during 4 cell stage, P2 and EMS divisions were more resistant and even at 26°C (the highest temperature that allows robust cell divisions in the wild type embryos) about 30-50% of these divisions completed successfully. Further, by blastomere isolation and recombination experiments, the authors revealed that cytokinesis of the EMS cell with reduced CYK-1 activity depends on the cell-cell contact between the EMS and P2 cells while the P2 division is independent of the contact with other cells. Based on these observations, the authors conclude that both the cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms protect against division failure due to defective contractile ring.</p><p>Establishment of an experimental system that allows further study of cell-type dependent variation in the mechanism of cytokinesis is a highly valuable achievement. However, there are major shortfalls in the current manuscript as below.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased reviewer 2 found our establishment of the 4-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo for the study of cell-type variation in cytokinesis a valuable achievement. We also appreciate their helpful comments on our manuscript, especially their detailed reading of the Materials and methods and notice of several key errors. We hope that we have fully addressed their concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors implicitly assume that 1) the temperature sensitivity of cytokinesis failure is derived of the temperature sensitive inactivation of CYK-1 (ts) mutant protein and 2) the levels of residual CYK-1 activity after temperature upshit are invariable across the four different cell types (or completely inactivated in all the four cells). However, neither of these assumptions have been confirmed.</p><p>In Davies (2014), they compared CYK-1 FH1FH2C fragments with and without the L1015H mutation found in the cyk-1(ts) allele and showed that this mutation inactivates the in vitro actin polymerizing activity at 25°C. However, it remained unclear whether the CYK-1 mutant is active at 15°C or not (this actually should have been examined at the publication of the 2014 paper). Thus, currently, we can't exclude the possibility that the CYK-1 L1015H mutant protein is inactive at 15°C as well, and the mutant cell can complete cytokinesis at 15°C, but not at higher temperature, because of the presence of an unknown redundant pathway whose activity is intrinsically temperature-sensitive. If this was the case, the cell-type dependent ts phenotypes would not be reflecting the variable responses to the defective actin polymerisation but be indicating the variable activities of this redundant pathway.</p><p>Even if the temperature-sensitive cytokinesis failure of cyk-1(ts) was caused by the temperature-sensitive activity of the mutant protein, currently, there is no direct evidence that the cellular CYK-1 activity is inactivated uniformly across the four cell types. The cell type specificity might be caused by the variable level of the residual activity of CYK-1. If so, observed data should be interpreted as indicating the variations in a cellular mechanism for the expression of the CYK-1 activity, rather than the plasticity against the defective contractile ring.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we did make these two assumptions in our initial manuscript. As discussed in our response to the reviewer and editorial comments above, we have now confirmed that the L1015H mutation in cyk-1(ts) causes loss of F-actin accumulation at the contractile ring, in a temperature-dependent manner. We initially tested this at the 1-cell stage to test the effect of temperature on <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutants for two main reasons: 1) the F-actin reporters are brighter and easier to image due to the absence of cell-cell contacts at the 1-cell stage; and 2) the essential role of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> at the 1-cell stage has been studied using non-ts mutations (Severson et al., 2002) and RNAi (Sonnichsen et al., 2005; Swan et al., 1998). These data are now included in the revised manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We also measured contractile ring levels at the 4-cell stage in ABa, ABp, EMS, and P2 (Figure 4, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1-3).</p><p>We measured the levels of F-actin in the contractile ring at both permissive and restrictive temperatures (16ºC and 26ºC) in control and <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant embryos using multiple fluorescently-tagged F-actin reporters (Lifeact::RFP, GFP::PLST-1, or GFP::Utrophin<sup>ABD</sup>). We found that contractile ring F-actin levels were lower in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant embryos than in control embryos at 16ºC (permissive temperature), and contractile ring F-actin levels were undetectable in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant embryos at 26ºC (restrictive temperature). This suggests the <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant is indeed temperature sensitive for formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>-mediated F-actin polymerization at 26ºC and, despite providing sufficient formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity to support organismal viability and germline function (Jordan et al., 2016), is not fully wildtype at 16ºC.</p><p>Thus, to address this reviewer concern in a different way, we also targeted F-actin polymerization independent of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity by treating embryos with a pharmaceutical inhibitor of F-actin (LatrunculinA or LatA). We found that, similar to what is observed in the <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant, ABa and ABp blastomeres consistently failed at cytokinesis when treated with low doses of LatA (50, 67, or 80 nM), whereas the EMS and P2 blastomeres successfully completed cytokinesis at a high frequency at the same LatA concentrations. These new results support our original hypothesis that the EMS and P2 cells are protected against cytokinesis failure when the actin cytoskeleton is weakened, and they are now included in this revised manuscript (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript is rather descriptive and misses clear insight into the molecular mechanisms. In Jordan (2016), the authors reported the synthetic effects between the cyk-1(ts) and depletion of PAR proteins. Are the expression levels/cortical localization of the PAR proteins in the 4 cell types consistent with the cell type dependent phenotypes in cyk-1(ts) embryos? Does inactivation of the WNT or SRC signalling affect cytokinesis of the cyk-1(ts) mutant EMS cell?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we directly tested if Src/Wnt cell fate signaling from P2 mediates protection against cytokinesis failure in EMS by RNAi-inhibition of Src<sup>SRC-1</sup>. We found that following RNAi-mediated depletion of Src<sup>SRC-1,</sup>protection of EMS cytokinesis in intact 4-cell embryos from <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutants is lost, despite intact cell-cell contacts with the ABa, ABp and P2 cells. This result supports a model in which cytokinesis in EMS is dependent on activation of Src<sup>SRC-1</sup> in EMS by direct contact with P2, as occurs during cell fate specification (Bei et al., 2002). These new data are included in the revised manuscript (Figure 8D).</p><p>We agree that cell polarity could be affecting cytokinesis in a cell type specific manner during asymmetric cell division. Both of the robustly dividing cells, EMS and P2, divide asymmetrically (Arata et al., 2010; Heppert et al., 2018), and in previous work we found that PAR polarity proteins aid robust cytokinesis in the 1-cell embryo (Jordan et al., 2016). However, the exact mechanisms of polarity establishment and/or maintenance in EMS and P2 are not as well studied as in the 1-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo. The PAR proteins localize to opposing cortical domains in P2, but are not as obviously asymmetrically distributed in EMS (Arata et al., 2010). Cell polarity in these later divisions is difficult to study due to the lack of conditional tools that disrupt the cell polarity proteins specifically in 4-cell embryos, while allowing normal cell polarity establishment and maintenance in asymmetrically dividing 1- and 2-cell embryonic parental cells (<italic>i.e.</italic> fast-acting ts PAR mutants). To address this reviewer comment, we have now added data showing <italic>par-6(RNAi)</italic> eliminates the cell-type specific protection of EMS and P2 against cytokinesis failure in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant 4-cell embryos at restrictive temperature (Figure 8—figure supplement 2). We also note that in <italic>par-6(RNAi)</italic> treated embryos at the 4-cell stage, cell fate specification and lineage patterning have been massively disrupted due to the loss of polarity in the asymmetric 1- and 2-cell divisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Data about the f-actin levels in the cleavage furrow (Figure 3) are not convincing. About 50~70% of the cyk-1(ts) mutant EMS and P2 cells fail cytokinesis while 30~50% complete it. The successful cells might have more robust contractile ring than the unsuccessful ones. Successful cells and failed cells should be analyzed separately as the author did in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified contractile ring F-actin levels relative to the outcome of cytokinesis in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant strains expressing the RFP::Lifeact and PLST-1::GFP F-actin reporters. We compared contractile ring F-actin levels in EMS and P2 cells that divide successfully versus in those that fail to divide. Despite this effort, we have found no detectable levels of F-actin in the contractile ring in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant EMS or P2 blastomeres that succeed or fail to divide. Although we cannot detect it, it is possible that the successful cells have more robust contractile rings than the unsuccessful cells. However, even if this were true, this does not negate our results: EMS and P2 blastomeres are more successful at cytokinesis in the absence of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity or in the presence of LatA than the 1-cell embryo or ABa/ABp cells; this cytokinetic protection is intrinsically regulated for P2 cells and extrinsically regulated for EMS cells; and extrinsic regulation in EMS cells is dependent on Src<sup>SRC-1</sup> signaling from P2 cells.</p><p>As we stated previously, all of these F-actin reporter strains are very dim and thus 1) are difficult to image and 2) an undetectable signal is difficult to interpret. We do not and cannot state that there is no F-actin in the contractile ring in these successfully dividing <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant blastomeres, just that we cannot detect differences in F-actin levels between successful and unsuccessful EMS and P2 cells. The reason we present the contractile ring F-actin levels in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutants is to demonstrate there is not a major redundant F-actin nucleating factor and/or massive F-actin stabilization in the EMS or P2 cells specifically, which could explain the ability of these two cells to divide in the absence of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity. We have made an effort to revise the text to ensure that we do not over-state this result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The mechanisms of cytokinesis remain elusive despite decades of work. The lack of resolution of a universal mechanism may stem in part from the employment of a wide range of model cell types. It is unclear whether reported differences reflect cell-type specific distinctions or a general absence of redundant mechanisms in some systems. Davies and colleagues compared the molecular requirements for cytokinesis of several cells in the early C. elegans embryo. They combined the well-characterized fate specification of the cells with powerful, time-resolved perturbations of major conserved cytokinesis proteins via temperature sensitive mutant alleles. The manuscript is a technical tour-de-force, with exquisite cell manipulation experiments in addition to temperature shift work with intact embryos. It is exceptionally comprehensively referenced, and will set a new standard for the field. That said, since the authors are not able to resolve the problem of how certain cells divide following strong reduction of F-actin by CYK-1 (ts) upshift, I recommend a finite list of things to try and to consider. I feel confident that after these concerns are addressed, this manuscript will be suitable for publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased reviewer 3 found the data and methodology in our original submission impressive and thank them for their critical comments. We have now added new data and made substantial changes to the text based on their suggestions, and we are hopeful this reviewer will now find the manuscript suitable for publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Points:</p><p>1a) F-actin levels and distribution need to be quantified and presented for the AB lineage, comparing control and formin ts shifted embryos.</p></disp-quote><p>We measured the levels of F-actin in the contractile ring in ABa and ABp at both permissive and restrictive temperatures (16ºC and 26ºC) in control and <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant embryos expressing Lifeact::RFP, the brightest of the F-actin reporters at the 4-cell stage on our microscope system. We found that contractile ring F-actin levels were lower in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant embryos than in control embryos at 16ºC (permissive temperature) and contractile ring F-actin levels were undetectable in ABa and ABp (like in EMS and P2) in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant embryos at 26ºC (restrictive temperature). These results show that the <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant is indeed temperature sensitive for formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>-mediated F-actin polymerization at 26ºC and, though not fully wildtype at 16ºC, provides sufficient formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity to support actin polymerization, organismal viability, and germline function (Jordan et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1b) The lack of an effect of targeting other formins is not fully satisfying, since no positive control is provided to ensure that they are depleted. One potential way to augment the exploration of these other formins is to consult a recent comparative transcriptomics study that may be able to verify which formins are expressed in the various early blastomeres (Tintori et al., Dev. Cell. 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added information (and references) about the expression of other formin-related genes in 4-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos as suggested. The diaphanous formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> is the only formin shown to have a role in assembling contractile ring F-actin during cytokinesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, there are two other formin-related proteins expressed in 4-cell stage embryos: FRL-1 and INFT-2 (Hashimshony et al., 2015). Single cell RNAseq data from individual blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo revealed that none of the worm formin-related genes, including <italic>cyk-1,</italic> are significantly enriched in either EMS or P2, compared to ABa or ABp cells (Tintori et al., 2016). Our mini-RNAi screen for additional formin-related proteins that might compensate for loss of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity was done at restrictive temperature (26ºC) in the <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant background. We expected that if another formin was functioning redundantly with formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>, then depletion of that formin would increase the rate of cytokinesis failure in EMS and/or P2. We did not find this to be the case, as depletion of the six <italic>C. elegans</italic> formin-family members did not increase the frequency of cytokinesis failure in any of the cells within the 4-cell embryo in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutants. However, we cannot rule out insufficient protein depletion or that multiple formin-related proteins may work together to promote cytokinesis in these cells when formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity is reduced and we now state this clearly in the manuscript text.</p><p>To address this reviewer’s concern in a different way, we also targeted F-actin polymerization independent of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> activity by treating embryos with a pharmaceutical inhibitor of F-actin (LatrunculinA or LatA). We found that, similar to what is observed in the <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant, ABa and ABp blastomeres consistently failed at cytokinesis when treated with low doses of LatA (50, 67, or 80 nM), whereas the EMS and P2 blastomeres successfully completed cytokinesis at a high frequency at the same LatA concentrations. These new results support our original hypothesis that the EMS and P2 cells are protected against cytokinesis failure when the actin cytoskeleton is weakened, and they are now included in this revised manuscript (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1c) Have the authors verified their analysis of F-actin levels using a second, distinct F-actin probe (LifeAct or the ABD of moesin)? It seems possible that these probes detect slightly different sub-populations of F-actin. I do not expect the authors to introduce fluorescently-labeled phalloidin or recombinant G-actin into embryos to distinguish different F-actin pools as has been done (see for example Burkel, von Dassow and Bement, Cytoskeleton 2007). The authors could label a non-formin-nucleated pool with a GFP-actin (Chai, Ou and colleagues, Nature Protocols, 2012).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified contractile ring F-actin levels in the <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant in strains expressing the F-actin reporters RFP::Lifeact, PLST::GFP, and GFP::Utrophin<sup>ABD</sup>. Using RFP::Lifeact, the brightest of the strains at the 4-cell stage on our microscope, as well as PLST::GFP, we also correlated the levels of F-actin in the contractile in ring in EMS and P2 cells that fail versus complete cytokinesis. Despite this effort, we found no detectable levels of F-actin in the contractile ring in either cells that complete or cells that fail to divide successfully. Although there is evidence to suggest different F-actin reporters label different sub-populations of F-actin (Belin et al., 2014; Bement et al., 2015), both of these markers are able to label the contractile ring in the 1-cell stage <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo (Figure 1—figure supplement 1, RFP::Lifeact and PLST::GFP; Figure 4—figure supplement 3, eGFP::Utrophin<sup>ABD</sup>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1d) The authors should examine the localization of fluorescently-tagged CYK-1 during cytokinesis of the 4 cells they study.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 approach (Dickinson and Goldstein, 2016) to generate a fluorescently tagged formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> (CYK-1::eGFP). We found that CYK1::eGFP localized nearly exclusively to the contractile ring in all 4 blastomeres, and contractile ring levels of CYK-1::eGFP in each cell did not significantly differ between the 4 cells. This is in agreement with single blastomere RNAseq analysis which showed no significant differences in <italic>cyk-1</italic> mRNA between the blastomeres (Swan et al., 1998; Tintori et al., 2016). These results are now included in Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In cases where cytokinesis is more successful than expected (insensitive cells), is initiation late?

When comparing the initiation time and initial rate of ingression, there was no clear difference between those that complete or those fail in cytokinesis. However, this analysis is obscured in cells that only weakly ingress due to the variable phenotype and by cell shape changes due to the movement and division of neighboring cells in the embryo. Due to the lack of ingression in ABa and ABp cells, we were unable to compare the initiation or ingression timing between the 4 cell types upon Formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would seem not outside the scope of this paper to combine the cyk-1 ts and a par mutant and shift the P2 after dissociation, to determine the role of polarity in protecting the P2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that PAR-protein dependent cell polarity could be affecting cytokinesis in the P2 cells and were very keen to perform the experiment suggested by the reviewer (both in vivoand isolated P2 cells in vitro). Both of the robustly dividing cells, EMS and P2, divide asymmetrically (Arata et al., 2010; Heppert et al., 2018), and in previous work we found that PAR polarity proteins aid robust cytokinesis in the 1-cell embryo (Jordan et al., 2016). However, the exact mechanisms of polarity establishment and/or maintenance in EMS and P2 are not as well studied as in the 1-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo. The PAR proteins localize to opposing cortical domains in P2, but are not as obviously asymmetrically distributed in EMS (Arata et al., 2010). Cell polarity in these later divisions is difficult to study due to the lack of conditional tools that disrupt the cell polarity proteins specifically in 4-cell embryos, while allowing normal cell polarity establishment and maintenance in asymmetrically dividing 1- and 2-cell embryonic parental cells (<italic>i.e.</italic> fast-acting ts PAR mutants). Unfortunately, none of the ~5 available ts PAR alleles (Fievet et al., 2013) are “fast acting” (able to disrupt cell division asymmetry in the 1-cell embryo upon upshift &lt;10-15 min before NEBD), and only one allele (<italic>pkc-3(ne4250ts)</italic>) disrupted cell polarity in the 1-cell embryo when upshifted &gt;20 minutes before cell division, at least in our hands. Importantly, this one ts allele did not disrupt division asymmetry in 2- and 4-cell embryos (including in either EMS or P2). Thus, to address this reviewer comment, we have now added data showing <italic>par-6(RNAi)</italic> eliminates the cell-type specific protection of EMS and P2 against cytokinesis failure in <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant 4-cell embryos at restrictive temperature (Figure 8—figure supplement 1).

Is there compensation for the loss of function by an increase in things jiggling around? Similarly, why is shifting earlier not always worse (i.e. Figure 2B, EMS and P2, formin mutant)? Are un-scored embryos dying and scored, live ones less severely affected somehow?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are some intermediate temperatures and temporal upshifts where a higher temperature, or longer upshift, causes a weaker phenotype than a slightly higher temperature or longer upshift. We think this is unlikely to be due to cell death, as at these temperatures we don’t observe cell death in a temperature-dependent manner (we never see cells die upon upshift). We consistently follow cell division until the daughter cells begin to divide again, to ensure the cells are still cycling. Although cells in control embryos divide in a highly stereotypical manner, perturbation (<italic>e.g.</italic> by RNAi or with ts mutants) adds some variability cell biology in this system, and this variability seems to be increased at intermediate temperatures. Furthermore, the number of cells analyzed varied between the different temperatures and upshift times; thus a few blastomeres that fail or succeed in cytokinesis at a given temperature could have large effects depending on the size of the data set. To improve clarity, we have now added the n’s directly to all panels in Figures 1 and 2, with a further breakdown in the supplemental data file (Supplementary file 1).</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion between reviewers, point 5 was emphasised as being important by ALL three reviewers.</p><p>1) Unfortunately, our suggestion of repeating an in vitro experiment to check the actin polymerization-promoting activity of the mutant version of CYK-1 at 16°C was neglected (or not presented). However, the authors measured the levels of F-actin in the contractile ring in the mutant embryos. Since the readout of this assay is the influence of the formin mutation on the complex cellular process of F-actin polymerization, it can also address our question though only indirectly. Anyway, irrespective of cell types and probes, the furrow F-actin levels in cyk-1(ts) mutant embryos at 16 °C were lower than those in wildtype embryos at 16 °C (Figure 4E, Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and Figure 4—figure supplement 3B). This suggests that CYK-1 L1015H mutant protein is not fully functional as the wildtype protein, as the authors admitted in the letter of rebuttal. However, although I am afraid that I might have just overlooked, I could not find any mention about this fact, which is important for the readers to understand the technical and conceptual limitation of the authors' approach, in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not addressing this request to conduct pyrene actin assays with the CYK1(ts) mutant at 16ºC and 26ºC in our previous Resubmission; we did not understand that the reviewers were asking for this specifically. We understood that the reviewers were asking if the CYK-1(ts) mutant protein is fully functional for F-actin polymerization at permissive temperature, and we addressed this in vivoin our previous Resubmission. Unfortunately, it is simply not possible to do comparative in vitro activity studies at different temperatures with most biochemically purified ts mutant proteins. Our understanding is that ts mutant proteins show high protein instability at all temperatures once the ts protein is removed from the stabilizing environment of the cell, which contains molecular and structural protein chaperones. When we first published on this ts mutant, we asked Dr. David Kovar (U. Chicago), our collaborator who did the original pyrene actin assay comparing the in vitroactivity of wildtype CYK-1 to CYK-1(ts) (L1015H) (Davies et al., 2014), to do the pyrene actin assay at a low permissive temperature, despite the unlikeliness it would work. However, the Kovar lab did not have access to a cooling plate reader required for the assay and told us these are expensive and not commonly used. In any case, we agree with the reviewer: our in vivo data in this manuscript and in our previous publications on the <italic>cyk-1(ts)</italic> mutant, clearly show that the <italic>cyk1(or596ts)</italic> allele is not fully functional at permissive temperature. Importantly, though, CYK1(ts) mutant protein is functional enough at permissive temperature to support cell division, organismal development, and fertility. Moreover, when we examine the cytokinesis of single cells in <italic>cyk-1(ts)</italic> mutant embryos, cytokinesis is always successful at the permissive temperature in every cell-type we’ve analysed to date. These data were included in our previous submission and now this point is explicitly stated in the Results section of the main text:</p><p>“In <italic>formin<sup>cyk-1</sup>(ts)</italic> mutant 1-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos at 16ºC, F-actin is present in the contractile ring (although at lower levels than in control embryos), but upon upshift to 26ºC linear F-actin is no longer visible and cytokinesis fails (Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Davies et al, 2014).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the rebuttal, the authors wrote, &quot;we have now measured the levels of F-actin in the contractile ring at both permissive and restrictive temperatures (16°C and 26°C) in control and formin cyk-1(ts) mutant embryos&quot;. However, I couldn't find any data for the ring F-actin levels in wildtype embryos at the restrictive temperature. Knowing now that CYK-4 ts mutant protein is not fully functional even at the permissive temperature, we can't exclude the possibility that the cytokinesis phenotype by acute temperature upshift might be triggered by acute inactivation of an unknown redundant mechanism for actin polymerization, which might be responsible for protecting the EMS and P2 cells from cytokines failure. In case of Figure 4E 'P2 cells', for example, drop of F-actin levels in cyk-1(ts) embryos from ~3 to ~0 by temperature upshift could be due to a) further inactivation of the mutant CYK-1 protein or b) inactivation of an unknown factor that contributes to the ring actin polymerisation. Data about F-actin levels in the wildtype embryos will be helpful for discriminating these possibilities. If the temperature upshift didn't affect the F-actin levels in the wildtype embryos or promoted it, this would provide a strong support for scenario a). On the contrary, if the temperature upshift drops the F-actin levels in the wildtype embryos from ~6 (16°C) to ~3 (26°C) or lower, it would be reasonable to conclude that the scenario b) is more likely.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include data showing levels of contractile ring F-actin in control embryos at both 16ºC and 26ºC. We found the same levels of contractile ring f-actin in control embryos at both temperatures. As the reviewers suggest above, these data therefore rule out hypothesis (b) that an alternative temperature-sensitive mechanism promotes robust cytokinesis in the EMS and P2 cells. This result is also consistent with our acute LatA treatment results and suggests that cytokinesis in EMS and P2 is protected against failure when the contractile ring is weakened. These data can be found in the revised Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I am afraid that I might be completely wrong, but I guess that the authors might already have the data of F-actin levels in wildtype embryos at 26°C since this is a very basic control. Whichever the results were, with the new data of the latrunculin A-sensitivity, the authors' key discovery in the current manuscript that the EMS and P2 cells are protected against cytokinesis failure due to the perturbed actin cytoskeleton will not be affected. Depending on the results, the authors might need to revise their basic assumption that the temperature shift causes a phenotype by acutely inactivating the mutant protein with a 'fast-acting ts mutation', on which they have been relying in previous publications. However, it is highly unnatural if the data of F-actin levels in wildtype embryos at 26°C is not shown. I strongly recommend showing the data of the F-actin levels in wildtype embryos at 26°C in at least one of Figure 4E, Figure 4—figure supplement 1C or Figure 4—figure supplement 3B (or Figure 1—figure supplement 1 although this is not really ideal), and properly discuss their implications on the possible mechanism for the acute induction of cytokinesis failure by temperature shift.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to point 2 above.

By Pearson's chi square test, it will be 0.032. This might be implying that inft-2, which is expressed at the 4-cell stage, might have an inhibitory role in the ring F-actin polymerization in the P2 cells although this is perfectly consistent with the authors' statement &quot;we found that individual depletion of the other formin-related proteins did not decrease the frequency cytokinesis failure in any of the 4 blastomeres in formin cyk-1(ts) mutants.&quot; These simple calculations might not be appropriate for a complex dataset such as in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, to which care about multiple comparisons has to be paid, and the authors might have performed proper corrections, which might have made it &gt;0.05, the significance level used in other figures.

However, we agree that <italic>inft-2(RNAi)</italic> may have a partially suppressive effect on cytokinesis failure in <italic>cyk-1(ts)</italic> 4-cell embryos, and <italic>inft-2</italic> mRNA is reported to be expressed at the 4-cell stage (Tintori et al., 2016).</p><p>We analysed the cytokinesis outcome for each cell type, comparing between control and formin RNAi-treated embryos and testing for significance using Fisher’s exact test.

We agree that, for this experiment, correcting for multiple comparisons is important to prevent false positives. To our knowledge, while there is no standardised way of correcting for multiple comparisons when using Fisher's exact or Pearson's chi square tests, Bonferroni correction is frequently used. In Bonferroni correction, a (the value against which the p-value is compared) is divided by the number of comparisons. In this experiment, we used 6 pairwise comparisons between the control RNAi and each formin gene RNAi within a given cell type in the 4-cell embryo. Therefore, the Bonferroni correction adjusted value of a is 0.050/6 or 0.0083. None of the calculated p-values is smaller than 0.0083, indicating that none of the RNAi treatments had a significant effect on cytokinesis outcome.

We include this analysis in response to the reviewers but would be happy to remove it if asked.</p><p>The main text now reads:</p><p>“Sum intensity projection analysis (total levels) revealed that formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>::eGFP is reduced in EMS and P2, versus ABa/ABp blastomeres (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). While the challenges of sum intensity projection analysis in multicellular embryos make it difficult to form conclusions about protein levels using this approach (see Materials and methods for additional information), these results are consistent with the maximum intensity projection analysis and do not support the hypothesis that resistance to formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> inactivation in EMS and P2 is due to an endogenous enrichment of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup> protein in these cells relative to ABa and ABp at the 4cell stage.”</p><p>We argue that the maximum intensity projection is a better way to quantify fluorescence intensity differences at the contractile ring between individual blastomeres for four reasons. The multicellular 4-cell embryo is much more challenging to image and compare levels between individual cells than is the 1-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo because: 1) individual cells within the 4cell embryo vary in both their position within the 4-cell embryo and in their orientation during cell division (ABa and ABp divide perpendicular to the long embryo axis whereas EMS and P2 divide parallel to this axis); 2) there is rotational variation of individual embryos relative to the coverslip in every time lapse image series; 3) individual cells within the 4-cell embryo are of different volume and thus occupy different numbers of z-sections within the image stack, and 4) CYK-1::GFP is largely enriched at the cell cortex, but also occupies the cell cytoplasm. These issues impact sum projection analysis to a much greater extent than maximum projection analysis and in our opinion, render sum projection analysis unreliable for measuring the levels of CYK-1::GFP at the contractile ring in the 4-cell embryo. In our sum projection analysis of contractile ring CYK-1::GFP levels in the 4-cell embryo, for example, the contractile ring signal scales roughly with cell volume, with smaller cells showing reduced signal than the larger cells. Again, this result is still consistent with our hypothesis that CYK-1 protein is not expressed at higher levels in EMS or P2, but we are not confident that this result indicates a real difference in CYK-1 levels in individual cells within the 4-cell embryo. We are happy to remove this analysis and retain our note in the Materials and methods explaining why if the reviewers and/or Editors allow this.</p><p>The Materials and methods section describing our analysis of contractile ring formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>::eGFP levels in individual cells within the 4-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo now reads:</p><p>“In Figure 3, accumulation of formin<sup>CYK-1</sup>::eGFP was analyzed using a Z-series maximum intensity projection to select for the signal from the cortex next to the coverslip.
