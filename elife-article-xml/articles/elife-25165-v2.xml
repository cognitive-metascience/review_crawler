Using transcriptional studies and slow-scan two-photon live imaging capable of identifying the number of motile and immotile cilia, we now established that the final number of motile cilia depends on Notch signalling (NS). We found that despite all left-right organizer (LRO) cells express <italic>foxj1a</italic> and the ciliary axonemes of these cells have dynein arms, some cilia remain immotile. We identified that this decision is taken early in development in the Kupffer’s Vesicle (KV) precursors the readout being <italic>her12</italic> transcription. We demonstrate that overexpression of either <italic>her12</italic> or Notch intracellular domain (NICD) increases the number of immotile cilia at the expense of motile cilia, and leads to an accumulation of immotile cilia at the anterior half of the KV. This disrupts the normal fluid flow intensity and pattern, with consequent impact on <italic>dand5</italic> expression pattern and left-right (L-R) axis establishment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ciliary epithelium</kwd><kwd>left-right</kwd><kwd>Notch signalling</kwd><kwd>fluid flow dynamics</kwd><kwd>cilia motility</kwd><kwd>her12</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/BEX-BID/1411/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lopes</surname><given-names>Susana Santos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FCT-ANR/BEX-BID/0153/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pestana</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/SAU-OBD/103981/2008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vaz</surname><given-names>Andreia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PD/BD/52420/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacinto</surname><given-names>Raquel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BPD/77258/2011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tavares</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/111611/2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sampaio</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IF/00951/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lopes</surname><given-names>Susana Santos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the on the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Foxj1a</italic> makes cilia ultrastructurally motile, while Notch signalling stops cilia movement in Kupffer's vesicle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Embryonic motile cilia play an essential role in body laterality patterning by generating a directional fluid flow inside the vertebrate left-right organizer (LRO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nonaka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takeda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nonaka et al., 2002</xref>). The mouse LRO (or node) is lined with monociliated cells, presenting motile and immotile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGrath et al., 2003</xref>). While motile cilia in the pit region generate a directional fluid flow (the nodal flow), the immotile cilia, present mostly in the perinodal crown cells, are thought to be able to sense it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGrath et al., 2003</xref>). This sensing mechanism is still unknown and continues to deserve tentative updates in the field both using the mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delling et al., 2016</xref>) and the zebrafish model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferreira et al., 2017</xref>). Whether it involves mechano- or chemosensation, or both, is still not demonstrated but it is known to lead to the activation of the channel Polycystin-2 (PKD2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshiba et al., 2012</xref>). This channel was elegantly shown to be necessary for the asymmetric expression of <italic>dand5</italic> (DAN domain family, member 5) on the right side of the mouse node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshiba et al., 2012</xref>) and consequently allowing the propagation of Nodal into the left Lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marques et al., 2004</xref>). This signal is amplified via a self-enhanced lateral-inhibition system (SELI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakamura et al., 2006</xref>) at the left LPM, which consists in the activation of the genetic cascade Nodal-Pitx2-Lefty2 and ends with the correct formation and asymmetric positioning of the visceral organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nonaka et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In zebrafish, the left-right (L-R) axis establishment starts in a fluid-filled organ designated Kupffer’s vesicle (KV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Essner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kramer-Zucker et al., 2005</xref>). Functionally, this organ is the homologue of other vertebrate LROs like the mouse node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nonaka et al., 2002</xref>) and the gastrocoel roof plate in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schweickert et al., 2007</xref>). The KV originates from a cluster of cells, the dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs), which migrate in the forefront of the shield during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cooper and D'Amico, 1996</xref>). At the end of gastrulation, the DFCs form an ellipsoid fluid filled vesicle. While KV lumen inflates each cell extends one cilium towards the lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amack et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oteíza et al., 2008</xref>). As in the mouse node, the KV cilia also produce a directional fluid flow that leads to an asymmetric <italic>dand5</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lopes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>). Our previous work determined that KV cilia can also be divided into two populations according to whether they are functionally motile or immotile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>). We also showed that the DeltaD zebrafish mutant (<italic>dld<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) for Notch signalling (NS) presents an increase in the number of motile cilia in the LRO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that NS may modulate the number of motile cilia in this organ. Equivalently, Boskovski <italic>et al.</italic> reported that GALNT11, an <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine type <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation enzyme needed to activate NS, regulates the ratio between motile and immotile cilia in the <italic>Xenopus’</italic> LRO, where less NS also increased the number of motile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boskovski et al., 2013</xref>). The authors showed that changing the ratio between motile and immotile cilia caused downstream defects in L-R patterning of the laterality marker <italic>pitx2c</italic> (<italic>paired-like homeodomain 2</italic>), and in the correct heart looping of <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boskovski et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The transcription factor Forkhead box J1a (Foxj1a) has been established as the motile cilia master regulator in the KV cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stubbs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Without it cilia do not form, altering the expression of L-R markers and randomizing organ <italic>situs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian et al., 2009</xref>). Its transcription initiates during gastrulation in the DFCs, and Foxj1a is responsible for the transcriptional activation of several motility genes, such as <italic>dnah7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choksi et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>dnah9</italic> (axonemal heavy chain dyneins that mediate the movement of cilia by hydrolysing ATP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choksi et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that in wild type (WT) embryos, where motile and immotile cilia are present in neighbouring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>), Foxj1a function may be antagonized by other factors, explaining why cilia remain immotile in some cells.</p><p>In order to understand the mechanisms behind the choice of motile <italic>versus</italic> immotile cilia, we manipulated NS and Foxj1a levels and evaluated their impact in the ratio of motile and immotile cilia in the zebrafish LRO. We concluded that, independently from variations in <italic>foxj1a</italic> mRNA levels, all cilia seem to acquire a motile ultrastructure. However, NS modulates the final number of functionally moving cilia early in the KV precursors, via a mechanism that involves the activity of Her12 (hairy-related 12), a transcription repressor so far only involved in somitogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shankaran et al., 2007</xref>). We then experimentally showed that Her12 mediated motile/immotile cilia ratio imbalance impacts not only on fluid flow intensity but also on its pattern. This supports our previous data showing that for the KV to develop a robust fluid flow, capable of promoting normal organ <italic>situs</italic>, it requires a minimum of 30 motile cilia and an anterior-dorsal cluster of motile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). Overall, the evidence presented demonstrates the importance of regulating the motile/immotile cilia ratio in the generation of a robust and functional fluid flow in the zebrafish LRO.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cilia in the KV become motile as development progresses</title><p>As the KV starts to form and inflate, cilia begin to emerge and some start to beat, generating a fluid flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Essner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kramer-Zucker et al., 2005</xref>), while others remain static (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>). How this dichotomy evolves over time is unknown. We thus questioned whether the percentage of immotile cilia at the 8-somites stage (ss) was the same since the beginning of the LRO formation. To better understand this phenomenon, we injected WT zebrafish embryos at the 1 cell stage with a titrated, non-toxic concentration of <italic>arl13b-GFP mRNA</italic>, and performed live imaging in a two-photon microscope. By scanning the whole KV at a low speed (0.16 frames per second, fps) in a slow scanning mode by using a high pixel dwell time (22.4 microseconds) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) it was possible to accurately distinguish the motile cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) from the immotile cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), quantify them, and track them throughout the KV development. An higher pixel dwell time allows to better identify motile from immotile cilia, thus explaining some differences in quantification of immotile cilia in comparison with another recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferreira et al., 2017</xref>), We then imaged the same embryos from 3 to 8 ss (5 embryos; 294 cilia); we identified every motile and immotile cilium at each time point using the 3D stacks acquired, and then tracked them throughout time in 3D projections (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25165.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Immotile cilia are specified early in development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Still from <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> representing a wild-type embryo injected with 400 pg Arl13b-GFP at 1 cell stage.

Between 3 and 5 ss, we observed the highest rate of increase in the percentage of motile cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, F–K</xref>), which then tended to stabilize at 6–8 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, L–O</xref>). This is accompanied with a change in KV cell shape and anterior-dorsal cluster formation as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). While tracking cilia, we observed two main different types of cilia behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; 4 embryos; 231 cilia). We found that 79 ± 7% of cilia transitioned from immotile at 3 ss to motile at 8 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), while 16 ± 8% of cilia never became motile during the time-window of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We reasoned that if immotile cilia are always immotile from the beginning to the end of the KV lifetime then something should be determining the fate of such cilia very early in development.</p><p>In agreement with the increase in number of motile cilia from 3 to 8 ss, we also observed changes in the pattern of the KV fluid flow throughout development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As we had previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>) we can calculate the speed and direction of the KV fluid flow by tracking native particles present in the KV by bright field microscopy (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">3</xref>). Therefore, at 3–4 ss we observed a complete absence of directional fluid flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>; 5 embryos; 258 tracks), with the native particles presenting what seemed to be Brownian motion (2.32 ± 0.95 μm s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This observation is in agreement with the low number of beating cilia found at 3 ss (6 ± 5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Again, here our results contrast with those from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferreira et al. (2017)</xref>, which are built on numerical predictions of flow supported by a much lower number of immotile cilia. So, flow forces were calculated in different ways in the two studies, while we measured flow velocity by following native particles in live embryos averaged over a number of embryos, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferreira et al. (2017)</xref> mapped cilia position and tilting in live embryos and then predicted the flow forces based on numerical simulations. As development progressed and the number of beating cilia increased (5 ss – 63 ± 23%; 6 ss – 76 ± 8%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we began to observe a weak directional fluid flow at 5–6 ss (6.61 ± 3.26 μm s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), which at this time was still homogeneous throughout the KV (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> – G; 5 embryos; 309 tracks). Finally, at 7–8 ss, when the number of beating cilia began to stabilize (8 ss – 83 ± 6%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), the directional fluid flow acquired its characteristic velocity (9.81 ± 5.36 μm s<sup>−1</sup>) and heterogeneous pattern (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">Figure 2—video 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>), presenting a faster flow at the anterior-left quadrant of the KV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2I, K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> embryos, 128 tracks). While tracking native particles we could also account for cilia motility and thus by an independent method we confirmed our previous quantifications on the ratio between motile vs immotile cilia. This method was based on a high frame rate acquisitions (500 fps) using a high-speed video camera.. Again, we observed an increase in the percentage of motile cilia throughout development, ranging from 27% at 3–4 ss (4 embryos; 48 cilia; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), 70% at 5–6 ss (4 embryos; 63 cilia; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) to 84% at 7–8 ss (4 embryos; 89 cilia; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). We also determined the cilia beat frequency (CBF) at these three different stages and we found that cilia beat faster as development progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> – L, right panels). The CBFs calculated were 33 ± 4 Hz (4 embryos; 8 cilia), 37 ± 5 Hz (4 embryos; 29 cilia), and 40 ± 4 Hz (4 embryos; 34 cilia) for the 3–4 ss, 5–6 ss and 7–8 ss, respectively. The ciliary frequency at 7–8 ss was significantly higher than at 3–4 ss. Overall the values found for the percentage of motile cilia together with the CBF may account for the differences found in the velocity of the fluid flow throughout development.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25165.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Changes in KV flow and CBF through development observed in uninjected WT embryos.</title><p>Data was pooled from embryos at 3–4 (<bold>A–D</bold>), 5–6 (<bold>E–H</bold>), and 7–8 (<bold>I–L</bold>) somites stage.

To understand why <italic>dld</italic><sup>−/−</sup> had more motile cilia than control embryos we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of DFCs from WT and <italic>dld<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutant zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). After curation, we obtained a list of 706 genes with a linear fold change (FC) in transcription higher than 2 (Table S1a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Our intention was to determine which genes in <italic>dld</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutants were implicated specifically in cilia motility. Therefore, we decided to use the Cildb<sub>v2</sub> reference base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnaiz et al., 2009</xref>) and Genevenn algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pirooznia et al., 2007</xref>) to determine the hits in our list that had orthologues already associated with cilia motility in other model organisms. We chose <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a primary cilia model; and <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, a motile cilia/flagella model (Table S1b in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The intersection analysis between these models permitted us to distinguish the ciliary genes specific for motility in our list. Because <italic>foxj1a</italic> was up-regulated (FC = 1.62, p value = 0.029) in the microarray, we also compared our gene list with the list of Foxj1a-induced genes published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choksi et al. (2014)</xref>. The result of these intersections showed that 18% (129 genes) of the genes in our original list were related to ciliogenesis and of those, 67% (86 genes) were specifically related to motility (Table S1b in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Motility specific column). Among these were the known motility axonemal genes <italic>dnah7</italic> and <italic>dnah10</italic> (Dynein, Axonemal, Heavy Chain 7 and 10), <italic>rsph3</italic> and <italic>rsph9</italic> (Radial Spoke Head 3 and 9) together with <italic>dld</italic>, <italic>foxj1a</italic> and <italic>rfx2</italic>. The axonemal genes were up-regulated in <italic>dld</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutants and were therefore good candidates to explain the increased number of motile cilia. To validate some of the motility-associated genes obtained in the microarray, we focused on the following genes: the ciliogenesis master regulator, <italic>rfx2</italic> (<italic>regulator master x 2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Swoboda et al., 2000</xref>); the motile cilia master regulator <italic>foxj1a</italic>, the notch ligand, <italic>dld</italic>; and two motile cilia axonemal components, <italic>dnah7</italic> and <italic>rsph3</italic>. We performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) using mRNA extracted from fluorescently activated cell sorted DFCs. Of these 5 tested genes, only 3 (<italic>foxj1a</italic>, <italic>dld</italic>, and <italic>dnah7</italic>) showed consistent changes in transcription regulation between the two methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>), the microarray and qPCR analyses, also confirmed by in situ hybridization in bud stage and 8 somite stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Motile cilia fate decision is regulated by Notch signalling independently of Foxj1a</title><p>In order to check if Foxj1a, the master regulator of motility, was expressed in all KV cells or KV precursor cells, we decided to look at a zebrafish line that expresses GFP under a <italic>foxj1a</italic> minimal promoter (Tg:<italic>foxj1a:GFP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caron et al., 2012</xref>) and determined whether all WT KV cells were GFP positive. Our reasoning was that if we found that Foxj1a was absent in around 16–20% of WT DFCs, this alone could account for the lack of motility observed at 8 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We fixed embryos at 8 ss and by immunofluorescence with an antibody against GFP and another against acetylated alpha-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>), we confirmed that the number of <italic>foxj1a</italic>-positive cells and the number of cilia present in each KV were concordant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>; p=0.9479, 7 embryos, 514 cells, 513 cilia). This experiment showed that <italic>foxj1a:GFP</italic> was present in all KV cells despite the fact that some cells have immotile cilia throughout development. So, we then questioned how this <italic>foxj1a</italic> promoter related to the actual mRNA expression. We confirmed that, as reported before by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al. (2008)</xref> <italic>foxj1a</italic> mRNA is strongly expressed in the DFCs at bud stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). However, this early expression is not yet seen with the <italic>foxj1a</italic>:GFP minimum promoter described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caron et al. (2012)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caron et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, at 8 ss the mRNA expression of <italic>foxj1a</italic> is no longer observed in the KV, while it is detectable in the pronephros and neural tube, but the reporter shows GFP in all KV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C–E</xref>, respectively). So, we must conclude that this promoter is not faithfully representing the <italic>foxj1a</italic> gene expression along time. However, by comparing the foxj1a <italic>in situs</italic> with another reporter line for DFCs, the sox17:GFP reporter, we showed that the <italic>foxj1a</italic> mRNA staining closely matches the sox17:GFP labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Altogether these experiments suggest that <italic>foxj1a</italic> is expressed in all DFCs and that the foxj1a:GFP observed at 8 ss is due to a delayed reporter and/or GFP perdurance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25165.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title><italic>foxj1a</italic> is expressed in dorsal forerunner cells structurally specifying all cilia as motile cilia.</title><p>(<bold>A-C</bold>) In situ hybridization with <italic>foxj1a</italic> at bud stage in the dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs), in a control representative embryo (<bold>A</bold>) and upon NICD overexpression (<bold>B</bold>).

Therefore, in order to understand the crosstalk between NS and <italic>foxj1a</italic> in regulating cilia motility, we monitored the transcription levels of <italic>her12</italic> (<italic>hairy-related 12</italic>), <italic>dnah7</italic> and <italic>foxj1a</italic> itself while manipulating NS and Foxj1a protein levels. These genes were chosen because: i) <italic>her12</italic> is a NS direct transcription target in the tail bud and somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shankaran et al., 2007</xref>) and in this study we found that it is highly expressed in DFCs at bud stage, and down-regulated in <italic>dld<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants (Table S1a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thisse and Thisse, 2004</xref>); and ii) <italic>dnah7</italic> was reported to be a transcriptional target of Foxj1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choksi et al., 2014</xref>) and an essential structural component of motile cilia, without which zebrafish KV cilia become static (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to the expression levels of <italic>foxj1a</italic>, we found <italic>dnah7</italic> significantly up-regulated in <italic>dld<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>) and expressed in DFCs at bud stage (Table S1a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The restricted expression patterns of <italic>her12</italic>, <italic>foxj1a</italic> and <italic>dnah7</italic> at bud stage indicated that it was possible to use mRNA from whole embryos to determine their expression levels by qPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neugebauer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013</xref>). As a control of this procedure, we tested <italic>dnah9</italic> and <italic>rfx4,</italic> two genes that, despite being transcribed in DFCs were not influenced by NS, according to our microarray and qPCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>We then set out to manipulate the levels of NS by using the single mutants <italic>dld<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>delta like c</italic> (<italic>dlc<sup>−/−</sup></italic>), and the double mutant <italic>dlc<sup>−/−</sup>;dld<sup>−/−</sup></italic>. In order to increase NS we overexpressed Notch intracellular domain (NICD OE). Showing the efficiency of NS manipulations, the <italic>her12</italic> transcription levels behaved accordingly, being significantly lower in the <italic>dld<sup>−/−</sup>;dlc<sup>−/−</sup></italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and significantly higher in the NICD OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>For each NS manipulation we also interfered with the levels of Foxj1a. This was assured either by knocking down the <italic>foxj1a</italic> expression with a morpholino against <italic>foxj1a</italic> translation start site (Foxj1a KD) or by overexpressing it <italic>via</italic> the injection of <italic>Danio rerio foxj1a</italic> mRNA (Foxj1a OE). As expected, the <italic>dnah7</italic> expression served as readout of the Foxj1a manipulation efficiency, as its expression significantly correlated both with the endogenous levels of Foxj1a (Foxj1a Not Manipulated; NM) and upon its overexpression (Foxj1a OE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; Pearson’s correlation coefficient: r = 0.8799, p value = 0.0208; and r = 0.9523, p value = 0.0034, respectively). Moreover, when compared to the WT situation, the <italic>dnah7</italic> mRNA levels were significantly higher upon the Foxj1a OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This observation is in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choksi et al. (2014)</xref> who previously showed that <italic>dnah7</italic> is induced by Foxj1a. Concordantly, the transcription levels of <italic>dnah7</italic> were lower in the Foxj1a KD than in the control situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), demonstrating the efficiency of the morpholino in blocking the <italic>foxj1a</italic> mRNA translation. Interestingly, we observed that the changes in <italic>dnah7</italic> expression were dependent only on the variations in Foxj1a, irrespectively of the NS background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>; Pearson’s correlation coefficient: r = −0.1859, p value = 0.4198).</p><p>The quantification of the expression data led us to conclude that the regulation of <italic>foxj1a</italic> transcription by NS, uncovered in our microarray, was dependent on the NS context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). In short, the qPCR analysis showed that NS impacts indirectly on the transcription of <italic>dnah7</italic> by affecting <italic>foxj1a</italic> transcription levels. This data confirms the results obtained in the comparative transcriptome analysis between <italic>dld<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants and WT for the genes in question: <italic>her12</italic>, <italic>foxj1a</italic> and <italic>dnah7</italic>.</p><p>Next, to independently evaluate the impact on the combined manipulation of NS and Foxj1a levels on KV cilia motility we performed live imaging of KV cilia at 8 ss. We selected three NS conditions: <italic>dld<sup>−/−</sup>;dlc<sup>−/−</sup></italic> double mutants (low NS); WT embryos (normal NS); and embryos injected with <italic>NICD</italic> mRNA at 1 cell stage (high NS), while simultaneously manipulating the levels of Foxj1a by overexpressing it in the three experimental groups. We chose not to knockdown Foxj1a because this would lead to the loss of cilia altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). We decided to use the double mutants <italic>dld<sup>−/−</sup>;dlc<sup>−/−</sup></italic> because we had previously observed laterality defects in both <italic>dld<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>dlc<sup>−/−</sup></italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lopes et al., 2010</xref>) and more importantly, we wanted to avoid redundancy among the genes coding for the two Delta ligands. We filmed ciliary motility at 8 ss because by this stage we know that the anterior and left flow hotspots are established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), which we demonstrated before to be crucial for the L-R patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The live imaging analysis showed that when NS is reduced, the number of immotile cilia in the KV decreased significantly from 20 ± 5% in controls to 12 ± 4% in <italic>dld<sup>−/−</sup>;dlc<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; 24 embryos, 1047 total cilia in control; 7 embryos, 304 total cilia in <italic>dld<sup>−/−</sup>;dlc<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants). Conversely, when NS is increased, the number of immotile cilia increased from 20 ± 5% in controls to 31 ± 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; 8 embryos, 353 total cilia in NICD OE;). Importantly, NS levels interfered with the motile/immotile cilia ratio and not with the total number of cilia (24 embryos, 44 ± 12 cilia in Control versus 8 embryos, 44 ± 11 cilia in NICD OE,; p=0.9154) or with cilia length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Regarding cilia length, we evaluated the cilia length from all treatments done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. These experiments were done using a 50 pg of arl13b-GFP so that we could observe the cilia motion live. Using the same movies we have also measured cilia length in 3D. We found no differences between any treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Using the arl13b-GFP overexpression we have normalized cilia length. In this way, we could overcome the cilia length differences that Notch signaling manipulations produce and successfully uncouple cilia length from cilia motility.</p><p>So, despite the qPCR data showing a significant increase in both <italic>dnah7</italic> and <italic>foxj1a</italic> transcription levels after <italic>foxj1a</italic> was over-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>, respectively), live imaging experiments showed that there were no changes in the actual number of motile cilia when <italic>foxj1a</italic> was over-expressed, irrespective of the NS background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; nine embryos, 380 total cilia in Foxj1a OE; eight embryos, 368 total cilia in <italic>dld<sup>−/−</sup>;dlc<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants + Foxj1 a OE; eight embryos, 347 total cilia in NICD OE +Foxj1 a OE). We conclude that the failure of Foxj1a OE to increase the number of motile cilia, and specifically the failure in rescuing the loss of motile cilia in the NICD OE embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) strongly suggests that the KV cells are already committed to a certain motility fate. We propose NS modulates such functional decision downstream of Foxj1a function.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether a higher level of <italic>foxj1a</italic> transcription, as the one found in the <italic>dld</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutants, was causing increased CBFs on motile cilia. However, by overexpressing Foxj1a, we observed no significant change in motile cilia CBF (WT = 37.27 ± 7.202 Hz, Foxj1a OE = 36.30 ± 6.877 Hz; p=0.4990; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). This experiment also agreed with the fact that in <italic>dld</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutants, we did not observe an increase in CBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>). Our results suggest that this level of Foxj1a overexpression, despite eliciting the transcription of the downstream target <italic>dnah7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>) has no consequences in KV cilia motility, contrary to our initial assumptions.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether the Her12 transcription factor was directly involved in the regulation of the ratio between motile and immotile cilia. In order to test this hypothesis we overexpressed Her12 (Her12 OE) by injecting its mRNA at 1 cell stage and imaging the embryos at 8 ss. We observed a significant increase in the percentage of immotile cilia from 20% in controls to 27% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref>, 9 embryos, 305 total cilia), recapitulating the results observed in the NICD OE assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>Overall these observations indicate that, in parallel to the activation of the motile cilia program by <italic>foxj1a</italic> transcription, which should occur in all DFCs, NS decides which cilia will be stopped. Since both <italic>foxj1a</italic> and <italic>her12</italic> are expressed at bud stage in the DFCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thisse and Thisse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neugebauer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013</xref>), we reason that on one hand, Foxj1a specifies cilia capable of moving, while on the other hand, NS prevents the fulfilment of the motile cilia Foxj1a-activated program. This could be achieved either by structurally changing cilia (e.g. preventing the assembly of dynein arms), or by somehow inhibiting the motility of structurally motile cilia (e.g. switching off the dynein motors). To tackle these different scenarios in the absence of appropriate zebrafish antibodies, we cloned the coding sequence of <italic>dnal1</italic>, fused it to the mCherry fluorescent tag and injected this construct in <italic>arl13b-GFP</italic> transgenic embryos that enable live imaging of motile and immotile cilia. As Dnal1 is a light chain outer dynein arm axonemal dynein motor required for cilia movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horváth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mazor et al., 2011</xref>), we reasoned that if only motile cilia expressed this construct then we could favour the hypothesis that motile cilia were likely to be structurally different. On the other hand if immotile KV cilia also expressed the Dnal1 construct then we could predict that all KV cilia might be structurally similar. In this last scenario, perhaps some other factor capable of switching off the dynein motors ATPase activity could be occurring.</p><p>Our results showed that Dnal1 was present in both motile and immotile KV cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> – R; six embryos; compare K, N, Q with L, O, R). The quantification for the injection of the construct <italic>dnal1</italic>-mCherry was done in a sample of 56 cilia in a total of 4 embryos. In the sample of cilia positive for <italic>dnal1</italic>-mCherry, we saw 72% of motile cilia and 28% of immotile cilia. This ratio is not statistically different from the one for the controls used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> (p=0.17, Fisher test) meaning that the <italic>dnal1</italic>-mCherry construct did not affect the cilia motility status and that both motile and immotile cilia can express <italic>dnal1</italic>-mCherry. Importantly, primary cilia from the tail region around the KV were all negative for <italic>dnal1</italic>-mCherry, which shows that in a mild overexpression scenario, this construct cannot enter a primary cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J,M,P</xref>). Overall this experiment suggests that most KV cilia have dynein arms, i.e., may have the necessary machinery to move.</p><p>In order to have a definitive answer as to whether all KV cilia structurally belong to the sub-type of motile cilia, we performed transmitted electron microscopy by sampling the full KV of 3 embryos. We used 10 ss embryos and sectioned their KVs with 5–7 micron intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 4S</xref>). We imaged a total of 101 cilia, providing an average of 34 cilia per KV, which according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>, represents on average a random coverage of 77% of the cilia population of each KV. Our findings demonstrated that all cilia imaged had an ultra-structure characteristic of motile cilia. Some cilia had a clearly visible central pair while others showed an unfocused central pair and all cilia had visible dynein arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4U</xref> - W; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

We found a significant increase of 14% in the percentage of <italic>her12</italic> positive DFCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>; from 30 to 44 ± 11%; 9 embryos). This represents a 14% more than the percentage of immotile cilia detected at 8 ss for this treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This differences between <italic>her12</italic> positive cells and immotile cilia percentages could be explained by the existence of a fine-tuning mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basch et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we noticed that these cells were preferentially located at the posterior half of the DFC 3-dimensional cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>; 40 ± 5% and 60 ± 5% for the anterior and the posterior halves, respectively; 9 embryos). When NICD is over-expressed, regarding cell distribution, we noticed that <italic>her12</italic> positive cells became homogeneously distributed in both the anterior and posterior halves of the DFC cluster in contrast to the control situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>; 9 embryos).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Posterior to anterior cell transitions induce a bias in the distribution of immotile cilia upon NICD overexpression</title><p>It is well established that KV maturation involves changes in cell shape to form an anterior-dorsal cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roxo-Rosa et al., 2015</xref>) crucial for the anterior-left fluid flow hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). However, in light of the bias of <italic>her12</italic> positive DFCs at the posterior part of the DFC cluster in control embryos (at bud stage <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D,F,N</xref>), this led us to test a new hypothesis. Knowing that at 8 ss there is no anterior-posterior bias in the position of immotile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>) we postulated that in a WT embryo with 3 ss, more cells bearing immotile cilia would be present in the posterior part of the KV, judging from the expression pattern of <italic>her12</italic>. We thus predict that some of those cells will be pushed to the anterior part of the KV, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) and also confirmed here, leading to a homogeneous final distribution of immotile cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>; immotile cilia in blue) at 8 ss. On the other hand, when NICD was overexpressed, we found that the posterior bias of <italic>her12</italic> positive DFCs was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>), which should lead to a homogenous distribution of immotile cilia in the KV at 3 ss, prior to cell shape changes. Therefore, upon KV maturation, we predict an accumulation of immotile cilia in the anterior half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5P</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we looked again to the KVs scanned at 8 ss, and used them to create 3D reconstructions and to map the position of each immotile cilia for all treatments. Using the principles of the Cartesian referential and, establishing the centre of the KV as the origin (0, 0, 0) of the three coordinate axes, it was possible to attribute Cartesian coordinates (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>z</italic>) to each immotile cilium. Using this information, we were able to plot the distribution of the immotile cilia along the anterior-posterior, the dorsal–ventral, and the left–right axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q–V</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). Our results showed that the position of immotile cilia was homogeneous across all 3 axes in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q–S</xref>; 17 embryos; 159 cilia), when <italic>foxj1a</italic> is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>; 9 embryos; 89 cilia), and in the double mutant <italic>dld<sup>−/−</sup>;dlc<sup>−/−</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>; 7 embryos; 38 cilia). Only when NICD was overexpressed, was there a significant accumulation of immotile cilia at the anterior part of the KV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5T–V</xref>; 8 embryos; 107 cilia), thus supporting our hypothesis. To quantify which transitions in cell position were occurring (anterior to posterior, left to right, dorsal to ventral, or vice-versa) we revisited our time-lapse results and tracked the immotile cilia through development for the control situation. Overall, our results showed that in WT embryos, posterior to anterior transitions are the most common (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref> – B, four embryos, nine cilia transitions, 19 immotile cilia tracked), further confirming our model. Here we show one such immotile cilium transitioning from the posterior part of the KV (at three ss), to an anterior position (at eight ss). We found a total of 4 immotile cilia transitioning from a posterior position to a more anterior position in as many embryos. If we assume an average KV with 44 ± 12 cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), 20% of these cilia will be immotile, giving an approximate number of 8 immotile cilia. Since at bud stage, 60% of the <italic>her12</italic> positive cells are located at the posterior part of the DFCs cluster, five immotile cilia (60% of total immotile cilia) start at a more posterior position, while 3 (40% of total immotile cilia) will be positioned more anteriorly. Therefore, one immotile cilia transition from posterior to anterior would suffice in order to evenly distribute immotile cilia at eight ss. This analysis is concordant with the observed number of transitions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Notch signalling occurs between DFCs and surrounding cells</title><p>Finally, the accumulation of <italic>her12</italic> positive cells in the posterior half of the DFC cluster of control embryos led us to question how NS was occurring, i.e. which cells were DeltaD positive. Using a DeltaD specific antibody, we looked for the expression of DeltaD at bud stage in the vicinity of DFCs (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video2">Figure 5—video 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C–G</xref>).

Regarding <italic>dand5</italic> expression pattern, it correlated with the difference in the fluid flow: in contrast to 100% of asymmetric on the right in control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6E</xref>, 10 embryos), 42% of embryos overexpressing Her12 showed a symmetric expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6E</xref>, 12 embryos). In terms of organ <italic>situs</italic>, 41% of Her12 overexpressing embryos displayed heterotaxia (incorrect positioning of either the heart or liver; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6F</xref>, 75 embryos) while 100% of the control embryos showed left heart and left liver (<italic>situs solitus</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6F</xref>, 99 embryos). To test if the observed decrease in flow speed and pattern, as well as the change in <italic>dand5</italic> expression pattern and organ <italic>situs</italic> were not due to a change in cilia length we measured the cilia length from 7 KVs upon Her12 OE (without arl13b-GFP).

This increase in motility occurs as immotile cilia start acquiring motility throughout development as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). We report here an increase in the intensity of the fluid flow velocity together with a significant increase in the CBF from 3 to 8 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The changes in fluid flow velocity as the number of motile cilia increased are in line with our previous predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>), which dictated that a minimum of 30 cilia is necessary for a robust fluid flow showing anterior-left hotspots at 8 ss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2016</xref>).

To determine if that was in fact the case we observed the KV cilia in action, using fluorescent live imaging at 0.16 frames per second (fps) and a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels. Contrary to our expectations, we showed that the number of motile cilia was not affected by overexpressing <italic>foxj1a</italic>. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the balance between motile and immotile cilia is regulated by NS, similarly to what was reported in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> LRO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boskovski et al., 2013</xref>). However we did not detect the same interaction between NS and <italic>foxj1a</italic> as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boskovski et al. (2013)</xref>. Interactions between NS and Foxj1a have also been suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jurisch-Yaksi et al. (2013)</xref> who showed that decreased levels of Rer1 (retention in endoplasmic reticulum sorting receptor 1), lead to increased γ-secretase activity and consequently increased NS, which lead to decreased <italic>foxj1a</italic> levels in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013</xref>). They showed this interaction occurs in several ciliated organs, such as neuromasts, pronephros, olfactory pits, and the sensory patch of the inner ear. In KV, Rer1 knockdown causes the decrease of <italic>foxj1a</italic> expression, but unlike in other organs, when NS is increased, <italic>foxj1a</italic> levels remain unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013</xref>). This last observation concurs with our qPCR results that show that when NICD is over expressed, the expression of <italic>foxj1a</italic> is unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p><p>It is also known that NS affects Gemc1/MCIDAS, which are required for Foxj1 expression and multiciliated cell fate determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kyrousi et al., 2015</xref>). In this context NS indirectly regulates the pattern of multicilliated cells in the epidermis of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos and in the human airway epithelium, by the process of lateral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deblandre et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marcet et al., 2011a</xref>). Additionally, the epithelia of the pronephric ducts from zebrafish embryos also present two types of cells, a multiciliated cell and a monociliated principal cell. Their differentiation and patterning is also determined by a NS-dependent lateral inhibition mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma and Jiang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). In this organ, multiciliogenesis is also inhibited by NS, with multiciliated cells expressing <italic>rfx2</italic> and <italic>jagged2</italic>, and principal cells expressing <italic>notch3</italic> and <italic>her9</italic> (hairy-related 9, a NS downstream target) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma and Jiang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). In the three multicilliogenesis models discussed, it was suggested that NS inhibited multiciliogenesis by blocking the early expression of either <italic>foxj1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marcet et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marcet et al., 2011b</xref>) or <italic>rfx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma and Jiang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). There was an exclusion of expression patterns for <italic>foxj1/rfx2</italic> and <italic>notch</italic>, and it was this exclusion that triggered cell fate specification and differentiation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boskovski et al. (2013)</xref> also suggest that NS functions upstream of Foxj1 and Rfx2 in determining the cilia type at the Xenopus LRO. Nevertheless, they never tested whether overexpressing <italic>foxj1a</italic> would rescue the immotility phenotype observed when NS was up-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boskovski et al., 2013</xref>). We were the first to show in the present study that <italic>foxj1a</italic> overexpression fails to rescue the immotile cilia number caused by the up-regulation of NS provided by NICD injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We propose here that Foxj1a acts early to specify all KV cilia as motile cilia and then Notch signalling triggers an immotility switch. Our strongest evidence comes from the random sampling by transmitted electron microscopy that clearly points to all KV cilia being of the motile sub-type. As far as we are aware we were the first to sample the whole KV by transmitted electron microscopy and to provide a high number of analysed cilia. Collectively, our results show that NS is acting downstream of Foxj1a to establish immotility.</p><p>Additionally, this study provides a new player involved in the motility decision: Her12, a paralogue of the mouse Hes5, known as a <italic>bona fide</italic> NS transcriptional target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shankaran et al., 2007</xref>). In our hands <italic>her12</italic> transcription proved a faithful NS readout in the KV cell precursors. We thus suggest that DeltaD binds to Notch1a [as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shankaran et al. (2007)</xref>] to activate transcription of <italic>her12</italic>. Subsequently, Her12 perhaps together with other factors, restricts the number of motile cilia, most likely by inhibiting the early transcription of a yet unknown crucial motility switch. Here we determined that overexpressing <italic>her12</italic> resulted in a significant increase of immotile cilia in the anterior half of the KV, thereby softening the difference between anterior and posterior flow speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). We demonstrate that this flow pattern/intensity disruption impacted on the expression pattern of <italic>dand5</italic> (making it symmetric) and on organ <italic>situs</italic> generating heterotaxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). We would like to emphasize that the results presented here on motile/immotile cilia ratio were uncoupled from the cilia length defects that Notch signalling causes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lopes et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>A recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferreira et al. (2017)</xref> determined a considerably smaller percentage of immotile cilia in the zebrafish LRO. This discrepancy can be explained by the different pixel dwell times used during acquisition in the two different studies. The pixel dwell time was ten times higher in our study, meaning that while we spent 22.4 microseconds per pixel, Ferreira et al. spent 2.4 microseconds. This parameter measures the time that is spent scanning on each pixel, so the longer the dwell time on a particular pixel, the more signal will be detected and the less it will be distorted. In opposition, the faster the scanning the more distorted becomes the imaged object and any cilia movement, even when caused passively by the KV flow bending immotile cilia, will produce a cilium blur that may be inaccurately scored as a motile cilium. Therefore, a longer pixel dwell time is crucial because it will produce a very sharp image of the trajectory of each cilium, reconstituting the beating pattern of a motile cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), or in the case of an immotile cilium it will show a very bright stiff cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, the number of discarded cilia by Ferreira et al. may have biased the ratio between motile and immotile cilia. We are aware that immotile cilia can be difficult to detect in 3D reconstructions due to cilia passive motion. In our own study to accurately identify immotile cilia we compared the 3D stacks side by side with the corresponding 3D reconstruction. For some immotile cilia this was crucial due to the smoother blur these may show in a 3D reconstruction. According to Ferreira et al. some embryos at 8 somites show 0% of immotile cilia which contrasts with the 20% we have detected by two independent methods.</p><p>Finally, the reason why immotile cilia detection method is important to be clarified is because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferreira et al. (2017)</xref> refute the immotile cilia mechanosensory hypothesis based on their results. We therefore cannot agree with such conclusion. In fact, according to Ferreira et al. own theory for mechanosensation to work, we would need at least 3 immotile cilia on each LR side to discern noise from productive flow. Therefore based on our results and their theory, we can conclude that from 5 to 6 somite stage, we have enough immotile cilia per KV to be able to sense flow (13 cilia at 5 ss and 9 cilia at 8 ss, on average, which is more than 3 cilia on each side). So, overall we propose that the mechanosensing hypothesis cannot be excluded until demonstration of a chemosensing or mixed mechanism emerges.</p><p>Taken together it is possible to conclude that the balance between motile and immotile LRO cilia in zebrafish needs to be tightly regulated for the proper establishment of the L-R axis, by producing a robust, and most importantly, a heterogeneous patterned fluid flow. We would like to stress that in opposition to the mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shinohara et al., 2012</xref>) the fish LRO is very sensitive to motile cilia number and localization, most likely because of the different topographies of these two LROs. Whereas in mouse all motile cilia are on the floor of the node contributing to the effective flow, in zebrafish ventral pole cilia are antagonistic to the desired flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish lines</title><p>For the microarray and respective qPCR assays we used transgenic sox17:GFP zebrafish on WT AB background (gift from Carl-Philipp Heisenberg) and on deltaD/aei<sup>tr233</sup> homozygous mutant AB background.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and four reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Taveres et al. addresses the role of Notch signaling in determining the ratio of motile/immotile cilia in Kupffer's Vesicle (KV) through its target, <italic>her12</italic>. The left-right organizers (LROs) in mouse, <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish are known to contain both motile and immotile cilia which has led to the two-cilia hypothesis, where two types of cilia are required to produce and sense flow during left-right patterning. Experiments in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> LRO by Boskovski (2013) put forth evidence that Notch signaling affects the ratio of motile to immotile cilia and this was proposed to occur by suppressing Foxj1 and RFX gene expression, critical regulators required for motile cilia to form. However, work, mainly by the Lopes lab, has shown that Notch signaling promotes longer cilia in zebrafish LRO, a finding seemingly at odds with those in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, since motile cilia tend to be longer than sensory cilia. The current manuscript attempts to resolve some of these issues by examining genes downstream of Notch signaling in the zebrafish LRO. The results presented are extensive. The overall impression is that the conclusions are not suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> but that upon revision the work may be.</p><p>The first two figures document when immotile and motile cilia arise developmentally as the LRO forms in Zebrafish and how this correlates with the appearance of flow. These experiments ground the subsequent analysis. The authors then present a transcriptomic analysis of Delta mutants, finding that Foxj1 and motile cilia components appear to be Notch regulated, but then the story gets complicated. First, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-D</xref> they argue that Foxj1 is not differentially regulated in the LRO, despite the differential expression in the microarray. The clear limitation with the experiment is that they use a minimal promoter driving GFP to carry out this analysis, and one wonders whether the regulation via Notch is simply not capture by this reporter. There is no attempt to show that the minimal promoter is a faithful proxy for endogenous <italic>foxj1a</italic> expression in the KV. Ideally Foxj1a protein would be tracked through an antibody staining, but if that is not possible then an in situ for <italic>foxj1a</italic> expression (similar to what was done for <italic>her12</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is necessary to show that <italic>foxj1a</italic> expression is uniform throughout the KV. Along the same lines, from the image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, there may be differing levels of <italic>foxj1a::GFP</italic> expression in some cells – could all cells be green, but there be significant differences in expression that could account for the reasonably subtle effects on motility that are observed?</p><p>In addition, the authors do not ask whether the expression of this reporter changes when Notch signaling is altered. They show qPCR results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> but the results are also complicated: Foxj1a goes up in single Delta mutants but is largely unchanged in the double mutants, and NICD has no affect. Finally, the ratio between motile and immotile cilia in the LRO when Notch signaling or Foxj1 activity is manipulated barely changes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, even when Notch ICD, or <italic>her12</italic>, overexpression is used. This result is not compatible with the idea that Notch/Her12 signaling has a major impact on motile cilia formation. The simplest interpretation of these results is that neither Notch nor Fox and may suggest that the rather limited input seen with Notch is unlikely to be direct. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> also do not provide much in the way of additional support for the author's conclusion that Notch/<italic>her12</italic> is a major regulator of the motile/immotile decision. The number of <italic>her12</italic> expressing cells goes up to 70% in a NICD experiment, but the number of immotile cilia only changes from the wild type by maybe 5% on average. The authors also focus on the number of anterior versus posterior immotile cilia in NICD injected embryo but again these results document subtle differences. Some comment should be made on the relative importance of Notch/<italic>her12</italic> pathway compared to other regulators of ciliary motility.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, Imaging at 0.16 fps seems to slow to quantify reliably the rotational speed of motile cilia. This might be the reason that the authors did not detect any difference in H. The reference the authors provide (Sampiao et al) images at 500fps, which is a 10 fold oversampling in relation to CBF and sufficient to resolve cilia movement. The authors should repeat the experiment using faster imaging, as, if it turns out that the CBF is reduced after NICD or Her12 overexpression, the interpretation of the data will change. It would also be helpful to know the frame rates used in the other figures. For example, what frame rates for imaging motile cilia 4Q-V?</p><p>The authors present data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, suggesting that a subtle change in the motile/immotile cilia ratio causes heterotaxy. However, the author's own work in Development (2010) shows that Notch signaling also affects the length of cilia, which one might predict would affect ciliary flow in KV. The authors have not examined cilia length in any of the experiments reported here, making it unclear how they dissociate length versus number of motile/nonmotile cilia in terms of generating the phenotype. The authors need to address the confounding issue of effects on ciliary length versus motility/immotility.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Notch/Her12 signalling modulates motile/immotile cilia ratio downstream of Foxj1a in zebrafish left-right organizer&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

As you will read, most of the points can be addressed with textual changes. One point will require analysis of data that I suspect that you may have in hand. The final point, which the reviewer thinks is important, may require an additional loss of function experiment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The revised manuscript by Lopes and colleagues has improved over the previous version, although technical difficulties prevent them from addressing several critical issues. The main strength of the manuscript is that it raises some interesting ideas about the nature of immotile cilia in the KV, and how they might arise. It further fuels the controversy about whether flow is sensed by immotile sensory cilia, or by another mechanism during left-right patterning. It also raises the possibility that Notch is influencing immotile cilia differentiation, in a mechanism that is independent of Foxj1, in contrast to what has been reported in <italic>Xenopus</italic> by the Khoka lab. The authors have included some additional data, like the TEM analysis, which adds further to the considerable amount of data included in the manuscript. At the same time, there are several issues I think still could be addressed to make this a manuscript suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The first two figures document how the ratio of motile to immotile cilia changes over time during the formation of the KV. The recent <italic>eLife</italic> paper from Ferreira et al. (2017), which carried out a similar analysis, reaches significantly different conclusions. I am sympathetic to the author's plight, since their work is under review, as a competing manuscript is published. Nonetheless, I feel that there needs to be a more thorough discussion of the marked discrepancy between the two papers (now only briefly mentioned in passing in the Discussion), beginning in the Results section. Otherwise, we have two <italic>eLife</italic> papers reaching different conclusions about the number of motile versus immotile cilia in the KV, leaving the general reader with the impression that scoring these numbers is very unreliable. This discrepancy, for example, is critical when assessing the fact that manipulating Notch signaling only causes a very small number of cilia to switch from immotile to motile, or vice versa.</p><p>2) The previous review asked the authors to validate their conclusion based on the microarray analysis that decreasing Notch signaling in the KV (which leads to a decrease in immotile cilia) increases the expression of Foxj1 and some key targets of Foxj1 required for cilia motility. Apparently this is technically difficult to do since the promoter reporter doesn't recapitulate the normal expression of Foxj1 and the in situ protocol they are using does not have the resolution they need to examine expression in the small number of cells with immotile cilium, where this expression would be predicted to change. And so in the end, whether or not Foxj1 or motile gene expression is affected by Notch in the KV remains unknown. The expression data on Her12 seems clear. However that on <italic>foxj1</italic> and <italic>dnah7</italic> is not: microarray data reports a change, but then the authors seem to want to conclude they are not changed based on low-resolution detection methods that wouldn't necessarily detect the critical changes in a small percentage of cells. In addition, the quantitative PCR does not support a consistent change as predicted by microarray results. The authors could do a much better job summarizing the expression data than the current one written in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Motile cilia fate decision is regulated by Notch signalling independently of Foxj1a”. In addition, the two supplemental figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and 2) describing G0 term analysis of the microarray data seems not to present information that is informative. I would highly recommend removing these data from the manuscript, especially since the microarray data have not been validated in a meaningful way.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> relate to the expression of Her12 as a Notch target gene that the authors conclude is required for setting the ratio of motile to immotile cilia. It is rather surprising that this conclusion is reached without a loss-of-function analysis, showing that Her12 normally plays a role in cilia motility and left-right patterning. This seems to be a major omission for a critical point made in the manuscript.</p><p>4) The DnaI1-GFP data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-I</xref> are potentially valuable since they support the author's suggestion that the immotile cilia in the KV are not simply sensory cilia, but have motile features. However, the analysis of Dnal1-GFP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> cannot be published as is, and needs to be quantified by examining localization over a large number of cilia.</p><p>5) The authors previously showed that manipulating Notch in the KV affects overall cilia length and left-right patterning. In this paper, they argue that they bypass this effect by overexpressing Arl13b (which causes cilia lengthening) so that they can then assess how left-right patterning is affected by a change in the ratio of motile and immotile cilia upon alteration by Notch. This might be kosher, but how Arl13b promotes cilia lengthening is not well understood (maybe more membrane than axoneme?). By using Arl13b to correct cilia length, have they really corrected the effects of Notch on cilia length and function they previously reported? This technical limitation is significant and really needs to be discussed explicitly in a way that makes this caveat clear, so that the reader understands the limitations in the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25165.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript by Tavares et al. addresses the role of Notch signaling in determining the ratio of motile/immotile cilia in Kupffer's Vesicle (KV) through its target, her12.

However, all our transcriptomic analysis is done at bud and relates to the dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) where <italic>foxj1a</italic> mRNA is expressed in the DFCs, as reported by several authors such as, Yu et al. Nat Genet. 2008; Tian et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009; Lopes et al. Development. 2010.

So, we can now conclude that DFC cells express <italic>foxj1a</italic>, meaning that the <italic>foxj1a:GFP</italic> we reported at 8 somite-stage is likely due to a delay in the reporter line or to GFP perdurance. Nevertheless it shows that <italic>foxj1a</italic> was expressed in those cells. The older <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-D</xref> was moved to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-E</xref> and replaced by DFC cluster <italic>foxj1a</italic> in situ hybridization and sox17:GFP staining.</p><p>We would like to highlight that we did not use the <italic>foxj1a:GFP</italic> line for any experiments apart from making the point that all ciliated KV cells have expressed <italic>foxj1a</italic> during their developmental path.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along the same lines, from the image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, there may be differing levels of foxj1a::GFP expression in some cells – could all cells be green, but there be significant differences in expression that could account for the reasonably subtle effects on motility that are observed?</p></disp-quote><p>That is an interesting question. We now checked this possibility by analyzing live imaging of motile and immotile cilia (labeled by arl13b-GFP) in embryos from the <italic>foxj1a:GFP</italic> line at 8 somite-stage. We quantified the fluorescent levels in every cell and checked if cells with motile cilia had higher levels of fluorescence than cells with immotile cilia, as suggested by the reviewer. Although we found some differences in GFP fluorescence intensity levels, we found no significant correlation between this and motility (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We decided to show this data here and did not include it in the manuscript because we did not use this line for any further analysis in our study.

We looked for <italic>foxj1a</italic> expression by in situ hybridization at bud stage upon NICD OE. We did this experiment using a sox17:GFP reporter line that specifically labels DFCs at bud stage. The results showed that the two labeling coincide in the DFC cluster (KV precursor cells). However, we could not provide single cell resolution because the fast red development stopped working. We repeated the experiment 5 times in the last month and changed all the buffers and reagents but still it is not working. With more time we could troubleshoot what is going wrong. We decided to include the images from the NBT-BCIP purple staining and the corresponding Sox17:GFP labeling after immune-staining with anti-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-C</xref>). In order to do it in 3D we need the fast red staining to work. However, faced with the new results from the ultrastructural data we decided to go ahead with the resubmission since we provide evidence that all cells are likely expressing <italic>foxj1a</italic> in the DFCs because we only detected motile cilia in the KV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They show qPCR results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> but the results are also complicated: Foxj1a goes up in single Delta mutants but is largely unchanged in the double mutants, and NICD has no affect.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the fact that neither the double Delta mutants nor NICD have impact on <italic>foxj1a</italic> mRNA suggests that Notch signaling has no effect on <italic>foxj1a</italic> expression under these manipulations.

Results show that comparing the DFC in situ hybridization staining between WT and NICD there are no apparent differences in pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-C</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the ratio between motile and immotile cilia in the LRO when Notch signaling or Foxj1 activity is manipulated barely changes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, even when Notch ICD, or her12, overexpression is used. This result is not compatible with the idea that Notch/Her12 signaling has a major impact on motile cilia formation. The simplest interpretation of these results is that neither Notch nor Fox and may suggest that the rather limited input seen with Notch is unlikely to be direct.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed overexpressing Foxj1a does not change the ratio and that is exactly our point because we argue that only Notch signaling does that. Notch signaling manipulations make a 10% difference in the motility ratio. We concur that this may seem mild and that it may show an indirect regulation by Notch, but based on our previous work we argue that 10% difference is relevant. The justification comes from numerical simulations reported in Sampaio et al. (2014). We have concluded that a minimum number of 30 motile cilia is necessary to ensure a correct left-right in zebrafish. So, if increasing Notch signaling results in less 10% of motile cilia this will have an impact in left-right as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> demonstrates. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>, we present data on total cilia number for 24 embryos; 1047 cilia. Based on this data, on average, one KV shows 41 cilia (SD = 7.318), of which only 80% are motile, meaning on average each KV has 33 motile cilia. If we now take 10% of these motile cilia due to NICD manipulation, this number would drop to 30 motile cilia. This average number is dangerous because it is borderline the predicted minimum 30. Meaning that some embryos would have less than 30.</p><p>In addition, the localization of these immotile cilia is crucial. If they are placed in the dorsal anterior cluster they might disrupt it and abolish the anterior faster speed characteristic of all the WT embryos and greatly responsible for the correct left–right output (as demonstrated in many of our recent papers; Sampaio et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2014 and Montenegro–Johnson et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> also do not provide much in the way of additional support for the author's conclusion that Notch/her12 is a major regulator of the motile/immotile decision. The number of her12 expressing cells goes up to 70% in a NICD experiment, but the number of immotile cilia only changes from the wild type by maybe 5% on average.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer focused on the maximum and minimum values. The average value for <italic>her12</italic> positive cells is 40% for NICD OE and the number of immotile cilia is 30% for the same manipulation. So, we interpret these 10% discrepancy as suggestive of a fine-tuning process typical in development and agree that it also opens the possibility for other players being involved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also focus on the number of anterior versus posterior immotile cilia in NICD injected embryo but again these results document subtle differences. Some comment should be made on the relative importance of Notch/her12 pathway compared to other regulators of ciliary motility.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the difference may be subtle as we explained above but still be relevant because of the two variables at stake:</p><p>1) number of motile cilia must be above 30</p><p>2) position of the immotile cilia should not disrupt the anterior dorsal cluster. In the flow map from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-D</xref>, we can appreciate that the flow at the dorsal anterior corner is weaker and that the bias in the anterior vs. posterior flow was lost (see flow plot). We now analyzed where are the immotile cilia upon <italic>her12</italic> OE by live imaging and scored their position in each KV half in the anterior-posterior axis. We show that there is a clear increase in the number of immotile cilia at the anterior half of the KV explaining the weaker flow speed at this position.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, Imaging at 0.16 fps seems to slow to quantify reliably the rotational speed of motile cilia. This might be the reason that the authors did not detect any difference in H. The reference the authors provide (Sampiao et al) images at 500fps, which is a 10 fold oversampling in relation to CBF and sufficient to resolve cilia movement. The authors should repeat the experiment using faster imaging, as, if it turns out that the CBF is reduced after NICD or Her12 overexpression, the interpretation of the data will change. It would also be helpful to know the frame rates used in the other figures. For example, what frame rates for imaging motile cilia 4Q-V?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being clear enough in the Materials and methods section. There are two very different aims here and each had its own specific imaging requirements:</p><p>1) For distinguishing motile versus immotile cilia we used 0.16 fps in a slow scanning mode in a 2-photon microscope. Under these conditions we can unequivocally identify all immotile cilia in the whole KV in 3D (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This slow scanning method was used to produce the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q-V</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H-I</xref>.</p><p>2) To evaluate cilia beat frequency (CBF) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>, we used 500 fps provided by high-speed video-microscopy described in Sampaio et al. 2014 for the midplane of the KV. Therefore, we are sure that there are no differences between WT and foxj1a OE regarding CBF. As for NICD and <italic>her12</italic> OE we did not evaluate CBF because the focus of the study was on the ratio between motile vs. immotile cilia. The high-speed videomicroscopy system that we have does not allow us to reconstruct the KV in 3D and does not allow fluorescence imaging (yet).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors present data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, suggesting that a subtle change in the motile/immotile cilia ratio causes heterotaxy. However, the author's own work in Development (2010) shows that Notch signaling also affects the length of cilia, which one might predict would affect ciliary flow in KV. The authors have not examined cilia length in any of the experiments reported here, making it unclear how they dissociate length versus number of motile/nonmotile cilia in terms of generating the phenotype. The authors need to address the confounding issue of effects on ciliary length versus motility/immotility.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree with the reviewer that this was a major weakness of the study. We have now addressed this point and provide extensive data on cilia length. We first evaluated the cilia length from all treatments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. These experiments were done using a 50 pg of arl13b-GFP so that we could observe the cilia motion live. Using the same videos we have now measured cilia length. We used a 3D measuring tool named Simple Neurite Tracer a plugin for FIJI (Longair MH, Baker DA, Armstrong JD. Simple Neurite Tracer: Open Source software for reconstruction, visualization and analysis of neuronal processes. Bioinformatics 2011).</p><p>We found no differences between treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Using the arl13b-GFP overexpression we have normalized the cilia length. In this way, we could overcome the cilia length differences that Notch signaling manipulations produce and successfully uncouple cilia length from cilia motility.</p><p>Furthermore, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> we showed that laterality defects were produced by <italic>her12</italic> OE without using arl13b-GFP. We suggested that defects on <italic>dand5</italic> expression pattern and organ situs are likely caused by incorrect speed and defective flow pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, it was important to check if <italic>her12</italic> overexpression (alone) could produce any cilia length phenotype. Our results showed that overexpressing <italic>her12</italic> at 50 pg had no impact on cilia length. This new data was included in the main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> as well as in the text.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>One reviewer still has substantive concerns about this work. As you will read, most of the points can be addressed with textual changes. One point will require analysis of data that I suspect that you may have in hand. The final point, which the reviewer thinks is important, may require an additional loss of function experiment.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The revised manuscript by Lopes and colleagues has improved over the previous version, although technical difficulties prevent them from addressing several critical issues. The main strength of the manuscript is that it raises some interesting ideas about the nature of immotile cilia in the KV, and how they might arise. It further fuels the controversy about whether flow is sensed by immotile sensory cilia, or by another mechanism during left-right patterning. It also raises the possibility that Notch is influencing immotile cilia differentiation, in a mechanism that is independent of Foxj1, in contrast to what has been reported in Xenopus by the Khoka lab. The authors have included some additional data, like the TEM analysis, which adds further to the considerable amount of data included in the manuscript. At the same time, there are several issues I think still could be addressed to make this a manuscript suitable for eLife.</p><p>1) The first two figures document how the ratio of motile to immotile cilia changes over time during the formation of the KV. The recent eLife paper from Ferreira et al. (2017), which carried out a similar analysis, reaches significantly different conclusions. I am sympathetic to the author's plight, since their work is under review, as a competing manuscript is published. Nonetheless, I feel that there needs to be a more thorough discussion of the marked discrepancy between the two papers (now only briefly mentioned in passing in the Discussion), beginning in the Results section. Otherwise, we have two eLife papers reaching different conclusions about the number of motile versus immotile cilia in the KV, leaving the general reader with the impression that scoring these numbers is very unreliable. This discrepancy, for example, is critical when assessing the fact that manipulating Notch signaling only causes a very small number of cilia to switch from immotile to motile, or vice versa.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this opportunity. We agree that the manuscript from Ferreira et al. 2017 is an elegant and important study that deserves to be properly discussed in our manuscript. We have now included more discussion points along the manuscript including a reference in the Introduction, notes in the Results and Discussion sections. We think the comparison of the two studies brings novelty to the field but most importantly it should make us hold on a bit longer to the mechanosensory hypothesis.</p><p>The main difference in our studies is the identification of the number of immotile cilia present in each KV. We have identified 2 sources for this discrepancy:</p><p>1) pixel dwell times are different</p><p>2) number of discarded cilia in Ferreira et al. study</p><p>The consequence of the higher number of immotile cilia that we detected compared to Ferreira et al. is that according to their own theory, the mechanosensory hypothesis would still hold true because we detect more than 3 immotile cilia on each KV side.</p><p>So, we have inserted the following comments in the manuscript:</p><p>“By scanning the whole KV at a low speed (0.16 frames per second, fps) in a slow scanning mode by using a high pixel dwell time (22.4 microseconds) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) it was possible to accurately distinguish the motile cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) from the immotile cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), quantify them, and track them throughout the KV development. An higher pixel dwell time allows to better identify motile from immotile cilia, thus explaining some differences in quantification of immotile cilia in comparison with another recent work [Ferreira et al., 2017], We then imaged the same embryos from 3 to 8 ss (5 embryos; 294 cilia); we identified every motile and immotile cilium at each time point using the 3D stacks acquired, and then tracked them throughout time in 3D projections (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).”</p><p>“Again, here our results contrast with those from Ferreira et al. [Ferreira et al., 2017], which are built on numerical predictions of flow supported by a much lower number of immotile cilia. […] This method was based on a high frame rate acquisitions (500 fps) using a high-speed video camera.”</p><p>Note (not in the text)</p><p>To experimentally validate their modulations the authors redirect the readers to data from Supatto et al. 2008. After careful screening of this referenced paper we could not find detailed data referring to particle tracks on precise developmental stages that we could use to compare with our own experimental data. More importantly, the flow experiments seem to start only after 6 somite-stage therefore there is no information on earlier stages. On the other hand, we are reporting that at 3 somite-stage we did not detect directional flow in contrast to Ferreira et al. predicted modulations. These discrepancies are important examples that emerge from using different methods.</p><p>In the Discussion section, the fifth paragraph now reads:</p><p>“A recent work by Ferreira et al. (2017) determined a considerably smaller percentage of immotile cilia in the zebrafish LRO [Ferreira et al., 2017]. […] So, overall we propose that the mechanosensing hypothesis cannot be excluded until demonstration of a chemosensing or mixed mechanism emerges.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The previous review asked the authors to validate their conclusion based on the microarray analysis that decreasing Notch signaling in the KV (which leads to a decrease in immotile cilia) increases the expression of Foxj1 and some key targets of Foxj1 required for cilia motility. Apparently this is technically difficult to do since the promoter reporter doesn't recapitulate the normal expression of Foxj1 and the in situ protocol they are using does not have the resolution they need to examine expression in the small number of cells with immotile cilium, where this expression would be predicted to change. And so in the end, whether or not Foxj1 or motile gene expression is affected by Notch in the KV remains unknown.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify these points a bit better. The reviewer is correct. However, we do not question that there are different levels of <italic>foxj1a</italic> mRNA under different Notch signaling manipulations. We, in fact show microarray and qPCR data confirming these differences. What we argue is that those differences are not responsible for the change in motility ratio between motile and immotile cilia, since when we overexpress Foxj1a we still see the same ratio as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These observations lead us to think that all cells have motile cilia but something dependent on Notch is stopping 20% of these cilia at 8 ss. This hypothesis is now backed-up by the EM data that we have added to the manuscript.</p><p>We also wrote regarding the <italic>foxj1a</italic> minimum promoter that it has a problem in time but not in space: “we must conclude that this promoter is not faithfully representing the <italic>foxj1a</italic> gene expression along time” and then we conclude:</p><p>“Altogether these experiments suggest that <italic>foxj1a</italic> is expressed in all DFCs and that the foxj1a:GFP observed at 8 ss is due to a delayed reporter and/or GFP perdurance”.</p><p>So the differences in <italic>foxj1a</italic> mRNA levels that we detected by microarray in <italic>dld</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants and were confirmed by qPCR are not responsible for the motility ratio phenotype. They were the clue that started this story but ended up not being the reason behind the motility phenotype. We suggest here in this manuscript that the reason is downstream of Her12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The expression data on Her12 seems clear. However that on foxj1 and dnah7 is not: microarray data reports a change, but then the authors seem to want to conclude they are not changed based on low-resolution detection methods that wouldn't necessarily detect the critical changes in a small percentage of cells. In addition, the quantitative PCR does not support a consistent change as predicted by microarray results.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the qPCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) we show that the single mutant for <italic>dld</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>dlc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> both up-regulate <italic>foxj1a</italic> and therefore <italic>dnah7</italic>, confirming the microarray results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors could do a much better job summarizing the expression data than the current one written in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Motile cilia fate decision is regulated by Notch signalling independently of Foxj1a”. In addition, the two supplemental figures (Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2) describing G0 term analysis of the microarray data seems not to present information that is informative. I would highly recommend removing these data from the manuscript, especially since the microarray data have not been validated in a meaningful way.</p></disp-quote><p>We summarized the data the best we can, as requested by the reviewer, and have removed the figures as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> relate to the expression of Her12 as a Notch target gene that the authors conclude is required for setting the ratio of motile to immotile cilia. It is rather surprising that this conclusion is reached without a loss-of-function analysis, showing that Her12 normally plays a role in cilia motility and left-right patterning. This seems to be a major omission for a critical point made in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Not addressed because reviewer withdrew the request after further clarifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The DnaI1-GFP data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-I</xref> are potentially valuable since they support the author's suggestion that the immotile cilia in the KV are not simply sensory cilia, but have motile features. However, the analysis of Dnal1-GFP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> cannot be published as is, and needs to be quantified by examining localization over a large number of cilia.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this mistake we should have included this quantification before.</p><p>The revised manuscript now reads:</p><p>“The quantification for the injection of the construct <italic>dnal1</italic>-mCherry was done in a sample of 56 cilia in a total of 4 embryos. In the sample of cilia positive for <italic>dnal1</italic>-mCherry, we saw 72% of motile cilia and 28% of immotile cilia. […] Overall this experiment suggests that most KV cilia have dynein arms, i.e., may have the necessary machinery to move.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors previously showed that manipulating Notch in the KV affects overall cilia length and left-right patterning. In this paper, they argue that they bypass this effect by overexpressing Arl13b (which causes cilia lengthening) so that they can then assess how left-right patterning is affected by a change in the ratio of motile and immotile cilia upon alteration by Notch. This might be kosher, but how Arl13b promotes cilia lengthening is not well understood (maybe more membrane than axoneme?). By using Arl13b to correct cilia length, have they really corrected the effects of Notch on cilia length and function they previously reported? This technical limitation is significant and really needs to be discussed explicitly in a way that makes this caveat clear, so that the reader understands the limitations in the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this concern we think we have now clarified this issue in the text. We have published on cilia length and Arl13b this year. The mechanism that leads to cilia length increase seems to be membrane derived and not IFT derived. However it is still not clear how the tubulin cytoskeleton follows the membrane growth. We have studied the impact of longer KV cilia on flow and found it is surprisingly rather mild (Dynamics of cilia length in left–right development. P. Pintado, P. Sampaio, B. Tavares, T. D.
