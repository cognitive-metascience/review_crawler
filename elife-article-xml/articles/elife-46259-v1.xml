insecticidal nematodes. To exert its potent insecticidal effects, it elaborates a myriad of toxins and small molecule effectors. Among these, the <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> Virulence Cassettes (PVCs) represent an elegant self-contained delivery mechanism for diverse protein toxins. Importantly, these self-contained nanosyringes overcome host cell membrane barriers, and act independently, at a distance from the bacteria itself. In this study, we demonstrate that Pnf, a PVC needle complex associated toxin, is a Rho-GTPase, which acts via deamidation and transglutamination to disrupt the cytoskeleton. TEM and Western blots have shown a physical association between Pnf and its cognate PVC delivery mechanism. We demonstrate that for Pnf to exert its effect, translocation across the cell membrane is absolutely essential.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46259.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Photorhabdus</italic> are the only known group of non-marine bacteria that can produce their own light. These organisms prey on insects, which then glow in the dark once infected. The group also has an unusual weapon system formed of miniscule needle-like structures that can be sent out in the environment. These ‘<italic>Photorhabdus</italic> virulence cassettes’ are loaded with toxins that are injected inside host cells; the cassettes alone can kill a caterpillar within minutes. However, it is still unclear how exactly these structures work: are they like poison darts, with the toxin on the outside, or like hypodermic needles, with the toxin within?</p><p><italic>Photorhabdus</italic> bacteria make lots of deadly substances, so to look at the needles on their own, Vlisidou et al. had them produced by another species of bacteria that does not carry these weapons. The experiments revealed that the cassettes packaged the toxic proteins inside, like a hypodermic needle. Alone in the environment, the toxin cannot penetrate host cells.</p><p>Creating the cassettes takes a lot of energy, and a closer look at <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> showed that, at any given time during an infection, only a small number of bacteria produce them. It is therefore possible that the bacteria share the high cost of making these deadly devices by using a division of labour approach.</p><p>With a better understanding of the cassettes, it could one day become possible to harness these molecular machines to control insect pests or parasites.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Photorhabdus</italic></kwd><kwd>toxins</kwd><kwd>secretion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/C008367/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vlisidou</surname><given-names>Isabella</given-names></name><name><surname>Waterfield</surname><given-names>Nicholas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPG-2015-194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hapeshi</surname><given-names>Alexia</given-names></name><name><surname>Waterfield</surname><given-names>Nicholas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004443</institution-id><institution>Warwick Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start up package</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hapeshi</surname><given-names>Alexia</given-names></name><name><surname>Waterfield</surname><given-names>Nicholas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DTPEP/F500378/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Healey</surname><given-names>Joseph RJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N014294/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smart</surname><given-names>Katie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/E021328/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waterfield</surname><given-names>Nicholas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The insect pathogenic bacterium <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> has evolved astonishing nano-scale analogues of hypodermic syringes that it uses to inject toxins into host cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae genus <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> exist in a symbiotic partnership with entomopathogenic <italic>Heterorhabditis</italic> sp. nematodes. This Entomopathogenic Nematode complex (EPN) comprises a highly efficient symbiosis of pathogens that is commonly used as a biological agent to control crop pests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forst et al., 1997</xref>). The <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> bacteria are delivered into the hemocoel of the insect, after regurgitation from the worm, where they resist the insect immune response and rapidly kill the host via septicaemic infection. Insect tissues are subsequently bio-converted into a dense soup of <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> bacteria, which provide a food source to support the replication of the nematode. As food resources are depleted <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> re-associates with infective juvenile nematodes, and together they emerge from the insect cadaver able to re-infect a new host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciche et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Somvanshi et al., 2012</xref>). Three major species have been formally recognized to date within the genus - <italic>P. luminescens</italic>, <italic>P. asymbiotica</italic>, and <italic>P. temperata</italic>. It should be noted however that with increasing numbers of <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> genome sequences becoming available, the genus structure is under revision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Machado et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to the normal insect life cycle, <italic>P. asymbiotica</italic> is also the etiological agent of a serious human infection termed <italic>Photorhabdosis</italic>, which is associated with severe ulcerated skin lesions both at the initial infection foci and later at disseminated distal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerrard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerrard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerrard et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerrard et al., 2003b</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> genome encodes a diverse repertoire of virulence genes encoding for protein toxins, proteases and lipases for combating diverse hosts, that can be found in chromosomally encoded pathogenicity islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waterfield et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">ffrench-Constant, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Waterfield et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duchaud et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waterfield et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilkinson et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the bacteria also secrete a potent cocktail of other biologically active small molecules to preserve the insect cadaver in the soil from competing saprophytes and microbial predators such as amoeba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozhüyük et al., 2017</xref>). Several classes of <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> protein insecticidal toxins have now been well characterised including the Toxin Complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">ffrench-Constant and Bowen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Waterfield et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Waterfield et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meusch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erickson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waterfield et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hares et al., 2008</xref>), the binary PirAB toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Waterfield et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahantarig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sirikharin et al., 2015</xref>) and the large single polypeptide Mcf (‘makes caterpillars floppy’) toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daborn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waterfield et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dowling et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A fourth class of highly distinct toxin delivery systems first identified in <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> are the ‘<italic>Photorhabdus</italic> virulence cassettes’, or PVCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). These represent operons of around 16, conserved, structural and synthetic genes (from hereon just described as the structural genes) encoding for a phage ‘tailocin’ like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghequire and De Mot, 2015</xref>) and one or more tightly linked downstream toxin-effector like genes. Genomic analysis of multiple strains of <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> revealed they often encode up to five or six copies of the operon, each with unique downstream effector genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hapeshi and Waterfield, 2017</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that PVC-like elements are not restricted to <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> as a well-characterized homologous operon can also be found on the pADAP plasmid of the insect pathogenic bacteria <italic>Serratia entomophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hurst et al., 2004</xref>). This system has been named the anti-feeding prophage (AFP), as it is responsible for the cessation of feeding in the New Zealand grass grub host. Recent cryo-electron microscopy studies have revealed that, morphologically, AFP resembles a simplified version of the sheathed tail of bacteriophages such as T4, including a baseplate complex. It also shares features with type-VI secretion systems, with the central tube of the structure having a similar diameter and axial width to the Hcp1 hexamer of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> T6SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heymann et al., 2013</xref>). One important difference between the PVC and T6SS machinery is that the T6SS relies upon direct contact between host and bacterial cell, and is anchored in to the membrane by a substantial membrane complex whose structure is still being elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Durand et al., 2015</xref>), whereas the PVC needle complex is freely released into the surrounding milieu and so can act at a distance.</p><p>Furthermore, recent reports have indicated that other more diverse bacteria can also make similar needle complexes for manipulation of eukaryotic hosts. A well-characterized example is the production of analogous devices by the marine bacterium <italic>Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These structures are involved in the developmental metamorphosis of the larvae of the tubeworm <italic>Hydroides elegans,</italic> and they are deployed in outward-facing arrays comprising about 100 contractile structures, with baseplates linked by tail fibres in a hexagonal net (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shikuma et al., 2014</xref>). Interrogation of sequence databases with PVC protein sequences suggests many other more diverse tailocin-like systems are yet to be characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sarris et al., 2014</xref>). These include operons closely related to the PVCs in <italic>Xenorhabdus bovienii</italic> CS03, <italic>Yersinia ruckeri</italic> ATCC29473 and <italic>Vibrio campbellii</italic> AND4. In addition, evidence of more diverse elements, like that of <italic>P. luteoviolacea</italic>, can also be seen. To address this, we have recently performed an exhaustive analysis of all available prokaryotic and archaeal genome sequences in the public databases to look at the distribution of <italic>pvc</italic>-like elements (unpublished data). This suggests that PVC-like nano-syringes and their distant cousins are of enormous ecological and perhaps biomedical significance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46259.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic organisation of PVC operons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Similarity between PVCs and two diverse protein secretion systems, (i) the <italic>P. luteoviolacea mac</italic> gene cluster and (ii) The type-VI secretion system (T6SS) from <italic>Burkholderia mallei. </italic>Homologous protein sequences are coloured coded.

The PVC<italic>pnf</italic> operon belongs to class I, which has 16 structural genes and three translationally coupled gene blocks, and is of the type typically seen in non-<italic>Photorhabdus</italic> genera. Class II and III operons differ in the number of structural genes and translationally coupled gene blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Given the diversity of <italic>pvc</italic>-operons, and their typically poor annotation in genome sequences, it is necessary here to define a nomenclature protocol to allow reference to any given operon. An example of the method we have adopted is as follows; [<italic>Pa</italic> <sup>ATCC43949</sup> PVC<italic>pnf</italic>], where <italic>Pa</italic> <sup>ATCC43949</sup> is species and strain, in this case <italic>Photorhabdus asymbiotica</italic> strain ATCC43949 and PVC<italic>pnf</italic> is the specific operon within that genome with the suffix referring to one of the tightly linked effectors, in this case the <italic>pnf</italic> effector gene. We will also include gene identifiers for either end of the operon where appropriate, which in this case would be PAU_03353-PAU_03332, which are the genes for <italic>pvc1</italic> and <italic>pnf</italic> respectively.</p><p>With reference to published literature and a detailed bioinformatic analysis of promoter regions upstream of the <italic>pvc1</italic> genes, we can identify two distinct, potential <italic>cis</italic>-operator sequences. Firstly operons belonging to classes I (e.g. PVC<italic>pnf</italic>) and III (e.g. PVC<italic>PaTox</italic>) typically encode the highly conserved RfaH operator sequence, GGCGGTAGNNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belogurov et al., 2009</xref>). RfaH is a conserved anti-termination protein that is known to regulate large operons encoding for extracellular factors in <italic>E. coli</italic>. It is also believed to be important in ensuring appropriate transcriptional control of horizontally acquired operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belogurov et al., 2009</xref>). Many of the <italic>pvc</italic>-operons in <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> and members of other genera (including <italic>Xenorhabdus</italic> and <italic>Yersinia</italic>) encode this operator sequence. An unusual example is the pADAP plasmid encoded <italic>Serratia entomophila</italic> anti feeding prophage (<italic>afp</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hurst et al., 2004</xref>). While the <italic>afp</italic> promoter also encodes an RfaH operator sequence, it has been demonstrated that it is positively regulated by a tightly linked specific regulator protein, AnfA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hurst et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hurst et al., 2003</xref>). This protein is a distant homologue of RfaH suggesting that other class I or III <italic>pvc</italic> operons are not necessarily under the regulation of the chromosomal RfaH orthologue, but might also be controlled by other diverse regulators that utilise this same operator sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carter et al., 2004</xref>). Unfortunately, we were not able to directly test the role of RfaH in <italic>pvc</italic>-regulation as attempts to knock out the single <italic>P. luminescens</italic> TT01 <italic>rfaH</italic> gene were not successful, suggesting an essential role. Secondly, all class II operons (e.g. PVC<italic>lopT</italic>) and certain class I operons (e.g. PVC<italic>units</italic>1-4) encode a minimal cryptic conserved sequence motif, CAGGTTGXTGCGGTAGCTAT. In both cases these conserved <italic>cis</italic>-encoded sequences are located between the <italic>pvc1</italic> gene and the transcription start sites, as defined by previous RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mulley et al., 2015</xref> and unpublished data). We speculate that this motif, which we have so far only found in <italic>pvc</italic> loci, may represent an operator sequence for a cryptic regulator.</p><p>Although there is no experimental evidence, several observations suggest that horizontal gene transfer may have been responsible for the dissemination of many observed <italic>pvc</italic>-operons. These include; the presence of four <italic>pvc</italic> operons in tandem in <italic>P. luminescens</italic> TT01 (directly adjacent to a type IV DNA conjugation pilus operon), the presence of multiple <italic>pvc</italic> operons in any given genome, the suggestion that several operons are regulated by RfaH and the remnants of YhgA-like IS elements and inverted repeats (IR) associated with many of the operons (e.g. the IR sequence <named-content content-type="sequence">5’-TTATATTGAA(t/g)GAATATTAAGCAAGAAAC-3’</named-content> flanking [<italic>Pl</italic><sup>TT01</sup>PVC<italic>u4</italic>]). Nevertheless, automatic prediction of horizontal gene transfer regions (HGTs) using Alien Hunter 1.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vernikos and Parkhill, 2006</xref>) either did not detect any HGT elements spanning the structural regions of PVCs or in the cases where such an element was detected it was assigned a low confidence score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>An analysis of the conservation of individual genes across different <italic>pvc</italic> operons at both DNA and protein sequence levels suggests that either recombination or diversifying selection is more likely to have occurred in the more 3’ regions of the operons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is perhaps no surprise as each <italic>pvc</italic> operon can be seen to encode different effector genes in the 3’ payload region of the operons. An analysis of conservation of protein sequences of the <italic>pvc</italic> operons showed that within <italic>pvc</italic>-operons a good deal of variability is possible while presumably retaining the ability to produce a similar macromolecular structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is supported by HHPRED structural homology comparisons for equivalent PVC proteins across different operons, despite often-variable primary amino acid sequences (data not shown). We note that the most diverse protein seen in <italic>pvc</italic>-operons is that of the predicted tail fibre proteins, Pvc13, which we may expect if different <italic>pvc</italic>-operons are adapted for different host cell targets. Paralogous genes within <italic>pvc</italic>-operons include <italic>pvc1</italic> and <italic>pvc5</italic> which encode homologs of Hcp, the inner tube protein of contractile tube mechanisms such as T6SS and phage protein Gp27 and <italic>pvc2</italic>, −<italic>3</italic> and −<italic>4</italic> which encode homologues of the outer sheath proteins of phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leiman et al., 2010</xref>) and T6SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Russell et al., 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> illustrates the organisation of the [<italic>Pa</italic><sup>ATCC43949</sup> PVC<italic>pnf</italic>] operon used as a model system in our experimental studies described here, showing the top HHPRED structural homology hits and predicted roles for each encoded protein at the time of writing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A bioinformatic analysis of <italic>pvc</italic>-operon effector gene sequences</title><p>A comparison of the 3’ effector ‘payload regions’ of different <italic>pvc</italic> operons reveals a large diversity of effector genes, with a range of predicted activities, covering a large range of sizes and isoelectric point values (data not shown). Some operons encode only a single putative effector, for example [<italic>Pa</italic><sup>ATCC43949</sup> PVC<italic>PaTox</italic> PAU_02249–02230] while others have several, either tandem homologues of one another, for example [<italic>Pa</italic><sup>ATCC43949</sup> PVC<italic>u4</italic> PAU_02790–02808] or entirely unrelated putative effector genes, for example [<italic>Pa</italic><sup>ATCC43949</sup> PVC<italic>lopT</italic> PAU_02112–02095]. Many effector genes are also tightly linked to transposase gene remnants suggesting they are typically exchanged by horizontal acquisition. This is further supported by the observation that orthologous <italic>pvc</italic>-operons in the same chromosomal context may have different effector genes in different strains. A good example of this being the unrelated effector genes seen in the orthologous structural ‘PVC<italic>pnf</italic>’ operon loci of <italic>Pa<sup>Kingscliff</sup></italic> and <italic>Pa</italic><sup>ATCC43949</sup> which carry a tyrosine glycosylase and Pnf (this paper) respectively. Analysis with Alien Hunter 1.7, suggests that certain <italic>pvc</italic>-operon/effector associations are ancestral to any given species. For example, the association of the <italic>pvc17</italic> effector with PVC<italic>u4</italic>, and the multiple linked effectors with the PVC<italic>lopT</italic> operon in both <italic>Pa</italic><sup>ATCC43949</sup> and <italic>Pl</italic><sup>TT01</sup>.

While the predicted activity of PAU_03337 has not been tested directly, when expressed in the NIH-3T3 cell cytoplasm (in transient transfection experiments) it did produce a highly unusual cytoskeleton phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2006</xref>).

SDS-PAGE was used to confirm high levels of purity and that no obvious degradation had occurred. The toxoid was designed based on homology between Pnf and the CNF2 toxin active site, wherein we mutated the cysteine at amino acid position 190 into an alanine (Pnf <sup>C190A</sup>). Firstly, neither purified wild type nor toxoid proteins had any obvious toxic effect when injected into cohorts of <italic>G. mellonella</italic>, even at high doses (data not shown). We subsequently used bioPORTER, a liposome based transfection system, to introduce the purified proteins directly into cultured human cells. We visualised effects on the cytoskeleton and nucleus using TRITC-phalloidin and DAPI staining respectively. The wild type Pnf protein had a very clear effect on the cells, producing phenotypes consistent with those predicted by similarity to the CNF2 toxin. CNF2 is known to modify the cellular Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42. Pnf delivery as a bioPORTER formulation led to the formation of F-actin filaments within 24 hr followed by multi-nucleation by 48 hr, phenotypes consistent with the modification of the Rho GTPases. The toxoid derivative, delivered at the same dose using the same approach, produced no changes, giving cellular phenotypes consistent with that of the negative control or of the wild-type Pnf protein topically applied without the bioPORTER transfection agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

As a result protein electrophoretic mobility of the protein is altered. Deamidation is a chemical reaction in which an amide functional group is removed from the protein, which may be detected using deamidated protein specific antibodies. These experiments demonstrated that Pnf induced transglutamination and deamidation of both RhoA and Rac1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), although unlike the reported activity of CNF2, had no effect on Cdc42.

However, PVC-like elements are distinct in two important ways. Firstly, unlike the T6SS, they require no membrane complex for anchoring and synthesis and are freely released from the producing bacterial cell. Therefore, in common with R-type pyocins, they can act at a distance. Secondly, like T6SS but unlike R-type Pyocins, they are evolved to inject bioactive protein effectors into other cells. We hypothesise that the PVCs are evolved to specifically target eukaryotic cells, unlike T6SS, which have been shown to be able to deliver to both eukaryotes and prokaryotic competitors. However, while our previous attempts to show PVC<italic>pnf</italic> attachment to a range of bacterial species from different genera showed no binding we could detect (data not shown), we cannot rule out the possibility that homologues exist which are able to target prokaryotes.</p><p>We speculate that these large protein complexes are costly for the cell to produce, consistent with the observation of population heterogeneity of <italic>pvc</italic>-operon expression. Indeed, uncontrolled heterologous over expression of the <italic>Pa</italic><sup>ATCC43949</sup> PVC<italic>lopT</italic> and PVC<italic>pnf</italic> operons in cosmid clones in <italic>E. coli</italic>, results in deletion of regions of the <italic>pvc</italic>-operon (confirmed by sequencing) and significant loss of culture viability (not shown). It should be noted that in a natural insect infection the vast majority of the <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> bacterial population are sacrificial. The majority of the population act as a food source for the replicating nematodes, with very few cells passing into the next generation of infective juvenile nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciche et al., 2008</xref>). As such the population may restrict PVC production to a limited number of sacrificial cells. We have noted the presence of holin-lysin gene homologues tightly linked to certain <italic>pvc</italic>-operons, including both 5’ and 3’ to the <italic>Pa</italic><sup>ATCC43949</sup> PVC<italic>pnf</italic> operon which we focus on in this publication.

While it is difficult to fully characterise this heterogeneity in vivo, the PVC<italic>pnf</italic> GFP reporter strain did show restricted expression to one specific tissue, the insect trachea, and not throughout the body of the animal. In regards to these experiments, it should be noted that we did not see any melanisation response around the bacterial biomass showing GFP. The insect melanisation immune response is typically activated at sites of encapsulation. This is mediated by the recruitment of hemocytes, surrounding and enclosing foreign bodies, and entombing them in melanin. The absence of melanisation around this GFP expressing bacterial mass is consistent with the expression of anti-hemocyte virulence genes, which are likely to include the native <italic>Pl</italic><sup>TT01</sup> <italic>pvc</italic>-operons.</p><p>Examination of the promoter regions has provided no clue as to the mechanism of population heterogeneity of expression. Nevertheless, the identification of RfaH and a second cryptic conserved potential operator sequence upstream of the <italic>pvc1</italic> genes provides a starting point for addressing this in future. Operons containing the second cryptic putative regulatory sequence include [<italic>Pl</italic> <sup>TT01</sup>PVC<italic>lopT</italic>] and [<italic>Pl</italic> <sup>TT01</sup> PVC<italic>u4</italic>]. Analysis of the supplementary data from a recently published RNA-seq study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tobias et al., 2017</xref>), suggests that these operons may be dependent upon Hfq/HexA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joyce and Clarke, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Unlike many of the other genera in which we see <italic>pvc</italic>-like operons, <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> genomes encode multiple copies, typically around 5 to 6, suggesting they play important and diverse roles in the life cycle. With this in mind, we examined the conservation of the different subunit genes between operons. We observe a ‘break point’ in conservation, toward the 3’ end of the operons. We postulate this may be due to imprecise recombination events in the 3’ payload regions of <italic>pvc</italic>-operons, where incoming sequences, which have a GC-content that is distinct from the host genome, gradually ‘erode’ the upstream sequence. Alternatively, it is plausible that the lower GC at the distal end of these long operons (each of ~25 kb) may assist in strand separation during transcription, maintaining stoichiometry for these large, multi-subunit structures. Indeed low GC stretches of DNA are common origins of replication because of their reduced strand separation energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meijer et al., 1979</xref>). However, as yet we do not know whether the <italic>pvc1</italic> promoter serves the whole operon, or if there are additional promoters internal to the operon.</p><p>Each of the <italic>pvc</italic>-operons in a <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> genome encodes multiple paralogous copies of <italic>pvc1/5</italic> and <italic>pvc2/3/4</italic> genes. We were therefore surprised not to see any operons showing signs of genetic degradation. This suggests there is sufficient positive selection for maintaining these multiple operons, with each operon potentially adapted for a specific role. This hypothesis is supported by the high variation in the Pvc13 protein sequences, which we speculate represent the host cell binding fibres. The need to maintain multiple copies of <italic>pvc</italic>-operons may also have arisen if the structural genes for the needle complexes are specifically adapted for delivery of their cognate <italic>cis</italic>-linked effector proteins in some way.</p><p>Circumstantial evidence from genomic sequences and previous work on the related AFP system of <italic>Serratia</italic> has suggested the needle complexes serve to deliver the <italic>cis</italic>-encoded effector proteins. We present here for the first time direct evidence that a linked effector protein does in fact become physically associated with the needle complex. Western blot detection of Pnf from preparations enriched for needle complexes taken from the native <italic>Pa</italic><sup>ATCC43949</sup> supernatants confirmed it was being expressed in vitro and suggested it was physically associated with the complexes. In addition, physical or chemical disruption was required to release the Pnf protein for detection. When taken alongside the immuno-gold EM observations, showing Pnf could only be seen near contracted or damaged needle complexes, it confirms the protein is either sequestered inside the complex or physically associated in such as way that the TGQKPGNNEWKTGR epitope is not solvent accessible. The anti-Pvc2 antibody is able to specifically detect the protein in Western blots, however it only showed binding to what appeared to be disrupted fragments of needle complexes, again suggesting the relevant epitope is not accessible in the intact native needle complex structure. Indeed, iTasser structural model simulations of a PVC outer sheath Pvc2 protein, using the homologous <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> 3J9Q PDB structure of an R-type pyocin outer sheath as a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ge et al., 2015</xref>), supports this idea, suggesting the epitope is partially occluded between adjacent subunits.</p><p>While we have not yet directly demonstrated injection of Pnf into host cells by the needle complex, the results of the topical application and bioPORTER transfection experiments confirmed that the Pnf effector absolutely requires a mechanism to facilitate entry into the host cell cytoplasm to exert its effect. We argue the evidence for injection by the needle complex is very strong, and is corroborated by the SEM visualisation of needle-like structures of the correct dimensions on the surface of intoxicated hemocytes. Finally, we have confirmed that Pnf acts in a manner similar to the <italic>Yersinia</italic> CNF2 toxin, modifying two of the same Rho-GTPases, which correlates with the observed phenotypic effects on the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Insects, bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p> <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> (Lepidoptera: <italic>Sphingidae</italic>) were individually reared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reynolds et al., 1985</xref>).

A 250 ml overnight culture of <italic>E. coli</italic> with the <italic>Pa</italic><sup>ATCC43949</sup> PVC<italic>pnf</italic> cosmid (c4DF10) and a wild-type <italic>Pa</italic><sup>ATCC43949</sup> were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> ampicillin (in case of the cosmid strain) at 28°C with aeration in the dark. The cultures were centrifuged at 6800 x <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatants were decanted to remove each cell pellet, and the centrifugation procedure was repeated to remove any remaining cells. Cell-free supernatants were then centrifuged, in small batches, at 150,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 90 min at 4°C to harvest particulate material. The particulate pellets were washed by gentle re-suspension in 1 × Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) before a second centrifugation at 150,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 90 min at 4°C to pellet the particulate material. Each pellet was further separated by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. 10 ml of particulate material in ice-cold PBS were mixed with an equivalent volume of DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B anion exchanger (in PBS) and the preparation was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The Sepharose resin was harvested by centrifugation (3,000 × <italic>g</italic>), and the supernatant was discarded. The resin was resuspended in 40 ml of ice-cold PBS and again harvested by centrifugation. This washing step was repeated another three times, and the resin was finally resuspended in 10 ml of elution buffer (0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM phosphate buffer [pH 7.4]). The resin was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the PVCs was again centrifuged at 150,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 90 min at 4°C to pellet the particulate material and concentrate the needle structures in 500 μl of ice-cold PBS. For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) pioloform-covered 300-mesh copper grids that were coated with a fine layer of carbon were used as substrates for the protein fractions. The following four aqueous negative stains were tested with the protein samples: 1% uranyl acetate, 3% ammonium molybdate, 3% methylamine tungstate, and 2% sodium silicotungstate. The preferred stain, 3% methylamine tungstate, produced acceptable contrast and minimum artefacts and was subsequently used for all samples viewed by TEM. The coated grids were exposed to UV light for 16 hr immediately prior to use to ensure adequate wetting of the substrate. A 10 μl drop was applied to the TEM grid, and the protein was allowed to settle for 5 min. Liquid was absorbed with filter paper from the edge of the grid and replaced immediately with 10 μl of filtered negative stain. The drop was partially removed with filter paper, and the grids were allowed to air dry thoroughly before they were viewed with a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 80 kV.</p><p>Production and isolation of secreted Pnf from wild-type <italic>P. asymbiotica</italic><sup>ATCC43949</sup> was performed at the same time as the production and isolation of wild-type needle complex in a duplicate culture. Bacterial cultures were grown from the same starter culture and under the same conditions. However, for isolation of secreted proteins, the supernatant was filtered through 0.45 µm and 0.22 µm filters to remove any remaining bacteria and particulate matter. Then it was concentrated using 4% TCA overnight at 4°C and the next morning washed and resuspended in approximately 10 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4.

The identity of six different positive clones was confirmed by sequencing. Subsequently, −80°C glycerol stocks were used to inoculate 5 ml of fresh LB medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glucose and 100 µgml<sup>−1</sup> ampicillin. Bacteria were grown overnight at 30°C with shaking, and 1 ml of the culture was then harvested, re-suspended in 100 ml of the same medium, and incubated in an orbital incubator at 37°C until the optical density at 600 nm was 0.7 to 0.9. Cells were then harvested at room temperature by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was re-suspended in 100 ml of fresh LB medium supplemented with the 100 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> ampicillin and 0.1 mM of the inducer isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Optimized times for inductions were determined experimentally, and cells were then harvested. The bacterial cell pellet was re-suspended in 10 ml of 1x PBS and sonicated (four 20 s sonications at 45 mA using a Branson 450 digital Sonifier fitted with a tapered probe). The freshly sonicated samples were then diluted in 1x PBS for injection into <italic>Galleria</italic> larvae and for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis to confirm expression of the target protein. For toxicity testing cohorts of <italic>Galleria</italic> larvae (n = 20) were chilled on ice before injection with 10 μl of a dilution series (in sterile PBS) of sonicated cells expressing Pnf or vector control.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Photorhabdus</italic> Virulence Cassettes:</p><p>extracellular multi-protein needle complexes for delivery of small protein effectors into host cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor, a Guest Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript describes the packing of the toxin that insect pathogenic bacteria <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> use as a virulence factor into a nanosyringe. <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> Virulence Cassettes (PVC) are evolutionarily related to the Serratia anti-feeding prophage, the <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> MAC system and the bacterial type 6 secretion system. The authors' computational analysis revealed three classes of PVC systems and identified genes homologous to the MAC gene cluster and to <italic>Burkholderia mallei</italic> T6SS, and they identified putative effectors for the three classes of PVC. One of the effectors, Pnf, was shown to directly associate with the PVC tube, potentially allowing long-range effector delivery following the release of the PVC tube from the bacteria. Addition of PVC<italic>pnf</italic> needle complexes to insect hemocytes led to membrane ruffling and the appearance of ~150 nm long linear structures on the cell surface. The authors further demonstrate that the effector Pnf – which was previously shown to interfere with actin cytoskeleton of the host cells – acts by modifying small Rho GTPases RhoA and Rac1 by transglutamination and deamidation.</p><p>Overall the manuscript is interesting and advances the understanding of the PVC systems, their relation to the R-type pyocins, MAC and T6SS systems, and the mechanisms of effector action. The data is of high quality and the manuscript is mostly well written. However, some parts of the manuscript are rather convoluted, and several important revisions need to be made before the manuscript can be published. We would welcome a revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Bioinformatic analysis identified several features that were, unfortunately, not further tested or discussed in this study e.g. role of potential RfaH operator sequence. Are these elements involved in the heterogeneity reported later in the study? It might be helpful if the authors gave some background on RfaH here (rather than in the Discussion section) to aid in understanding what was done. Moreover, the section on the potential mobility of PVC genetic loci is very speculative.</p><p>2) In order to confirm the in vivo expression of the PVC loci, bacteria containing GFP reporter constructs were injected into Manduca larvae before samples were taken for microscopy. As the <italic>gfpmut2</italic> allele used here encodes a stable derivative of GFP, it is important to know the level of GFP expression in the inoculum and also how long post-injection before samples were taken. Did the bacteria grow in the insect to allow potential dilution of GFP already present in the bacteria? Alternatively, it is possible to use a <italic>gfp</italic> allele encoding an unstable protein e.g. GFP(LVA). The RT-PCR data presented in this supplementary figure are effective in supporting in vivo expression of this locus and should be used as a main text figure.</p><p>3) The reviewers think that more elaborate control of protein quality should be presented in the manuscript. In particular, GFP fusions of the PVC locus from <italic>P. asymbiotica</italic> is expressed in vitro and in vivo was monitored in <italic>P. luminescens</italic>. Are the same regulatory circuits present in <italic>P. luminescens</italic>? For example, the authors do not report any heterogeneity of expression in this heterologous system.</p><p>4) The in vitro experiments in the Results section have not been described rigorously enough and they are hard to follow, particularly in subsection “The Pnf effector protein is physically associated with the PVC needle complex”. Was the total protein concentration in the clarified supernatant sample similar to the concentration in the particle preps sample? The statement about the need for chemical or physical disruption of the needle for detection of Pnf needs to be more specific.</p><p>5) The section on the effects of heterologously expressed and purified Pnf on the actin cytoskeleton is missing important controls. The proteins Pnf and Pnf<sub>C190A</sub> must be folded and of sufficient purity for the experiments to be meaningful. Protein purity and quality could be assessed by SDS-PAGE or anion exchange and/or size exclusion chromatography or CD analysis. It would be interesting to know more about secondary structure content, regions of potential disorder or Pnf, potential membrane association and the motivation for the particular design of the C190A mutant. Please comment on purity and quality of Rho1 and Rac1.</p><p>6) The findings of the manuscript should be discussed with respect to the recently published structure of the PVC (Jiang et al., 2019). Particularly, Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and Figure 1—figure supplement 4 and subsection “The Pnf effector protein is physically associated with the PVC needle complex” should be updated.</p><p>7) The authors could elaborate on the possible mechanism of the release of PVC from the bacterial cells beyond the Discussion section? Are there any toxic effects on the bacteria and are there any potential immunity proteins which potentially could be identified by bioinformatic analysis?</p><p>8) Subsection “A bioinformatic analysis of <italic>pvc</italic> structural operon sequences”: the authors' own phylogenetic analyses are not shown (although relevant analyses are referred to subsequently). Please present the results or delete reference to authors' unpublished studies.</p><p>9) Figure 1 legend: Not clear if the figure refers to <italic>pvc16</italic> as class II or III? Please clarify this section.</p><p>10) Figure 6 legend: this says there is no activity of the mutant but in the Rac1 image, there is a faint band. &quot;No Pnf&quot; controls would be valuable in these figures.</p><p>11) Discussion section: expression in spiracles is mentioned here but was not listed in the Results.</p><p>12) Subsection “Deamidation and Transglutamination of Rho GTPases”: the pH is unclear here since the buffer (7.4) and the ethylene diamine (9.0) are both listed but this appears to be the same solution.</p><p>13) The arguments expressed in the Discussion section strongly support that PVCs are more similar to R-type pyocins than to the T6SS. The most important distinction is that there is no membrane complex in the PVC. PVCs have more or a less uniform length and act on the target at a distance, therefore the statement that PVC is less similar to R-type pyocins than to T6SS should be revised.</p><p>14) Please note the <italic>eLife</italic> guidelines for titles: Two-part titles and/or punctuation are to be avoided: “In the interests of style and clarity, the titles of <italic>eLife</italic> research papers should not use colons, dashes, exclamation marks, or brackets (unless needed for scientific reasons). Two-part titles should also be avoided (though some exceptions can be made for Tools and Resources).” Furthermore, authors should avoid acronyms in the title: “Titles of <italic>eLife</italic> research papers should avoid unfamiliar abbreviations or acronyms, or authors should spell out in full or provide a brief explanation for any acronyms.” Please revise your title with this advice in mind. A possibility: &quot;The PVC element of <italic>Photorhabdus asymbiotica</italic> virulence cassettes deliver protein effectors directly into target eukaryotic cells&quot;.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the revised version of the manuscript &quot;The PVC element of <italic>Photorhabdus asymbiotica</italic> virulence cassettes deliver protein effectors directly into target eukaryotic cells&quot;. It has been favourably evaluated by the reviewing editor. The updated version has adequately addressed most of the original concerns of the reviewers; however, a few points still need to be dealt with. The remaining revisions will not affect the conclusions of the manuscript, but some of them will serve as important controls, and others are clarifications in the text to make the manuscript more accessible to the general readers of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In particular, reviewer's comment 3 has not been fully addressed. If the authors have the data to support similar heterogeneity levels in the two used strains these should be added and briefly described.</p><p>Comment 5: please add the considerations about protein quality of Pnf and Pnf C190A to the text of the manuscript. Please comment on purity and quality of Rho1 and Rac1. We believe that the goal of the question about the secondary structure content has not to suggest that you embark on structure determination, but the computational prediction of secondary structure and a comment on the potential ordered and disordered parts of the protein.</p><p>Updated subsection “The Pnf effector protein is physically associated with the PVC needle complex” make statements about expression levels observed by florescent microscopy and refer to &quot;not shown&quot; data. Please present this data in the supplementary material and provide quantification for the percentage of green cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46259.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Bioinformatic analysis identified several features that were, unfortunately, not further tested or discussed in this study e.g. role of potential RfaH operator sequence.

In attempts to address this, we did in fact try to knock-out the <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic> TT01 <italic>rfaH</italic> gene, using a recombineering strategy, that normally works in our hands for this strain. However, we were not able to delete the gene, despite several attempts, suggesting an essential role in <italic>Photorhabdus</italic>. We also procured an <italic>E. coli rfaH</italic> Keio collection knock out strain, but its unusual cellular morphology and phenotypic behavior led us to believe it was unsuitable for any relevant experiments. We have now included this and a brief discussion of <italic>rfaH</italic> into this Results section as suggested. We accept the reviewer’s comment regarding the PVC operon motility and have reduced and simplified this text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In order to confirm the in vivo expression of the PVC loci, bacteria containing GFP reporter constructs were injected into Manduca larvae before samples were taken for microscopy. As the gfpmut2 allele used here encodes a stable derivative of GFP, it is important to know the level of GFP expression in the inoculum and also how long post-injection before samples were taken.

The RT-PCR data presented in this supplementary figure are effective in supporting in vivo expression of this locus and should be used as a main text figure.</p></disp-quote><p>In this case, in vitro reporter expression (in LB medium) is only seen in a sub-population of cells, as illustrated by similar constructs shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. It should be noted that the blood samples and dissections were performed at 12 hours post infection, after injection of a small inoculum of only 100 CFU as described in the Materials and methods section. This indicates that the bacteria would necessarily have been replicating up to the time of examination (in order to see them at all), greatly increasing their numbers and initiating a normal infection. Thus, in answer to the reviewer’s question, the green cells are highly unlikely to represent those initially injected. The microcolonies seen in Figure 2B and bacterial cells in 2A therefore represent the activity of cells undergoing an active infection cycle. We have included text to highlight this.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we will move the RT-PCR data shown into a figure in the main text (Figure 2C) to further support our findings relating to in vivo expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers think that more elaborate control of protein quality should be presented in the manuscript. In particular, GFP fusions of the PVC locus from P. asymbiotica is expressed in vitro and in vivo was monitored in P. luminescens. Are the same regulatory circuits present in P. luminescens? For example, the authors do not report any heterogeneity of expression in this heterologous system.</p></disp-quote><p>As the same cis-encoded potential regulatory elements are seen in homologous operons from all <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> strains (and indeed in other genera such as <italic>Yersinia</italic>) that we have looked at, we have no reason to believe that <italic>P. asymbiotica</italic> ATCC43949 and <italic>P. luminescens</italic> TT01 would have different regulatory circuits for <italic>pvc</italic> expression. In a previous study we compared gene expression and pheno-array activity of TT01 and ATCC43949 (see Mulley et al., 2015). We do indeed see the same heterogeneity of expression in all strains we have looked at when grown at the normal insect infection temperature of 28°C. While in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 we only show the activity of <italic>Pa</italic><sup>ATCC43949</sup> promotors in a closely related <italic>P. asymbiotica</italic> strain (<italic>Pa</italic><sup>PB68</sup>) we also have equivalent data for these reporters in <italic>P. luminescens</italic> TT01 which we excluded for brevity. These could be included in the figure also if it is felt necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The in vitro experiments in the Results section have not been described rigorously enough and they are hard to follow, particularly in subsection “The Pnf effector protein is physically associated with the PVC needle complex”. Was the total protein concentration in the clarified supernatant sample similar to the concentration in the particle preps sample? The statement about the need for chemical or physical disruption of the needle for detection of Pnf needs to be more specific.</p></disp-quote><p>We isolated the needle complexes (NCs) from both the wild-type <italic>Photorhabdus asymbiotica</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> cosmid clone (c4DF10) grown in 250 ml of LB media for 16 hrs. The particulate matter including NC was isolated from both cultures as described in Materials and methods section and the NC in both cases was resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. The reason we have selected the specific growth phase and culture volume relies on previous studies reporting successful detection of <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> secreted toxins under similar conditions. Detection of secreted Pnf from wild-type <italic>P. asymbiotica</italic><sup>ATCC43949</sup> was performed at the same time as the isolation of wild-type NC in a duplicate culture. Bacterial cultures were grown from the same starter culture and under the same conditions. However, for isolation of secreted proteins, the supernatant was filtered through 0.45 μm and 0.22 μm filters to remove any remaining bacteria and particulate matter. Then it was concentrated using 4% TCA overnight at 4°C and the next morning washed and resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4. The secreted proteins were further concentrated using Amicon filters with NMWL of 10kDa to 0.5 ml. It should be noted that we cannot really compare the two NC preparations as one relies on the natural expression levels, while the other is constitutive expression on the cosmid clone. The chemical and physical methods of needle complex are we believe self-explanatory. We have included this text in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The section on the effects of heterologously expressed and purified Pnf on the actin cytoskeleton is missing important controls. The proteins Pnf and Pnf<sub>C190A</sub> must be folded and of sufficient purity for the experiments to be meaningful.

It would be interesting to know more about secondary structure content, regions of potential disorder or Pnf, potential membrane association and the motivation for the particular design of the C190A mutant. Please comment on purity and quality of Rho1 and Rac1.</p></disp-quote><p>Both the wild-type and mutant toxoid were produced and purified in the same bacterial expression host from the same constructs and under the same conditions (over-expression for 16 hours at low temperature to facilitate solubility). Both proteins were purified at similar yields and none of them appears to be degraded during purification (checked with SDS-PAGE both run at the same size). In addition, the correct folding of the Pnf WT is supported by the clear expected phenotypes obtained by the protein transfection experiments into mammalian cells. It remains formally possible that the toxoid no longer folds correctly, but we would argue that this would only be the equivalent as a heat denatured control. We suggest that determination of the actual structure of the proteins is a little over the top, and not something routinely done in analogous published studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The findings of the manuscript should be discussed with respect to the recently published structure of the PVC (Jiang et al., 2019). Particularly, Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and Figure 1—figure supplement 4 and subsection “The Pnf effector protein is physically associated with the PVC needle complex” should be updated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified the text to include reference to this recent publication as requested. We have also improved Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and Figure 1—figure supplement 4 to include a more up to date HHPRED analysis table that is colour coded to match that used in the PVC structure publication. In addition, we have modified the text in subsection “The Pnf effector protein is physically associated with the PVC needle complex” and subsection “The Pnf protein requires delivery into the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm to exert its</p><p>Effect” to discuss the location of the Pvc2 anti peptide antibody epitope in relation to the recently published structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors could elaborate on the possible mechanism of the release of PVC from the bacterial cells beyond the Discussion section? Are there any toxic effects on the bacteria and are there any potential immunity proteins which potentially could be identified by bioinformatic analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the text in this section in response to the reviewer’s suggestion. In unpublished work we have data to suggest that either a restricted small sub-population can produce very large quantities of PVCs, that are released by lysis, or that the needle complex can in fact be secreted. We hope this work will form part of a subsequent publication.</p><p>We do discuss toxic effects of unregulated PVC expression in the heterologous <italic>E. coli</italic> cosmid expression strains in the manuscript. We do have loss of viability data in <italic>E. coli</italic> we could include if deemed necessary. In addition, we have tested purified PVC<italic>pnf</italic> needle complexes themselves against a range of different bacteria genera, and saw no toxicity, or indeed even cell surface binding using TEM studies. We mention this in the Discussion section. It does not seem useful for us to include this “negative” data however.</p><p>As such we do not really understand the question regarding immunity proteins. As mentioned above, unlike Type 6 secretion systems, the PVCs do not appear to target other bacteria. As such the toxins they deliver are apparently evolved against eukaryotic targets. Therefore, there is no assumed requirement for immunity proteins for the expression of PVCs (and their cognate toxins) in the bacteria themselves.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “A bioinformatic analysis of pvc structural operon sequences”: the authors' own phylogenetic analyses are not shown (although relevant analyses are referred to subsequently). Please present the results or delete reference to authors' unpublished studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not wish to increase the complexity and size of the publication further so as suggested by the reviewer we have removed the reference to our unpublished phylogenetic analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 1 legend: Not clear if the figure refers to pvc16 as class II or III? Please clarify this section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the figure legend text to improve consistency and clarity and hope this addresses the issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 6 legend: this says there is no activity of the mutant but in the Rac1 image, there is a faint band. &quot;No Pnf&quot; controls would be valuable in these figures.</p></disp-quote><p>The specificity of the anti-63 polyclonal against the exact same constructs (not only plasmids but also expression host) has been shown in McNichol et al. (2006) paper Figure 6, where we can see a faint non-specific band for both RhoA and Rac1 incubated without toxin (lane 1 on western blot panels). The only way to address this with any precision may be to use 2D electrophoresis and/or MS analysis as deamidation of glutamine alters the isoelectric point (pI) of the protein. We feel this additional effort would not really add much to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Discussion section: expression in spiracles is mentioned here but was not listed in the Results.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies, this was an error and the comment in the discussion has now be changed to “insect trachea”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Subsection “Deamidation and Transglutamination of Rho GTPases”: the pH is unclear here since the buffer (7.4) and the ethylene diamine (9.0) are both listed but this appears to be the same solution.</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that the addition of ethylenediamine increased the pH to 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The arguments expressed in the Discussion section strongly support that PVCs are more similar to R-type pyocins than to the T6SS. The most important distinction is that there is no membrane complex in the PVC. PVCs have more or a less uniform length and act on the target at a distance, therefore the statement that PVC is less similar to R-type pyocins than to T6SS should be revised.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the first comment here, we believe the reviewer may have misread this as the sentence referred to actually says; “An analysis of the different subunit proteins of PVCs show they share several elements in common with other contractile phage-tail derived systems, including the Type VI secretion system (T6SS) (Leiman et al., 2010) and to a lesser extent R-type pyocins (Russell et al., 2014).”</p><p>We argue that we do highlight these differences/similarities between the PVCs and T6SS and R-type pyocins in a clear way. While the lack of membrane complex, standardised length and action at a distance are indeed more reminiscent of R-type pyocins, genetically PVCs are in many respects more like T6SS than the more phage-like pyocins. Nevertheless, we have made minor modification to this text to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Please note the eLife guidelines for titles: Two-part titles and/or punctuation are to be avoided: “In the interests of style and clarity, the titles of eLife research papers should not use colons, dashes, exclamation marks, or brackets (unless needed for scientific reasons). Two-part titles should also be avoided (though some exceptions can be made for Tools and Resources).” Furthermore, authors should avoid acronyms in the title: “Titles of eLife research papers should avoid unfamiliar abbreviations or acronyms, or authors should spell out in full or provide a brief explanation for any acronyms.” Please revise your title with this advice in mind. A possibility: &quot;The PVC element of Photorhabdus asymbiotica virulence cassettes deliver protein effectors directly into target eukaryotic cells&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to adopt the new title suggested.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>In particular, reviewer's comment 3 has not been fully addressed. If the authors have the data to support similar heterogeneity levels in the two used strains these should be added and briefly described.</italic></p><p>We have now expanded the Figure 2 supplementary material to include representative micrographs from a time course of reporter activity from four PVC operons from each of two species, <italic>P. luminescens</italic><sup>TT01</sup> and <italic>P. asymbiotica</italic><sup>PB68.1</sup> (so a total of 8 PVC operons now). These can be viewed as Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Figure 2—figure supplement 4. We have also now added pertinent descriptive text to the manuscript and expanded the Materials and methods section to include construction of the additional seven plasmids (including a primer list as a supplementary document).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5: please add the considerations about protein quality of Pnf and Pnf C190A to the text of the manuscript. Please comment on purity and quality of Rho1 and Rac1. We believe that the goal of the question about the secondary structure content has not to suggest that you embark on structure determination, but the computational prediction of secondary structure and a comment on the potential ordered and disordered parts of the protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added comments regarding the methods used and purity of the various protein preparations. In addition, we have performed Phyre2 computational structural predictions of the wild-type Pnf and toxoid sequences. We have added text to discuss that the single amino acid change in the Pnf active site (C190A) causes minimal overall predicted structural differences in the two proteins. A summary figure has now been included as Figure 6—figure supplement 1 to illustrate a comparison of these models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Updated subsection “The Pnf effector protein is physically associated with the PVC needle complex” make statements about expression levels observed by florescent microscopy and refer to &quot;not shown&quot; data. Please present this data in a supplementary material and provide quantification for the percentage of green cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included an image analysis (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) to objectively quantify heterogeneity of GFP expression in the reporter strain shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. A description is included in the text and methods included in the figure legend. We also include the raw data as an excel file.</p></body></sub-article></article>
