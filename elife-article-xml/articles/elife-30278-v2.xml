The scaffold protein SAV1 promotes the activation of this kinase cascade, but the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we discover SAV1-mediated inhibition of the PP2A complex STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup> as a key mechanism of MST1/2 activation. SLMAP binding to autophosphorylated MST2 linker recruits STRIPAK and promotes PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of MST2 at the activation loop. Our structural and biochemical studies reveal that SAV1 and MST2 heterodimerize through their SARAH domains. Two SAV1–MST2 heterodimers further dimerize through SAV1 WW domains to form a heterotetramer, in which MST2 undergoes trans-autophosphorylation. SAV1 directly binds to STRIPAK and inhibits its phosphatase activity, protecting MST2 activation-loop phosphorylation. Genetic ablation of SLMAP in human cells leads to spontaneous activation of the Hippo pathway and alleviates the need for SAV1 in Hippo signaling. Thus, SAV1 promotes Hippo activation through counteracting the STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup> PP2A phosphatase complex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human 293FT cell</kwd><kwd>human MCF10A cell</kwd><kwd><italic>Escherichia coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM107415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Xuelian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Xuelian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The scaffold protein SAV1 counteracts PP2A to activate Hippo kinases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The balance between cell division and death maintains tissue homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Through restricting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis, the evolutionarily conserved Hippo pathway is critical for tissue homeostasis and tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harvey and Tapon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson and Halder, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). The role of the Hippo pathway in tumorigenesis is well-established in model organisms, such as fly and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Halder and Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pan, 2010</xref>). Aberrant expression and genetic mutations of Hippo pathway components have been linked to human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). A better molecular understanding of the Hippo pathway may uncover new targets for cancer therapy.</p><p>In mammals, the canonical Hippo pathway contains a core kinase cascade, formed by STE20-like MST1/2 kinases, Large Tumor Suppressor LATS1/2 kinases, the WW-domain containing scaffold protein Salvador (SAV1) and the adaptor protein MOB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Halder and Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yu and Guan, 2013</xref>). Upon activation by extracellular signals, such as cell-cell contact and mechanical cues, cell-surface receptors transduce signals to a cytoskeletal complex containing the FERM proteins NF2 and Expanded (EX), which relays these upstream signals to activate MST1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamaratoglu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Activated MST1/2 partner with SAV1 to phosphorylate and activate the LATS1/2–MOB1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Praskova et al., 2008</xref>), which in turn phosphorylate and inactivate the oncogenic transcriptional co-activators YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). LATS1/2–MOB1-mediated phosphorylation inhibits YAP/TAZ by promoting their nuclear export, cytoplasmic sequestration, and ubiquitination-dependent degradation. When Hippo signaling is turned off, YAP/TAZ translocate to the nucleus and bind to the TEAD family of transcription factors to promote the transcription of pro-proliferative and pro-survival genes, enabling cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2008b</xref>).</p><p>Although the MAP4K family kinases can act as additional activators of LATS1/2 in response to certain upstream signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Plouffe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>), genetic studies in fly and mouse have established the requirement for the canonical MST-LATS kinase cascade in tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harvey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Justice et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kango-Singh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tapon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 1995</xref>). Activation of MST1/2 is sufficient to turn on the Hippo pathway to inhibit YAP/TAZ-mediated gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). It is critical to understand the mechanism of MST1/2 kinase activation, a key initiating event in Hippo signaling. MST1/2 contain an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil SARAH domain, which are separated by a flexible linker. MST1 and MST2 can each form a constitutive homodimer through the SARAH domain, and kinase activation is achieved by trans-autophosphorylation of the activation loop (T183 for MST1 and T180 for MST2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avruch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ni et al., 2013</xref>). Although MST1/2 form homodimers and undergo constitutive autophosphorylation in vitro, the vast majority of MST1/2 molecules remain unphosphorylated at the T-loop in vivo when the Hippo pathway is off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Praskova et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that MST1/2 activation is antagonized by phosphatases. Recent studies have suggested that Hippo activity is negatively regulated by a multi-subunit protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex, called striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, MST1/2 interact with STRIPAK through the adaptor protein SLMAP in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couzens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hauri et al., 2013</xref>), although the mechanism and functional consequence of this interaction are unclear.</p><p>Among the core components of the MST-LATS cascade, MOB1 acts as a dynamic phospho-peptide-binding adaptor to promote MST1/2-dependent activation of LATS1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ni et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, the mechanism by which the other core component SAV1 promotes MST1/2 activation remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pantalacci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Udan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2003</xref>). SAV1 contains an N-terminal flexible region that binds to the FERM domain of NF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), two WW domains, and a C-terminal SARAH domain. Binding of SAV1 to MST1/2 is mediated by their SARAH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Callus et al., 2006</xref>). One attractive hypothesis is that the SARAH domains of SAV1 and MST1/2 form a heterotetramer to strengthen the MST homodimer, thus promoting MST1/2 trans-autophosphorylation at the T-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ni et al., 2013</xref>). It has also been suggested that SAV1 recruits MST1/2 to the plasma membrane for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harvey and Tapon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological experiments, we establish the PP2A complex, STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup>, as a key negative regulator of Hippo signaling in human cells, and show that SAV1 promotes MST1/2 activation through antagonizing the STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup> PP2A phosphatase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Feedback inhibition of MST2 activation by autophosphorylated MST2 linker</title><p>MST2 undergoes autophosphorylation at multiple threonine-methionine (TM) motifs in its linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ni et al., 2015</xref>). One such motif, pT378M, acts as the primary docking site for MOB1. Binding of MST2 converts MOB1 to the open conformation, allowing MOB1 to bind and recruit LATS1 to MST2 for phosphorylation. Therefore, phosphorylation of the MST2 linker is critical for activation of the Hippo pathway. Surprisingly, we found that mutation of 7 TMs to AMs (7TA) in MST2 not only abolished MOB1 binding to MST2, but also dramatically increased MST2 T180 phosphorylation in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that linker phosphorylation could inhibit MST1/2 kinase activation in a feedback mechanism. This result is consistent with earlier findings that truncation of the MST1/2 linker increases MST1/2 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Creasy et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, autophosphorylation of the MST2 linker has dual, opposing functions in Hippo signaling: recruitment and activation of MOB1 for downstream signaling and feedback inhibition of MST2 activation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30278.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Feedback inhibition of MST2 activation by SLMAP binding to autophosphorylated MST2 linker.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain organization of human MST2 and seven phospho-TM sites in the linker region.

Restoration of T325, T336, and T378 individually to the 7TA mutant reduced T180 phosphorylation to various levels, indicating that phosphorylation of these three TM sites is critical for MST2 inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The MST2 3TA mutation with these three threonine residues mutated to alanine was as efficient as 7TA in activating MST2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We previously raised a phospho-specific antibody against the pT378 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ni et al., 2015</xref>). To confirm that T336 was phosphorylated in full-length MST2, we then raised a phospho-specific antibody against the pT336 site. We showed that both T336 and T378 sites were indeed phosphorylated in wild type (WT) MST2, but not in 3TA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, phosphorylation at T336 and T378 and the enhanced phosphorylation of T180 in 3TA were abolished in the kinase-inactive MST2 mutants (T180A and D146N) in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Active MST2 kinase domain efficiently phosphorylated T180, T336, and T378 of kinase-dead MST2 D146N in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results indicate that the inhibitory phosphorylation at the MST2 linker occurs through autophosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SLMAP binds to phosphorylated MST2 linker</title><p>Because deletion of the MST2 linker does not enhance either the activation or kinase activity of recombinant purified MST2 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ni et al., 2013</xref>), we hypothesized that the inhibitory pTM motifs recruited a phosphatase to dephosphorylate pT180 and inactivate MST2. A proteomic study has shown that MST1/2 interact with a specific PP2A complex called STRIPAK through the N-terminal forkhead associated (FHA) domain of the adaptor protein SLMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couzens et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this previous report, we showed that MST2 interacted with SLMAP WT, but not SLMAP ∆FHA, in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). SLMAP interacted with MST2 WT, but not 3TA and T180A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, SLMAP bound to MST2 mutants with a single pTM site restored at pT325, pT336, or pT378 to varying degrees in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, the inhibitory phosphorylation at these three sites in the MST2 linker is required for the SLMAP-MST2 interaction. Recombinant GST-SLMAP FHA interacted with the full-length (FL) MST2, but not the MST2 kinase domain (KD) or MST2 with the linker deleted (∆L), suggesting that SLMAP FHA binds directly to the MST2 linker in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). As measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the binding affinities between SLMAP FHA and phospho-MST2 peptides containing pT325, pT336, or pT378 were 0.39 µM, 1.1 µM, and 0.16 µM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

We determined the structure of SLMAP FHA–pMST2 by molecular replacement using apo-SLMAP FHA as the search model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In the SLMAP FHA–pMST2 structure, the FHA domain adopts a conformation virtually identical to that of free SLMAP FHA with an RMSD of 0.33 Å for all atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), indicating that binding of pMST2 does not appreciably alter the conformation of the FHA domain. Only six residues of pMST2 (D<sup>376</sup>GpTMKR<sup>381</sup>) have clear electron density, and bind to a surface formed by residues from the β3-β4, β4-β5, β6-β7, and β10-β11 loops of SLMAP FHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The pT378 residue binds at a highly positively charged pocket, with the phosphate group making favorable electrostatic interactions with side chain or main chain atoms from R32, S52, R53 and S75 of SLMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). M379 inserts into an adjacent hydrophobic pocket on SLMAP. R381 makes hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with side chains from V107 and V109, and main chain from D108 of SLMAP, respectively, indicating that a positively charged residue is preferred at this position. D376 forms two hydrogen bonds with R53 of SLMAP. G377 forms a 90˚ turn to allow D376 to make favorite contacts with R53 of SLMAP. Our structure thus suggests that SLMAP FHA prefers binding to a phospho-threonine peptide with a consensus sequence of E/D-G-pT-M-x-R/K. Consistent with this prediction, the pT325-MST2<sup>320-329</sup> and pT336-MST2<sup>331-340</sup> peptides that do not fully conform to this consensus bind to SLMAP FHA with lower affinities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Despite the differences of the loops at the pT binding site among various FHA domains, the pT-binding residues, R32, S52 and H55, can be structurally overlaid with the corresponding residues from other FHAs, suggesting that the mode of pT recognition is highly conserved among FHA domains. Indeed, the binding affinity between SLMAP FHA/R32A mutant and pMST2 was reduced by ~120 fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The active site of MST2 in MST2–SAV1 is well-defined. The Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and AMP-PNP are clearly visible in the electron-density map. The MST2 kinase domain in MST2–SAV1 is structurally very similar to the MST2 kinase alone, except that the T-loop helix observed in the MST2 kinase structure is not visible in the MST2–SAV1 structure. The K56-E70 salt bridge between strand β3 and helix αC is not formed in MST2–SAV1, consistent with MST2 adopting the inactive conformation. The SARAH domains of MST2 and SAV1 form a long antiparallel coiled coil and do not directly contact the kinase domain. The N-terminal extension of SAV1 SARAH forms two short helices, H0 and H1, which interact with the main coiled coil through several hydrophobic interactions. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> RASSF ortholog (dRASSF) has previously been shown to restrict Hippo (The <italic>Drosophila</italic> MST1/2 ortholog) activity by competing with SAV for binding to Hippo, and dRASSF-associated Hippo is inactive whereas SAV-associated Hippo is active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polesello et al., 2006</xref>).

SAV1 ∆SARAH lost its ability to activate MST2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Mutations in SAV1 SARAH that disrupted its binding to MST2 (E346A/R358A and E346A/R368A) also diminished SAV1 stimulation of MST2 activation. Thus, SARAH-mediated binding of SAV1 to MST2 is required for SAV1-induced MST2 activation. Furthermore, deletion of the WW domains also decreased MST2 activation, with the deletion of WW2 having a larger effect, suggesting that WW2-mediated dimerization of SAV1 might be important for MST activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We have previously shown that SARAH-mediated MST2 homodimerization is critical for its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ni et al., 2013</xref>). SAV1 SARAH disrupts this homodimerization of MST2 SARAH, and is expected to block MST2 activation. Indeed, SAV1 SARAH alone (SAV1 ∆N268) blocked MST2 activation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Interestingly, the SAV1 ∆N198 mutant, which contains WW1/2 and SARAH domains, could support MST2 auto-activation in the same assay. These results suggest that SAV1 WW2 promotes the self-association of MST2–SAV1 heterodimers and enables trans-autophosphorylation and activation of the MST2 kinase domain in the context of the MST2–SAV1 heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>The SAV1 ∆N198 mutant did not enhance T180 phosphorylation of MST2 in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), indicating that the N-terminal region of SAV1 is also important for MST2 activation. We made additional N-terminal truncation mutants of SAV1 to further map the region involved in MST2 activation. Deletion of the N-terminal 90 residues completely abolished MST2 pT180 signals, whereas deletion of the N-terminal 30 residues greatly reduced MST2 pT180. Because SAV1 1–30 contains the FBM motif that binds to the FERM domain of NF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), we tested if SAV1 FBM was required for MST2 activation. The FBM deletion mutant of SAV1 was indeed deficient in MST2 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), raising the intriguing possibility that NF2 or other FERM-containing proteins might regulate the ability of SAV1 to stimulate MST2.</p><p>Overexpression of SAV1 not only promoted MST2 T180 phosphorylation, but also increased phosphorylation at T336 and T378, which was required for SLMAP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Consistent with this finding, SAV1 overexpression did not reduce the binding of SLMAP and STRIP1 to MST2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that SAV1 prevents pT180 dephosphorylation without disrupting the interaction between MST2 and STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup>. All discernable domains of SAV1 are required for MST2 activation in vivo.</p><p>One possibility is that SAV1 may target MST2 to the plasma membrane, thus spatially separating MST2 from STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup>, whose SLMAP subunit has been reported to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzzo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hwang and Pallas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nader et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wigle et al., 1997</xref>). To test this possibility, we examined the localization of MST2 and SAV1 in 293FT cells by subcellular fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Tubulin, NF2 and Pan Cadherin were used as markers for the cytosolic, peripheral and integral membrane fractions, respectively. The membrane fraction contained both peripheral and integral membrane proteins. Although a minor fraction of SAV1 and MST2 resided in the membrane fraction, major pools of SAV1 and MST2 were present in the cytosol. More importantly, both cytosolic and membrane fractions of MST2 were proportionally activated, as indicated by phosphorylation at T180. Thus, membrane targeting cannot fully explain SAV1-dependent activation of MST2. SAV1 may directly antagonize STRIPAK-mediated inhibition of MST2. Because Hippo/MST binding can induce SAV phosphorylation and prevent its degradation, leading to increased levels of SAV in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aerne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Callus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pantalacci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu and Wu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2003</xref>), SAV may also function in a positive feedback mechanism in Hippo/MST activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aerne et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>The N-terminal region of SAV1 directly inhibits PP2A</title><p>The N-terminal residues of SAV1 are required for MST2 activation in human cells, but are not expected to contact MST2.

Diverse upstream signals activate the central MST-LATS kinase cascade in this pathway, which regulates the YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcription module to alter transcription. Among the four core components of the MST-LATS kinase cascade (MST, SAV1, LATS, and MOB1), the biochemical function of SAV1 is the least understood. Our present study has filled this important gap, and establishes a molecular framework for SAV1-dependent MST activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>MST2 undergoes constitutive trans-autophosphorylation at T180 and several residues in its linker. Multiple phospho-residues in the MST2 linker redundantly bind to the FHA domain of SLMAP, an adaptor of STRIPAK, and promote PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of pT180, resulting in feedback inactivation of MST2 under normal growth conditions. Upon activation of the Hippo pathway by contact inhibition or cytoskeletal perturbation, SAV1 binds to MST2 and forms a SAV1–MST2 heterodimer through their SARAH domains. SAV1 WW domains further dimerize to promote the formation of a SAV1-MST heterotetramer. In the context of the MST2-SAV1 heterotetramer, the two kinase domains of MST2 can still undergo trans-autophosphorylation at T180 and activation. The molecular interactions among MST2, SAV1, and STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup> position the N-terminal phosphatase-inhibitory domain (PID) of SAV1 for direct binding to and inhibition of the PP2A catalytic core, thus protecting pT180 from dephosphorylation. Therefore, SAV1 promotes MST1/2 activation through forming an MST1/2-SAV1 heterotetramer that permits MST1/2 autoactivation, and through antagonizing PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of the activation loop of MST1/2. Although the N-terminal PID of SAV1 in isolation interacts with PP2A weakly and only inhibits PP2A A/C at very high concentrations, this domain may be more effective in PP2A inhibition in the context of the intact SAV1–MST2–STRIPAK<sup>SLAMP</sup> complex. Scaffolding by striatin and other adaptor proteins in this complex may buttress the interaction of SAV1 PID and PP2A and position this domain for optimal PP2A inhibition. Future structural studies on the SAV1–MST2–STRIPAK<sup>SLAMP</sup> super-complex will definitively test the key tenets of this framework.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, dRASSF has been reported to promote the association between dSTRIPAK and Hippo, suggesting that dRASSF may also help to recruit dSTRIPAK to inactivate Hippo by dephosphorylation of its activation loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2010</xref>).

Phosphorylation of MOB1 by MST1/2 requires the binding of MOB1 to phospho-residues in the MST1/2 linker. MOB1 can thus compete with SLMAP for binding to overlapping sets of phospho-residues and further enhance MST1/2 activation in a feed-forward mechanism.</p><p>SAV1 has been proposed to perform additional functions in the Hippo pathway. For example, MST1/2 can be targeted to the plasma membrane by SAV1, whereas NF2 promotes the plasma membrane association of LATS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). The co-localization of MST1/2 and LATS1/2 at the membrane facilitates MST1/2-dependent phosphorylation and activation of LATS1/2. In addition, SAV1 has been proposed to recruit substrates to MST1/2 for efficient phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pantalacci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tapon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Udan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2003</xref>). Our discovery that SAV1 antagonizes STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup> to promote MST1/2 activation is entirely consistent with these observations, and further implies that SAV1 targets the active MST1/2 to appropriate substrates. Deletion of SLMAP bypasses the requirement of SAV1 in Hippo pathway activation in normal growth conditions, providing conclusive evidence for the antagonism between SAV1 and STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup>in vivo. On the other hand, it is unlikely that all SAV1 functions can be bypassed by SLMAP deletion, given the wide array of upstream stimuli that can activate the Hippo pathway.</p><p>The Hippo pathway can be activated by a multitude of signals and stimuli. The SAV1–STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup> antagonism is likely regulated by upstream signals. STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup> is expected to outcompete the inhibitory function of SAV1 when the Hippo pathway is off, and the opposite might be true when the Hippo pathway is on. Currently, we do not know how the SAV1– STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup> antagonism is regulated by upstream signals to affect Hippo kinase activation. Along this vein, the N-terminal PID of SAV1 encompasses the FBM that binds to FERM domains. Deletion of SAV1 FBM reduces its ability to activate MST2 in human cells. SAV1 PID directly binds to and inhibits the PP2A catalytic core, thus protecting MST2 from dephosphorylation. Because the interaction between SAV1 PID and PP2A A/C in isolation is weak, it may need to be buttressed by scaffolding functions of other components in the STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup>–MST2–SAV1 complex. In another non-exclusive possibility, through the embedded FBM, SAV1 PID may further recruit certain FERM-containing proteins, such as NF2 and Expanded (EX), to promote STRIPAK inhibition in vivo. In this case, NF2 or EX might directly bind to the core components of STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup>. Through engaging both SAV1 PID and STRIPAK, NF2 or EX might help to position SAV1 PID in the optimal orientation to inhibit STRIPAK during Hippo signaling activation. Intriguingly, when the Hippo pathway is off, NF2 adopts a closed conformation, in which its FERM domain is autoinhibited and cannot bind to FBMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2015</xref>). When the Hippo pathway is on, NF2 adopts an open conformation, in which its FERM domain binds to the FBM of LATS1/2 and recruits LATS1/2 to membrane for phosphorylation by MST1/2. Oncogenic NF2 mutations are believed to alter the open-closed conformational change of NF2, thus inhibiting Hippo signaling. It will be interesting to test whether NF2 or other FERM-containing proteins, such as EX, regulate the PP2A-blocking function of SAV1 in similar ways.</p><p>A major unresolved question is how the Hippo kinases are activated by upstream signals. In this study, we have shown that the dynamic antagonism between SAV1 and STRIPAK determines the activation status of MST1/2. By virtue of its ability to interact with NF2/EX, STRIPAK, and MST1/2, SAV1 links upstream signals to MST1/2 activation. Because STRIPAK contains both a kinase and a phosphatase, the delicate balance between the opposite catalytic activities of the two enzymes in the same complex can play a critical role in toggling the activation status of Hippo signaling. Although the Hippo pathway is often dysfunctional in human cancer, the core components of the MST-LATS kinase cascade are rarely mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>). Chemical inhibitors of the STRIPAK complex are expected to activate MST1/2 and downstream signaling, and may have therapeutic potential in treating human cancers driven by NF2 mutations or elevated expression of YAP/TAZ.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The coding regions of human SLMAP FHA (residues 1–140), the C-terminal fragments of SAV1, and PP2A A subunit were cloned into a modified pGEX-6P vector (GE Healthcare) that included a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site at the N terminus, respectively.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Philip Cole (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers agree that this work represents a potentially significant advance in understanding the role of SAV1 in Hippo signaling. The key finding is that SAV1 helps to activate the Mst1 kinase for phosphorylation of Lats by inhibiting the STRIPAK/SLMAP phosphatase that is also bound to Mst1 in the &quot;off&quot; state, where it prevents phosphorylation of the MST1 activation loop at T180. A variety of potential mechanisms for how it promotes Hippo signaling have been proposed, so the manuscript needs to not only confirm that SAV can inhibit dephosphorylation of MST by STRIPAK, but also compare the proposed mechanism and discuss its relative importance compared to previously suggested mechanisms by which SAV could influence Hippo signaling. Specifically, several concerns need to be addressed in a revised manuscript:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are concerns about the reliability of the blots in Figure panels 2B, 3A, and 7B, and the quantification based on them (2C, 3B). It appears from the size, shape, and orientation of the bands shown that the bands shown come from multiple different gels. In order for the GAPDH loading control to be valid, it needs to come from the same gel. Moreover, there are comparisons of phospho- versus total antibody stains for Mst, Mob, Lats, and Yap, and these too look like they come from different gels – indeed, it seems unlikely that they used the same gels for so many different antibodies. The legends and Materials and methods don't provide a detailed explanation for how the blots were generated and how the quantification was done, but it looks like these experiments were not done properly. The authors need to show the proper controls for each blot and provide a much better explanation of the protocols.</p><p>2) The ability of the SLMAP deletion to bypass SAV1 necessity supports their model, but considering other available data the result is somewhat puzzling. The authors report that the N-terminus of Sav, which is known to interact with NF2/Merlin, is required for activation of MST by SAV, but they nonetheless appear to invoke a weak interaction of this region with PP2A as being responsible for the influence SAV on Hippo phosphorylation, which seems to ignore the potential roles of both NF2 and SLMAP. The authors do show an inhibition of PP2A activity on MST with the SAV N terminus, but the effect requires very high levels of peptide so may not be biologically relevant. Scaffolding activity provided by the SLMAP-MST1-SAV1 complex could explain the high concentrations needed in these experiments, but this would need to be discussed. Moreover, in the Discussion they seem to hedge against this mechanism, suggesting instead an indirect mechanism through FERM-containing proteins. If the interaction with NF2 is critical for effects of SAV on MST phosphorylation, it could suggest that any interaction with or recruitment of STRIPAK is not the key mechanism by which SAV regulates MST activity. In any case, a more coherent and complete discussion of these points is needed.</p><p>3) The interpretation of the structural data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> characterizing interaction between SAV and MST is incomplete. Data supporting competition between Rassf proteins and SAV for binding to Hpo/Mst was described several years ago by the Tapon lab. The Rassf interaction could provide an alternative mechanism for promoting recruitment of STRIPAK, as proposed by the Tapon lab, but this isn't discussed by the authors, and Rassf isn't depicted in their model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7.</xref> A more thorough and balanced discussion is needed here.</p><p>4) The experiment examining activation of Mst1 in the cytoplasm raised several concerns. The claim that there is equal activation of membrane and cytosol fractions is based on overexpression of components. Under these conditions they could be getting misleading activation, and perhaps they have saturated all membrane sites. Moreover, the control for membrane fraction is an integral membrane protein rather than a peripheral protein, and it isn't clear that the fractionation protocol will retain such proteins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30278.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are concerns about the reliability of the blots in Figure panels 2B, 3A, and 7B, and the quantification based on them (2C, 3B).

In our original experiments, we indeed used multiple different gels because we need to blot with so many different antibodies. Since most phospho-specific antibodies and antibodies against the total protein were rabbit polyclonal antibodies from commercial companies, we could not perform multiplexed blots (with secondary antibodies linked to different fluorophores) on the same membrane. Stripping and re-blotting the same membrane is a potential method that allows one to use a single gel for multiple antibodies in immunoblotting. However, we do not like this method, as we cannot be confident that the membrane-attached antibody can be equally and totally stripped each time. If this were not the case, it could lead to devastating artifacts. Thus, on balance, the use of multiple gels for blotting with different antibodies is the most appropriate and indeed widely accepted practice.</p><p>As a general practice in the lab, we routinely include loading controls for each gel. However, as pointed out by the reviewers, we did not use the GAPDH loading control for every gel in this study, because we did not observe significant variations from gel to gel using Ponseau S staining of the membranes. We agree with the reviewer that a proper control loading is needed for every blot to ensure scientific rigor. Therefore, we have re-performed the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>, and 7B, each with multiple biological repeats. Whenever possible, we re-blotted the same membrane first with rabbit polyclonal phospho-specific antibodies and then with mouse monoclonal antibodies against the relevant total proteins (e.g. YAP, SAV1 and SLMAP). Secondary antibodies against rabbit and mouse IgGs coupled to different fluorophores were used to detect the signals using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR). We also included the GAPDH loading control for each gel, but only one representative GAPDH blot was shown for each experiment. These new results are presented in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>, and 7B. Furthermore, we quantified phospho- and total protein bands in a set of three independent experiments. Each band intensity was normalized against the intensity of GAPDH from the same gel. The ratios of normalized phospho-proteins versus normalized total proteins were calculated and shown. These new results were presented in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>. We have also modified the Materials and methods accordingly. The results support our original conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The ability of the SLMAP deletion to bypass SAV1 necessity supports their model, but considering other available data the result is somewhat puzzling.

We have revised the main text and added the relevant references about the competition between RASSF and SAV for Hippo /MST binding accordingly. We also added more discussion on the alternative mechanism by which RASSF can recruit STRIPAK to Hippo/MST for its inactivation. Because our model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> highlights SAV1 regulation on MST activity shown by our own data, we did not add RASSF in our model. Although our results are entirely consistent with a role of RASSF in STRIPAK recruitment, we do not have direct data on RASSF to support this conclusion. Adding RASSF in the model might mislead the readers into thinking that we had examined RASSF in this study. Moreover, as it stands, the model is already complicated. We hope that the reviewers would understand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The experiment examining activation of Mst1 in the cytoplasm raised several concerns.

In our original experiments, we showed that SAV1 specifically activated overexpressed MST2. For example, many SAV1 mutants, especially WW domain deletion mutants (which are not related to MST2 binding), could not activate overexpressed MST2. Meanwhile, co-expression of RASSF1A could not enhance MST2 activation. We performed the membrane fractionation assay because we wanted to check where MST2 was activated by SAV1 inside the cells and if SAV1 affected MST2 localization in our experimental conditions. The result showed that MST2 was localized to both cytosol and membranes, and MST2 was equally activated by co-expression of SAV1 at both locations. As suggested by the reviewers, we performed the cytosol-membrane fractionation assay again using three different cellular localization markers: Tubulin for cytosolic proteins, Pan Cadherin for integral membrane proteins, and NF2 for peripheral membrane proteins. The results showed that the membrane fraction used in this assay contained both peripheral and integral membrane proteins. These new data were presented in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>. The relevant legend and method were revised accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
