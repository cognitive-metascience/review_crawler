The discontinuous hippocampal theta bursts have been proposed to drive the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations, yet the cellular substrate of these early interactions is still unresolved. Here, we selectively target optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of either dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age to elucidate their contribution to the emergence of prefrontal oscillatory entrainment. We show that despite stronger theta and ripples power in dorsal hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippocampus by phase-locking of neuronal firing via dense direct axonal projections. Theta band-confined activation by light of pyramidal neurons in intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1 that were transfected by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation with high-efficiency channelrhodopsin boosts prefrontal oscillations.

These findings may therefore inform on how the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex start connecting in humans.

Understanding these processes at the cellular level may therefore be the first step towards finding potential targets for treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cortical development</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>oscillations</kwd><kwd>prefrontal</kwd><kwd>hippocampal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>681577</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanganu-Opatz</surname><given-names>Ileana L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 936</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanganu-Opatz</surname><given-names>Ileana L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP 1665</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanganu-Opatz</surname><given-names>Ileana L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combined optogenetics and electrophysiology in vivo identified the cellular substrate of hippocampal drive that initiates the oscillatory entrainment of prefrontal cortex in neonatal mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the adult rodent brain, coordinated patterns of oscillatory activity code in a frequency-specific manner for sensory and cognitive performance. For example, learning and memory critically depend on oscillations within theta frequency band (4–12 Hz) that functionally couple the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brincat and Miller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Backus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eichenbaum, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wirt and Hyman, 2017</xref>). These frequency-tuned brain states are present already during early development, long before the memory and attentional abilities have fully matured. They have been extensively characterized and categorized according to their spatial and temporal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lindemann et al., 2016</xref>). Network oscillations during development have a highly discontinuous and fragmented structure with bursts of activity alternating with ‘silent’ periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanganu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seelke and Blumberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shen and Colonnese, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luhmann and Khazipov, 2018</xref>). The most common oscillatory pattern, spindle bursts, synchronizes large cortical and subcortical networks within theta-alpha frequency range. It is accompanied by slow delta waves as well as by faster discharges (beta and gamma oscillations) that account for local activation of circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brockmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of direct behavioral correlates, a mechanistic understanding of oscillatory rhythms in the developing brain is currently lacking. In sensory systems, spindle bursts have been proposed to act as a template facilitating the formation of cortical maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dupont et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanganu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tolner et al., 2012</xref>), whereas early gamma oscillations seem to control the organization of thalamocortical topography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Minlebaev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khazipov et al., 2013</xref>). In limbic systems dedicated to mnemonic and executive abilities, the knowledge on the relevance of early network oscillations is even sparser. Few lesion studies, yet without selectivity for specific activity patterns, suggested that prefrontal-hippocampal communication during development might be necessary for the maturation of episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krüger et al., 2012</xref>). Temporal associations between the firing and synaptic discharges of individual neurons and network oscillations in different frequency bands gave first insights into the cellular substrate of coordinated activity in neonates. Whereas in sensory systems, endogenous activation of sensory periphery drives entrainment of local circuitry through gap junction coupling as well as glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dupont et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanganu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minlebaev et al., 2009</xref>), in developing prefrontal-hippocampal networks, the excitatory drive from the HP has been proposed to activate a complex layer- and frequency-specific interplay in the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brockmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bitzenhofer and Hanganu-Opatz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bitzenhofer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>While most of this correlative evidence put forward the relevance of early oscillations beyond a simple epiphenomenal signature of developing networks, direct evidence for their causal contribution to circuit maturation is still missing. This is mainly due to the absence of a causal interrogation of developing networks, similarly to the investigations done in adult ones. Only recently the methodological difficulties related to area-, layer- and cell type-specific manipulations at neonatal age have been overcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bitzenhofer et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bitzenhofer et al., 2017b</xref>). By these means, the local neuronal interplay generating beta-gamma oscillations in the PFC has been elucidated. However, the long-range coupling causing the activation of local prefrontal circuits is still unresolved. We previously proposed that the hippocampal CA1 area drives the oscillatory entrainment of PFC at neonatal age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brockmann et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we developed a methodological approach to optically manipulate the neonatal HP along its septo-temporal axis. We provide causal evidence that theta frequency-specific activation of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of intermediate and ventral (i/vHP), but not of dorsal HP (dHP) elicits broad band oscillations in the PFC of neonatal mice via dense axonal projections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neonatal dorsal and intermediate/ventral hippocampus are differently entrained in discontinuous patterns of oscillatory activity</title><p>While different organization and function of dHP vs. i/vHP of adults have been extensively characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patel et al., 2013</xref>), their patterns of structural and functional maturation are still poorly understood. To fill this knowledge gap, we firstly examined the network oscillatory and firing activity of CA1 area of either dHP or i/vHP by performing extracellular recordings of the local field potential (LFP) and multiple unit activity (MUA) in neonatal [postnatal day (P) 8–10] non-anesthetized and urethane-anesthetized mice (n = 153). While urethane anesthesia led to an overall decrease of amplitude and power of oscillatory activity when compared to the non-anesthetized state of the same group of pups, the firing rate and timing as well as the synchrony and interactions within prefrontal-hippocampal networks were similar during both states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Due to the close proximity and the absence of reliable anatomical and functional borders between iHP and vHP at neonatal age, data from the two areas were pooled and referred as from i/vHP. The entire investigation was performed at the age of initiation of coupling between HP and PFC, that is, P8-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brockmann et al., 2011</xref>). Independent of the position along the dorsal-ventral axis, the CA1 area was characterized by discontinuous oscillations with main frequency in theta band (4–12 Hz) and irregular low amplitude beta-gamma band components, which have been previously categorized as theta oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brockmann et al., 2011</xref>). They were accompanied by prominent sharp-waves (SPWs) reversing across the pyramidal layer (str. pyr.) and by strong MUA discharge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and E</xref>). While the general patterns of activity were similar in dHP and i/vHP, their properties significantly differed between the sub-divisions. The theta bursts in i/vHP had significantly higher occurrence (i/vHP: 8.1 ± 0.2 oscillations/min, n = 103 mice vs. dHP: 5.2 ± 0.3 oscillations/min, n = 41 mice; p&lt;0.001), larger amplitude (i/vHP:110.6 ± 5.6 µV vs. dHP: 92.9 ± 2.6 µV; p=0.015), and shorter duration (i/vHP: 3.5 ± 0.1 s vs. dHP: 4.3 ± 0.1 s, p&lt;0.001) when compared with dHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Investigation of the spectral composition of theta bursts revealed significant differences within theta band with a stronger activation of dHP (relative power: dHP: 13.0 ± 1.3, n = 41 mice; i/vHP: 10.3 ± 0.5, n = 103 mice; p=0.026), whereas the faster frequency components were similar along the septo-temporal axis (relative power: 12–30 Hz: dHP, 15.0 ± 1.6, n = 41 mice; i/vHP, 13.2 ± 0.7 n = 103 mice, p=0.22; 30–100 Hz: dHP, 6.3 ± 0.6, n = 41 mice; i/vHP: 5.2 ± 0.3, n = 103 mice; p=0.073) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33158.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Patterns of discontinuous oscillatory activity in the CA1 area of the neonatal dHP and i/vHP in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Characteristic theta burst activity recorded in the CA1 area of the dHP (left) and i/vHP (right) of a P9 mouse displayed after band-pass filtering (4–100 Hz) and the corresponding MUA (500–5000 Hz).

The discontinuous theta oscillations in HP have been proposed to drive the activation of local circuits in the PFC. To assess the coupling of dHP and i/vHP with PFC, we recorded simultaneously LFP and MUA in the corresponding hippocampal CA1 area and the prelimbic subdivision (PL) of the PFC of P8-10 mice. The entire investigation focused on PL, since in adults it is the prefrontal subdivision with the most dense innervation from HP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jay and Witter, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vertes et al., 2007</xref>).

We previously characterized the network activity in the PL and showed that spindle-shaped oscillations switching between theta (4–12 Hz) and beta-gamma (12–40 Hz) frequency components alternate with periods of silence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brockmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cichon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bitzenhofer et al., 2015</xref>). The majority of prelimbic and hippocampal oscillations co-occurred within a narrow time window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The temporal synchrony between prelimbic and hippocampal oscillations was assessed by performing spectral coherence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The results revealed a stronger coupling for PL-i/vHP (4–12 Hz: 0.17 ± 0.0069; 12–30 Hz: 0.31 ± 0.011; 30–100 Hz: 0.11 ± 0.0069, n = 103 mice) when compared with PL-dHP (4–12 Hz: 0.12 ± 0.0081; 12–30 Hz: 0.18 ± 0.0094; 30–100 Hz: 0.084 ± 0.004, n = 41 mice). In line with previous investigations, this level of coherence is a genuine feature of investigated neonatal networks and not the result of non-specific and conduction synchrony, since we considered only the imaginary component of the coherence spectrum, which excludes zero time-lag synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nolte et al., 2004</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33158.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dynamic coupling of hippocampal and prefrontal oscillatory activity along septo-temporal axis during neonatal development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simultaneous LFP recordings of discontinuous oscillatory activity in dHP and PL (top) and i/vHP and PL (bottom).

Independent of the position along the septo-temporal axis, the information flow in theta or beta frequency band from either dorsal or intermediate/ventral HP to PL was significantly stronger than in the opposite direction. However, mean gPDC values for i/vHP → PL were significantly (p&lt;0.001) higher (0.069 ± 0.003, n = 103 mice) when compared with those for dHP → PL (0.053 ± 0.003, n = 41 mice). Cross-correlation analysis confirmed these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The stronger information flow from i/vHP to PL was confined to theta frequency range and was not detected for 12–30 Hz frequencies (i/vHP → PL: 0.048 ± 0.001; dHP → PL: 0.043 ± 0.002, p=0.16). Correspondingly, the firing of individual prelimbic neurons was precisely timed by the phase of oscillations in i/vHP but not dHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Almost 20% of clustered units (52 out of 310 units) were locked to theta phase in i/vHP, whereas only 6.5% of units (3 out of 46 units) were timed by dHP. The low number of locked cells in dHP precluded the comparison of coupling strength between the two hippocampal sub-divisions.</p><p>These results indicate that the distinct activity patterns in dHP and i/vHP at neonatal age have different outcomes in their coupling with the PL.

Simultaneous recordings from neonatal CA1 area either in dHP or i/vHP and PL showed that already at neonatal age, prefrontal oscillations are generated shortly (~100 ms) after hippocampal SPWs-ripples. This prelimbic activation is significantly stronger when induced by SPWs-ripples emerging in i/vHP than in dHP as reflected by the significantly higher power of oscillatory activity in theta (PL for dHP: 186.9 ± 12.5 µV<sup>2</sup>; PL for i/vHP: 249.5 ± 14.5 µV<sup>2</sup>, p=0.0088), beta (PL for dHP: 34.3 ± 3.3 µV<sup>2</sup>; PL for i/vHP: 48.1 ± 2.8 µV<sup>2</sup>, p=0.0049), and gamma (PL for dHP: 11.3 ± 0.9 µV<sup>2</sup>; PL for i/vHP: 17.4 ± 1.2 µV<sup>2</sup>, p=0.0026) frequency band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Moreover, the differences identified between the dHP – PL and i/vHP – PL communication argue for prominent augmentation of driving force along the septo-temporal hippocampal axis. To causally confirm these correlative evidences, we selectively activated by light the pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of either dHP or i/vHP that had been transfected with a highly efficient fast-kinetics double mutant ChR2E123T/T159C (ET/TC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berndt et al., 2011</xref>) and the red fluorescent protein tDimer2 by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation (IUE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This method enables stable area and cell type-specific transfection of neurons already prenatally without the need of cell-type specific promotors of a sufficiently small size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumgart and Grebe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szczurkowska et al., 2016</xref>). To target neurons along the septo-temporal axis, distinct transfection protocols were used. When the IUE was performed with two paddles placed 25° leftward angle from the midline and a 0° angle downward from anterior to posterior, tDimer-positive neurons were mainly found in the CA1 area of the dHP, as revealed by the analysis of consecutive coronal sections from IUE-transfected P8-10 mice. Targeting of i/vHP succeeded only when three paddles were used, with both positive poles located at 90° leftward angle from the midline and the third negative pole at 0° angle downward from anterior to posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, S2B).

These data identify the cellular substrate of the directed interactions between neonatal hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and offer new perspectives for the interrogation of long-range coupling in the developing brain and its behavioral readout.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Distinct patterns of functional maturation in dorsal and intermediate/ventral hippocampus</title><p>The abundant literature dedicated to the adult hippocampus mainly deals with a single cortical module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amaral et al., 2007</xref>). However, an increasing number of studies in recent years revealed distinct organization, processing mechanisms and behavioral relevance for dHP vs. i/vHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bannerman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strange et al., 2014</xref>). For example, the dHP, which receives dense projections from the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Witter and Amaral, 2004</xref>), is mainly involved in spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moser et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moser et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast, the ventral part receives strong cholinergic and dopaminergic innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Witter et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pitkänen et al., 2000</xref>) and contributes to processing of non-spatial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bannerman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bast et al., 2009</xref>). Correspondingly, the network and neuronal activity changes along the septo-temporal axis. The power of the most prominent activity pattern in the adult HP, the theta oscillations, as well as the theta timing of the neuronal firing was found to be substantially reduced in the i/vHP when compared with dHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Royer et al., 2010</xref>). By these means, the precise spatial representation deteriorates along the septo-temporal axis, since theta activity is directly linked to place cell representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O'Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Geisler et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, SPWs are more frequent and ripples have higher amplitude and frequency in the ventral HP than in the dHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patel et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our data uncovered that some of these differences in the activity patterns along the septo-temporal axis emerge already during early neonatal development. Similar to findings from adult rodents, the power of theta bursts at neonatal age was higher in dHP than in i/vHP. The amplitude of SPWs and the power of ripples decreased along the septo-temporal axis. These findings give insights into the mechanisms underlying the early generation of activity patterns. It has been proposed that the differences in theta dynamics along the septo-temporal axis result from distinct innervation, on the one hand, and from specific intrinsic properties of hippocampal neurons, on the other hand. Cholinergic projections of different origin in the dHP and i/vHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stewart and Fox, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amaral et al., 2007</xref>) as well as maturational differences in the intrinsic resonant properties of hippocampal neurons and notable gradients of parvalbumin immunoreactivity along the septo-temporal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Honeycutt et al., 2016</xref>) may contribute to the observed differences.</p><p>Quantification along the septo-temporal axis revealed that, similar to adults, the occurrence of SPWs was higher in the i/vHP and their amplitude was larger in the neonatal dHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patel et al., 2013</xref>). It is still an issue of debate when exactly ripples emerge in the developing hippocampus, although it is obvious that they appear later than theta bursts and SPWs, most likely towards the end of the first and during second postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buhl and Buzsáki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brockmann et al., 2011</xref>). Their underlying mechanisms at neonatal age remain also largely unknown and need to be related to age-dependent changes in gap junctional coupling and GABA switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Ari et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yuste et al., 1995</xref>). The organization of SPWs and ripples is of particular relevance when considering their impact on the early activity of PFC. Already at neonatal age, the prelimbic firing and oscillatory entrainment is timed by SPWs-ripples. Of note, the degree of timing varies along the septo-temporal axis and is much higher for the i/vHP.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Optogenetic interrogation of long-range coupling in the developing brain</title><p>At adult age the communication between PFC and HP has been investigated in relationship with memory tasks both under physiological and disease-related conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirota et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sigurdsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eichenbaum, 2017</xref>). Depending on the phase of memory processing, the prefrontal-hippocampal coupling via oscillatory synchrony has been found to be either unidirectional from the HP to PFC or bidirectional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Place et al., 2016</xref>). Both theta and gamma network oscillations contribute to the functional long-range coupling. The model of prefrontal-hippocampal communication has been initially built based on experimental evidence correlating the temporal organization of neuronal and network activity in the two brain areas. The time delay between spike trains and oscillatory phase or between oscillations enabled to propose that the information flows in one direction or the other via mono- or polysynaptic axonal projections. More recently, a direct causal assessment of the coupling became possible through optogenetic interrogation of neural circuits. In a seminal study, Spellman and colleagues used light-driven inhibition of axonal terminals for dissecting the directionality of interactions between PFC and HP during different phases of memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed that at neonatal age, long before full maturation of memory and attentional abilities, discontinuous theta bursts in i/vHP are temporally correlated to the network oscillations in the PFC and time the prefrontal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brockmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hartung et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the temporal delay of 10–20 ms between prefrontal and hippocampal spike trains as well as the estimated directionality of information flow between the two areas suggested that hippocampal theta drives the oscillatory entrainment of the local circuits in the PFC. The present data directly prove this hypothesis, taking advantage of the recently developed protocol for optogenetic manipulation of neuronal networks at neonatal age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bitzenhofer et al., 2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2017b</xref>). We observed that prelimbic circuits were effectively entrained when the stimulation of paramidal neurons in i/vHP occurred at 8 Hz but not at 4 Hz or 16 Hz. Such frequency-specific effect might result from intrinsic resonance properties of neurons mediated through hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stark et al., 2013</xref>). It has been previously proposed that oscillatory activity in cortical regions may be entrained due to the rhythmic theta-band output from the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stark et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Colgin, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Several considerations regarding the technical challenges of optogenetic manipulation of HP along the septo-temporal axis need to be made. Besides the inherent difficulties related to the specificity of promoters for selective transfection and the targeting procedure that are ubiquitary for all developing networks and have been addressed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bitzenhofer et al., 2017a</xref>), confinement of light-sensitive proteins to pyramidal neurons of either dHP or i/vHP required special attention. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bitzenhofer et al., 2017b</xref>), we developed a selective targeting protocol of neonatal neurons that relies on the combination of CAG promoter and IUE. By these means, the expression of light-sensitive proteins in the neurons located in the neocortical layer and area of interest was sufficiently high to ensure their reliable activation. Similarly, the expression of ChR2(ET/TC) in the pyramidal neurons of hippocampal CA1 area under the CAG promoter was sufficiently high to reliably cause network and neuronal activity. Taking into account that viral transduction, which usually requires 10–14 days for stable expression, is only of limited usability to investigate local network interactions during development, IUE seems to represent the method of choice for manipulating circuits at this early age. IUE enables targeting of precursor cells of neuronal and glial subpopulations, based on their distinct spatial and temporal patterns of generation in the ventricular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tabata and Nakajima, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Borrell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niwa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2015</xref>). IUE based on two electrode paddles enabled selective targeting of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of dHP in more than half of the pups per litter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), but it completely failed (0 out of 32 mice) to target these neurons in i/vHP. Therefore, it was necessary to use a modified IUE protocol based on three electrodes. This protocol, although more complicated and time consuming, allows reliable transfection at brain locations that are only able to be sporadically targeted by two electrodes The IUE-induced expression of light sensitive proteins enables the reliable firing of neurons in both dHP and i/vHP in response to light pulses. One intriguing question is how many pyramidal neurons in str. pyr. of CA1 area must be synchronously activated to drive the oscillatory entrainment of prelimbic circuitry. Anterograde and retrograde tracing demonstrated the density increase along the septo-temporal axis of hippocampal axons targeting the PL. Light activation/inhibition of these axonal terminals paired with monitoring of network oscillations in the PFC might offer valuable insights into the patterns of coupling sufficient for activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional relevance of frequency-specific drive within developing prefrontal-hippocampal networks</title><p>Abundant literature links theta frequency coupling within prefrontal-hippocampal networks to cognitive performance and emotional states of adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu and Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Place et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ye et al., 2017</xref>). The early emergence of directed communication between PFC and i/vHP raises the question of functional relevance of this early coupling during development and at adulthood.</p><p>The maturation of cognitive abilities is a process even more protracted than sensory development and starts during second-third postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanganu-Opatz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cirelli and Tononi, 2015</xref>). Some of these abilities, such as recognition memory, can be easily monitored at early age and seems to critically rely on structurally and functionally intact prefrontal-hippocampal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krüger et al., 2012</xref>). Direct assessment of the role of neonatal communication for memory performance as performed for adult circuits is impossible due to the temporal delay of the two processes. The alternative is to manipulate the activity of either PFC, HP or the connectivity between them during defined developmental time windows and monitor the juvenile and adult consequences at structural, functional and behavioral levels. The present data and optogenetic protocol represent the pre-requisite of this investigation, opening new perspectives for assessing the adult behavioral readout of long-range communication in the developing brain.</p><p>One question that remains to be addressed is how the hippocampal theta drive shapes the maturation of prefrontal-hippocampal networks. Following the general rules of activity-dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hubel et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huberman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yasuda et al., 2011</xref>), the precisely timed excitatory inputs from the i/vHP to the PL might facilitate the wiring of local prefrontal circuitry and enable the refinement of behaviorally relevant communication scaffold between the two regions. By these means, the prefrontal activity driven by projection neurons in the HP act as a template, having a pre-adaptive function that facilitates the tuning of circuits with regard to future conditions. This instructive role of theta activity for the prefrontal circuits needs to be proven by manipulation of temporal structure of the hippocampal drive without affecting the overall level of activity. Understanding the rules that govern the early organization of large-scale networks represents the pre-requisite for identifying the structural and functional deficits related to abnormal behavior and disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>antibody</td><td>mouse monoclonal Alexa <break/>Fluor-488 conjugated <break/>antibody against NeuN</td><td>Merck Millipore</td><td>MAB377X</td><td>1:200 dilution</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>rabbit polyclonal primary <break/>antibody against GABA</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>A2052</td><td>1:1000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor-488 goat <break/>anti-rabbit IgG <break/>secondary antibody</td><td>Merck Millipore</td><td>A11008</td><td>1:500 dilution</td></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>Isoflurane</td><td>Abbott</td><td>B506</td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>Urethane</td><td>Fluka analytical</td><td>94300</td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>Fluorogold</td><td>Fluorochome, LLC</td><td>52–9400</td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>Biotinylated dextran <break/>amine, 10.000 MW</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>D1956</td><td/></tr><tr><td>commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="bottom">NucleoBond PC 100</td><td>Macherey-Nagel</td><td>740573</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background <break/>(mouse, both genders)</td><td>C57Bl/6J</td><td>Universitätsklinikum <break/>Hamburg-Eppendorf – <break/>Animal facility</td><td>C57Bl/6J</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/008199">https://www.jax.org/strain/008199</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background <break/>(mouse, both genders)</td><td>Tg(dlx5a-cre)1Mekk/J</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Tg(dlx5a-cre)1Mekk/J</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/017455">https://www.jax.org/strain/017455</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background <break/>(mouse, both genders)</td><td>R26-CAG-LSL- <break/>2XChETA-tdTomato</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>R26-CAG-LSL-2XChETA- <break/>tdTomato</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/021188">https://www.jax.org/strain/021188</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background <break/>(mouse, both genders)</td><td>Ai40(RCL-ArchT/EGFP)-D</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Ai40(RCL-ArchT/EGFP)-D</td><td/></tr><tr><td>recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pAAV-CAG-ChR2 <break/>(E123T/T159C) <break/>−2AtDimer2</td><td>Provided by T.

Solution containing 1.25 µg/µl DNA [pAAV-CAG-ChR2(E123T/T159C)−2A-tDimer2, or pAAV-CAG-tDimer2)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and 0.1% fast green dye at a volume of 0.75–1.25 µl were injected into the right lateral ventricle of individual embryos using pulled borosilicate glass capillaries with a sharp and long tip. Plasmid DNA was purified with NucleoBond (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). 2A encodes for a ribosomal skip sentence, splitting the fluorescent protein tDimer2 from the opsin during gene translation. Two different IUE protocols were used to target pyramidal neurons in CA1 area of either dHP or i/vHP. To target dHP, each embryo within the uterus was placed between the electroporation tweezer-type paddles (5 mm diameter, Protech, TX, USA) that were oriented at a 25° leftward angle from the midline and a 0° angle downward from anterior to posterior. Electrode pulses (35 V, 50 ms) were applied five times at intervals of 950 ms controlled by an electroporator (CU21EX, BEX, Japan) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>(i)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumgart and Grebe, 2015</xref>). To target i/vHP, a tri-polar approach was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szczurkowska et al., 2016</xref>). Each embryo within the uterus was placed between the electroporation tweezer-type paddles (5 mm diameter, both positive poles, Protech, TX, USA) that were oriented at 90° leftward angle from the midline and a 0° angle downward from anterior to posterior. A third custom build negative pole was positioned on top of the head roughly between the eyes. Electrode pulses (30 V, 50 ms) were applied six times at intervals of 950 ms controlled by an electroporator (CU21EX, BEX, Japan). By these means, neural precursor cells from the subventricular zone, which radially migrate into the HP, were transfected. Uterine horns were placed back into the abdominal cavity after electroporation. The abdominal cavity was filled with warm sterile PBS (37°C) and abdominal muscles and skin were sutured individually with absorbable and non-absorbable suture thread, respectively. After recovery, pregnant mice were returned to their home cages, which were half placed on a heating blanket for two days after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-1-2"><title>Retrograde and anterograde tracing</title><p>For retrograde tracing, mice were injected at P7 with Fluorogold (Fluorochrome, LLC, USA) unilaterally into the PFC using iontophoresis. The pups were placed in a stereotactic apparatus and kept under anesthesia with isoflurane (induction: 5%, maintenance: 2.5%) for the entire procedure. A 10 mm incision of the skin on the head was performed with small scissors. The bone above the PFC (0.5 mm anterior to bregma, 0.3 mm right to the midline) was carefully removed using a syringe. A glass capillary (≈20 µm tip diameter) was filled with ≈1 µL of 5% Fluorogold diluted in sterile water by capillary forces, and a silver wire was inserted such that it was in contact with the Fluorogold solution. For anterograde tracing, mice were injected at P7 with the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) unilaterally into i/vHP using iontophoresis and surgery protocols as described above. The bone above i/vHP (0.7 mm anterior to lambda, 2.3 mm right to the midline) was carefully removed using a syringe. A glass capillary (≈30 µm tip diameter) was filled with ≈1 µL of 5% BDA diluted in 0.125 M phosphate buffer by capillary forces, and a silver wire was inserted such that it was in contact with the BDA solution. For both anterograde and retrograde tracing, the positive pole of the iontophoresis device was attached to the silver wire, the negative one was attached to the skin of the neck. The capillary was carefully lowered into the PFC (≈1.5 mm dorsal from the dura) or HP (≈1.5 mm dorsal from the dura). Iontophoretically injection by applying anodal current to the pipette (6 s on/off current pulses of 6 µA) was done for 5 min. Following injection, the pipette was left in place for at least 5 min and then slowly retracted. The scalp was closed by application of tissue adhesive glue and the pups were left on a heating pad for 10–15 min to fully recover before they were given back to the mother. The pups were perfused at P10.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-1-3"><title>Surgical preparation for acute electrophysiological recording and light delivery</title><p>For recordings in non-anesthetized state, 0.5% bupivacain/1% lidocaine was locally applied on the neck muscles. For recordings under anesthesia, mice were injected i.p. with urethane (1 mg/g body weight; Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) prior to surgery. For both groups, under isoflurane anesthesia (induction: 5%, maintenance: 2.5%) the head of the pup was fixed into a stereotaxic apparatus using two plastic bars mounted on the nasal and occipital bones with dental cement. The bone above the PFC (0.5 mm anterior to bregma, 0.5 mm right to the midline for layer V/VI), hippocampus (2.0 mm posterior to bregma, 1.0 mm right to the midline for dHP, 3.5 mm posterior to bregma, 3.5 mm right to the midline for i/vHP) was carefully removed by drilling a hole of &lt;0.5 mm in diameter. After a 10–20 min recovery period on a heating blanket mice were moved to the setup for electrophysiological recording. Throughout the surgery and recording session the mouse was positioned on a heating pad with the temperature kept at 37°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-1-4"><title>Perfusion</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with 10% ketamine (aniMedica, Germany)/2% xylazine (WDT, Germany) in 0.9% NaCl solution (10 µg/g body weight, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with Histofix (Carl Roth, Germany) containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 30–40 min. Brains were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hr.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavioral testing</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Examination of developmental milestones</title><p>Mouse pups were tested for their somatic development and reflexes at P2, P5 and P8. Weight, body and tail length were assessed. Surface righting reflex was quantified as time (max 30 s) until the pup turned over with all four feet on the ground after being placed on its back. Cliff aversion reflex was quantified as time (max 30 s) until the pup withdrew after snout and forepaws were positioned over an elevated edge. Vibrissa placing was rated positive if the pup turned its head after gently touching the whiskers with a toothpick.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Electrophysiological recording</title><p>A one-shank electrode (NeuroNexus, MI, USA) containing 1 × 16 recording sites (0.4–0.8 MΩ impedance, 100 mm spacing) was inserted into the layer V/VI of PFC. One-shank optoelectrodes (NeuroNexus, MI, USA) containing 1 × 16 recordings sites (0.4–0.8 MΩ impedance, 50 mm spacing) aligned with an optical fiber (105 mm diameter) ending 200 μm above the top recording site was inserted into either dHP or i/vHP. A silver wire was inserted into the cerebellum and served as ground and reference electrode. A recovery period of 10 min following insertion of electrodes before acquisition of data was provided. Extracellular signals were band-pass filtered (0.1–9,000 Hz) and digitized (32 kHz) with a multichannel extracellular amplifier (Digital Lynx SX; Neuralynx, Bozeman, MO, USA) and the Cheetah acquisition software (Neuralynx). Spontaneous (i.e. not induced by light stimulation) activity was recorded for 15 min at the beginning and end of each recording session as baseline activity. Only the baseline prior to stimulation epochs was used for data analysis. The position of recording electrodes in PL and CA1 area of dHP or i/vHP was confirmed after histological assessment post-mortem. For the analysis of prelimbic LFP, the recording site centered in PL was used, whereas for the analysis of spiking activity two channels above and two channels below this site were additionally considered. Recording site in cingulate or infralimbic sub-divisions of the PL were excluded from analysis. For the analysis of hippocampal LFP, the recording site located in <italic>str pyr</italic>,where sharp-waves reverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bitzenhofer and Hanganu-Opatz, 2014</xref>), was used to minimize any non-stationary effects of the large amplitude events. For the analysis of hippocampal firing, two channels below and two channels above this site were additionally considered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Light stimulation</title><p>Pulsed (laser on-off) light or ramp (linearly increasing power) stimulations were performed with an arduino uno (Arduino, Italy) controlled diode laser (473 nm or 600 nm; Omicron, Austria). Laser power was adjusted to trigger neuronal spiking in response to &gt;25% of 3-ms-long light pulses at 16 Hz. Resulting light power was in the range of 20–40 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> at the fiber tip. For each frequency used (4, 8 and 16 Hz), stimuli (3 ms pulse length, 3 s stimulation duration, 6 s inter stimulation interval) were repeated (30 times) in a randomized order.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histology</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Brains were sectioned coronally at 50 µm. Free-floating slices were permeabilized and blocked with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), 10% normal bovine serum (Jackson Immuno Research, PA, USA) and 0.02% sodium azide. Subsequently, slices were incubated overnight with mouse monoclonal Alexa Fluor-488 conjugated antibody against NeuN (1:200, MAB377X, Merck Millipore, MA, USA) or rabbit polyclonal primary antibody against GABA (1:1,000, A2052; Sigma-Aldrich), followed by 2 hr incubation with Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:500, A11008; Merck Millipore). Slices were transferred to glass slides and covered with Fluoromount (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA).</p><p>For 3.3’-diaminobenzidie (DAB) staining sections (prepared as described above) were rinsed in PBS (0.125 M, pH 7.4–7.6) for 10 min, treated with peroxide solution (3% peroxide, 10% methanol in 0.125 M PB) for 10 min to quench any endogenous peroxidases within the tissue, and rinsed again. Subsequently, the sections were washed in PBS containing 0.5% Triton-X and incubated with avidin biotinylated enzyme complex (ABC, VECTASTAIN ABC Kit, USA) at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. After rinsing in Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), the sections were further incubated with DAB working buffer (DAB peroxidase substrate kit, Vector Laboratories, USA) at room temperature for 2–10 min. After the signal was detected, all sections were rinsed with Tris-HCl.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Imaging</title><p>Wide field fluorescence was performed to reconstruct the recording electrode position in brain slices of electrophysiologically investigated pups and to localize tDimer2 expression in pups after IUE. High magnification images were acquired with a confocal microscope (DM IRBE, Leica, Germany) to quantify tDimer2 expression and immunopositive cells (1–4 brain slices/investigated mouse). For DAB staining, brightfield images were obtained using Zeiss imager M1 microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and enhanced using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Image program.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Immunohistochemistry quantification</title><p>All images were similarly analyzed with ImageJ. For quantification of fluorogold tracing automatic cell counting was done using custom-written tools. To quantify tDimer2, NeuN and GABA-positive neurons, manual counting was performed, since the high neuronal density in str. pyr. prevented reliable automatic counting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Spectral analysis of LFP</title><p>Data were imported and analyzed offline using custom-written tools in the Matlab environment (MathWorks). Data were processed as follows: band-pass filtered (500–5,000 Hz) to analyze MUA and low-pass filtered (&lt;1,400 Hz) using a third-order Butterworth filter before downsampling to 3.2 kHz to analyze LFP. All filtering procedures were performed in a manner preserving phase information.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Detection of oscillatory activity</title><p>The detection and of discontinuous patterns of activity in the neonatal PL and HP were performed using a modified version of the previously developed algorithm for unsupervised analysis of neonatal oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cichon et al., 2014</xref>) and confirmed by visual inspection. Briefly, deflections of the root mean square of band-pass filtered signals (1–100 Hz) exceeding a variance-depending threshold were assigned as network oscillations. The threshold was determined by a Gaussian fit to the values ranging from 0 to the global maximum of the root-mean-square histogram. If two oscillations occurred within 200 ms of each other, they were considered as one. Only oscillations lasting &gt;1 s was included.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>Detection of sharpwaves</title><p>Sharpwaves were detected by subtracting the filtered signal (1–300 Hz) from the recording sites 100 µm above and 100 µm below the recording site in str. pyr. Sharpwaves were then detected as peaks above five times the standard deviation of the subtracted signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Power spectral density</title><p>Power spectral density was calculated using the Welch’s method. Briefly, segments of the recorded signal were glued together (1 s segments for oscillatory activity; 300 ms segments for sharpwave pre/post comparison; 100 ms segments for ripple comparison; 3 s for light evoked activity) and power were then calculated using non-overlapping windows. Time–frequency plots were calculated by transforming the data using Morlet continuous wavelet.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6"><title>Coherence</title><p>Coherence was calculated using the imaginary coherency method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nolte et al., 2004</xref>).

The method attempts to describe the causal relationship between multivariate time series based on the decomposition of multivariate partial coherences computed from multivariate autoregressive models. The LFP signal was divided into segments containing the oscillatory activity. Signal was de-noised using wavelets with the Matlab wavelet toolbox. After de-noising, gPDC was calculated using the gPDC algorithm previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baccala et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-8"><title>Single unit activity analysis</title><p>SUA was detected and clustered using Offline Sorter (Plexon, TC, USA). 1–4 single units were detected at each recording site. Subsequently, data were imported and analyzed using custom-written tools in the Matlab software (MathWorks). The firing rate temporally related to SPWs was calculated by aligning all units to the detected SPWs. For assessing the phase locking of units to LFP, we firstly used the Rayleigh test for non-uniformity of circular data to identify the units significantly locked to network oscillations. The phase was calculated by extracting the phase component using the Hilbert transform of the filtered signal at each detected spike. Spikes occurring in a 15 ms-long time window after the start of a light pulse were considered to be light-evoked. Stimulation efficacy was calculated as the probability of at least one spike occurring in this period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 21 (IBM, NY, USA) or Matlab. Data were tested for normal distribution by the Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally distributed data were tested for significant differences (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01 and ***p&lt;0.001) using paired t-test, unpaired t-test or one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc analysis. Not normally distributed data were tested with the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test. The circular statistics toolbox was used to test for significant differences in the phase locking data. Data are presented as mean ±SEM. No statistical measures were used to estimate sample size since effect size was unknown. Investigators were not blinded to the group allocation during the experiments. Unsupervised analysis software was used if possible to preclude investigator biases.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Jonas-Frederic Sauer (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Ahlbeck et al. examines the early postnatal development of long-range projections between the hippocampus and the prelimbic cortex, particularly their role in driving oscillatory activity patterns in the prelimbic cortex of young mice. In this study the authors apply a broad set of techniques including electrophysiological recordings of local field potentials as well as single units, axonal tracing and optogenetic applications to examine first, what activity patterns are expressed in the developing dorsal and ventral hippocampus and second, whether glutamatergic drive originating in the hippocampus influences the activity in the prelimbic area. The study shows that the ventral hippocampus is anatomically strongly coupled to the prelimbic area and drives theta- and β/γ-modulated activity patterns in the prelimbic cortex. In contrast, the dorsal hippocampus shows locally higher theta power but is less involved in this drive.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers agreed that this is a very interesting study that nicely builds upon the authors previous work and provides strong evidence for a topographic drive for prefrontal activity located in the v/i portion of the neonatal hippocampus. However, one of the main criticisms was that the current set of experiments does not directly prove the hypothesis that 'theta in the HP drives the oscillatory entrainment of the local circuits in the PFC'. It is not entirely clear whether the number of optogenetically activated HP pyramidal cells reflects the number of cells active during a natural oscillation event. Furthermore, during optogenetic stimulation, the spikes might be more tightly synchronized compared to naturally occurring oscillations, which might favor downstream synchronization.</p><p>Rather, the manuscript shows that driving a substantial proportion of HP pyramidal neurons at theta frequency induces PFC oscillations. Thus, a causal proof requires additional experiments, such as specific silencing of the ventral hippocampus (optogenetically or pharmacologically). Without this experiment the relationships remain only correlational or modulatory.</p><p>2) More details are required on where from the LFP recordings were made since the amplitude and waveforms are strongly dependent on cortical and hippocampal depth. The authors should perform CSD analysis to analyze the amplitude and the power of theta and ripple oscillations both in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.</p><p>3) Please provide averaged single optostimulus – triggered LFP/unit PETH in the PFC – as functional evidence for the connections.</p><p>4) One of the emerging questions from the study is whether periodic ontogenetic activation of ventral hippocampal principal cells has a similar effect on the activity patterns in the prelimbic area than in the adult mice. Moreover, it remains unclear why the 8 Hz ontogenetic stimulation of hippocampal principal cells is more efficient than 4 and/or 16 Hz stimulation in driving prefrontal activity patterns? These questions can be addressed in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Glutamatergic drive along the septo-temporal axis of hippocampus boosts prelimbic oscillations in the neonatal mouse&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The figures and the main body of the text have been improved according to the comments, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Error in the text, subsection “Theta activity within dorsal and intermediate / ventral hippocampus differently entrains the neonatal prelimbic cortex”, second paragraph: Figure 1—figure supplement 2D and not Figure 2—figure supplement 2D.</p><p>2) There seems to be a confusion about the numbering of the Figure supplements. The included references to Figure 2—figure supplement 2D (subsection “Theta activity within dorsal and intermediate / ventral hippocampus differently entrains the neonatal prelimbic cortex”, second paragraph) and Figure 3—figure supplement 2E (subsection “SPWs-mediated output of intermediate / ventral but not dorsal hippocampus times network oscillations and spiking response in the neonatal prelimbic cortex”, first paragraph) both point to Figure 1—figure supplement 2. To meet eLife’s guidelines on figures that should be linked to a main figure, I would suggest to place the content of Figure 1—figure supplement 2D in a new Figure 2—figure supplement 1, and Figure 1—figure supplement 2E in a new Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><p>3) References to 'Figure S2A' and 'Figure S2B' in the subsection “Neonatal dorsal and intermediate / ventral hippocampus are differently entrained in discontinuous patterns of oscillatory activity” should be corrected to 'Figure 1—figure supplement 2A' and 2B', respectively.</p><p>4) Detailed and rigorous statistical information should be supplied in an excel table.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33158.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers agreed that this is a very interesting study that nicely builds upon the authors previous work and provides strong evidence for a topographic drive for prefrontal activity located in the v/i portion of the neonatal hippocampus.

For this, we modulated the hippocampal activity by selectively silencing or activating the interneurons transfected with excitatory (ChETA) or inhibitory (ArchT) light-sensitive proteins with blue and yellow light, respectively. Silencing the interneuronal activity in HP caused prominent oscillatory discharges both in HP and PFC, whereas its activation diminished the oscillatory entrainment within prefrontal-hippocampal circuits. We added the new data to Results (subsection “Selective light manipulation activation of pyramidal neurons and interneurons in CA1 area of intermediate / ventral but not dorsal hippocampus causes frequency-specific changes in the oscillatory entrainment of neonatal prelimbic circuits”, fifth paragraph) and supplemented the manuscript with a new main figure (Figure 6). These findings complement our previously published results when pharmacological silencing of hippocampus led to diminishment of prefrontal oscillatory activity (Brockmann et al., 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More details are required on where from the LFP recordings were made since the amplitude and waveforms are strongly dependent on cortical and hippocampal depth.

To avoid redundancy, we did not include similar findings in the present paper. The exact location of recording electrodes in PFC and HP was confirmed after histological investigation post-mortem. We supplemented the manuscript with details on the selection of recording sites for LFP and spiking analysis (Materials and methods, subsection “Electrophysiology”).

These questions can be addressed in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed these issues in Discussion (subsection “Optogenetic interrogation of long-range coupling in the developing brain”, second paragraph).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The figures and the main body of the text have been improved according to the comments, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Error in the text, subsection “Theta activity within dorsal and intermediate / ventral hippocampus differently entrains the neonatal prelimbic cortex”, second paragraph: Figure 1—figure supplement 2D and not Figure 2—figure supplement 2D.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There seems to be a confusion about the numbering of the Figure supplements. The included references to Figure 2—figure supplement 2D (subsection “Theta activity within dorsal and intermediate / ventral hippocampus differently entrains the neonatal prelimbic cortex”, second paragraph) and Figure 3—figure supplement 2E (subsection “SPWs-mediated output of intermediate / ventral but not dorsal hippocampus times network oscillations and spiking response in the neonatal prelimbic cortex”, first paragraph) both point to Figure 1—figure supplement 2. To meet eLife’s guidelines on figures that should be linked to a main figure, I would suggest to place the content of Figure 1—figure supplement 2D in a new Figure 2—figure supplement 1, and Figure 1—figure supplement 2E in a new Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified to meet the <italic>eLife</italic> guidelines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) References to 'Figure S2A' and 'Figure S2B' in the subsection “Neonatal dorsal and intermediate / ventral hippocampus are differently entrained in discontinuous patterns of oscillatory activity” should be corrected to 'Figure 1—figure supplement 2A' and 2B', respectively.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Detailed and rigorous statistical information should be supplied in an excel table.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the statistics table.</p></body></sub-article></article>
