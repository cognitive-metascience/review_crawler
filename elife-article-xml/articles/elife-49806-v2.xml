proteostasis and the regulation of vital processes through ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated substrates. To accomplish the multi-step degradation process, the proteasome’s regulatory particle, consisting of lid and base subcomplexes, undergoes major conformational changes whose origin is unknown. Investigating the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> proteasome, we found that peripheral interactions between the lid subunit Rpn5 and the base AAA+ ATPase ring are important for stabilizing the substrate-engagement-competent state and coordinating the conformational switch to processing states upon substrate engagement. Disrupting these interactions perturbs the conformational equilibrium and interferes with degradation initiation, while later processing steps remain unaffected. Similar defects in early degradation steps are observed when eliminating hydrolysis in the ATPase subunit Rpt6, whose nucleotide state seems to control proteasome conformational transitions. These results provide important insight into interaction networks that coordinate conformational changes with various stages of degradation, and how modulators of conformational equilibria may influence substrate turnover.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>26S proteasome</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin-proteasome System</kwd><kwd>AAA+ ATPase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM094497</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2EB020402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lander</surname><given-names>Gabriel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>132279-PF-18-189-01-DMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de la Peña</surname><given-names>Andres H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lander</surname><given-names>Gabriel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD021634</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lander</surname><given-names>Gabriel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The 26S proteasome lid subcomplex acts as an external scaffold whose interactions with the ATPase motor stabilize the substrate-engagement-competent state, and control conformational changes upon engagement for subsequent degradation steps.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The 26S proteasome is the principal ATP-dependent protease in eukaryotic cells and responsible for the majority of targeted protein turnover, both through the degradation of short-lived regulatory proteins and the clearance of damaged or misfolded polypeptides for protein-quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998</xref>). Ubiquitin ligases mark obsolete proteins with poly-ubiquitin chains and thereby target them to ubiquitin receptors on the 26S proteasome, which represents the last component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and mechanically unfolds, deubiquitinates, and translocates protein substrates into an internal chamber for proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bard et al., 2018a</xref>). To accomplish these various tasks of substrate processing, the 26S proteasome undergoes significant conformational rearrangements whose origin and control still remain largely elusive.</p><p>At the center of the 26S proteasome is a barrel-shaped core peptidase with sequestered proteolytic active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Groll et al., 1997</xref>). This core is capped on one or both ends by a regulatory particle that consists of two subcomplexes, referred to as the &quot;lid&quot; and the &quot;base&quot;, and is responsible for the recognition, unfolding, and transfer of protein substrates into the core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bard et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glickman et al., 1998a</xref>). The base contains 10 subunits, including three ubiquitin receptors, Rpn1, Rpn10, and Rpn13, the large scaffolding subunit Rpn2, and six distinct ATPases that form a ring-shaped, heterohexameric AAA+ (<underline>A</underline>TPase <underline>A</underline>ssociated with various cellular <underline>A</underline>ctivities) motor in the order Rpt1-Rpt2-Rpt6-Rpt3-Rpt4-Rpt5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tomko et al., 2010</xref>). These ATPases dock on top of the core peptidase to open its gate for substrate transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). As in other protein unfoldases of the AAA+ family, the six Rpt subunits in the proteasome base use loops with conserved aromatic residues projecting into the central pore of the hexamer to interact with the substrate polypeptide, mechanically pull on it, and drive its translocation into the 20S core in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner. These loops lie deep in the pore, such that appropriate substrates require not only a ubiquitin modification for binding to a proteasomal receptor, but also a flexible initiation region of 20–25 residues to reach and engage with this AAA+ translocation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Prakash et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The nine-subunit lid binds to one side of the base and thus further expands the regulatory particle’s asymmetry contributed by the heterohexameric ATPase ring. The lid includes the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent deubiquitinase (DUB) Rpn11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glickman et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yao and Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Verma et al., 2002</xref>) in a hetero-dimeric complex with another MPN-domain containing subunit, Rpn8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Worden et al., 2014</xref>), as well as six scaffolding subunits, Rpn3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 12. In addition to lid contacts with Rpn2 and the N-terminal regions of Rpt3 and Rpt6, the subunits Rpn5, Rpn6, and Rpn7 use their N-terminal TPR domains to specifically interact with the ATPase domains of Rpt4, Rpt3, and Rpt6, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lander et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lasker et al., 2012</xref>). Rpn5 and Rpn6 also contact the core peptidase and thus appear to form an external scaffold bridging the lid, base, and core subcomplexes within the proteasome holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lander et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matyskiela et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous cryo-electron microscopy studies identified multiple proteasome conformations with distinct relative orientations and contacts of base, lid, and core that are structurally conserved between yeast and human proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matyskiela et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Śledź et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Unverdorben et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wehmer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). In the absence of substrate, the proteasome exists in two conformations, s1 and s2, in which Rpt1-Rpt6 form a spiral staircase arrangement with Rpt3 in the top position. In the s1 state, the ATPase ring is not coaxially aligned with the core peptidase, and Rpn11 is offset from the central processing channel, allowing substrate access to the pore entrance. In contrast, the s2 state is characterized by a rotated lid position relative to the base and a coaxial alignment of Rpn11, the ATPase ring, and the core peptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Unverdorben et al., 2014</xref>). Substrate engagement induces conformations that are overall very similar to s2, with a continuous central channel for efficient substrate translocation and a centrally aligned Rpn11 that leaves only a small gap to the subjacent Rpts for substrate to be pulled through, facilitating co-translocational deubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matyskiela et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). These substrate-processing states, named s3-s6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matyskiela et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Unverdorben et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wehmer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2019</xref>), show AAA+ motor conformations in which various Rpts adopt the individual vertical position in the spiral staircase, depending on the progression of the ATP-hydrolysis cycle in the hexamer. The s5 state thereby resembles s2, with the exception of the core gate that is open in s5 and closed in s2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>). Similar suites of substrate-engaged-like conformations can also be induced by incubating the proteasome with non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Śledź et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wehmer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2017</xref>) or introducing Walker-B mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>), both of which trap Rpts in the ATP-bound state and stabilize their interface to neighboring ATPase subunits in the hexamer. Our recent studies on the coordination of proteasomal degradation steps suggested that substrate engagement depends on the s1 state, in which the entrance to the central pore is accessible and the initiation region of a ubiquitin-receptor-bound substrate would be able to enter the AAA+ motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>). Premature switching to substrate-processing states seemed to prevent this substrate engagement, potentially due to Rpn11 obstructing the central pore. Yet alternative models could not be completely ruled out, because the substrate-processing states in those studies were induced by the addition of ATPγS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>), which abolishes translocation and may also interfere with substrate engagement.</p><p>Mutational studies, in which nucleotide binding or hydrolysis of single ATPase subunits were disrupted by substitutions in the Walker-A or Walker-B motifs demonstrated the functional asymmetry of the proteasomal AAA+ motor, as the same mutations in different Rpts caused varied effects on cell viability and the degradation of ubiquitinated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wendler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rubin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckwith et al., 2013</xref>). However, it remains unclear to what extent these differences in proteasomal activity originate from individual Rpt subunits playing unequal roles in mechanical substrate processing, or from these mutations differentially affecting the overall conformational switching of the proteasome.</p><p>Here, we investigate how interactions between the lid and base subcomplexes influence the conformational transitions and thus substrate processing by the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> 26S proteasome. Previous structural studies showed that the contacts between Rpn5’s TPR domain and the small AAA+ subdomain of Rpt3 are broken during the regulatory particle’s transition from the substrate-free s1 state to any other state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matyskiela et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Unverdorben et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wehmer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). Through mutations of the involved residues in Rpn5, we found that loss of these interactions perturbs the conformational landscape and allows the proteasome to more strongly populate substrate-engaged-like conformations even in the absence of substrate. Walker-B mutations that prevent ATP hydrolysis in individual subunits of the AAA+ motor similarly disrupt the conformational equilibrium. In both cases, perturbing the coordination between substrate-processing steps and conformational transitions of the proteasome’s regulatory particle leads to decreased degradation rates, primarily by affecting the initiation of processing and shifting the rate-limiting step from substrate unfolding to engagement. Our data thus reveal how the proteasome uses the peripheral interactions with the lid subunits to orchestrate the conformational transitions required for the various stages of ubiquitin-dependent substrate degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The lid is required for proteasome function independent of deubiquitination</title><p>Structural rearrangements, specifically the rotation of the lid relative to the base observed in response to substrate processing or binding of ATP analogs to the AAA+ motor, suggest that the lid may be directly involved in determining the proteasome conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matyskiela et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Unverdorben et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wehmer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). However, the lid’s structural importance for degradation cannot simply be tested by eliminating this subcomplex from the holoenzyme, as it contains the essential DUB Rpn11 and is indispensable for efficient ubiquitin-dependent substrate turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Verma et al., 2002</xref>). We therefore used our previously established ubiquitin-independent substrate-delivery system, in which the bacterial SspB adaptor fused to Rpt2 allows the recruitment of model substrates containing the ssrA recognition motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bashore et al., 2015</xref>). Degradation was monitored through the decrease in anisotropy of a titin-I27<sup>V15P</sup> model substrate that contained a destabilizing V15P mutation, fluorescein conjugated to the N-terminus, and a C-terminal 35 amino-acid initiation region derived from cyclin B that also included the ssrA recognition motif (FAM-titin-I27<sup>V15P</sup>). Even though we eliminated the dependence on Rpn11-mediated deubiquitination, presence of the lid was still required for efficient ATP-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). In contrast to other compartmental proteases, the proteasomal AAA+ motor and the 20S core peptidase together are not sufficient to catalyze ATP-dependent protein unfolding and degradation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The proteasome lid subcomplex is required for proteasome function through direct contacts with the AAA+-motor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ubiquitin-independent degradation of fluorescein-labeled, ssrA-tagged FAM-titin-I27<sup>V15P</sup> substrate by in-vitro reconstituted 26S proteasomes with recombinantly produced SspB-fused base in the absence and presence of recombinantly produced lid subcomplex was monitored through fluorescence anisotropy under multiple-turnover conditions.

Of particular interest was the contact between Rpn5’s TPR domain and Rpt3’s small AAA+ subdomain that is present only in the substrate-free s1 state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matyskiela et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Unverdorben et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wehmer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>). Mutating all residues in the Rpt3-contacting loop of Rpn5 (V125 - F131) to alanine (mutant denoted Rpn5-VTENKIF) decreased the rate of both, ubiquitin-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>) and ubiquitin-independent degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Importantly, this loss of degradation activity is not primarily caused by defects in proteasome assembly, which was found by native PAGE to be only slightly less efficient for the mutant compared to the wild-type enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, using the response of the base ATPase activity to lid binding during holoenzyme assembly, we determined similar affinities for wild-type and Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant lid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Despite their lower degradation activity, Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant proteasomes show an elevated ATPase rate in the absence of substrate that increases in response to substrate processing, albeit to a lesser extent than for wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In agreement with recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nemec et al., 2019</xref>), proteasomes containing the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutation more strongly retained the Nas6 assembly chaperone during holoenzyme reconstitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, this presence of Nas6 is not the main cause for the observed decrease in degradation rate, as purified endogenous proteasomes from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> carrying the same Rpn5 mutations also exhibit major deficiencies in single-turnover degradation reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), despite containing only negligible amounts of Nas6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Moreover, we found that substrate processing efficiently evicts most Nas6 from nascent Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant proteasomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), indicating that the initial Nas6 retention is not responsible for the steady-state substrate processing defect of the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant. Overall, the observed decrease in degradation activity appears to principally be caused by intrinsically compromised substrate processing, rather than the observed minor defects in the assembly or composition of proteasome holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Lid-base contacts influence proteasome conformation</title><p>We employed negative-stain electron microscopy to assess the conformational states of the proteasome and whether the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutation affects their distribution.

In contrast to wild-type proteasomes with nearly equal distribution of s1 and s2 conformations, Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant proteasomes showed only 37% of particles in the s1 state, while also populating substrate-engaged-like states (s3/s4/s6) that are absent from wild-type samples in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6</xref>).

To assess in more detail how perturbations in ATP-hydrolysis affect the conformational states of the proteasome, we placed Walker-B mutations (Glu to Gln) in individual Rpts. Consistent with previous in vitro and in vivo studies that revealed unequal contributions of Rpts to proteasomal degradation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckwith et al., 2013</xref>), we observed differentially reduced rates of substrate turnover for these variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), with the strongest defects seen in Rpt subunits that make contacts with TPR domains of lid (Rpt3, Rpt6, and Rpt4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As a readout for their conformational state, we analyzed how Walker-B mutants responded in their ATPase activity to the interaction with ubiquitin-bound Ubp6. Ubp6 is a non-essential, proteasome-interacting DUB that in its ubiquitin-bound form biases the proteasome’s conformational equilibrium away from the s1 state and thereby stimulates the ATPase activity similar to substrate processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bashore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aufderheide et al., 2015</xref>). Despite significantly different basal ATPase rates, proteasome variants with a Walker-B mutation in Rpt1, Rpt2, Rpt3, or Rpt5 still maintain some Ubp6-mediated stimulation of ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

That Rpt6-EQ and Rpt4-EQ-mutant proteasomes show increased Ubp6 DUB activity in ATP is consistent with their lack of Ubp6-mediated ATPase stimulation and further suggests that trapping Rpt4 or Rpt6 in permanent ATP-bound states populates non-s1 conformations, even in the absence of substrate or ATPγS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Rpt4-EQ and Rpt6-EQ mutant proteasomes showed strong degradation defects and were consistent in both, Ubp6-mediated ATPase stimulation and Ubp6 DUB activation, indicating a conformational bias away from the engagement-competent s1 state. We therefore tested their core gate-opening activities through fluorogenic peptide hydrolysis in the presence of ATP or ATPγS. Complete opening of the core particle gate requires the docking of five Rpt C-terminal tails: Rpt2, Rpt3, Rpt5, Rpt1, and Rpt6, with the latter two only found fully-docked in substrate engaged-like conformations - that is, during degradation or in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). The Rpt6-EQ mutant showed elevated gate opening in the presence of ATP that resembled the ATPγS-bound wild-type proteasome and did not further increase upon ATPγS addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which is consistent with this variant being biased towards an engaged-like conformation due to trapping Rpt6 in a permanent ATP-bound state. Consistently, the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant proteasome, whose conformational distribution appeared partially shifted in our EM analyses, exhibited moderately increased core gate-opening and peptide-hydrolysis activity that still responded to ATPγS. Proteasomes containing the combined Rpn5-VTENKIF and Rpt6-EQ mutations behaved largely similar to the Rpt6-EQ mutant proteasome, indicating that preventing ATP hydrolysis in Rpt6 and thus stabilizing the interface with Rpt3 has a dominant effect on determining the conformational state, at least with respect to core-particle docking and gate-opening.</p><p>Although Rpt4-EQ mutant proteasomes also appeared to be biased towards engaged-like, non-s1 conformations based on their crosstalk with Ubp6, their core-gate opening resembled the ATP-bound wild-type holoenzyme and was not responsive to ATPγS binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These proteasomes displayed decreased assembly under non-equilibrium conditions in native-PAGE analyses, which could explain some, yet not all of the gate-opening defects, as holoenzyme is clearly formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, the gate-opening activity of the Rpt4-EQ mutant was insensitive to increased base concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), arguing against an assembly defect as the main reason for the functional deficiencies and suggesting that a biased conformational landscape of assembled proteasome is largely responsible for the observed effects. The Rpt4-EQ mutation thus seems to induce a partially distorted conformation that interacts with ubiquitin-bound Ubp6 similar to an engaged-state proteasome, but fails to properly dock with core particle for complete gate opening. Like the Rpt6-EQ mutation, the Rpt4-EQ mutation is dominant in determining the conformational state and therefore masks the stimulating gate-opening effects of the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutation in the combined mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Compromising the lid-base interface through Rpn5-VTENKIF mutations thus appears to partially shift the conformational equilibrium of the proteasome, while trapping Rpt6 or Rpt4 in ATP-bound states overrules those changes and further shifts the equilibrium towards either a fully engaged-like or a distorted, potentially off-pathway conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Proteasomes with biased conformational landscapes display various degradation defects</title><p>To understand how these conformation-influencing mutations affect substrate degradation, we first performed Michaelis-Menten kinetic analyses using our ubiquitinated FAM-titin-I27<sup>V15P</sup> model substrate with a C-terminal 35 amino-acid initiation region that contained a single lysine-attached ubiquitin chain next to the titin folded domain. Rpt4-EQ mutant proteasome showed no discernable degradation activity at any substrate concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and further measurements under single-turnover conditions revealed only a small change in anisotropy that we could attribute solely to substrate deubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), as no peptide products were detected in an end-point analysis by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These results were confirmed using an additional model substrate, ubiquitinated TAMRA-G3P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), for which the small amounts of produced peptides could be attributed to nonspecific proteolysis of the unstructured region by the core particle, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Myers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wenzel and Baumeister, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, free Rpt4-EQ-containing regulatory particle, a prominent species in the native-PAGE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), harbored little deubiquitination activity compared to wild-type, Rpn5-VTENKIF, and Rpt6-EQ mutant RPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).

We previously identified tail engagement to be a major determinant of K<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>). Based on the lack of major K<sub>m</sub> changes, we can thus conclude that the Rpt6-EQ and Rpn5-VTENKIF mutations do not considerably affect substrate engagement of proteasomes in the s1 state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>). It is assumed that non-s1 states that are not yet substrate-engaged do not significantly contribute to substrate processing, because their coaxially aligned position of Rpn11 right above the entrance to the pore interferes with substrate-tail insertion for degradation and also limits access to the DUB active site for potential translocation-independent deubiquitination. Accordingly, we did not detect deubiquitination and release of unmodified substrate from Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant proteasomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is consistent with our previous findings that non-s1-state proteasomes with bound ATPγS show only﻿ low deubiquitination activity towards unengaged protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Worden et al., 2017</xref>). It is conceivable that the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutation reduces k<sub>cat</sub> more strongly than the EM-observed shift in the conformational equilibrium would suggest, if weakening the lid-base interactions increases the dynamics of conformational transitions, and the life time of the engagement-competent s1 state in the mutant proteasomes is shorter than the time constant for substrate-tail insertion (τ = 1.6 s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>). The Rpt6-EQ mutant proteasome were previously found to exhibit a similar distribution of s1 and non-s1 states as the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>), and its rates of switching out of and back to the engagement-competent s1 state are expected to be determined by ATP binding and release of the hydrolysis-dead Rpt6 subunit. A 6-fold reduction in k<sub>cat</sub> compared to wild-type proteasome can thus also be explained by compromised conformational switching and a shorter life time of the s1 state in the presence of the Rpt6-EQ mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Disrupting the proteasome conformational equilibrium affects degradation initiation</title><p>We recently discovered that the engagement of a substrate’s unstructured initiation region by the AAA+ motor triggers the major conformational change away from the s1 state, during which the contacts between the base and the VTENKIF-containing loop in Rpn5 are broken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore aimed to investigate how the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutation with its effects on the conformational equilibrium influences this critical step of substrate processing. Using our previously established assay to monitor FRET between a fluorescence donor placed near the central channel of the base and an acceptor fluorophore attached to the substrate, we measured the kinetics of inserting the substrate’s flexible tail into the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>). Inhibiting deubiquitination by Rpn11 with the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-chelator ortho-phenanthroline (<italic>o</italic>-PA) stalls further translocation in these experiments and leads to the accumulation of stably engaged substrate in a high-FRET state.

As expected, wild-type proteasomes displayed degradation kinetics in the restart experiments that resembled those under non-stalled, single-turnover conditions, because the processing steps preceding the stall, that is tail insertion and the conformational switch upon substrate engagement, are not rate limiting for degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Worden et al., 2017</xref>).

These data indicate that tail insertion and engagement, but not the subsequent deubiquitination, unfolding, and translocation, are compromised by these mutations, likely through perturbations of the conformational equilibrium and reducing the fraction of proteasomes in the substrate-engagement competent s1 state. The early initiation and commitment steps of degradation are thus strongly dependent on the conformational bias and dynamics of the substrate-free proteasome.</p><p>Because a major kinetic deficit for the Rpn5-VTENKIF and Rpt6-EQ mutant proteasomes is incurred at substrate-tail insertion and engagement, degradation by these mutants is likely no longer rate-limited by mechanical unfolding and translocation, in contrast to what is observed for the wild-type proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>). To address this aspect in more detail, we characterized the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of titin substrates with various thermodynamic stabilities. While wild-type proteasomes degraded the strongly destabilized FAM-titin-I27<sup>V13P/V15P</sup> variant significantly faster than the non-destabilized FAM-titin-I27, Rpn5-VTENKIF and Rpt6-EQ mutant proteasomes both showed only small differences in degradation for these two substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These data indicate that unfolding does not represent the rate-determining step for degradation of the destabilized titin variants by the mutant proteasomes. Interestingly, the non-destabilized FAM-titin-I27 is degraded by wild-type, Rpn5-VTENKIF, and Rpt6-EQ-mutant proteasomes with comparable rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that thermodynamic stability of this substrate is high enough to make mechanical unfolding the common rate-limiting step for all proteasomes. Kinetic SDS-PAGE analysis of the non-destabilized FAM-titin-I27 degradation reaction showed that the decay of ubiquitinated substrate and the appearance of peptide products were anticorrelated, confirming that the observed rates for FAM-titin-I27 processing reflect true degradation and not an aberrant deubiquitination and release process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). For the Rpn5-VTENKIF and Rpt6-EQ mutant proteasomes this means that the rate-limiting step in degradation changed from initial engagement for more labile substrates to mechanical unfolding for substrates with higher thermodynamic stability. Again, these findings suggest that compromising the conformational equilibrium of the proteasome primarily affects the early steps of degradation, with no major influence on mechanical unfolding and translocation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Numerous structural studies of the 26S proteasome have established a suite of conformations that showed various distributions under different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matyskiela et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Unverdorben et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wehmer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2019</xref>).

The lid subunit Rpn5, whose contact with the base ATPase ring changes dramatically during proteasome conformational changes, plays a critical role in stabilizing the engagement-competent s1 state and coordinating the conformational switch upon substrate engagement by the AAA+ motor. The changes in the conformational landscape caused by the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutation are reminiscent of those incurred by Walker-B mutations in certain Rpt subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>), for which a significant population of proteasome particles still adopt the s1 conformation, but additional substrate-engaged-like states are accessed as well. Unique to the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant, however, is the predominance of the s2- or s5-like states, which feature a similar spiral-staircase orientation of the AAA+ motor as the engagement-competent s1 state, but have the ATPase ring and core peptidase coaxially aligned, lack the interaction between the Rpn5-VTENKIF region and Rpt3, and show the lid rotated relative to the base, with Rpn11 obstructing access to the central pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Unverdorben et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>). ATP-bound wild-type proteasomes also have a fraction of molecules in the s2 conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bard et al., 2018a</xref>), which is likely adopted through the spontaneous release of lid-base contacts, without rearranging the AAA+ motor staircase. In contrast, the substrate-engaged proteasome conformations are characterized by a multitude of Rpt-staircase arrangements, in addition to having the base coaxially aligned with the core and the lid in a rotated position. This observation suggests that breaking the interactions between Rpn5-VTENKIF and Rpt3, and consequently rotating the lid relative to the base, are likely the first steps in the transition from s1 to substrate-processing states and prerequisites for the staircase re-arrangements of the AAA+ motor. It is conceivable that these peripheral lid-base interactions are disrupted, when several Rpt subunits grab a substrate with their pore loops during engagement and thus become more coordinated in their ATPase cycles, leading to the various spiral-staircase arrangements observed for the substrate-engaged proteasome.</p><p>We found that disrupting lid-base interactions and thereby perturbing the conformational landscape of the proteasome leads to significant degradation defects, illustrating the critical importance of the s1 state for substrate-tail insertion and degradation initiation. Previously, we assessed the dependence of substrate engagement on the s1 state by inducing engaged-like conformations through the addition of ATPγS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>). However, in these studies it could not be completely ruled that, in addition to the conformational bias, shutting down the ATPase motor with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog also played a role in causing the observed tail-insertion defects. The Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant proteasome characterized here contains a completely unmodified ATPase ring and mutations in Rpn5 that are relevant for subunit interactions exclusively in the s1 state. That this mutant shows strongly compromised degradation initiation therefore provides important new evidence for the s1-state requirement of substrate engagement and the critical role of proteasome conformational changes in coordinating the individual steps of substrate processing. While our EM snapshot of the conformational distribution revealed that Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant proteasomes still retain a considerable fraction of particles in the s1 state, weakening the lid-base interactions may strongly affect the dynamics of conformational switching and shorten the time proteasomes spend in the s1 state. Recent work established a kinetic-gateway model for substrate entry into the proteasome, in which only sufficiently long and complex tails on a substrate are able to enter the central pore of s1-state proteasomes and trigger the conformational switch to substrate-processing states for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>). Shortening the life time of the s1 conformer would therefore disrupt this substrate-selection mechanism, interfere with degradation initiation, and lead to major degradation defects, as we observed here. This model does not only apply to the disruption of lid-base contacts, but also to the stabilization of substrate-processing states, for instance by trapping Rpt subunits with bound ATP or ATPγS, which may thus explain the differential degradation defects previously reported for the various Walker-B mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckwith et al., 2013</xref>). In both the s1 and s2 states of substrate-free proteasomes, the ATP-binding pocket of Rpt6 is open and ADP-bound, and the Rpt6-Rpt3 interface acts as the seam in the spiral-staircase arrangement of ATPase subunits, with Rpt3 at the top and Rpt2 at the bottom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In the substrate-processing conformations, however, the Rpt6 pocket is ATP-bound and closed, and may only transiently open up for nucleotide exchange during processive ATP hydrolysis and substrate translocation, similar to all other ATPase subunits in the hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Eliminating ATP hydrolysis in Rpt6 therefore biases the proteasome away from the s1 and s2/s5 states, towards substrate-engaged like conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>), and is expected to inhibit the progression of the hexamer’s sequential ATPases cycle at a stage when the neighboring Rpt3 subunit is in the bottom position of the spiral staircase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). That trapping Rpt4 with bound ATP also shifts the conformational equilibrium away from the engagement-competent s1 state is somewhat surprising, given that Rpt4’s ATPase pocket at the interface with Rpt5 is already closed and ATP-bound in the substrate-free s1 state. Despite their correct assembly into 26S holoenzymes with robust peptidase, ATPase, and deubiquitination activities, Rpt4-EQ mutant proteasomes are degradation-incompetent, which explains the previously described lethality of this mutant in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>) and highlights the importance of the Rpt4 ATPase pocket for proteasome function. It remains unclear whether the degradation defects of the Rpt4-EQ mutant primarily originate from a perturbed conformational equilibrium that may be more completely or irreversibly shifted to engagement-incompetent non-s1 states, or whether other degradation steps besides initiation are compromised as well.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for coupling between proteasome conformations and substrate degradation.</title><p>In the s1 conformation, Rpn11 is offset from the central pore, which is therefore accessible for substrate entry and engagement by the AAA+ motor.

Insertion of a substrate’s flexible initiation region in the s1 state induces the transition to substrate-engaged conformations. Rpn5-VTENKIF and Rpt6-EQ mutations bias the conformational landscape away from the s1 state, either by destabilizing s1 or trapping substrate-engaged-like states through ATPase inhibition, and therefore interfere with substrate engagement.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49806-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>For the Rpt6-EQ mutant we observed full rescue of degradation defects when proteasomes were restarted after stalling them prior to substrate deubiquitination, indicating that only substrate-tail insertion and engagement by the AAA+ motor were affected by the mutation. The Rpt6-EQ mutant proteasome was previously shown by cryo-EM to adopt substrate-engaged like conformations in the absence of substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>), which is further supported by their elevated, ATPγS-insensitive core gate-opening activity, their stimulated ATPases rates that are non-responsive to ubiquitin-bound Ubp6, and their increased Ubp6-DUB activity. In agreement with the idea that conformational switching is primarily driven by the nucleotide states and hydrolysis in the motor, the core gate-opening effects contributed by Rpt4-EQ and Rpt6-EQ mutations were unaffected by the addition of the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutation in lid. Conversely, the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutation at the lid-base interface was dominating the degradation defects when combined with Rpt6-EQ, which can be explained if these two mutants have intrinsically different dynamics of conformational switching.</p><p>In summary, the detailed characterization of Rpn5-VTENKIF and Rpt6-EQ mutant proteasomes provides insight into the network of interactions within the regulatory particle that govern the crucial conformational switch during degradation. Both mutants highlight the critical importance of the s1 state being populated long enough for substrate-tail insertion and engagement, before the conformational switch to substrate-processing states enables processive threading, mechanical unfolding, co-translocational deubiquitination, and substrate transfer into the 20S core for proteolytic cleavage. While these mutations give rise to similar degradation defects, they are located in distant regions of the proteasome and affect the conformational switching in distinct ways. The Rpn5-VTENKIF mutation disrupts critical lid-base interactions, destabilizes the s1 state, and causes a spontaneous re-equilibration of proteasome conformations. In contrast, the Rpt6-EQ mutation stabilizes substrate-processing states and inhibits the sequential progression of the ATPase hydrolysis cycle in the hexamer, thereby pulling the conformational equilibrium away from the s1 state. These alternative ways of shifting the conformational landscape to influence substrate turnover hints to the numerous possibilities for regulatory fine-tuning of proteasomal degradation through posttranslational modifications or binding partners, such as Ubp6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bashore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aufderheide et al., 2015</xref>). There is already a growing number of factors and site-specific modifications of the base and lid subcomplexes that are known to affect proteasome activities and are coupled to conformational switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">VerPlank and Goldberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">VerPlank et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, modulating the conformational equilibria through proteasome-interacting effectors could differentially influence the turnover of only specific substrate pools in the cell, as illustrated by our observations that the Rpn5-VTENKIF and Rpt6-EQ mutations led to a range of degradation defects depending on the substrate identity. Given the extensive structural and functional conservation of 26S proteasomes between yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bard et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Finley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kachroo et al., 2015</xref>), we expect this mechanism of conformational regulation to be conserved among eukaryotic proteasomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

These data were plotted v time and fit to a first order exponential, see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> below (OriginPro9) to derive degradation rates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Equations</title><p>Double Exponential Decay:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Single exponential decay with linear component:<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Single Exponential Decay:<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">k</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the members of the Martin lab for helpful discussions, and particularly Jared Bard and Ken Dong for providing material.

proteolytic system for the ATP-dependent degradation of misfolded proteins and regulated protein turnover. The proteasome consists of the proteolytic core particle (20S) and the regulatory particle (19S), the latter being composed of two subcomplexes, the so-called lid and the ATPase base. In the present study the authors investigated the conformational interplay between lid and base and identified interactions that are critical for engagement and processing of proteasome substrates. Their findings provide new insight into the intricate workings of one of the most complicated macromolecular machines.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Specific lid-base contacts in the 26S proteasome control the conformational switching required for substrate degradation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Robert T Sauer (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers are overall positive and we are happy to invite you to submit a thoroughly revised version of your manuscript. However, the reviewers found various issues with the paper. The most serious of these is that some of the proteasome mutants analyzed have markedly reduced assembly efficiencies, which could explain at least some of the functional effects. In their discussion, all reviewers agreed that final acceptance of the manuscript will hinge on this issue being satisfactorily addressed. One reviewer wrote: &quot;The main concern has to do with Figure 1—figure supplement 2A. This experiment tracks reconstitution of the mutant proteasomes against that of reconstituted wild-type. The Rpn5 VTENKIF and Rpt4 EQ mutants both have quite reduced levels of fully or properly assembled proteasomes. In the case of Rpt4, this reduction is at the expense of a fast-migrating species that is assigned as RP, which is clearly more abundant than the fully assembled proteasome. The three native gels are all consistent so the differences between WT and mutant do not appear to be flukes. Although it is discounted in the main text in several places, some of the behavior of the mutants in various proteasome assays may reflect these differences in assembly, at least in part. For example the Rpt4 mutant is very defective in the degradation of ubiquitinated protein (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), probably some component of this defect reflects of the predominance of free RP. For Rpn5 it is hard for me to tell whether defects such as that shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B (25% reduced degradation of ubiquitin-conjugates) result from the altered conformational states or a lower fraction of fully assembled proteasome (looks like more than 25% down). It may or may not be possible in these cases to create mutant proteasomes that are carbon copies of WT but some adjustments or normalizations may make for better data interpretation.&quot;</p><p>In addition to the assembly issue, we ask that the following major and minor points raised by the reviewers be addressed in the revised manuscript:</p><p>1) What should be made of the effect of the Rpt4 mutation on gate opening? The authors dwell on this in the discussion, &quot;the stimulating effects of Rpt4-EQ and Rpt6-EQ mutations on gate opening&quot;. From the data in Figure 3D it looks to me that the Rpt4 mutation instead suppresses gate opening (and shows and effect opposite that of Rpt6, not in line with it).</p><p>2) In Figure 1A, slow degradation of the substrate by core alone is observed. Isn't this result surprising? Some comment would be useful.</p><p>3) Figure 1C shows a large difference between degradation by endogenous and reconstituted proteasomes containing Rpn5-VTENKIF. The authors argue that this is not a consequence of additional Nas6 in the reconstituted prep. Why then is the difference so large?</p><p>4) In Figure 1—figure supplements 1A, 1B, and 1D are the proteomes endogenous or reconstituted?</p><p>5) In Figure 2, 26S particles were assigned to different classes but in the overlay in panel B, S1 and S3 do not differ dramatically. It would be nice to include: (i) an overlay between previously published high-resolution maps after low-pass filtering with the lower resolution map of the same state; and (ii) an overlay between two lower resolution maps assigned to the same state from different samples to strengthen the argument that the assignment of conformational states are valid at lower resolution and consistent with high-resolution data.</p><p>6) In subsection “The nucleotide states of Rpt6 and Rpt4 affect proteasome conformational switching”, it is stated that Rpt3, Rpt6, and Rpt4 contact the TPR domains of the lid. This seems at odds with the cartoon in Figure 3A.</p><p>7) In Figure 3C, it would be helpful to show a Ubp6-only control. It is argued that EQ mutations in Rpt6 and Rpt4 bias the conformational distribution and thus increase Ubp6 activity. However EQ mutations in Rpt2, Rpt3, and Rpt5 also increase Ubp6 activity, sometimes as much as EQ-Rpt6 and EQ-Rpt4.</p><p>8) In subsection “Proteasomes with biased conformational landscapes display various degradation defects” paragraph two, Figure 4B is referenced with respect to Rpn5-VTENKIF proteasomes but does not contain any information about Rpn5-VTENKIF activity.</p><p>9) In Figure 5, why is data for EQ-Rpt6 not shown? Also the data seems to show slow insertion in the presence of ATPgS, but the text (subsection “Disrupting the proteasome conformational equilibrium affects degradation initiation”) states that no tail insertion was observed.</p><p>10) It would be useful for readers not familiar with the proteasome literature to have a brief discussion of the differences/similarities between the yeast and human enzymes.</p><p>11) Since the negative-stain EM analysis is the major evidence for the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant perturbing the natural distribution of states, the presentation of the differing states and their clustering shown in Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Supplementary Figure 3, could be improved for non-experts of proteasome EM. It is stated &quot;Designation of substrate-free and engaged-like conformations was based on a best fit to the atomic models provided in Eisele et al., 2018&quot;. Perhaps this best fit can be more emphatically shown or even quantified in the supplementary figures. To the non-expert, it is currently very difficult to discern differences in the different states, even if RP rotation is indicated by the arrow in Figure 2B. This is also true for the comparison of states in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C (grey vs. yellow vs. purple) and the gallery of discarded vs. included classes in Supplementary Figure 3. The alignments were made on the 20S core particle and the authors mention that the relative orientation of the horseshoe-shaped feature of the PCI domains aided in classification – perhaps this can be presented in a more obvious way by coloring or outlining (one clear exemplary figure that demonstrates this alignment can be sufficient as a guide for the others). Also, the authors should comment on how classes were chosen for discarding (red cross on individual classes shown in the gallery in Supplementary Figure 3) – to the non-expert some of these discarded classes look more or less similar to others that were kept.</p><p>12) While the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant and its effect on the lid-base contact network is very clearly illustrated and should be intuitive even for non-experts (aided by models like the one shown in Figure 1B), this is less so for the Rpt6/Rpt4 mutants, owing perhaps to the structural complexity of the AAA+ cycle to non-experts. The authors show in Figure 3A a scheme of base subunit arrangement and contact points with the lid; but perhaps there is a way to utilize existing structures of the AAA+ hexameric staircase and the surrounding lid subunits, to more directly visualize how these two subunits in particular could be pivotal in allowing the base motor to drive the sort of overall conformational switching the manuscript goes to great lengths to analyse. Some passages in the Discussion address the relationship between AAA+ staircase structure and RP conformational states, but the authors could think about including an extra Supplementary Figure to visualize these interaction networks using existing data, even if some points remain speculative.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Specific lid-base contacts in the 26S proteasome control the conformational switching required for substrate degradation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Cynthia Wolberger (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The revised manuscript has addressed most of the points raised by the reviewers. The following remaining issues, however, need to be addressed before the paper can be accepted:</p><p>1) Figure 1—figure supplement, panels A and B, where B is the quantification of A: B shows about a two-fold effect on the rate of ubiquitin-independent degradation. But the reaction curve appears to be biphasic for VTENKIF, with a visible slow-down in the second phase, beginning at about 600 sec. If you consider the first phase, the initial phase, the defect seems much less. Was the line-fitting done assuming a monophasic decay? Authors please comment.</p><p>2) In Figure 1's supplement, panel D, the degradation rate of the reconstituted VTENKIF complex is measured. The significance of this result is described in the main text as having to do with the Nas6 problem (which arises in part from the Tomko paper published earlier this year, where an Rpn5 mutation comparable to VTENKIF was found to impair Nas6 release): these &quot;purified endogenous proteasomes from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>&quot; have very little Nas6 and they are nonetheless still degradation-deficient. However, there is no wild-type control (no control at all), so the extent of deficiency cannot be assessed.

However, even though lower or more dynamic RP-CP association may account for some of the defects observed for the Rpt4-EQ variant, we think this is not the case for the variant containing Rpn5-VTENKIF. To strengthen this point, we repeated native-PAGE analyses for all proteasome variants, such that we now have triplicate trials of this experiment, presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. It should also be noted that the native-PAGE gels described by reviewers as consistent were in fact images of the same, single gel, visualized by different methods (LLVY hydrolysis -/+ SDS, and Coomassie staining). We have revised the figure legend and text now accordingly to clarify these different readouts for individual gels.</p><p>From the additional gels that we produced for this revision, it is clear that Rpn5-VTENKIF-mutant lid can assemble very similarly to wild type (Figure 1—figure supplement 2C). This is further supported by the native-PAGE comparison of wild-type and Rpn5-mutant proteasomes purified as holoenzymes from yeast (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2D), and by the pulldown of wild-type and Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant RP with FLAG-tagged CP (Figure 1—figure supplement 1 F), which represents an alternative non-equilibrium method assessing holoenzyme stability.</p><p>The lid titration experiment shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C is an equilibrium binding measurement that also indicates similar affinities for wild-type and Rpn5-VTENKIF lids. Mutations in Rpn5 thus do not appear to cause assembly defects that are significant enough to account for the detected degradation defects.</p><p>As noted by the reviewers, we do from time to time observe slightly lower amounts of assembled holoenzymes for Rpn5-VTENKIF-containing, reconstituted holoenzyme, which may be a consequence of lingering Nas6. To account for potential small differences in the concentrations of reconstituted holoenzyme (for instance due to the retention of some Nas6), we performed most of the degradation experiment in this manuscript under single-turnover conditions, with excess enzyme relative to substrate, and using concentrations of proteasome subcomplexes that are well above saturating for holoenzyme formation. By doubling the concentration of reconstituted wild-type and Rpn5-VTENKIF proteasomes (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1D), we confirmed that degradation indeed proceeded at maximal velocity and there was no further proteasome assembly at higher concentrations of its subcomplexes. Also, as requested by the reviewers, we confirmed that the addition of excess 19S RP does not inhibit degradation, for instance by sequestering substrates away from assembled holoenzyme (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2F).</p><p>As shown in Figure 1C, there is a significant difference in activity between undissociated holoenzymes and reconstituted complexes, whose origin is still unknown. Importantly, however, this difference is observed for wild-type and mutant proteasomes. We thus conclude that the degradation defects of RPN5-VTENKIF-containing proteasomes are caused principally by intrinsic changes in its behavior, e.g. differences in the position and dynamics of conformational equilibria, rather than assembly defects (see also the response to reviewer comment 3).</p><p>To address whether assembly defects contribute to the hypo-stimulated gate-opening activity observed for Rpt4-EQ-mutant proteasomes, we compared gate-opening measurements with wild-type, Rpt4-EQ-, and Rpt6-EQ-mutant proteasomes after reconstitution at two different base concentrations and found no change in activities (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). These data suggest that under equilibrium conditions, Rpt4-EQ-mutant proteasomes are likely fully assembled. To address whether the faster migrating species (likely regulatory particle) observed on native gels in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 plays a role in rendering the Rpt4-EQ mutant degradation incompetent, we carried out a series of experiments assessing the effects of additional free regulatory particle on the degradation process of all proteasome mutants (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We found that compared to the other tested RPs, Rpt4-EQ-containing RP displayed lower Rpn11-mediated deubiquitination activity, which was enhanced by binding to the core particle. The rate of general substrate processing (deubiquitination and complete or partial degradation) by Rpt4-EQ-containing proteasomes was lower than that of nonspecific proteolysis by free CP, indicating that the Rpt4-EQ-mutant RP caps the core particle, hinders access of the substrate’s unstructured tail to the internal degradation chamber, and thus prevents clipping.</p><p>These data suggest that Rpt4-EQ-mutant base can assemble into holoenzyme, but lacks engagement and/or translocation properties, rendering the corresponding proteasomes degradation incompetent. We also found that excess RP did not affect the degradation kinetics of other proteasomes tested (wild-type, Rpn5-VTENKIF, and Rpt6-EQ), further supporting that free RP is not responsible for any degradation defects we observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to the assembly issue, we ask that the following major and minor points raised by the reviewers be addressed in the revised manuscript:</p><p>1) What should be made of the effect of the Rpt4 mutation on gate opening?

We agree that Rpt4-EQ is insensitive in its gate-opening activity to the addition of ATPγS, and we have revised the text to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1A, slow degradation of the substrate by core alone is observed. Isn't this result surprising? Some comment would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>Ourselves (e.g. Bard et al., 2019) and others (e.g. Myers et al., 2018; Wenzel and Baumeister, 1995) have noted nonspecific proteolysis by the core particle in the absence of regulatory complexes, both in vivo and in vitro, which likely originates from flexible regions of the substrate accessing the proteolytic chamber. To clarify this, we have included a short discussion of this effect in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1C shows a large difference between degradation by endogenous and reconstituted proteasomes containing Rpn5-VTENKIF. The authors argue that this is not a consequence of additional Nas6 in the reconstituted prep. Why then is the difference so large?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the comparison of Nas6-free proteasome holoenzymes purified from yeast, it is clear that the significant difference in degradation activities for wild-type and Rpn5-VTENKIF-containing proteasomes indeed originates from intrinsic features, i.e. a biased conformational landscape, of the mutant.</p><p>The defects observed for all reconstituted proteasomes compared to non-dissociated holoenzymes may at least in part originate from the retention of Nas6. Proteasomes reconstituted with Rpn5-VTENKIF-mutant lid retain Nas6 to a larger extent and thus show an additional degradation defect relative to their reconstituted wild-type counterparts. The text has been rewritten to clarify this distinction.</p><p>There may be additional factors, for instance posttranslational modifications or yet unidentified peptides or subunits, playing a role for the higher activity of endogenous proteasomes, which is an interesting avenue for future exploration, but beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 1—figure supplements 1A, 1B, and 1D are the proteomes endogenous or reconstituted?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this omission of important experimental details. These experiments were performed with reconstituted proteasomes, and the figure legends have been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 2, 26S particles were assigned to different classes but in the overlay in panel B, S1 and S3 do not differ dramatically.

We have therefore updated Figure 2B to better emphasize the conformational changes and replaced Supplemental Figure 3 with Figure 2—figure supplements 2-6. We would like to highlight Figure 2—figure supplement 3 specifically for showing a comparison of simulated 20Å density for the different proteasome conformations compared to each other. Additionally, Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplements 4-6 present comparisons between these simulated density maps and experimental density maps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In subsection “The nucleotide states of Rpt6 and Rpt4 affect proteasome conformational switching”, it is stated that Rpt3, Rpt6, and Rpt4 contact the TPR domains of the lid. This seems at odds with the cartoon in Figure 3A.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We have updated the cartoon in Figure 3A to be more accurate and precise regarding the various contacts made between the lid and base, and how these interactions change in different conformations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 3C, it would be helpful to show a Ubp6-only control. It is argued that EQ mutations in Rpt6 and Rpt4 bias the conformational distribution and thus increase Ubp6 activity. However EQ mutations in Rpt2, Rpt3, and Rpt5 also increase Ubp6 activity, sometimes as much as EQ-Rpt6 and EQ-Rpt4.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have included a Ubp6-only control in Figure 3C. As the Ub-AMC cleavage activity of Ubp6 is stimulated 300-fold by binding to the base (Borodovsky et al., 2001, Leggett et al., 2002, and Bashore et al., 2015), it is not surprising that the activity of Ubp6 in isolation is extremely low.</p><p>The Ubp6-stimulation experiments shown in Figure 3 were performed with base in excess over Ubp6 and with a mastermix containing all components except for the base, to ensure that observed differences can indeed be attributed to differential Ubp6 responses to individual base variants rather than differential Ubp6 binding to proteasomes.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the Ub-AMC activity is elevated for other base variants as well, not just for the two mutants we have chosen to focus on (Rpt4-EQ and Rpt6-EQ). This is in agreement with a previous study (Eisele et al., 2018), indicating that Rpt2-EQ, Rpt3-EQ, and Rpt6-EQ could have aberrant conformational landscapes based on their elevated core gate-opening activity in ATP, crosslinking between an engineered s1-state-specific pair of cysteines, and the appearance of substrate-engaged proteasome conformations in ATP, as observed by cryo-EM. In this study by Eisele et al., only a subset of the Rpt-EQ mutants were tested, and different assays did not always show the same extent of defect. For example, Rpt2-EQ-mutant proteasome exhibited elevated core-gate opening, but no loss of s1-specific crosslinking. We therefore thought it was important to show all single Rpt-EQ mutant proteasomes, but focus further characterization on the mutants Rpt4-EQ and Rpt6-EQ, which displayed consistent defects in both, the Ubp6-stimulated ATPase and Ubp6 Ub-AMC cleavage assays. The effects of ubiquitin-bound Ubp6 on ATPase rates appeared to be the more stringent criterium for the potential of an Rpt-EQ mutation to change the overall conformation of the proteasome.</p><p>We have updated the text to include statements about the elevated Ubp6 Ub-AMC activity for other Rpt-EQ mutants and to emphasize that only Rpt6-EQ and Rpt4-EQ were characterized in more detail due to their better agreement between ATPase stimulation and Ubp6 activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In subsection “Proteasomes with biased conformational landscapes display various degradation defects” paragraph two, Figure 4B is referenced with respect to Rpn5-VTENKIF proteasomes but does not contain any information about Rpn5-VTENKIF activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this mistake and corrected the error by changing the reference to Figure 4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Figure 5, why is data for EQ-Rpt6 not shown? Also the data seems to show slow insertion in the presence of ATPgS, but the text (subsection “Disrupting the proteasome conformational equilibrium affects degradation initiation”) states that no tail insertion was observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a comparative data set for substrate-tail insertion into wild-type, Rpn5-VTENKIF, and Rpt6-EQ-mutant proteasomes in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, showing similar behavior for the two mutant proteasomes.</p><p>The reviewers are correct that there is a small extent of tail insertion for the proteasomes in the presence of ATPγS, which is consistent with previous measurements by our lab (Bard et al., 2019) as well as the observations for conformational distributions of proteasomes in ATPγS (Dong et al., 2019). The fraction of proteasomes in the engagement-competent s1 state may in part depend on the extent of ATP contaminations present in ATPγS, but it is generally very low and negligible. We changed the text to more accurately reflect this position.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) It would be useful for readers not familiar with the proteasome literature to have a brief discussion of the differences/similarities between the yeast and human enzymes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and have added a brief discussion of the major similarities between yeast and human proteasomes in the Introduction and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Since the negative-stain EM analysis is the major evidence for the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant perturbing the natural distribution of states, the presentation of the differing states and their clustering shown in Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Supplementary Figure 3, could be improved for non-experts of proteasome EM. It is stated &quot;Designation of substrate-free and engaged-like conformations was based on a best fit to the atomic models provided in Eisele et al., 2018&quot;. Perhaps this best fit can be more emphatically shown or even quantified in the supplementary figures. To the non-expert, it is currently very difficult to discern differences in the different states, even if RP rotation is indicated by the arrow in Figure 2B. This is also true for the comparison of states in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C (grey vs. yellow vs. purple) and the gallery of discarded vs. included classes in Supplementary Figure 3.

Also, the authors should comment on how classes were chosen for discarding (red cross on individual classes shown in the gallery in Supplementary Figure 3) – to the non-expert some of these discarded classes look more or less similar to others that were kept.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for criticizing this shortcoming and agree that it is useful to show additional details regarding the methodology of picking conformations. We have updated Figure 2B to now depict a comparison of low-resolution density maps from previous studies overlaid with our experimental maps. In addition, Supplementary Figure 3 was replaced with Figure 2—figure supplements 2-6, which address all of the points suggested by reviewers. Together with our response to point number 5 above, we hope that these new Supplementary figures make it clear how the classes were derived and what structural features distinguish different conformations.</p><p>We also want to point out that there was a mistake in the originally submitted Supplementary Figure 3, reporting incorrect numbers of discarded classes. This had no effect on the results or interpretations, but has now been corrected in the new supplementary figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) While the Rpn5-VTENKIF mutant and its effect on the lid-base contact network is very clearly illustrated and should be intuitive even for non-experts (aided by models like the one shown in Figure 1B), this is less so for the Rpt6/Rpt4 mutants, owing perhaps to the structural complexity of the AAA+ cycle to non-experts. The authors show in Figure 3A a scheme of base subunit arrangement and contact points with the lid; but perhaps there is a way to utilize existing structures of the AAA+ hexameric staircase and the surrounding lid subunits, to more directly visualize how these two subunits in particular could be pivotal in allowing the base motor to drive the sort of overall conformational switching the manuscript goes to great lengths to analyse.

We have updated Figure 3A to indicate which ATPase pockets are in ‘open’ versus ‘closed’ configurations for “substrate-free” (s1) and “substrate-engaged” (e.g. s3) conformations. This representation emphasizes the open-pocket conformation for Rpt6 in substrate-free states and visually aids our discussions of this ATPase pocket contributing to changes in the proteasome’s conformational landscape. For structural models of the Rpt6 ATPase pocket and how it relates to proteasome conformation, we would like to refer readers to the cited literature.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The revised manuscript has addressed most of the points raised by the reviewers.

But the reaction curve appears to be biphasic for VTENKIF, with a visible slow-down in the second phase, beginning at about 600 sec.

Authors please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the initial slope for the VTENKIF-mutant trace does not reflect a 40% lower rate compared to wild type, as shown in panel B. The rates in panel B originate from linear regressions between 15 s and 570 s for traces of three replicates, including the one shown in panel A. Unfortunately, that depicted trace has the highest slope (~ 80% of wild type) and in addition a kink at ~ 600 s. To better represent our data and the lower activity of the VTENKIF mutant, we now picked a different example trace that is linear over the entire measurement and indicates a ~ 50% lower rate compared to WT.
