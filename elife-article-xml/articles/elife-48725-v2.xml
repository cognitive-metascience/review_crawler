pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48725.001</object-id><p>The Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) phosphorylates Ser2 residues of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit (RPB1) of RNA polymerase II and is essential for the transition from transcription initiation to elongation in vivo. Surprisingly, P-TEFb exhibits Ser5 phosphorylation activity in vitro. The mechanism garnering Ser2 specificity to P-TEFb remains elusive and hinders understanding of the transition from transcription initiation to elongation. Through in vitro reconstruction of CTD phosphorylation, mass spectrometry analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis, we uncover a mechanism by which Tyr1 phosphorylation directs the kinase activity of P-TEFb and alters its specificity from Ser5 to Ser2. The loss of Tyr1 phosphorylation causes an accumulation of RNA polymerase II in the promoter region as detected by ChIP-seq. We demonstrate the ability of Tyr1 phosphorylation to generate a heterogeneous CTD modification landscape that expands the CTD’s coding potential. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for a combinatorial CTD phosphorylation code wherein previously installed modifications direct the identity and abundance of subsequent coding events by influencing the behavior of downstream enzymes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48725.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA contains the instructions for making proteins, which build and maintain our cells. So that the information encoded in DNA can be used, a molecular machine called RNA polymerase II makes copies of specific genes. These copies, in the form of a molecule called RNA, convey the instructions for making proteins to the rest of the cell.</p><p>To ensure that RNA polymerase II copies the correct genes at the correct time, a group of regulatory proteins are needed to control its activity. Many of these proteins interact with RNA polymerase II at a region known as the C-terminal domain, or CTD for short. For example, before RNA polymerase can make a full copy of a gene, a small molecule called a phosphate group must first be added to CTD at specific units known as Ser2.</p><p>The regulatory protein P-TEFb was thought to be responsible for phosphorylating Ser2. However, it was previously not known how P-TEFb added this phosphate group, and why it did not also add phosphate groups to other positions in the CTD domain that are structurally similar to Ser2.</p><p>To investigate this, Mayfield, Irani et al. mixed the CTD domain with different regulatory proteins, and used various biochemical approaches to examine which specific positions of the domain had phosphate groups attached. These experiments revealed a previously unknown aspect of P-TEFb activity: its specificity for Ser2 increased dramatically if a different regulatory protein first added a phosphate group to a nearby location in CTD. This additional phosphate group directed P-TEFb to then add its phosphate specifically at Ser2.</p><p>To confirm the activity of this mechanism in living human cells, Mayfield, Irani et al. used a drug that prevented the first phosphate from being added. In the drug treated cells, RNA polymerase II was found more frequently ‘stalled’ at positions on the DNA just before a gene starts. This suggests that living cells needs this two-phosphate code system in order for RNA polymerase II to progress and make copies of specific genes.</p><p>These results are a step forward in understanding the complex control mechanisms cells use to make proteins from their DNA. Moreover, the model presented here – one phosphate addition priming a second specific phosphate addition – provides a template that may underlie similar regulatory processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd><kwd>P-TEFb</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>promoter-proximal pausing</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>ultraviolet photodissociation mass spectrometry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM104896</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 RM125882</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21EB018391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brodbelt</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F-1778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F-1155</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brodbelt</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The phosphorylation of tyrosine in the heptad repeat of the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II promotes Ser2 phosphorylation by P-TEFb for pausing release.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The C-terminal domain of the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II (CTD) is composed of a species-specific number of repeats of the consensus amino acid heptad YSPTSPS (arbitrarily numbered as Tyr1, Ser2, Pro3, Thr4, Ser5, Pro6, and Ser7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeronimo et al., 2016</xref>). The CTD undergoes extensive post-translational modification (PTM) that recruits RNA processing and transcription factors that regulate progression through the various stages of transcription. These modification events are dynamic, highly regulated, and maintained through the complex interplay of CTD modification enzymes. Collectively these PTMs and recruited protein factors constitute the ‘CTD Code’ for eukaryotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buratowski, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing technologies have revealed how phosphorylation levels of CTD residues change temporally and spatially during each transcription cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eick and Geyer, 2013</xref>). The major sites of phosphorylation are Ser5 and Ser2, directed by Transcription Factor II H (TFIIH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feaver et al., 1994</xref>) and P-TEFb in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marshall et al., 1996</xref>), respectively. The other three phosphate-accepting residues (Tyr1, Thr4, and Ser7) are also subject to modification, although their functions are less well-understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeronimo et al., 2013</xref>). In mammalian cells, the phosphorylations of Tyr1 and Ser7 rise and peak near the promoter along with Ser5 and gradually decrease as transcription progresses towards termination. The phosphorylation of Thr4 and Ser2, on the other hand, don’t appear until later in the transcription cycle during elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eick and Geyer, 2013</xref>). The molecular underpinnings resulting in this orchestration are poorly defined. A particularly apparent gap in current knowledge is if sequence divergence from the consensus heptad or previously installed PTMs influence coding events.</p><p>The CTD code is generated through the interplay of CTD modifying enzymes such as kinases, phosphatases, and prolyl isomerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bataille et al., 2012</xref>). Disruption of this process is implicated in various disease states. P-TEFb is of particular interest due to its overexpression in multiple tumor types and role in HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franco et al., 2018</xref>). As a major CTD kinase, P-TEFb promotes transcription by contributing to the release of RNA polymerase II from the promoter-proximal pause through its phosphorylation of Negative Elongation Factor (NELF), DRB Sensitivity Inducing Factor (DSIF), and Ser2 of the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wada et al., 1998</xref>). Interestingly, P-TEFb seems to phosphorylate Ser5 of the CTD in vitro and mutation of Ser5 to alanine prevents the phosphorylation of CTD substrates. However, mutation of Ser2 to alanine did not result in this abolishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czudnochowski et al., 2012</xref>). These results are in contrast to in vivo studies of P-TEFb specificity, where compromised P-TEFb kinase activity results in a specific reduction in levels of Ser2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marshall et al., 1996</xref>). The discrepancies between P-TEFb specificity in vitro and in vivo make it difficult to reconcile P-TEFb’s function as a CTD Ser2 kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartkowiak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czudnochowski et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To resolve these inconsistencies, we utilize a multi-disciplinary approach to investigate the specificity of P-TEFb. Identification of phosphorylation sites was carried out using ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry establishing the specificity of P-TEFb in vitro in single residue resolution. We reveal the tyrosine kinase c-Abl phosphorylates consensus and full-length CTD substrates in a conservative fashion, with only half of the available sites phosphorylated. The unique phosphorylation pattern of Tyr1 by tyrosine kinases like c-Abl directs the specificity of P-TEFb to Ser2. The priming effect of pTyr1 on P-TEFb extends to human cells, where small-molecule inhibition of c-Abl-like Tyr1 kinase activities leads to a reduction of Tyr1 phosphorylation. Further ChIP-seq analysis shows that the loss of tyrosine phosphorylation increases promoter-proximal pausing with an accumulation of RNA polymerase II at the promoter region of the gene. Overall, our results reconcile the discrepancy of P-TEFb kinase activity in vitro and in cells, showing that Tyr1 phosphorylation can prime P-TEFb and alter its specificity to Ser2. Importantly, these findings provide direct experimental evidence for a combinatorial CTD phosphorylation code wherein previously installed modifications direct the identity and abundance of subsequent coding events, resulting in a varied PTM landscape along the CTD allowing for diversified co-transcriptional signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Determination of P-TEFb specificity in vitro using mass spectrometry</title><p>To define P-TEFb’s specificity directly on full-length RPB1 CTD substrates, we applied matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and liquid chromatography ultraviolet photodissociation tandem mass spectrometry (LC-UVPD-MS/MS) to identify the substrate residues of this kinase. Ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) using 193 nm photons is an alternative to existing collision- and electron-based activation methods in proteomic mass spectrometry. This method energizes peptide ions via a single absorption event of high-energy photons resulting in a greater number of diagnostic fragment ions and the conservation of lower energy bonds like those of some PTMs including phosphorylations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodbelt, 2014</xref>). This method is applicable in both positive and negative ionization modes, results in a greater degree of peptide fragmentation, better certainty in PTM localization, and conservation of PTMs to ultimately ensure the detection of even low abundance or particularly labile modifications. Because endogenous RNA polymerase II is heterogeneously modified, we used recombinant yeast CTD GST fusion proteins, which contain mostly consensus heptad repeats (20 of 26), as an unmodified substrate for PTM analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The stability and consistency of GST yeast CTD (yCTD) make it ideal for studying CTD modification along consensus heptads. With high kinase and ATP concentration (2 mM) and overnight incubation (~16 hr), P-TEFb generates two phospho-peptides as detected by LC-UVPD-MS/MS: a major species phosphorylated on Ser5 (Y<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2</sub>P<sub>3</sub>T<sub>4</sub>pS<sub>5</sub>P<sub>6</sub>S<sub>7</sub>) and a minor species phosphorylated on Ser2 (S<sub>5</sub>P<sub>6</sub>S<sub>7</sub>Y<sub>1</sub>pS<sub>2</sub>P<sub>3</sub>T<sub>4</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).

MALDI-MS analysis of yCTD treated with P-TEFb reveals a cluster of peaks with mass shifts relative to no kinase control ranging from 1906.1 to 2318.4 Da, each interspaced by 80 Da (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This corresponds to the addition of 24 to 29 phosphates to yCTD’s 26 heptad repeats. This finding in combination with our LC-UVPD-MS/MS analysis of P-TEFb treated yCTD indicates that P-TEFb phosphorylates the CTD in an average one phosphorylation per heptad manner, and these heptads are primarily phosphoryl-Ser5 (pSer5) in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Amino acid identity at the Tyr1 position is important for kinase activity</title><p>To phosphorylate Ser2 and Ser5, CTD kinases must discriminate very similar SP motifs in the CTD, Y<sub>1</sub><bold><underline>S<sub>2</sub></underline></bold>P<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub><bold><underline>S<sub>5</sub></underline></bold>P<sub>6</sub>, to maintain accuracy during transcription. Among the flanking residues of these two motifs, the unique structure of the tyrosine side chain likely contributes to the recognition of the serine residues subject to phosphorylation. Several factors suggest the chemical properties of residues at the Tyr1 position are important for CTD modification. First, residues at this first position of the heptad are highly conserved across species and substitution to non-aromatic residues is rare, suggesting significance to function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapman et al., 2008</xref>). As evidence of this, even conservative mutation of the Tyr1 position to phenylalanine in both <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and human cells is lethal, highlighting the significance of residue identity at this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">West and Corden, 1995</xref>). Secondly, we have shown that mutating the Tyr1 position to alanine prevents phosphorylation at other CTD residues by CTD kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayfield et al., 2017</xref>), indicating the side chain at this position is important for kinase activity. Third, phosphoryl-Tyr1 (pTyr1) is detected at the initiation of transcription in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Descostes et al., 2014</xref>). This positions pTyr1 well to influence and interact with subsequent modifications of the CTD and, potentially, direct subsequent enzyme specificities.</p><p>To determine the effect of the chemical characteristics of residues at the Tyr1 position on CTD modification, we searched for naturally occurring Tyr1 substitutions. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> CTD contains a majority of heptads that diverge from consensus sequence with only 2 of its approximately 45 heptads being of the consensus sequence. Despite this highly divergent character, the Tyr1 position of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> CTD is rather conserved and contains mostly tyrosine residues. For the six heptads that do not contain tyrosine, half are modestly substituted with phenylalanine. We were curious to determine if, like alanine, phenylalanine replacement at the Tyr1 position would abolish CTD kinase activity. These initial experiments were designed on <italic>D.</italic> melanogaster CTD because its heptads have diverse sequences that allow for the observation of shifts in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) banding patterns, which might not be easily seen for consensus sequence CTD substrates. We generated GST-CTD constructs containing a portion of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> CTD (residues 1671–1733, containing nine heptad repeats) of either tyrosine containing wild-type (dmCTD) or with phenylalanine substitution at the Tyr1 position in all nine heptads (dmCTDYtoF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The CTD variants purified from these constructs were phosphorylated with one of three established CTD kinases: Erk2, a recently identified Ser5 CTD kinase that phosphorylates primed RNA polymerase II in developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tee et al., 2014</xref>); the kinase module of TFIIH that install Ser5 and Ser7 marks in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feaver et al., 1994</xref>); or P-TEFb which phosphorylates Ser2 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marshall et al., 1996</xref>). Unlike alanine substitution, all three kinases are active against the phenylalanine-substituted CTD construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Surprisingly, the substitution of phenylalanine at the Tyr1 position alters the behavior of phosphorylated substrates in EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While the wild-type variant assumes only one or two apparent intermediate species in EMSA, the YtoF variant of dmCTD exhibits multiple intermediates, suggesting the generation of a greater diversity of phosphorylated species. Additional analysis of Erk2 phosphorylated dmCTDYtoF using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) of the intact phosphorylated construct confirms the existence of multiple species revealing complex spectra composed of multiple overlapping peaks relative to the dmCTD control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). To quantify the effect of phenylalanine replacement at the Tyr1 position on CTD kinase function, we measured the kinase activity of Erk2 and TFIIH using GST-yCTD or yCTDYtoF (in which all Tyr1 positions have been mutated to phenylalanine) substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Steady-state kinetics demonstrate that the replacement of tyrosine by phenylalanine has a markedly different effect on these two kinases. Erk2 shows a 2.5-fold higher specificity constant against the YtoF variant, as indicated by <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>/<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic>, compared to the WT construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Erk2 has nearly identical <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> values (0.44 ± 0.02 s<sup>−1</sup> vs. 0.45 ± 0.02 s<sup>−1</sup>) for the two substrates, but a much lower <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for the YtoF substrate (35.8 ± 3.2 µM for WT vs. 14.8 ± 2.2 µM for YtoF substrates). This difference in <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values suggests Erk2 has a binding preference for the phenylalanine substituted substrate. However, TFIIH activity is greatly compromised when Tyr1 is replaced by phenylalanine with a nearly 10-fold reduction in <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>/<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our data demonstrate the chemical properties of the residues located at the first position of the heptad repeat have a significant impact on the phosphorylation of the CTD by CTD kinases. Even slight modification of this residue (e.g., loss of the hydroxyl group) can have dramatic consequences for modification of the CTD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Tyr1 phosphorylation in human CTD</title><p>Although substitution of non-tyrosine residues at the Tyr1 position is relatively rare in nature and does not occur in human cells, Tyr1 phosphorylation is conserved from yeast to humans and plays a key role in transcriptional events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yurko and Manley, 2018</xref>). Since the molecular mechanism explaining its diverse biological functions remains elusive, the sensitivity of CTD kinases to the chemical properties of Tyr1 side-chain motivated us to investigate if Tyr1 phosphorylation impacts subsequent phosphorylation events by reconstructing sequential CTD phosphorylation in vitro. In humans, Tyr1 phosphorylation rises along with Ser5 phosphorylation at the beginning of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heidemann et al., 2013</xref>). However, experiments using synthetic CTD peptides with every Tyr1 residue phosphorylated have shown that Tyr1 phosphorylation inhibits subsequent phosphorylation by CTD kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czudnochowski et al., 2012</xref>). We suspect that the heavily phosphorylated synthetic peptide doesn’t mimic the physiological RNA polymerase II during transcription. Instead, we reconstructed the phosphorylation of the CTD using physiologically relevant Tyr1 kinases in vitro. Existing literature points to Abl-like non-receptor tyrosine kinases as mammalian Tyr1 CTD kinases, with c-Abl as a major candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baskaran et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burger et al., 2019</xref>). Three lines of evidence support this notion: c-Abl phosphorylates CTD in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baskaran et al., 1993</xref>) and in cells since transient over-expression of c-Abl in primate COS cells results in increased Tyr1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baskaran et al., 1997</xref>), and c-Abl immunoprecipitates with RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baskaran et al., 1999</xref>). To elucidate the biophysical consequences of Tyr1 phosphorylation of the CTD, we reconstructed c-Abl phosphorylation of consensus sequence CTD in vitro using purified human c-Abl and the yCTD constructs. C-Abl readily phosphorylates yCTD in vitro as evidenced by EMSA and detection of Tyr1 phosphorylation using pTyr1 specific antibody 3D12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We directly interrogate the sites of phosphorylation using LC-UVPD-MS/MS to identify phosphorylation sites in single residue resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayfield et al., 2017</xref>). Using this method to analyze a peptide containing three heptad repeats treated by c-Abl (3CTD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), two single phospho-forms were detected, each containing a single phosphorylated tyrosine on either the first or second heptad of the variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>).

High-resolution MALDI-MS spectra of samples treated by c-Abl revealed peaks accounting for yCTD containing 5 to 13 phosphates (with mass shifts ranging from 398.9 to 1049.4 Da) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), approximately half of yCTD’s available tyrosine residues within 26 heptad repeats. Further incubation with more kinase/ATP does not appear to add more than 13 phosphate groups to substrate CTD in these assays. Additional GST-CTD constructs containing 3–5 consensus heptad repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>) treated with c-Abl were analyzed using MALDI-TOF to evaluate if c-Abl truly only phosphorylates half of the available Tyr1 sites even in the presence of high kinase/ATP concentrations and after prolonged incubation times. Three phosphorylation peaks were detected in the 5CTD variant with mass differences of 79.8, 160.3, and 239.1 Da relative to the unphosphorylated control, accounting for the addition of 1–3 phosphates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Similarly, two phosphates are added to the 3CTD variant that displayed mass shifts of 78.2 or 158.7 Da (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Compared to a non-phosphorylated CTD, the pre-treatment of yCTD with c-Abl results in a significant increase in Ser2 phosphorylation of nearly 300%, as detected by pSer2 specific CTD antibody 3E10, accompanied by a small and statistically non-significant decrease in pSer5 installed by P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). The increase of pSer2 is unique for P-TEFb-mediated phosphorylation of CTD since a similar tandem treatment of yCTD by c-Abl followed by either TFIIH or Erk2 showed no changes in pSer2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We propose two possible explanations for the apparent increase of pSer2 levels upon c-Abl/P-TEFb treatment: First, c-Abl interacts with and/or modifies P-TEFb and alters its specificity from Ser5 to Ser2. Alternatively, c-Abl may phosphorylate substrate CTD and these phosphorylations prime P-TEFb specificity towards Ser2 residues of the CTD. To differentiate these two models, we inactivated c-Abl after its reaction with CTD but before the addition of P-TEFb. We used two independent methods to inactivate c-Abl prior to P-TEFb addition: introduction of the potent Abl inhibitor dasatinib to 10 µM or denaturation of c-Abl via heat-inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). In the first method, the introduction of dasatinib inhibits c-Abl activity towards the CTD but shows no effect in P-TEFb’s ability to phosphorylate the CTD substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In the second method, the heat-inactivation effectively abolishes the kinase activity of c-Abl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In both experiments, P-TEFb continues to install a greater amount of Ser2 phosphorylation relative to no c-Abl treatment controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Therefore, the increase in the apparent Ser2 phosphorylation is not due to P-TEFb’s physical interaction with c-Abl but arises from c-Abl kinase activity against CTD substrates at Tyr1.</p><p>Since immunoblotting presents the issue of epitope masking in highly phosphorylated protein samples and lacks the ability to separate reaction products in high resolution, we sought a method to identify the phosphorylation sites on the CTD directly and precisely. To determine the phosphorylation pattern resulting from sequential kinase treatment, we used LC-UVPD-MS/MS to investigate the activity of P-TEFb in the context of Tyr1 phosphorylation. LC-UVPD-MS/MS provides single residue resolution and overcomes artifacts inherent to immunoblotting such as epitope masking. Unfortunately, full-length yeast CTD is resistant to proteolysis due to a lack of basic residues, hindering further analysis by tandem MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schüller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Suh et al., 2016</xref>). Novel proteases, such as chymotrypsin and proteinase K, that cleave at bulky hydrophobic residues like tyrosine have proven effective in the past for analyzing the native sequence of the CTD, but proteolysis becomes inhibited upon phosphorylation due to the modification on tyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayfield et al., 2017</xref>). Short synthetic peptides circumvent the need for proteases but poorly mimic the physiological CTD and are unlikely to reveal bona fide CTD kinase specificities. To overcome these technical challenges, we generated a full-length yeast CTD with lysine replacing Ser7 in every other repeat (yCTD-Lys) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This allowed for trypsin digestion into di-heptads, which represent the functional unit of the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corden, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eick and Geyer, 2013</xref>), and are amenable to MS/MS analysis.</p><p>To validate that the introduction of lysine residues does not bias kinase specificity, we first mapped the phosphorylation pattern of c-Abl or P-TEFb individually along yCTD-Lys using LC-UVPD-MS/MS. When treated with c-Abl, two single phosphorylation species are found at equivalent abundances with tyrosine at the same or neighboring heptad of Lys replacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>, peak 1 and 2) and a small peak in which both Tyr1 residues are phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>, peak 3). When treated with P-TEFb alone, we observed four single phosphorylated peptides: two almost equally abundant peaks containing di-heptads with a single Ser5 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>, peak 1 and 2) and two peaks about ~40 fold less in intensity with pSer2 or pSer7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>, peaks 3 and 4). This result shows that P-TEFb strongly favors pSer5 in unmodified CTD substrates, consistent with our previously analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Double phosphorylated species are also detected for di-heptads with both Ser5 residues phosphorylated as the predominant product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>, peak 5). Several very small peaks (less than 100-fold lower in intensity) are identified as peptides containing both Ser5 and pSer2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>, peak 6). These results indicate that the existence of Lys residue does not seem to bias kinase activity and is consistent with our previous results that P-TEFb strongly prefers to phosphorylate Ser5.</p><p>When treated in tandem with c-Abl followed by P-TEFb and digested with trypsin, di-heptads (YSPTSPSYSPTSPK) in a variety of phosphorylation states are generated. These species were separated in liquid chromatography (LC) and revealed nine di-heptad species of varying abundances. LC purification separates the different phosphorylation states of the di-peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Some of the di-heptads contain only single phosphorylations due to incomplete reactions in vitro. To understand the effect of c-Abl CTD phosphorylation on P-TEFb, we focused on phosphorylated species with more than one phosphate added, especially those containing both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Tandem phosphorylation generated species unique to those observed in c-Abl or P-TEFb individual treatment (elution at 27–31 min in LC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, peak 6, 7, 8). The most abundant of these unique species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> peak 7) contains both Tyr1 and Ser2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Similarly, a close-by but less abundant peak also contains Tyr1 and Ser2 double phosphorylation although in a different location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> peak eight and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Only a small peak contains both Tyr1 and Ser5 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> peak six and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility of the existence of other phosphorylated species containing a mixture of tyrosine and serine phosphorylation, their quantity is likely very low and not detected in LC-UVPD-MS/MS analysis. P-TEFb’s serine residue preference is dramatically different between reactions on unmodified CTD substrate, where pSer5 predominates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> peak 5), and those pre-treated with c-Abl where pSer2 is the primary product species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> peak 7). Our results show that in di-heptads with Tyr1 phosphorylated, Ser2 becomes the primary target of P-TEFb phosphorylation.</p><p>The high performance of LC chromatography also allowed us to confirm our phosphomapping within di-heptads of the yeast CTD that diverge from the consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Three di-heptads of the divergent sequence were generated following trypsin digestion of the yCTD-Lys construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, sequences of YSPTSP<underline>A</underline>YSPTSPK, YSPTSP<underline>N</underline>YSPTSPK, and YSPTSP<underline>G</underline>YSP<underline>G</underline>SPK). Although these di-heptads exist in a much smaller amount than the dominant product YSPTSP<underline>S</underline>YSPTSPK, they can be resolved and purified in high-performance liquid chromatography and analyzed for phosphorylation position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). In these three phosphorylated di-heptads, the sole detected product of tandem treatment is a di-heptad with Tyr1 and Ser2 phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, right panels). In contrast, all peptides phosphorylated by P-TEFb alone gave a predominant di-heptad species containing only pSer5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, left panels). No Tyr1 and Ser5 double phosphorylation species were captured, possibly due to low abundance. The phosphoryl mapping of the various di-heptads generated provides independent evidence that Tyr1 phosphorylation promotes Ser2 phosphorylation by P-TEFb even in the context of divergent heptads.</p><p>To further corroborate the mass spectrometry results that the specificity of P-TEFb is altered from Ser5 to Ser2 upon Tyr1 phosphorylation, we generated a new yeast CTD variant with 13 repeats (half of the full-length yeast CTD) with every single Ser5 mutated to alanine (S5A construct, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Previously, it was shown that replacing Ser5 in CTD prevents its phosphorylation by P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czudnochowski et al., 2012</xref>). Treatment of the S5A constructs with P-TEFb alone results in the addition of little to no phosphate shown by MALDI-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). However, when the S5A construct is treated with c-Abl, it accepts up to five phosphate groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Subsequent treatment with P-TEFb results in an obvious shift in the MALDI-MS spectra with up to seven phosphates added to the final product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). The results corroborate the conclusion drawn from the MS/MS results, indicating that upon Tyr1 phosphorylation S5A becomes a viable substrate for P-TEFb and adds at least two additional phosphates likely to Ser2 residues.</p><p>The observation of pSer2 as the major product in the context of pre-existing pTyr1 is interesting because P-TEFb has consistently shown a strong preference for Ser5 in vitro. Using a combination of immunoblotting, LC-UVPD-MS/MS, mutagenesis, and MALDI-MS we found Tyr1 phosphorylation primes the CTD for subsequent modification on Ser2 by P-TEFb via alteration of its specificity from Ser5.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Effect of Ser5 and Ser7 phosphorylation on P-TEFb activity</title><p>The observation that Tyr1 phosphorylation by c-Abl alters the specificity of P-TEFb from Ser5 to Ser2 prompted us to ask if other kinases recruited to the CTD at the beginning of transcription can also alter P-TEFb specificity in vitro. TFIIH is a kinase that acts during transcription initiation and promotes P-TEFb function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ebmeier et al., 2017</xref>). To evaluate if a modification or combination of modifications installed by TFIIH can promote the Ser2 specificity of P-TEFb as we see with Tyr1 phosphorylation, we reconstructed CTD phosphorylation in vitro by treating yCTD substrates sequentially with TFIIH followed by P-TEFb and analyzed the resultant phosphorylation pattern using LC-UVPD-MS/MS and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). When followed by P-TEFb, three phosphorylated species are generated, as revealed by LC-UVPD-MS/MS: two major species containing Ser5 phosphorylation and a minor species containing Ser2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>). These peptides are reminiscent of those generated by P-TEFb alone where Ser5 phosphorylation dominates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These data indicate that TFIIH-mediated phosphorylations do not alter P-TEFb specificity in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Tyr1 phosphorylation primes Ser2 phosphorylation in human cells</title><p>Our kinase assays have shown that Tyr1 phosphorylation by c-Abl alters the specificity of P-TEFb allowing for Ser2 phosphorylation of the CTD in vitro. To evaluate the importance of pTyr1 to Ser2 phosphorylation in human cells, we sought to selectively reduce pTyr1 levels and monitor pSer2 via western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Available literature suggests that c-Abl is important to Tyr1 phosphorylation in RNA polymerase II but not the sole kinase responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baskaran et al., 1999</xref>). Other Abl-like kinases may likely compensate for the function of c-Abl by phosphorylating Tyr1 in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baskaran et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, we initially utilized the potent inhibitor dasatinib, which inhibits c-Abl as well as other tyrosine kinases similar to c-Abl, to treat HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Winter et al., 2012</xref>). Tyr1 phosphorylation has also been implicated in stabilizing RNA polymerase II in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsin et al., 2014</xref>), so marked reduction of Tyr1 phosphorylation may lead to a decrease in the global level of RNA polymerase II resulting in an apparent decrease in CTD phosphorylation levels. To address this potential artifact, we optimized inhibitor concentration to a level at which global RNA polymerase II levels are not significantly altered as determined by immunoblotting against RNA polymerase II subunits POLR2A and POLR2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At 10 µM dasatinib, pTyr1 levels are reduced by 30% in HEK293T cells, and this is accompanied by a 29% decrease in Ser2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Importantly, pSer5 levels were not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To more specifically target Abl-mediated Tyr1 phosphorylation, we utilized the highly specific inhibitor imatinib that has a much smaller inhibitory repertoire with strong inhibition to c-Abl and Abl2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Winter et al., 2012</xref>). Treatment of HEK293T cells with 20 μM imatinib results in a reduction in pTyr1 of 35%. This is accompanied by a statistically significant decrease in pSer2 levels of 15% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). One potential concern is antibody masking by flanking phosphorylation because Tyr1 phosphorylation can block recognition of pSer2 by the 3E10 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chapman et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, loss of pTyr1 by inhibition with small molecules should produce an increase in the pSer2 signal if pSer2 levels remain constant. The fact that we observe a significant reduction in the pSer2 signal suggests it is indeed decreasing, but the 15–29% reduction quantified is likely an underestimate of the decrease given existing knowledge about these antibodies. Compounded with the mass spectrometry results, our data support that pTyr1 promotes Ser2 phosphorylation. In both the dasatinib and imatinib treatments pSer5, POLR2A, and POLR2C levels remain unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Data from this inhibitor-based approach are in line with our in vitro observation that Ser2 phosphorylation is specifically coupled to Tyr1 phosphorylation and extends these conclusions to cellular contexts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48725.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Reduction of Tyr1 levels specifically reduces Ser2 levels in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images (top) and quantification (bottom) of western blot against 20 μg total protein from HEK293T cells treated with paired DMSO vehicle control (left, white) or 10 μM dasatinib (right, red).

To carry out this experiment, we inhibited c-Abl with the potent small-molecule inhibitor dasatinib in HEK293T cells under conditions where pTyr1 is significantly reduced, but overall Pol II amount is unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The sample was prepared for ChIP-seq studies using RNA polymerase II antibody (8WG16) for immunoprecipitation to analyze the distribution of RNA polymerase II in a genome-wide fashion. In comparison of the dasatinib treated cells with the vehicle controls, the distribution of RNA polymerase II along the gene body is altered in multiple genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Signal was normalized to 10M reads for both samples, and a significant increase of peak height for RNA polymerase II was found in the promoter region of many genes, as demonstrated in representative genes Myc and FANCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To quantify the change of distribution of the polymerase, we calculated the pausing index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zeitlinger et al., 2007</xref>) which is the ratio of Pol II read density in the region −50 to +300 bp of Transcription starting site (TSS) to the rest of gene body 3000 bp downstream of Transcription end site (TES). The genes are clustered into four groups based on the pausing index: the G0 cluster has a pausing score close to 0; the remaining genes were ranked based on their pausing scores from high to low with the G1 cluster containing genes with pausing scores less than the lower quartile, G2 with genes contained between the lower and upper quartile, and G3 with pausing scores above the upper quartile.

P-TEFb was initially identified as a CTD kinase that controls the elongation potential of RNA polymerase II, is required for the majority of RNA polymerase II transcription, and is specific for Ser2 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao and Price, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marshall et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ni et al., 2004</xref>). However, these early conclusions are at odds with in vitro data demonstrating P-TEFb is incapable of phosphorylating Ser2 of CTD peptides in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czudnochowski et al., 2012</xref>). Two other kinases, CDK12 and CDK13, display Ser2 kinase activity in cells but do not seem to play a major role in Ser2 phosphorylation in early transcriptional events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartkowiak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). Investigations on the effect of CTD phosphorylations on P-TEFb specificity have revealed that Ser7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czudnochowski et al., 2012</xref>) and Ser5 (this manuscript) do not alter its preference for Ser5. Using direct methods, like mass spectrometry confirmed by immunoblotting and EMSA, we identified that Tyr1 phosphorylation could alter the specificity of P-TEFb from Ser5 to Ser2 in vitro. It should be stressed that continuous heptad repeats with phosphorylated pTyr1 inhibit subsequent CTD modification by P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czudnochowski et al., 2012</xref>). However, when treated biochemically with c-Abl, the pTyr1 pattern not only allows for P-TEFb phosphorylation but also shift the substrate preference from Ser5 to Ser2. Furthermore, inhibition of Tyr1 phosphorylation leads to the reduction of Ser2 phosphorylation in human cells and the accumulation of Pol II in the promoter-proximal pausing stage of transcription. Therefore, we show that Tyr1 phosphorylation potentiates Ser2 phosphorylation of the CTD by altering P-TEFb specificity.</p><p>The PTM state of the CTD has been correlated to the progression of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeronimo et al., 2016</xref>). Traditionally, such analyses are interpreted through a paradigm considering heptads phosphorylated on a single isolated residue with Ser5 phosphorylation dominating the initiation stage of transcription and Ser2 phosphorylation dominating elongation and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corden, 2013</xref>). However, this simplification of CTD modification cannot explain the well-coordinated recruitment of the myriad CTD binding factors currently implicated in eukaryotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ebmeier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eick and Geyer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harlen and Churchman, 2017</xref>). Data presented here point to a sophisticated model in which the phosphorylation of Tyr1 at the beginning of transcription sets the stage for future coding events. This interplay between c-Abl and P-TEFb results in a chemically distinct phospho-CTD landscape compared to CTD phosphorylated by a single kinase. The combination of these modification modes likely contributes to a heterogeneous collection of modified heptads, which recruits the diverse array of CTD binding partners in a coordinated manner. These results are in good agreement with the ‘CTD code’ hypothesis proposed decades ago where different combinations of post-translational events result in different transcriptional outcomes.</p><p>Tyr1 phosphorylation has been implicated in stabilizing RNA polymerase II in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsin et al., 2014</xref>), transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mayer et al., 2012</xref>) and anti-sense transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Descostes et al., 2014</xref>) but a coherent molecular basis for these disparate functions remains elusive. Our analysis provides a molecular mechanism demonstrating how Tyr1 phosphorylation can affect subsequent phosphorylation events carried out by other CTD kinases. The ability of Tyr1 phosphorylation to redirect signaling and influence subsequent modifications along the CTD, as revealed for P-TEFb, suggests these various roles for pTyr1 may arise indirectly. It can function through its impact on downstream CTD modifiers, highlighting integrated, indirect, and context-specific mechanisms for pTyr1 during co-transcriptional signaling. The final accumulation of individual species is dependent on the dynamic interplay of CTD kinases and phosphatases throughout the transcription cycle. Tyr1 phosphorylation is relatively transient, appearing at the transition from initiation to elongation and decreasing rapidly through the action of phosphatase(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eick and Geyer, 2013</xref>). Despite this transient nature, pTyr1 is positioned in a vital window to alter P-TEFb specificity and regulate its phosphorylation pattern along RNA polymerase II. The adjustability of P-TEFb specificity by nearby Tyr1 phosphorylation reveals a novel mechanism for the regulation of P-TEFb kinase activity. With many binding partners in cells for P-TEFb, there might be additional regulators promoting the pSer2 activity of P-TEFb independent of or cooperatively with Tyr1 phosphorylation.</p><p>The data presented reconcile P-TEFb’s in vitro and in vivo specificity and inspires new queries fundamental to CTD biology. P-TEFb is ubiquitously important for transcription across eukaryotic cells and often co-opted in disease states like HIV infection and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franco et al., 2018</xref>). The integrated CTD code revealed here represents a unique mechanism to manipulate P-TEFb and potentially other CTD modifiers. Future inquiries using similar multi-disciplinary approaches will hopefully reveal CTD modification patterns in greater detail at different stages of the transcription process in single amino acid resolution. Information such as this will define the temporal and spatial signaling allowing for the recruitment of transcriptional regulators during active transcription. Overall, our findings support a model in which cross-talk between CTD modification enzymes increases the diversity and coding potential of CTD heptads. This expands the lexicon of phosphorylation marks and can provide more specific recruitment of transcription regulators allowing for the precise control of eukaryotic transcription.</p></sec><sec

GST-yCTD samples were prepared for bottom-up analysis using a two-step proteolysis method. First, overnight digestion with trypsin at 37°C was carried out using a 1:50 enzyme to substrate ratio, which cleaved the GST-portion of the protein while leaving the abasic 26mer CTD portion intact. The resulting digest was filtered through a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) filter to remove tryptic GST peptides and buffer exchange the CTD portion into 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> for subsequent proteinase K digestion. Proteinase K was added in a 1:100 ration and digested overnight at 37°C. Samples were diluted to 1 μM in 0.2% formic acid for LC-MS. Analysis of yCTD-Lys treated by c-Abl, P-TEFb or c-Abl followed by P-TEFb is using a similar method as described above except the first digestion was done by 3C-protease and second by trypsin.</p><p>A bottom-up analysis of yCTD was performed on a Velos Pro dual linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a Coherent ExciStar XS excimer laser (Santa Clara) at 193 nm and 500 Hz as previously described for UVPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gardner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Madsen et al., 2010</xref>). Two pulses of 2mJ were used for photodissociation. Separations were carried out on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano liquid chromatography (Thermo Fischer) configured for preconcentration. Integrafrit trap columns were packed to 3.5 cm using 5 μm Michrom Magic C18. Picrofrit analytical columns were packed to 20 cm using 3.5 μm Waters Xbridge BEH C18 (Waters). Mobile phase A was water, and mobile phase B was acetonitrile; each contained 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were loaded onto the trap column for 5 min in an aqueous solvent containing 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid at a 5 μL/min flow rate. Separations occurred over a 20 min linear gradient in which percent phase B was increased from 2–15% during the first 15 min and further increased to 35% over the last 5 min. The flow rate was constant at 0.3 μL/min. A top seven data-dependent acquisition method was first used to identify the main phosphorylated species. A targeted analysis followed in which the singly phosphorylated heptad peptides were continually selected for UVPD activation (between MS<sup>1</sup> acquisitions occurring after every five MS/MS events) to resolve partially co-eluting phospho-isomers. All MS experiments were carried out three times independently with biological triplicates.

The cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in 15 ml of media, for 8 min at room temperature with intermittent swirling. The reaction was quenched by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125M and incubation for five minutes at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with 15 ml of ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and scraped off the surface. The cells were pelleted at a speed of 8000 g for 5 min, resuspended and aliquoted such that the number of control cells (with only DMSO) were normalized to the number of dasatinib treated cells. The cell pellet was frozen in a freezing mixture comprised of dry ice and ethanol.</p><p>The cells were lysed by adding buffer LB1 [50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Triton-X 100, 1x Protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermoscientific)] and placing the tubes on a rotating wheel at 4°C for 10 min, following which they were spun at 2000 g for 5 min to isolate the nuclei as a pellet. These were washed with buffer LB2 [10 mM Tris-HCL at pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA + 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail (thermoscientific)], and subsequently the nuclei where resuspended in 300 µl of nuclear lysis buffer LB3 [10 mM Tris-HCL, pH 8, 100mMNaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine and 1x Protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermoscientific)].</p><p>The nuclear lysate of 300 µl was sonicated using a Biorupter UCD 200 (Diagenode) for 25 cycles at maximum intensity (15 s ON 45 s OFF in a water bath at 4°C). After each of the 10 cycles, the samples were incubated on ice for 10 min. Following sonication 30 µl of buffer LB3 supplemented with 10% Triton X-100 was added into the sample and spun at full speed for 10 min to remove cell debris. 30 µl of the supernatant was taken as the input control for ChIP-seq, and the rest is used to prepare the samples.</p><p>Magnetic Protein-G beads (Thermo Fischer) were incubated with respective antibody (1 µg per 10 µl of beads) overnight on the rotating shaker at 4°C. The beads were then washed thrice with 5% BSA in PBS to remove any excess antibody, and the 300 µl of the sonicated lysate prepared above is added to it, with 800 µl of buffer LB3 and 100 µl of buffer LB3 supplemented with10% Triton X-100. The samples were placed on a rotating wheel overnight at 4°C for the immunoprecipitation to occur. The beads were washed twice by a low salt buffer (0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) followed by wash with high salt buffer (0.1% Na Deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl), lithium chloride buffer (250 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% Na Deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.1) and finally washed twice with TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.1 and 1 mM EDTA). The beads were ultimately resuspended in 200 µl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1M sodium bicarbonate) and placed in the thermomixer at 65°C for 16 hr to enable reverse crosslinking.</p><p>Both the input and treatment samples were with 70 µl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1M sodium bicarbonate) and underwent reverse crosslinking at 65°C for 16 hr. After the reverse crosslinking, phenol-chloroform extraction was used to extract the immunoprecipitated DNA, Library prep was done using a starting amount of 3 ng of DNA measured by Qubit HS (Thermo Fischer) using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) following the vendor manual. The libraries with multiplex index primers prepared above were pooled together and sequenced using the NextSeq single end 75 base pair sequencing platform.</p><p>Reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using bowtie with ‘--best --strata –m 1’ parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>). Only uniquely mapped reads were selected for downstream analysis. MACS2 was employed to call peaks by comparing immunoprecipitated chromatin with input chromatin using standard parameters and a q-value cutoff of 1e-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). The peaks overlapped with the blacklist regions downloaded from UCSC were removed. Each sample was normalized to 10 million mapped reads and visualized in Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>). The pausing index was defined as the ratio of Pol II density in the promoter-proximal region and the Pol II density in the transcribed region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zeitlinger et al., 2007</xref>). The proximal promoter region is defined as −50 bp to +300 bp around the transcription start site (TSS); while the transcribed region (gene body) is from +300 bp to the 3000 bp downstream of transcription end site (TES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rahl et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantification and data analysis</title><p>MALDI data analysis, noise reduction, and Gaussian smoothing (if necessary) were performed in DataExplorer (AB), R, and the R package smoother to provide interpretable data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamilton, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">R Development Core Team, 2017</xref>). Data were visualized in R-Studio using ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wickhan, 2009</xref>). LC masses were determined as the highest local intensity peak of the post-processed data. Tandem mass spectrometry data analysis was performed using the XCalibur Qual Browser and ProSight Lite. For both targeted <italic>m/z</italic> values, the MS/MS spectrum for each phosphoform present was deconvoluted to neutral forms using Xtract with a signal-to-noise threshold of 3. Sequence coverage was determined by matching the nine ion types observed with UVPD (<italic>a</italic>, <italic>a<sup>•</sup></italic>, <italic>b</italic>, <italic>c</italic>, <italic>x</italic>, <italic>x<sup>•</sup></italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>y</italic>-1, <italic>z</italic>). Localization of the phosphorylation(s) was performed by adding a phosphate group (+79.966 Da) at each of the possible serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues to identify fragment ions containing the moiety and optimize characterization scores in ProSight Lite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fellers et al., 2015</xref>). Western blots were quantified using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) and statistical significance was determined by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test assuming unequal variances in Microsoft Excel. Statistical significance is reported in the figure legends.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jerry L Workman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nicolas Young (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, authors showed the importance of the pol II CTD Tyr1 residue and Tyr1 phosphorylation (pTyr1) on CTD serine kinases, especially P-TEFb, specificity regulation by using in vitro kinase assays and Mass spec analysis. They showed that Tyr1 mutation into phenylalanine alters the CTD phosphorylation pattern by Erk2, TFIIH, and P-TEFb kinases. By in vitro phosphorylation of CTD construct by c-Abl kinase, they could create the CTD constructs whose Tyr1 residues are partially phosphorylated. On partial pTyr1 containing CTD, P-TEFb showed increased specificity toward CTD Ser2, rather than Ser5, which is the preferred target when CTD is not phosphorylated by c-Abl. Authors also provide in vivo evidence supporting their in vitro experiments. pTyr1 reduction by treatment with c-Abl specific inhibitor imatinib, or Abl like kinase inhibitor dasatinib results in CTD Ser2 phosphorylation (pSer2) reduction while Ser5 phosphorylation (pSer5) remains unchanged. In addition, dasatinib treatment causes increased Pol II pausing index and reduced CTD pSer2 at genes having a high pausing index.</p><p>This study provides an attractive model for understanding the discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro specificity differences of P-TEFb against Pol II CTD. Their in vitro assays combined with mass spec analysis are well designed. Although the in vivo phenotypes are not clear enough to prove their model, this may be due to the redundant nature of CTD Tyr1 kinases in vivo, and the shortage of tools to sufficiently and selectively reduce CTD pTyr1 signal.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In their in vitro kinase assays, the authors repeatedly used the term 'saturating conditions' which is confusing. They did not provide any explanation or data supporting that their experimental conditions are really saturating. Especially in Figure 2, as partial phosphorylation of CTD by c-Abl1 is very important for their overall logic, they need to provide a better explanation or data showing that this observation is not caused by insufficient incubation or kinase amount. They need to more precisely define their terms, or just more accurately describe their experimental conditions.</p><p>2) This work hypothesizes that CTD pTyr1 precedes pSer2. But CTD pTyr1 can be done at CTD containing pSer2 or pSer5. Does pre-existing CTD pSer2 or pSer5 affect c-Abl activity against pTyr1?</p><p>3) Although CTD pTyr1 in vivo seems to be achieved by multiple kinases including c-Abl, this work shows that c-Abl specific Imatinib treatment is enough to cause pTyr1 and pSer2 reduction in Figure 2C and Figure 4B. Is CTD pTyr1 and pSer2 reduced upon C-Abl knock down?</p><p>4) Imatinib is a highly selective C-Abl kinase inhibitor whereas dasatinib has broader specificity against abl like tyrosine kinases. However, as a control, the authors need to show or refer to evidence that those two kinase inhibitor molecules do not affect P-TEFb activity, at least in vitro.</p><p>5) In Figure 3—figure supplement 1, the authors insist that they kill the activity of c-Abl by heat inactivation or by treatment with dasatinib. However, the authors did not show the proof that c-Abl activity is sufficiently blocked by these treatments. They need to show their titration data using increasing amount of dasatinib or increasing heat inactivation time to fully kill the c-Abl activity against CTD Tyr1.</p><p>6) The authors fail to specifically identify the protein that they are studying, only referring to it obliquely as the CTD of RNAP II. While this is an obvious reference to the majority of the audience, it would be better to at some point specifically mention the protein (BPB1) and not only the complex.</p><p>7) Given the excellent work, it would be appropriate to also point out what has not been done and what future directions could be fruitful. It was particularly noticed that the actual patterns of phosphorylation between heptads (inter-heptad) was not resolved or well-studied here as technical challenges remain.</p><p>8) Figure 4: There is a reference to Supplementary Figure 13 but we did not find this figure. We were concerned that the interplay found here might result from technical crosstalk through modulation of antibody response via neighboring PTMs. This concern appears to be sufficiently addressed by the MS data. It may be helpful to the reader to more specifically declare that this may be a problem; however, the MS data appears to support the Western blot data.</p><p>As the main claim made by authors is that Y1P alters p-TEFb's specificity from Ser5 to Ser2, several key details need to be addressed more rigorously:</p><p>9) If c-Abl-phosphorylated CTD causes elevated Ser2P levels by p-TEFb while Ser5P remains the same (Figure 3B and C), why did the overall phosphorylation level of tandem reactions decreases comparing to p-TEFb acting alone (24-29 to 16-26)?</p><p>10) Can the authors quantify the overall levels of Ser2P and Ser5P when c-Abl-pretreated K7-CTD was used? Is Ser5P still the predominant form of products by p-TEFb? This would be an important parameter to conclude whether Y1P merely promotes Ser2P vs. Y1P alters Ser5P to Ser2P.</p><p>11) Does p-TEFb cause further gel-shift of c-Abl-pretreated CTD?</p><p>12) Descostes et al., 2014, showed that Tyr1P co-immunoprecipitated with Ser5P and Ser7P but not Ser2P or Thr4P. Can the authors reconcile this seeming discrepancy between the above observations and their main conclusion?</p><p>13) The authors should consider re-purifying the phosphorylated CTD after the c-Abl reaction so as to completely rule out the possibility that kinase-kinase interaction might cause the p-TEFb activity switch.</p><p>14) It wasn't clear to this reviewer why dmCTDs (WT and YtoF mutant) were used in part of Figure 1, then authors changed to yeast CTD for the rest of kinetics experiments. If similar results were obtained from both yeast and fly, it might be easier to show one complete set of data for consistency.</p><p>15) The author should consider stressing that continuous Y1P inhibits p-TEFb-mediated phosphorylation (Czudnochowski, 2012) whereas c-Abl-pretreated CTD displays an alternate Y1P pattern which promotes Ser2P phosphorylation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48725.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p></disp-quote><p> <italic>1) In their</italic> in vitro <italic>kinase assays, the authors repeatedly used the term 'saturating conditions' which is confusing.

We considered a reaction condition saturating when we don’t detect further addition of phosphate to the CTD substrate with longer incubation or addition of kinase/ATP using MALDI-TOF.

We observed in MALDI-TOF that when every Ser5 of the CTD is phosphorylated, c-Abl cannot place more phosphorylation at Tyr1. In regards to pSer2’s influence, ChIP-seq analysis suggests pTyr1 occurs prior to pSer2 accumulated only after pTyr1 and, therefore, the reverse of this order may not be physiologically relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although CTD pTyr1 in vivo seems to be achieved by multiple kinases including c-Abl, this work shows that c-Abl specific Imatinib treatment is enough to cause pTyr1 and pSer2 reduction in Figure 2C and Figure 4B. Is CTD pTyr1 and pSer2 reduced upon C-Abl knock down?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, it was shown that ABL2 could also phosphorylate RNA polymerase II at Tyr1 when c-Abl is abolished (Baskaran et al., 1997). Our approach to inhibit c-Abl with small molecules such as imatinib inhibits not only c-Abl but also ABL2. Because of the high sequence conservation between the kinase domains of the two enzymes (93%), imatinib inhibits ABL2 with a <italic>Ki</italic> around 3nM and binds ABL2 in a highly similar manner to ABL1 according to the co-crystal structures (PDB code 3GVU, Salah E et al., 2011). We were able to see a reduction of pTyr1 and pSer2 since the inhibitor blocks both kinases’ function. On the other hand, ABL1 knockdown only reduces c-Abl, and this loss can be compensated for by ABL2 making it difficult to observe a drop in the global amount of Tyr1 phosphorylation using western blot of whole-cell lysate. Our results are consistent with other reported results showing that global pTyr1 levels were unaffected by shRNA against ABL1, even though they observed alterations in pTyr1-linked phenomena investigated through other means (Burger et al., 2019). Therefore, ABL1 likely contributes to a portion of global Tyr1 phosphorylation but is unlikely to account for all of it.</p><p> <italic>4) Imatinib is a highly selective C-Abl kinase inhibitor whereas dasatinib has broader specificity against abl like tyrosine kinases. However, as a control, the authors need to show or refer to evidence that those two kinase inhibitor molecules do not affect P-TEFb activity, at least</italic> in vitro.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ advice, we have monitored P-TEFb activity in the presence of c-Abl inhibitors. In this assay, we incubated P-TEFb with substrate CTD and varying amounts of dasatinib, the compound used in our biochemical assays and ChIP-seq samples. Using EMSA, we show that P-TEFb still adds phosphate to the CTD at concentrations as high as 20µM, but c-Abl shows no activity at dasatinib concentrations beyond 2.5µM. Similar results were also observed using imatinib. These results have been added as Figure 3—figure supplement 1C to show that c-Abl inhibitors don’t cross-inhibit P-TEFb.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 3—figure supplement 1, the authors insist that they kill the activity of c-Abl by heat inactivation or by treatment with dasatinib.

As shown in the EMSA assay, c-Abl has little kinase activity after 2 minutes incubation at 65°C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors fail to specifically identify the protein that they are studying, only referring to it obliquely as the CTD of RNAP II.

We have added a future direction section to the end of our Discussion. Specifically, we have included the following text “Future inquiries using similar multi-disciplinary approaches will hopefully reveal CTD modification patterns in greater detail, across a greater number of contiguous heptads, and at different stages of the transcription process in single amino acid resolution. Information such as this will define the temporal and spatial signaling allowing for the recruitment of transcriptional regulators during active transcription.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 4: There is a reference to Supplementary Figure 13 but we did not find this figure.

It may be helpful to the reader to more specifically declare that this may be a problem; however, the MS data appears to support the Western blot data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for catching this mis-numbering. We have corrected the error, and this section now refers appropriately to Figure 4—figure supplement 1. The interplay of antibody recognition is indeed a major concern, which was our motivation to develop mass spectrometry methodologies to identify phosphorylated species. We are adding discussion of the potential issue of cross-talk to the Results section alongside our interpretation when compounded with the mass spectrometry data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the main claim made by authors is that Y1P alters p-TEFb's specificity from Ser5 to Ser2, several key details need to be addressed more rigorously:</p><p>9) If c-Abl-phosphorylated CTD causes elevated Ser2P levels by p-TEFb while Ser5P remains the same (Figure 3B and C), why did the overall phosphorylation level of tandem reactions decreases comparing to p-TEFb acting alone (24-29 to 16-26)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for making this observation and encouraging us to clarify. We easily captured the pronounced increase in Ser2 phosphorylation because it is increasing from very low abundance (Figure 1A and 3B) to the primary species when flanking heptads have pTyr1 (Figure 3G). We only detect a small and statistically non-significant decrease in Ser5 using western blot (Figure 3B). However, we cannot conclude from this blot that pSer5 remains at the same level. First, the products are a mixture containing tandem treatment product as well as a significant amount of CTD substrate that didn’t react with c-Abl in the first step. If tandem products only account for a small fraction of overall material (which can happen in in vitro biochemical assays), their quantity changes might not be detected with statistical significance. Thus, we cannot conclude if pSer5 for the tandem reaction is altered or not because the mixtures are not separately quantified. Furthermore, the antibody recognition used in the western blot might affect the reliability of the quantification. This motivated us to analyze the product mixture using LC-UVPD-MS analysis where different products can be isolated and directly detected. We were able to isolate the pTyr1 containing di-peptides, which are the products of tandem treatment. Upon isolation, pSer2 is much more enriched than pSer5 in the peptide that also contains pTyr1 (Figure 3G peak 7 and 8 vs. 6 and 9). We have added in the revision the reason driving us to study the tandem reaction products with LC-UVPD-MS.</p><p>The apparent reduction in the number of phosphates added by P-TEFb in c-Abl treated samples is due to the existence of pre-installed phosphates added by c-Abl. As noticed by us as well as other labs, CTD kinases don’t prefer to add phosphates to a hyper-phosphorylated CTD substrate. C-Abl adds phosphorylation heterogeneously along full-length CTD resulting in an apparent decrease in the number of phosphates incorporated by P-TEFb in the second reaction. Once CTD is fully phosphorylated with an average one phosphate per heptad, it is no longer a good substrate for P-TEFb. This is similar to what was observed in the Geyer Lab when all tyrosine residues are phosphorylated, P-TEFb no longer can add phosphate to the CTD (Czudnochowski, 2012). We also observed that when we phosphorylate the CTD with TFIIH until no phosphates are added (around 26 phosphates for yeast CTD), neither c-Abl nor P-TEFb can add additional phosphate to the substrate. The biological meaning of this trend requires further investigation but suggests the implication of temporal control in phosphorylation/dephosphorylation during eukaryotic transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Can the authors quantify the overall levels of Ser2P and Ser5P when c-Abl-pretreated K7-CTD was used? Is Ser5P still the predominant form of products by p-TEFb? This would be an important parameter to conclude whether Y1P merely promotes Ser2P vs. Y1P alters Ser5P to Ser2P.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the tandem-treatment product species containing either pSer2 or pSer5 are quantified via the liquid chromatography trace in Figure 3G. Figure 3G peaks 7 and 8 contain the pSer2 species and are of higher intensity than peaks 6 and 9, the pSer5 containing species. PSer5 is no longer the predominant product formed by P-TEFb when pTyr1 marks are present. This is dramatically different from Figure 3E, where P-TEFb treatment alone generates pSer5 as its major product (Figure 3E peak 5). In these LC spectra, the product peptides are chemically similar to having the same base amino acid sequence and identical numbers of phosphates in species plotted in the same trace. Therefore, peak heights are comparable and reflect species abundance within the specific trace and can be used to derive relative abundance. When pTyr1 is present, pSer2 is the dominant product of P-TEFb phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Does p-TEFb cause further gel-shift of c-Abl-pretreated CTD?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. We conducted an EMSA assay as suggested. The treatment of P-TEFb causes further gel shift for the CTD pre-treated with c-Abl. This is consistent with our MALDI-TOF results that show that up to 13 phosphates are added to the CTD with c-Abl treatment (Figure 2D) and further treatment with P-TEFb adds another ~13 phosphates (Figure 3A).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The native gel EMSA results for the tandem treatment of the CTD substrate treated by c-Abl alone or c-Abl followed by P-TEFb.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48725-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Descostes et al., 2014, showed that Tyr1P co-immunoprecipitated with Ser5P and Ser7P but not Ser2P or Thr4P. Can the authors reconcile this seeming discrepancy between the above observations and their main conclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the result that pTyr1 occurs at the initiation stage of transcription, coincident with the pSer5 and pSer7. As seen in the pTyr1 ChIP-seq analysis, its existence is transient and precedes the apparent accumulation of phosphoryl-Ser2. During transcription, the appearance and disappearance of phosphorylated species are highly dynamic. It is difficult to capture the moment of transition from initiation to productive elongation. Instead, most of the species observed in currently published experiments indicate either initiation (Tyr1P, Ser5P, and Ser7P) or elongation/termination (Ser2P and Thr4P). Furthermore, the antibodies used in the co-immunoprecipitation are frequently interfered by flanking phosphorylation species and may further limit our ability to detect molecules at the initiation/elongation transition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The authors should consider re-purifying the phosphorylated CTD after the c-Abl reaction so as to completely rule out the possibility that kinase-kinase interaction might cause the p-TEFb activity switch.</p></disp-quote><p>One major technical problem with pTyr1 CTD substrates and their proteolytic peptides is their propensity to fall out of solution. This is why such a large amount of material is needed for UVPD-MS analyses. Issues with material recovery are particularly difficult during affinity purification chromatography that would be required to re-purifying the phosphorylated CTD after the c-Abl reaction. In our experience, the combination of the affinity beads, phosphorylated substrate, coupled with the small reaction volumes feasible results in the pTyr1 containing substrate being almost entirely retained on the affinity beads. For these reasons, we utilized alternative approaches applying either a chemical inhibitor or heat inactivation. We are currently working with our mass spec collaborators to develop and optimize UVPD-MS method to reduce the requirement of the amount of starting material and hope to overcome that technical obstacle soon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) It wasn't clear to this reviewer why dmCTDs (WT and YtoF mutant) were used in part of Figure 1, then authors changed to yeast CTD for the rest of kinetics experiments. If similar results were obtained from both yeast and fly, it might be easier to show one complete set of data for consistency.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. The multiple banding in EMSA of YtoF mutants was first observed in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> CTD, which motivated us to do the ESI-MS and subsequent experiments investigating how the side-chain of Tyr1 affects other CTD kinases. Likely owing to the highly divergent nature of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> CTD, each phosphorylation species is well separated in EMSA. Because of this observation, we investigated if consensus CTD sequences also have altered phosphorylation pattern when Y is replaced by F using yeast CTD. The observation of multiple banding is indeed conserved but are much more difficult to detect and interpret in phosphorylated yeast CTD with the consistent consensus sequence. We realize that introducing <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> CTD complicates the story. However, the reality is that if we had started with consensus yeast CTD with YtoF mutations, the presence of multiple bands might have been easily missed. After consideration, we decided to honestly describe the process and experiments that led us to our hypothesis about the influence of the chemical properties of residues at the Tyr1 position on CTD modifying enzymes. To clarify this motivation, we edited the manuscript to explain our thought process and the importance of the divergence of dmCTD to our data and detection of multiple species in EMSA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The author should consider stressing that continuous Y1P inhibits p-TEFb-mediated phosphorylation (Czudnochowski, 2012) whereas c-Abl-pretreated CTD displays an alternate Y1P pattern which promotes Ser2P phosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. We added this to the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
