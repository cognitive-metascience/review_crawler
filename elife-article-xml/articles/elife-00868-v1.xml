In a multicellular context, <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells can share outer membrane (OM) materials by an unknown mechanism involving the <italic>traAB</italic> genes and gliding motility. Using live imaging, we show for the first time that transient contacts between two cells are sufficient to transfer OM materials, proteins and lipids, at high efficiency. Transfer was associated with the formation of dynamic OM tubes, strongly suggesting that transfer results from the local fusion of the OMs of two transferring cells. Last, large amounts of OM materials were released in slime trails deposited by gliding cells. Since cells tend to follow trails laid by other cells, slime-driven OM material exchange may be an important stigmergic regulation of <italic>Myxococcus</italic> social behaviors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00868.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00868.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00868.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria studied in the laboratory are, in general, readily amenable to culture, and they easily form colonies when grown on agar plates. In the wild, however, many bacteria exhibit a range of more complex behaviors, including the growth of super-organisms that contain many cells.</p><p>The bacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> can exist either as single cells or as a super-organism. Each cell has an inner and outer plasma membrane separated by a periplasmic space. Previous work has found that individual cells communicate with each other by exchanging the contents of their outer membranes, and that these swaps can govern multicellular behavior.</p><p>Membrane exchange is known to depend on both donor and recipient cells having the proteins TraA and TraB. TraA proteins are similar to the adhesion factors that hold cells together, and they are found in many species: this suggests that TraA therefore might help the outer membranes of cells to fuse so that they can swap materials. The role of TraB is not known at present.</p><p>To investigate membrane exchange more closely, Ducret et al. measured the transfer of fluorescent proteins from the periplasm and the inner and outer membranes of the donor cell to the recipient cell, as well as the transfer of fluorescent lipids from the donor’s outer membrane. Both proteins and lipids from the outer membrane were transferred rapidly (within minutes); although a small amount of protein transfer from the periplasmic space was observed after 36 hr, there was no transfer from the inner membrane. As in previous studies, exchange depended on the presence of TraA.</p><p>Ducret et al. observed that contact between two cells was sufficient to stimulate transfer of proteins and lipids from the outer membrane. But not all contacts led to a transfer. Importantly, when cells that had swapped fluorescent membrane components moved apart, they appeared to remain connected by tubular structures, suggesting that an inter-membrane junction must form to allow proteins and lipids to be transferred between the cells. This junction is referred to as an outer-membrane synapse.</p><p>Ducret et al. also noted another phenomenon: cells shed pieces of membrane as they moved across surfaces or separated after outer membrane exchange. This suggests that both synapse formation after direct cell-to-cell contact and the shedding of membrane components can help to propagate bacterial signals, enabling population-wide behavioral changes, including the formation or collapse of super-organisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00868.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00868.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Myxococcus xanthus</kwd><kwd>lipid tube</kwd><kwd>gliding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>HFSP young investigator grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGY0075/2008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ducret</surname><given-names>Adrien</given-names></name><name><surname>Mignot</surname><given-names>Tâm</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ERC starting grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DOME 261105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fleuchot</surname><given-names>Betty</given-names></name><name><surname>Mignot</surname><given-names>Tâm</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Physical contact between two <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> cells is sufficient to fuse their outer membrane transiently and exchange outer membrane proteins and lipids at high efficiency.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic>, a gram negative deltaproteobacterium, displays complex multicellular behaviors in response to environmental cues such as the presence of prey bacteria or starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, starvation triggers a developmental program where thousands of cells coordinate their motility, moving into aggregation centers to build multicellular fruiting bodies where the cells form metabolically-inert spores. This multicellular response requires an arsenal of intercellular signals, including diffusible long-range signals as well as contact-dependent signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10a">Konovalova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12a">Mauriello et al., 2009</xref>). One intriguing cell–cell communication mechanism involves the cell-to-cell transfer of outer membrane (OM) proteins between <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells. This phenomenon was originally unmasked by mixing experiments where certain motility mutants were shown to rescue other motility mutants in a process called stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nudleman et al., 2005</xref>). Stimulatable mutants all carried mutations in genes encoding predicted OM proteins (termed <italic>cgl</italic> or <italic>tgl</italic>). Experiments with the Tgl and the CglB OM lipoproteins suggested that stimulation is transient and does not involve the exchange of genetic material, but results from the physical transfer of Tgl/Cgl proteins from donor Tgl<sup>+</sup>/Cgl<sup>+</sup> cells to recipient Tgl<sup>−</sup>/Cgl<sup>−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nudleman et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, OM protein exchange is not restricted to motility proteins and virtually any OM protein and even lipid can be exchanged between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pathak et al., 2012</xref>). Gliding (A−)motility has been shown to be important for transfer, but rather indirectly by promoting the formation of dense regions of aligned cells and favoring intimate cell–cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nudleman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pathak et al., 2012</xref>). The transfer process itself depends on two specific proteins, TraA and TraB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pathak et al., 2012</xref>). TraA is a protein with hallmarks of yeast floculins, a class of cell surface adhesins that mediate cell–cell interactions leading to flocculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Smukalla et al., 2008</xref>) and TraB is a secreted protein of unknown function with a possible peptidoglycan-binding domain. TraA and TraB must be expressed both by donor and recipient cells for transfer to occur. Consequently, Wall and colleagues proposed that when adjacent cells engage Tra-dependent surface interactions (i.e., homotypic interactions or interactions with other surface ligands), the OMs fuse locally and OM materials are exchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pathak et al., 2012</xref>). However, because transfer was studied in bulk assays this hypothesis could not be tested directly. Therefore, other mechanisms remained possible, for example long-range exchange of OM vesicles or even local cell lysis. In this study, we investigated the transfer mechanism at the single cell level to gain more insights into the transfer mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transfer is a highly efficient OM-specific process</title><p>In a previous study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wei et al. (2011)</xref> measured the transfer efficiency in agar plate mixing assays (‘Materials and methods’), monitoring the appearance of fluorescent recipient cells over time with mCherry fluorescent probes (OM<sub>mCherry</sub> and IM<sub>mCherry</sub>), which when fused to type II or type I signal sequences localize to the OM or the inner membrane (IM), respectively. However, no information was obtained about the increase in fluorescence intensity in the recipient cells. Thus, in a prelude to this study, we repeated the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wei et al. (2011)</xref> experiment and further measured fluorescence fluctuations in recipient cells. For completion and to test the transfer of soluble periplasmic proteins, we also constructed a periplasmic probe, fusing mCherry to the <italic>Escherichia coli phoA</italic> signal sequence (PERI<sub>mCherry</sub>) (‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with previous works and OM specific protein transfer, only OM<sub>mCherry</sub> was transferred significantly between cells. As observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wei et al. (2011)</xref>, transfer was highly efficient and ∼80% of the total recipient cells were already labeled after 12 hr of co-incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Transfer remained active for the next 36 hr because although the total number of recipient cells became stable after 24 hr, the fluorescence intensity of recipient cells increased regularly until it reached a plateau at 36 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). After 36 hr of co-incubation, 20% of the recipient cells displayed a high level of fluorescence, showing that some cells acquire exogenous OM content with very high efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A low amount of PERI<sub>mCherry</sub> transfer was detected after 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that periplasmic proteins may also be exchanged but with a near background level efficiency. These findings confirm results from previous studies that transfer is a highly efficient OM-specific process.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00868.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transfer is a highly efficient OM-specific process.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Percentage of mCherry<sup>+</sup> recipient cells as a function of time.

Although most of the recipient cells are stained after 12 hr, the staining is generally weak and both brilliance and the fast-bleaching of mCherry prevented single cell transfer analysis with the OM<sub>mCherry</sub> probe. Therefore, to maximize our chances to observe a transfer event, we constructed a new probe where super-folder GFP (sfGFP), a fast folding bright variant of GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pédelacq et al., 2006</xref>), is fused to the type II signal sequence (OM<sub>sfGFP</sub>). In a bulk transfer assay, OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> and OM<sub>mCherry</sub> were transferred with similar efficiencies, showing that OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> could be used in a single cell assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To this aim, <italic>Myxococcus</italic> donor cells expressing OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> were mixed with recipient cells expressing IM<sub>mCherry,</sub> and the emergence of dual color cells was monitored over time by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, unlabeled recipient cells became fluorescent when they came in contact with OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> donor cells (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2">Videos 1,2</xref>). Several lines of evidence argue that the observed fluorescence increase results from the physical transfer of OM<sub>sfGFP</sub>: (i), Fluorescence transfer was very rapid, approximately a third of the total donor fluorescence appeared in the recipient strain after 12 min of contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). (ii), Fluorescence initially appeared at the contact zone and subsequently diffused throughout the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Additionally, green fluorescence was enhanced at the recipient cell periphery, reflecting a membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). (iii), IM<sub>mCherry</sub> was not exchanged between the two cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). (iv), Green fluorescence transfer was not detected in recipient cells that were not in contact with donor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), or in a negative control experiment, when they were mixed with a <italic>traA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00868.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cell-contact-dependent transfer of OM<sub>sfGFP</sub>/DiO between single cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) sfGFP transfer from a donor OM<sub>sfGFP</sub><sup>+</sup> (white contour in lower panel) cell to a recipient OM<sub>sfGFP</sub><sup>−</sup> IM<sub>mCherry</sub><sup>+</sup> cell (orange contour in upper panel).

While indeed a moderate decrease of sfGFP fluorescence is observed in the donor cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the steepness of this decrease is likely compensated by the high level of newly synthesized OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> expressed from the strong pilin (<italic>pilA)</italic> promoter. To circumvent this limitation, we made use of the observation that lipids are also exchanged during transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pathak et al., 2012</xref>) and tested the transfer of DiO, a small C<sub>18</sub> backbone hydrophobic lipid dye that intercalates in lipid membranes. DiO-labelled cells contain a finite amount of DiO and given that it is highly diffusible, its dilution upon transfer should be obvious. Importantly, DiO-transfer is Tra-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pathak et al., 2012</xref>) and thus its exchange between cells would also reflect the transfer dynamics. In a cell mixing experiment, DiO-stained cells were observed to transfer DiO to unlabeled cells upon physical contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). In the example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, DiO-transfer is also observed to a third cell that is not immediately in contact with the DiO-donor cell but is adjacent to the first transferred cell. Remarkably, the fluorescence of the DiO-labeled cell decreased very rapidly, concomitant with the gradual increase of fluorescence in the adjacent unlabeled cells as if all three cells were connected like communicating vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Transfer must require specific contacts (i.e., collision of TraA proteins) because unlabeled cells do not systematically acquire fluorescence when they establish a direct contact with a DiO-donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>; red contoured cell). In total, the OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> and the DiO-staining experiments strongly suggest that we were able to capture transfer events at the single cell level.

If such synapses are not resolved when the cells physically separate due to motility, OM tubes would appear because of the tight physical connection. This would predict that tube formation is linked to the transfer mechanism. We first tested whether a tube and the cell OM are continuous. For this, we took advantage of the rapid diffusion of DiO and performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments targeting a tube connected to a single DiO<sup>+</sup> cell. DiO fluorescence showed a quick recovery, implying rapid exchange between the tube and the cell DiO pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). We then aimed to capture tube formation between transferring cells. Since the tubes are relatively short lived, we also used DiO staining for these experiments. In the example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>, DiO is exchanged upon contact between two cells, a tube becomes apparent when the cells move apart, strongly suggesting that tubes are formed between transferring cells. Last, if two cells linked by a tube have continuous OMs, they should exchange DiO, even if they are not immediately in contact. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>, show a DiO-stained tube formed between a brightly fluorescent cell and a weakly fluorescent cell within a larger group of cells. Remarkably, in the cell with weak fluorescence, the level of fluorescence increased steadily as long as the tube connection was maintained, even though the two cells were not in immediate contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). When the tube was ruptured the fluorescence decreased due to photo-bleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Fluorescence transfer was strictly confined to the tube-connected cells and no fluorescent fluctuations were observed in the other cells of the group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Thus, tubes allow the rapid exchange of DiO and must be continuous between two connected cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00868.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Transfer is driven by transient OM fusion between donor and recipient cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments targeting a tube connected to a single DiO<sup>+</sup> cell.

Interestingly, when we observed gliding cells on cellulose pre-coated EM grids (‘Materials and methods’), we found that cells deposit vesicular/tubular material in their wake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This material was also observed by fluorescence microscopy and must be derived from the OM because dual labeled OM<sub>sfGFP</sub>/IM<sub>mCherry</sub> cells deposited trails that were labeled with OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> but not with IM<sub>mCherry</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Gliding <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells are known to deposit slime, a self-deposited sugar polymer of unknown composition that facilitates cell adhesion to the underlying substratum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ducret et al., 2012</xref>). The slime polymer can be detected selectively by addition of fluorescent Concanavalin A (ConA-FITC) in a microfluidic gliding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ducret et al., 2012</xref>). To test whether the OM materials are specifically associated with the deposited slime, we observed slime trails deposited by an OM<sub>mCherry</sub>-expressing strain in the presence of ConA-FITC. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows that such cells deposited numerous mCherry<sup>+</sup> dots and tubular structures that co-localized with ConA<sup>+</sup> trails. EM analysis using gold-labeled ConA confirmed that the deposited OM material is embedded in a sheath of slime polymer (‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). All together, these results suggest that gliding <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells shed a significant amount of their OM during motility and that this material remains attached to the underlying slime polymer. Since gliding <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells have long been known to follow trails left by other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burchard, 1982</xref>), a tantalizing possibility is that the transfer of OM materials could also occur when cells follow slime trails, harvesting vesicles and tubes embedded in the slime. Unfortunately, we could not test this possibility directly because the amount of OM<sub>sfGFP</sub>/OM<sub>mCherry</sub> labeled material remains too weak to detect a significant transfer to gliding cells by fluorescence microscopy.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00868.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Lipid tubes and vesicles are deposited in slime trails.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TEM images of lipid tubes deposited in the wake of a moving cell (left panel).

Specifically, we found that the physical contact between two adjacent cells is sufficient to promote transfer of OM proteins and lipids at high efficiency. This explains the results from bulk transfer experiments (from previous works and reported herein) suggesting that transfer is a remarkably efficient process. The formation of transient OM tubes between cells is a major indication that transfer indeed occurs by OM fusion: the tubes are continuous extension of cell OM, they form between transferring cells and allow the rapid exchange of lipids. Importantly, the <italic>Myxococcus</italic> OM transfer system is distinct from reported bacterial nanotubes, which seem to connect the cytosolic contents of connected cells and involve a yet uncharacterized machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dubey and Ben-Yehuda, 2011</xref>). In <italic>Myxococcus</italic>, the transfer process is restricted to OM proteins and lipids. Transfer only occurs in a subset of cell contact events, suggesting that it is provoked by specific contacts, for example if TraA interactions brought OMs in close apposition locally. OM<sub>sfGFP</sub>/OM<sub>mCherry</sub> are fused to type II signal sequences and thus insert in the OM as OM lipoproteins. Since, OM lipoproteins are inserted in the inner leaflet of the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Nakayama et al., 2012</xref>), transfer must involve the fusion of both leaflets of the OM membrane, suggesting that the entire OM is exchanged locally between cells. The formation of OM synapses must therefore create continuity between the periplasmic content of transferring cells. The size of the OM synapse may be estimated from the size of the tubes (∼50 nm), suggesting that the diameter of the periplasmic lumen may reach up to 20 nm (for an OM of 10–15 nm thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayer, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Palsdottir et al., 2009</xref>]), providing ample space for periplasmic exchange. However, the PERI<sub>mCherry</sub> probe was poorly if at all exchanged and there is currently no evidence for the physiological transfer of periplasmic proteins, suggesting that OM synapses are not very permeable to periplasmic proteins.</p><p>Our results also suggest that gliding motility may facilitate transfer by promoting cell–cell alignment but also when cells follow slime trails by incorporating membrane materials embedded in the slime polymer. The shedding of large amounts of membrane materials on the underlying substrate is a common byproduct of surface motility both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. For example, crawling keratinocytes also deposit their plasma membrane due to the activity of acto-myosin motors in focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kirfel et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>Myxococcus,</italic> gliding (A−)motility is thought to involve OM dynamics in the form of energized deformations and/or protein movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Luciano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, OM fragments may detach to the substrate due to the interaction between the motility machinery and slime. It is possible that acquisition of the <italic>traAB</italic> genes allowed <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells to recycle this ‘waste’ and co-opt it for cell–cell signaling. A tantalizing possibility would be that slime embedded vesicles contain signals that promote specific recognition, facilitate trail following and promote colony expansion in response to environmental changes.</p><p>The <italic>Myxococcus</italic> Tra-dependent cell–cell transfer of OM proteins is a novel mode of bacterial communication that adds to the growing repertoire of bacterial contact-dependent signaling mechanisms. Contrary to known contact dependent protein transfer systems, the type VI secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Silverman et al., 2012</xref>) or intercellular nanotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dubey and Ben-Yehuda, 2011</xref>), the distribution of TraA suggests that Tra-dependent OM fusion is restricted to the deltaproteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, even in <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> strains, the predicted extracellular N-terminal PA14 domain of TraA shows variability, while the C-terminal region, presumably involved in anchoring to the cell surface is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6B—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, TraA acts as both key and lock for transfer to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pathak et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, as already suggested, OM-transfer may have evolved to regulate interactions between cells of the same kin. <italic>tra</italic> mutants do not show motility or developmental defects in pure culture and thus the contribution of OM transfer to <italic>Myxococcus</italic> social behaviors is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pathak et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly however, mixing <italic>tra</italic> mutants with WT cells perturbs motility and development profoundly, consistent with a role in the control population dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pathak et al., 2012</xref>). OM exchange by transient fusion may be more widespread than suspected, especially because it is not easily unmasked and likely does not employ a conserved molecular system.

Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, and washed four times with 1 ml TPM. Cells were then imaged on agar pads for up to 1 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Time lapse video-microscopy</title><p>Time lapse experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ducret et al., 2009</xref>). Microscopic analysis was performed using an automated and inverted epifluorescence microscope TE2000-E-PFS (Nikon, Champigny sur Marne, France). The microscope is equipped with ‘The Perfect Focus System’ (PFS) that automatically maintains focus so that the point of interest within a specimen is always kept in sharp focus at all times, in spite of any mechanical or thermal perturbations. Photobleaching was performed with a 488 nm laser. The bleach region of interest (ROI) was a circular region ∼1 µm diameter. The ROI was uniformly bleached with a 200 ms laser exposition at 100% intensity. Images were recorded with a CoolSNAP HQ 2 (Roper Scientific, Roper Scientific SARL, France) and a 100x/1.4 DLL objective. All fluorescence images were acquired with appropriate filters with a minimal exposure time to minimize bleaching and phototoxicity effects. Cell tracking was performed automatically using a previously described macro under the METAMORPH software (Molecular devices, Evry, France) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ducret et al., 2009</xref>). Typically, the images were equalized, straightened and overlaid under both ImageJ 1.40g (National Institute of Health, United States) and METAMORPH. Kymographs display the maximum intensity values of green or red signal along the long axis of the cell for each frame, using a 0.2 µm wide region. The Y-axis of each kymograph represents the relative position along the cell body, where 0 represents the mid-cell and 1 or −1 the cell poles. The −1 pole is always the pole closer to the bottom of the frames shown in panel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Diffusion rates of DiO dye and OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> fusion</title><p>To know the respective diffusions rates of the probes used in this study, we measured the diffusion constant of the DiO and the outer membrane probe OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>, FRAP analysis provided a diffusion coefficient for DiO (D<sub>DiO</sub> = 8.1 ± 1.3 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) at least four times faster than the OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> probe (D<sub>sfGFP</sub> = 2.3 ± 0.5 µm<sup>2</sup>/s). These values are similar to diffusion constants measured for respectively outer membrane probes and outer membrane proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tocanne et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chow et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>TEM procedure</title><p>For TEM experiments carbon-coated copper grids were first coated with carboxymethylcellulose. Briefly, carbon-coated copper grids were covered with 30 µl of carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (Medium viscosity, Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St Louis, MO) diluted in ultrapure water. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the coating solution was removed by performing two successive washes with ultrapure water. Carbon-coated copper grids were then covered with the cell suspension previously washed and resuspended in TPM containing 100 mM of CaCl<sub>2</sub> (TPM-Ca<sup>2+</sup>). After 1 or 15 min incubation, unattached cells were removed by performing two successive washes with TPM. For Lectin-Gold staining procedure, carbon-coated copper grids were first covered for 30 min with 30 µl of ConcanavalinA (ConA)-Biotin conjugated (ConA-Biotin; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) diluted in TPM-Ca<sup>2+</sup> to a final concentration of 100 µg/ml and then washed four times with TPM-Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The grids were then incubated for 15 min with 10 nm gold-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen, Saint Aubin, France) diluted in TPM-Ca<sup>2+</sup> (1/500) and then washed four times with TPM-Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Grids were postfixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, washed once with TPM, washed four times with water, stained with 1% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate, dried, and imaged with a JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV. Cells were first observed on standard TEM grids. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, tubes appear as continuous and flexible structures emerging from the cell surface. Unattached tubes and vesicles were also observed in the vicinity of cells suggesting that this material was also released by cells in the media. On standard uncoated TEM grids <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells do not glide (data not shown) precluding any observation of these structures when cells were moving. To deal with this limitation we pre-coated the TEM grids with cellulose, a linear polysaccharide composed of β(1→4) linked D-glucose units and previously known to support gliding motility of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ducret et al., 2013</xref>). As observed on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, linear depositions of tubes and vesicles were observed in the wake of motile cells when cells were deposited on pre-coated TEM grids and incubated for 20 min before fixation. Linear depositions were not observed (i) when motile cells were fixed directly after deposition, (ii) with non-motile cells, and (iii) with A− cells (A<sup>−</sup>S<sup>+</sup> strain), strongly suggesting that these depositions are specifically associated with the A-motility. Since gliding <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells are known to deposit slime, a self-deposited sugar polymer that facilitates cell adhesion to the underlying substratum, we then tested if the deposited material is associated with slime. The slime polymer can be detected selectively by addition of Concanavalin A (ConA). When ConA was added to the TEM grids, electron-dense trails appeared in the wake of motile cells. The tubes and vesicles were clearly embedded in these trails. To verify that the trails are indeed labeled by ConA, we use Biotinylated ConA and colloidal gold-streptavidin. As observed on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, gold particles were exclusively associated with the trail proving that vesicles and tubes are associated with the slime polymer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Periplasmic probe and OM/IM probe Verification—plasmolysis</title><p>To verify the proper localization of each probe, cells expressing OM<sub>mCherry</sub>, IM<sub>mCherry</sub>, PERI<sub>mCherry</sub> or OM<sub>sfGFP</sub>/IM<sub>mCherry</sub> were subjected to plasmolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lewenza et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wei et al., 2011</xref>).

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Each of the reviewers has a unique perspective on which they based their comments. The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript is an elegant and substantial contribution. The presentation made it more difficult than needed to discriminate the contributions from previous work published by Wall’s group. As written it could be viewed as a clear confirmation of the Wall findings. We believe you have made important contributions beyond the Wall papers and by revising your manuscript you can make these contributions clear. Wall predicted outer membrane tubes connecting cells and allowing transfer of material. You clearly show these tubes and characterize them (length, diameter, etc). You also provide information about the rather rapid rate of transfer from one cell to another during connection (presumably through the tubes). You also show that there is OM material in the slime trails left in the path of a cell. Although you don’t know the biological significance of this yet, it is something that we believe might be very important. It seems the work advances our understanding of signaling in <italic>Myxococcus</italic> and it seems that it is at least as important to those interested in OM vesicles and signaling, an emerging area on microbiology. One of the reviewers suggested that by breaking your manuscript into sections with subheadings, the special contributions of your work would become more evident.</p><p>We have highlighted a selection of the reviewers’ minor comments below, but all, including typos, require attention:</p><p>1) To recast with subheadings would likely require some reorganization because the authors move back and forth between experimental-based fact and conjecture quite easily and too often. Please be clear about what are the contributions and advances, versus confirmation and speculation.</p><p>2) Do we really know green-beard genes are extremely rare? Or have we just not looked for them much at the molecular level. Is the green beard discussion relevant? It seems quite speculative. It would be appropriate to dedicate a paragraph of the manuscript to green beards <italic>if</italic> the social aspect were part of the work.</p><p>3) Previous work does not appear to have strongly suggested that isolated cells cannot transfer OM material. While the papers cited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pathak et al., 2012</xref>) do discuss OM transfer in the context of a biofilm, transfers like those documented here aren’t necessarily unexpected.</p><p>4) Do we still use the term “gram negative”? Hasn’t the term proteobacteria replaced this?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00868.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>In the revised version, we have followed all the editorial recommendations to improve the clarity of the manuscript and to adapt it to a general audience. We describe the changes we made below.</p><p>The initial submission did not make it easy to discriminate previous contributions from new findings. To remedy this problem we have made substantial modifications to the structure and several parts of the manuscript. For improved clarity, we have followed suggestions to cut the text into sections and adopted a traditional “Introduction/Results/Discussion” structure. The Results section was also re-organized into paragraphs separated by subheadings. In addition, we also significantly rewrote many sections, mainly in the Introduction and Discussion sections. In the Introduction, the second paragraph now presents previous contributions from other laboratories and the proposed transfer mechanism in detail to clarify knowledge of the transfer mechanism prior to this work. Similarly, in the Discussion section, the first two paragraphs have been rewritten to discuss the extensions that our results provide to the understanding of the transfer mechanism and its biological role.</p><p>We have removed any misleading statements that previous works had suggested that transfer could not occur between single cells. We also removed the discussion on green beard genes as we agree that it was speculative. All other minor problems, grammar, problems in the figure and legends, typos etc, have been fixed as well.</p><p>We did not replace “gram negative” by “proteobacteria” because gram negative is still largely used in bacteriology and to a large community it refers quite naturally to bacteria with an outer membrane.</p><p>Finally, because <italic>eLife</italic> requires figure supplements to be linked to main text figures, we created a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to show the variability of Tra homologues in the deltaproteobacteria. The Clustal alignments occupied too much space for a main text figure and they are presented as supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
