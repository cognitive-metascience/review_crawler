How these pathways are integrated to induce specific mediolateral cell fates is not well understood. We used mesoderm derived from post-gastrulation neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), which undergo a binary mediolateral patterning decision, as a simplified model to understand how FGF acts together with BMP to impart mediolateral fate. Using zebrafish and mouse NMPs, we identify an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of BMP and FGF-mediated mediolateral mesodermal patterning that occurs through modulation of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor activity. BMP imparts lateral fate through induction of Id helix loop helix (HLH) proteins, which antagonize bHLH transcription factors, induced by FGF signaling, that specify medial fate. We extend our analysis of zebrafish development to show that bHLH activity is responsible for the mediolateral patterning of the entire mesodermal germ layer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuromesodermal progenitor</kwd><kwd>FGF</kwd><kwd>BMP</kwd><kwd>mesoderm</kwd><kwd>morphogen</kwd><kwd>bHLH</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAREER Award IOS1452928</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Benjamin Louis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Scientist Development Grant 13SDG14360032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Benjamin Louis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03 AR065760</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maves</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Mr/K011200/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Valerie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Fellowship in Basic Biomedical Science 103789/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lowell</surname><given-names>Sally</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interplay between FGF-induced bHLH transcription factors and BMP-induced bHLH inhibitory id genes govern mesodermal cell fate choice along the mediolateral axis in both zebrafish and mouse.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mesodermal germ layer gives rise to a host of adult tissues and organs that constitute the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, among others. Immediately after mesoderm induction begins during vertebrate gastrulation, the germ layer is patterned by secreted morphogenetic signals that promote different mediolateral fates. BMP acts as the major lateralizing signal to induce fates such as blood, vasculature, and pronephros (kidney), while FGF and canonical Wnt signaling induce more medial fates such as the notochord and somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dorey and Amaya, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hikasa and Sokol, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tuazon and Mullins, 2015</xref>). Despite advances in determining how the BMP and FGF signaling gradients are established, the molecular mechanisms directing mediolateral pattern formation in the mesoderm remain unknown.</p><p>Understanding patterning during gastrulation downstream of FGF and BMP signaling is complicated, since these pathways also affect the patterning of the anterior-posterior (AP) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Robertis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kimelman, 2006</xref>). The pleiotropic patterning roles during gastrulation make it difficult to interpret their effects on specific mesodermal fate decisions at later stages of development. Interaction between the pathways further confounds a simple readout of their effects. For example, FGF signaling represses transcriptional activation of BMP ligands, thereby inhibiting BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fürthauer et al., 2004</xref>). FGF can also inhibit BMP signaling through MAPK activation, which phosphorylates the linker region of the BMP transducer SMAD, causing it to be targeted for proteasome and degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pera et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We used a simplified model of mesodermal patterning to understand how FGF and BMP signaling induce mediolateral mesodermal fate. After gastrulation ends in vertebrate embryos, a structure called the tailbud forms at the posterior-most end of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beck, 2015</xref>). The tailbud contains neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) that continue to make a germ layer decision between neural ectoderm and mesoderm during axis elongation ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martin and Kimelman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</xref>] and see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henrique et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kimelman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martin, 2016</xref>) for reviews). In zebrafish, NMP-derived mesoderm in the tailbud makes a further binary decision between lateral and paraxial fates, which is determined by canonical Wnt signaling levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martin and Kimelman, 2012</xref>). High Wnt signaling promotes the formation of paraxial mesoderm, which later gives rise to somites, while low Wnt signaling is required for adoption of lateral mesoderm fate, specifically endothelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martin and Kimelman, 2012</xref>). This binary decision, made when the AP axis is already established, allows us to focus specifically on mediolateral mesoderm patterning.</p><p>In this study, we show that that FGF and BMP signaling function in both zebrafish and mouse NMP-derived mesoderm to specify mediolateral pattern, with BMP promoting lateralization and FGF-inducing medial fate. Using NMPs, we also found that FGF induces medial fate through transcriptional activation of the bHLH transcription factors <italic>myf5</italic>, <italic>myod</italic>, and <italic>msgn1</italic>, and BMP counters this and promotes lateral fate through transcriptional activation of <italic>Id</italic> genes. <italic>Id</italic> genes encode HLH proteins that bind to and inhibit the function of bHLH transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ling et al., 2014</xref>). We present a model based on our data of a conserved vertebrate mesodermal mediolateral patterning mechanism downstream of FGF and BMP that is based on the regulation of bHLH transcription factor activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BMP signaling is necessary and sufficient for endothelial specification from NMP-derived mesoderm in zebrafish</title><p>We first examined the activity of BMP signaling, which induces lateral mesoderm during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tuazon and Mullins, 2015</xref>). To determine whether BMP signaling acts similarly in post-gastrula stage embryos, we examined mesodermal fate in embryos where BMP signaling was manipulated post-gastrulation using either a heat-shock inducible dominant negative BMP receptor transgenic line (<italic>HS:dnbmpr</italic>) or a small molecule inhibitor of BMP receptors (DMH1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pyati et al., 2005</xref>). Inhibition of BMP signaling in whole embryos using the heat-shock inducible transgenic line at the 12-somite stage resulted in a loss of endothelial tissue (including dorsal aorta and caudal vein), and in its place ectopic somite tissue formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). The loss of blood vessels prevented the normal circulation of blood in the posterior body (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Inhibition of BMP signaling using the small molecule inhibitor DMH1 phenocopied the dominant negative BMP receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–L</xref>). The DHM1-treated embryos contained transgenes to label skeletal muscle and endothelium, and revealed that ectopic somite tissue differentiates into skeletal muscle at the midline, where endothelium normally forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L</xref>, compared to E-G). The ectopic somite tissue is the same length along the AP axis as the bilateral somites that normally form, and the muscle reporter shows that the ectopic muscle tissue connects pairs of bilateral somites at the midline below the notochord. Loss of BMP signaling using either the <italic>HS:dnbmpr</italic> line or DMH1 at the end of gastrulation (bud stage) in embryos with an endothelial reporter transgenic background produced a more severe effect than the 12-somite stage heat-shock, with the gain of somite tissue and loss of endothelium occurring more anteriorly and across a broader domain of the AP axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31018.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BMP signaling is necessary and sufficient for endothelial fate specification in tailbud-derived mesoderm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type sibling embryos heat-shocked at the 12-somite stage exhibit normal formation of the dorsal aorta (black arrows, 20/20 normal).

Conversely, activation of BMP signaling at the 12-somite stage caused a large number of transplanted cells to become endothelium, and prevented donor cells from integrating into somites and forming skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1T–U’</xref>).

Additionally, ID1 maintains the undifferentiated state of ES cells through antagonism of FGF induced TCF15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2013</xref>). These activities prevent precocious differentiation of stem cells or lineage specified progenitors and allow expansion of progenitor populations prior to differentiation. However, there are few examples of <italic>Id</italic> genes affecting cell fate decisions. The primary example is during the white blood cell lineage decision between NK and B cell fate, where mouse ID2 promotes NK-cell fate over B-cell fate through inhibition of E2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ikawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yokota et al., 1999</xref>), which itself promotes B-cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhuang et al., 1994</xref>). The role of ID proteins in fate determination has likely been obscured by the fact that the four vertebrate <italic>Id</italic> genes play partially redundant roles, such that any single mouse mutant lacks a severe phenotype. Significant embryonic phenotypes can only be observed in multiple knockouts. The <italic>Id1</italic>/<italic>Id3</italic> double knockout mouse has angiogenesis defects in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lyden et al., 1999</xref>). The redundancy of ID proteins was also recently substantiated by transient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of ID1-4 function during mouse embryogenesis, which causes defects in cardiac mesoderm specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cunningham et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The patterning role that Id proteins play in mesoderm lateralization is due at least in part to the inhibition of Myod, Myf5, and Msgn1 function. Based on mediolateral patterning phenotypes, our data suggest that Id inhibition of Myf5 is more important during lateralization than inhibition of Myod. Although Myod and Myf5 are redundantly required for skeletal myogenesis, recent work using mouse cells showed that they have distinct functions in regulating the muscle specific transcriptional program. During muscle differentiation, MYF5 initially modifies chromatin through histone acetylation, but does not act as a strong transcriptional activator. MYOD binds to the same genomic sites as MYF5 and can modify chromatin, but in the presence of MYF5 its primary role is to recruit POLII to strongly activate muscle-specific transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conerly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerber et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, Id-mediated lateralization is likely achieved by preventing a paraxial mesoderm competent chromatin state through Myf5 inhibition. Since MSGN1 plays an essential role in mouse to promote a paraxial mesoderm specific transcriptional program essential for somite development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalamalasetty et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yoon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yoon and Wold, 2000</xref>), Myf5 and Msgn1 likely function together to modify chromatin and create the paraxial competent state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Do ID proteins mediate the morphogen activity of BMP signaling?</title><p>BMP functions as a morphogen during mediolateral mesodermal patterning. Different levels of signaling have distinct outputs on cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dale et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dale and Wardle, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dosch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">James and Schultheiss, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Neave et al., 1997</xref>). For example, cells receiving the highest level of BMP signaling adopt a blood or endothelial fate, intermediate levels specify pronephros and paraxial tissues, and the absence of BMP signaling is required for notochord fate. Here, we show that <italic>Id</italic> genes are critical downstream targets of BMP that mediate its role in mediolateral patterning of the mesoderm. A key unresolved question is whether Id protein levels produce the morphogenetic output of BMP signaling during mediolateral mesodermal patterning. Based on the ability of BMP signaling to act as a morphogen, we envision two plausible scenarios. Id proteins mediate the morphogenetic activity of BMP signaling within the mesoderm, with different levels of Id protein specifying distinct mesodermal cell fates. An alternative scenario is that Id proteins levels do not act alone as the mediators of morphogenetic output, but rather impact a series of binary fate decisions that are dictated by the position of the cell in the mesodermal territory. In this case, the morphogenetic activity of BMP signaling integrates both its role in cell fate and cell migration, where the level of BMP signaling dictates the position of a cell in the embryo and mediates the binary decision that is possible in that precise location/signaling environment. BMP signaling has been previously shown to be capable of controlling cell migration during zebrafish gastrulation independent of cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">von der Hardt et al., 2007</xref>). This important question can be resolved in the future through the controlled modulation of Id protein levels and the examination of cell fate output.</p><p>If Id proteins levels modulate the morphogenetic activity of BMP within the mesoderm, the mechanism will not be as simple as Id antagonism of the same set of bHLH transcription factor function throughout the entire mesodermal germ layer. We show that Msgn1, Myf5, and Myod act as medializing factors in the mesoderm, but these transcription factors are not expressed in axial mesoderm. Given that Id3 activation inhibits notochord formation, there must be other bHLH transcription factor(s) in the axial mesoderm that promote the medial-most fate. Additionally, the lateralization caused by Id3 activation during gastrulation in non-axial mesoderm is more severe than loss of Msgn1, Myf5, and Myod function, indicating that additional bHLH gene(s) likely functions in a partially redundant fashion with Msgn1, Myf5, and Myod to impart paraxial/myogenic fate. On the other hand, loss of Msgn1, Myf5, and Myod fully phenocopies Id3 activation during postgastrulation development, indicating that these three genes are the primary determinants of somite fate within NMP-derived mesoderm.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Evolutionarily conserved mediolateral patterning of NMP-derived mesoderm</title><p>Vertebrate NMP-derived mesoderm gives rise primarily to paraxial mesoderm, which forms the somites. We previously showed in zebrafish that a small percentage of NMP-derived mesoderm becomes endothelium, indicating a patterning event that occurs to generate medial paraxial and lateral endothelial mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martin and Kimelman, 2012</xref>). Similarly, in mouse, a minority of mesodermal cells in NMP-derived clones contribute to lateral mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</xref>). Here we show, using embryonic tissue transplantation and NMP cell culture, that mouse NMP-derived mesoderm is also plastic and can robustly differentiate to both medial and lateral mesodermal types, supporting previous grafting studies showing that lateral fated tailbud mesoderm can be re-specified to paraxial fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wymeersch et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we show using in vitro mouse assays and in vivo zebrafish assays, that FGF signaling acts as a medializing factor, and BMP signaling as the lateralizing factor during mediolateral patterning. In both zebrafish and mouse, the lateralizing activity of BMP signaling can be phenocopied by over-expression of the BMP target gene <italic>Id1</italic>, indicating that bHLH transcription factor activity is a key conserved mechanism by which NMP-derived mesoderm is patterned along the mediolateral axis. Since NMPs have been observed in several other vertebrate species and are likely present in all vertebrates, we expect that the mediolateral fate decision in NMP-derived mesoderm to become paraxial mesoderm or posterior endothelium is common feature of vertebrate body formation.</p><p>We showed that in zebrafish, FGF signaling medializes and promotes somitic fate in NMP-derived mesoderm through transcriptional activation of the bHLH transcription factors <italic>myf5</italic>, <italic>msgn1</italic>, and <italic>myod</italic>. This indicates that in addition to its fundamental role in promoting cell motility and orchestrating segment formation during somitogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bénazéraf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubrulle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hubaud and Pourquié, 2014</xref>), FGF signaling also maintains paraxial fate in unsegmented presomitic mesoderm. This function is solely dependent on regulation of bHLH transcription factor expression and not on inhibition of BMP signaling, which FGF signaling normally inhibits during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fürthauer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pera et al., 2003</xref>). Loss of both FGF and BMP signaling lateralizes the NMP-derived mesoderm to the same extent as loss of FGF signaling alone. This suggests that with respect to FGF and BMP signaling, lateral mesoderm is the default fate. Why then is BMP signaling necessary in the tailbud to promote an endothelial fate? Both FGF and Wnt signaling, which are medializing factors, are also required for the induction of mesoderm from NMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martin and Kimelman, 2012</xref>), and therefore BMP signaling is required to counter the action of these signals after mesoderm induction. Indeed, loss of BMP signaling causes cells that would normally become endothelium to adopt a medial, somite fate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care</title><p>All zebrafish procedures were performed with prior approval from the Stony Brook University and Seattle Children’s Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Generation of zebrafish heat-shock inducible constructs and transgenic lines</title><p>We generated heat-shock inducible constructs as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Row et al., 2016</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Anna-Katerina Hadjantonakis (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. <italic>eLife</italic></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Row et al. present a compelling analysis of the way in which FGF and BMP signaling intersect to pattern the vertebrate mesoderm. FGF is known to activate expression of bHLH transcription factors that are required for paraxial mesoderm development, such as Mesogenin, Myod and Myf5. The authors show that BMP promotes ventral mesoderm (vasculature) by activating the expression of Id, a known inhibitor of bHLH proteins. Strikingly, simultaneous inhibition of Mesogenin, Myod and Myf5 causes paraxial tissue to adopt a vascular fate. It is especially appealing that the authors employ a cross-species approach, combining work in zebrafish, mouse, and IPSC-derived mesodermal progenitors, to investigate the intersection between BMP/FGF signaling, bHLH proteins, and Id function during this important patterning process. Their interesting results suggest a conserved function for BMP signaling in inhibiting the development of neural tissue development and dorsal somitic mesoderm while also specifying endothelial cells through bHLH proteins, including Id acting as a BMP target gene to specify multiple ventral mesodermal cell fates. The authors try to integrate all of their results into a unified model for how distinct signaling impacts D-V (but not A-P) patterning of nascent mesodermal cell types emanating at gastrulation or in the tail bud. This model has important implications for our understanding of embryonic patterning and mesodermal differentiation. However, in its current form, the manuscript is challenging to read and hard to digest into a simple model (presented – but kind of buried – in Figure 8X). In addition, there are several open issues related to the authors' controls, experimental design, and results, and further work will be needed to strengthen the case for the authors' interpretations. Finally, some of the authors' conclusions seem to extend far beyond what is indicated by the available data, and it would be valuable for the authors to re-think precisely what they want to conclude (as mentioned in certain suggestions for revision listed below).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is unclear why the authors use dorsomorphin for this study. It has a well-documented effect on VEGF signaling, thus the results cannot be interpreted simply as a loss of BMP signaling. The dorsomorphin data should be removed and replaced with experiments using DMH1 which has higher specificity and inhibits the BMP receptor.</p><p>2) The authors cannot conclude that BMP signaling is cell-autonomously required for endothelial cell fate specification as they do in the last paragraph of the subsection “BMP signaling is necessary and sufficient for endothelial specification from NMP derived mesoderm”, since endothelial cells with DN-BMPR still form and are reduced to half, not to 0 percent. If the authors want to test cell autonomy, it would be better done by transplanting BMP component null mutant cells in such an experiment, rather than using the hsDN-BMPR, which may not block all BMP signaling and therefore not block all from endothelial development. The experiment is still a good one, but it would be appropriate to soften the conclusion on cell autonomy. Additionally, cell non-autonomous effects would not be observed when measuring fli1-GFP endothelial cells, since only the donor cells contain the marker.</p><p>3) The <italic>HS:dnfgfr</italic> transplant analysis should be quantified, as with the <italic>HS:caalk6</italic> and <italic>hs:dnbmpr</italic> transplants. Same issue here with making conclusions about cell autonomy. Cell non-autonomous effects would not be observed because the <italic>fli1-GFP</italic> is only in the donor cells, and not all donor cells change fate, so not most rigorous test of cell autonomy. Clearly FGF signaling is playing a role and it is likely to be cell-autonomous, but these experiments are not definitive.</p><p>4) In the first paragraph of the subsection “FGF signaling prevents presomitic mesoderm from adopting an endothelial fate” and Supplementary Figure 2, without a quantitative assay for the number of <italic>etv2</italic>-expressing cells, it cannot be said that loss of FGF and Wnt signaling cause a synergistic increase in <italic>etv2</italic> cells. A change in morphology of the tailbud may also occur, so the red bar between <italic>etv2</italic> cells and the end of the tailbud is not sufficient a measure. The distance from <italic>etv2</italic> cells to the dorsal edge of the embryo appears smaller in Supplementary Figure 2C compared to 2D, possibly indicating a morphology change.</p><p>5) For experiments in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, these would be most convincing if done blindly (if not already done this way) by mixing the embryos in one tube, heat shocking, followed by in situ hybridization, and then genotyping. Also, in situ hybridizations are not a good assay for quantitative changes, since length of staining can strongly affect the amount of staining. Quantitative RT-PCR would be an alternative to the blind experiment suggested, which provides better controls for fixing, staining, etc.</p><p>6) Based on comparisons of Figure 8V (<italic>HS:id3</italic>) and 8W (<italic>HS:caalk6</italic>), it is concluded that Id3 does not affect AP patterning, while overexpression of BMP does. There are few controls or analysis performed to substantiate this conclusion. Is Id3 expressed widely and sufficiently at shield stage compared to <italic>caalk6</italic>? Caalk6 may act cell non-autonomously because it likely will induce BMP gene expression during gastrulation where ectopically expressed, which Id3 may not do. Much more analysis should be performed if the authors would like to make such a conclusion.</p><p>7) The Myogenin/Myod/Myf5 experiments clearly show their requirement for muscle development, and in their absence the cells form endothelium or blood. But that doesn't show that these myogenic genes inhibit 'ventral mesodermal fate'. Perhaps it is not useful to refer to Myogenin/Myod/Myf5 or Gata1a as dorsalizing or ventralizing the mesoderm. Rather, they are acting in specific cell fate decisions. Myogenin/Myod/Myf5 have a long history and are well known for their roles in specifying somitic mesoderm. Referring to them as dorsalizing factors is confusing. These factors are the outputs acting at more specific cell fate decisions, so it would be better to discuss them in that way. In the last paragraph of the subsection “Id genes are the essential targets mediating BMP induced ventralization of mesoderm”, the authors are trying to argue that their results show that Myogenin/Myod/Myf5 play roles other than in somite-muscle specification, which does not seem well supported by their results. On the other hand, Id genes may be acting more broadly and may therefore be appropriate to discuss in terms of ventralization/dorsalization.</p><p>8) One major question that comes to mind is the specificity of Id proteins. Do they bind to and inhibit all bHLH proteins? If so, then one can assume that they act by preventing Mesogenin et al. from activating transcription. However, if they have some specificity, it would be good to show the physical interaction, since the authors' conclusions assume that Id is sequestering mesogenin et al. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation has been used to show binding specificity between hairy-related proteins (also bHLH proteins) in live zebrafish and could be employed in a similar manner here.</p><p>9) In the Discussion, the authors ask whether Id is a morphogen. The answer is no. A morphogen diffuses from a source and specifies at least two cell fates above a ground state in a concentration-dependent manner. Given that the vertebrate embryo is not a syncytium and that Id is a transcription factor, it cannot function as a morphogen. BMPs can function as morphogens and, perhaps as an effector of Bmp signaling, Id can function to specify multiple cell fates, which seems to be what the authors are trying to say in the discussion. However, Id cannot be a morphogen and the authors should use this terminology appropriately.</p><p>10) Regarding the discussion: &quot;Distinct molecular control of AP and DV axis formation downstream of FGF and BMP signaling&quot;: The role of BMP signaling in AP patterning is very distinct from the roles of Wnt, FGF, RA in AP patterning of the embryo and needs to be clarified. As written, it could be misleading to many readers and confusing to those more familiar with the roles of Wnt and RA that pattern AP tissues. Because tail tissues are derived predominantly from ventral regions of the gastrula, they are affected by BMP loss or gain of function. I think it is worth clarifying this, so the distinct roles of these signaling pathways is conveyed. The discussion on BMP signaling controlling AP and DV patterning of mesodermal tissue should also be discussed in terms of loss of function studies. A few studies examining AP patterning of neural tissue shows that it is unaffected in BMP loss of function mutants, related to the prior point.</p><p>11) &quot;Our results show for the first time a molecular pathway downstream of BMP and FGF signaling that controls DV pattern without affecting AP pattern.&quot; It does not seem that this conclusion, which is also in the Abstract, can be made based on the Figure 8 results.</p><p>12) Although the Id genes are well known as BMP direct targets, it does not seem like they have been shown to be direct targets in these tissues for zebrafish. The authors should qualify their conclusions and say, for example, presumptive (or likely) direct target. A role for different levels of Id protein in patterning DV tissues is stated in the Discussion (subsection “Do ID proteins act as morphogens?”, first paragraph), although it's unclear which experiments demonstrated this. Since the Hs:Id experiments do not show this, this conclusion seems likely to be an overstatement. Later in this paragraph two mechanisms by which Id could act is discussed, which is good, but the previous statement should be removed.</p><p>13) The cross-species approach employed here is a great strength of this work. However, although this manuscript tries to propose an integrated model of signaling between zebrafish and mouse, much of the insight comes from the fish experiments, which are somehow disconnected from the mouse and pluripotent stem cell work. It is not expected that all work will be performed in parallel in all contexts (e.g. it is not necessary for all fish experiments to be recapitulated in the mouse), but it is important for the authors to integrate their coverage of the experiments performed in each system as well as they can. It will also be worthwhile for the authors to make each part of the manuscript as accessible as possible (e.g. making the zebrafish portions of the manuscript highly accessible to readers from the mouse field, and vice versa). In this regard, the authors should consider how they can revise their manuscript to address the following comments from the reviewers:</p><p>a) This study specifically identifies and characterizes a role of BMP and FGF signaling in D-V (but not A-P) patterning. While BMP acting as a ventralizing signal may be well described in zebrafish, it is not well documented in the mouse, and so many of the analogies the authors make are hard to reconcile between the two species making it even more difficult for the reader to integrate.</p><p>b) The introduction to the manuscript presents a discussion of NMPs. However, it is somewhat polarized and centered on studies in the zebrafish. It neglects to mention that NMPs were first identified through studies in mice, which were in many people's opinion spearheaded by a tour-de-force and landmark fate mapping study (Tsouanacou et al. 2009).</p><p>c) The analysis of gastrulation is only performed (or extended) to zebrafish. This is fine, although it sort of stands out.</p><p>d) The mouse grafting experiments (Figure 2A) seem a little disjointed with the rest of the study and could be better explained and integrated into the big picture of the story.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;BMP and FGF signaling interact to pattern mesoderm by controlling basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor activity&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor), Deborah Yelon (Reviewing Editor), and three reviewers.</p><p>All of the reviewers agree that the manuscript has been improved through revision. The new data provided are helpful to address the prior critiques, the conclusions are well substantiated by the data, and the overall findings are quite interesting and provide a more integrated understanding of how FGF and BMP signaling pattern the vertebrate mesoderm. However, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) An important issue remains regarding whether Id and Myod/Myog/Myf5 function during gastrulation. Although the experiments (subsection “bHLH transcription factor activity functions during zebrafish gastrulation to pattern the mediolateral mesodermal axis”, first paragraph) are convincing that triple loss of <italic>myod, myog</italic>, and <italic>myf5</italic> leads to loss of skeletal muscle and an increase in endothelial cells and blood, the results do not support a role for an alteration in cell fate specification during gastrulation. Analysis was done at 24 hpf or 22-somite stage, which is a long time from gastrulation. These genes are expressed throughout this period, so it seems a leap in logic to make conclusions about gastrulation, without examining much earlier stages in development. This is a weak point and these experiments are not evidence for function in gastrulation.</p><p>The <italic>HS:id3</italic> experiment where heat-shock is done at shield stage provides some evidence for a role in gastrulation; however, it is not conclusive. It would have been desirable to show that the same expansion in blood was not observed with a heat-shock after gastrulation. The persistence of the transcript and Id3 protein beyond gastrula stages could lead to the expansion, rather than actual patterning during gastrulation. Indeed, Figure 8—figure supplement 1 supports long persisting Id3 protein, as an early heat-shock (shield, 75% epiboly) affects cell fates extensively along the AP axis. In addition, heat-shock at 75% epiboly (mid-gastrula) looks nearly identical to heat-shock at shield stage (early gastrula), indicating that Id3 is sufficient at late gastrula stages to inhibit somite and promote endothelial cell fates. Further, heat-shock after gastrulation at bud stage still strongly affects anterior somites (some myoD expression anteriorly but still significantly reduced compared to WT) and shows an expansion of <italic>kdrl</italic> (endothelial) expression along the entire AP axis, including the most anterior. Thus, it seems that the results do not support a role for patterning during gastrulation. Here too patterning was only analyzed at 24 hpf, rather than during gastrulation or at early somite stages, so concluding that patterning is affected during gastrulation should be softened here or more experiments need to be performed to rigorously test this point. This is a minor point of the manuscript, and does not affect the main, important conclusions of the paper. Perhaps the simplest solution would be for the authors to remove the conclusion that patterning is occurring during gastrulation (or at least to substantially tone down this interpretation and to discuss the appropriate caveats.)</p><p>2) The authors should also comment on where the <italic>id1</italic> and <italic>id3</italic> genes are expressed in zebrafish.

It has a well-documented effect on VEGF signaling, thus the results cannot be interpreted simply as a loss of Bmp signaling. The dorsomorphin data should be removed and replaced with experiments using DMH1 which has higher specificity and inhibits the BMP receptor.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated the dorsomorphin experiments using DMH1 as suggested and found that the effects on medial-lateral patterning of the NMP derived mesoderm were the same as what we originally observed using dorsomorphin and <italic>HS:dnbmpr</italic>. The new DMH1 data can be found in Figures 1, 3, and Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors cannot conclude that BMP signaling is cell-autonomously required for endothelial cell fate specification as they do in the last paragraph of the subsection “BMP signaling is necessary and sufficient for endothelial specification from NMP derived mesoderm”, since endothelial cells with DN-BMPR still form and are reduced to half, not to 0 percent. If the authors want to test cell autonomy, it would be better done by transplanting BMP component null mutant cells in such an experiment, rather than using the hsDN-BMPR, which may not block all BMP signaling and therefore not block all from endothelial development. The experiment is still a good one, but it would be appropriate to soften the conclusion on cell autonomy. Additionally, cell non-autonomous effects would not be observed when measuring fli1-GFP endothelial cells, since only the donor cells contain the marker.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment. Our assumption is that endothelial cells that form in the presence of DN-BMPR are already committed to the endothelial fate at the time the heat-shock is applied. But, as the reviewers correctly point out, we cannot say for sure if this is the case given data in the manuscript. The question of cell autonomy is not important for the main message of the paper; therefore, as suggested, we will change the text accordingly to soften the conclusions of this experiment (subsection “BMP signaling is necessary and sufficient for endothelial specification from NMP derived mesoderm in zebrafish”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The HS:dnfgfr transplant analysis should be quantified, as with the HS:caalk6 and hs:dnbmpr transplants. Same issue here with making conclusions about cell autonomy. Cell non-autonomous effects would not be observed because the fli1-GFP is only in the donor cells, and not all donor cells change fate, so not most rigorous test of cell autonomy. Clearly FGF signaling is playing a role and it is likely to be cell-autonomous, but these experiments are not definitive.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a quantitative analysis of cell fate changes after inhibition of FGF signaling in transplanted cells. We found a significant increase in the percent of transplanted NMP derived mesodermal cells that adopt an endothelial fate after FGF inhibition. These new results are presented in Figure 3G-I. Additionally, we will modified the text to soften the conclusions about cell autonomy similar to the previous point. We indicated that while the <italic>HS:dnfgfr</italic> transplant results show that it functions in a cell-autonomous fashion, we cannot rule out an additional non-autonomous effect (subsection “FGF signaling prevents zebrafish presomitic mesoderm from adopting an endothelial fate”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the first paragraph of the subsection “FGF signaling prevents presomitic mesoderm from adopting an endothelial fate” and Supplementary Figure 2, without a quantitative assay for the number of etv2-expressing cells, it cannot be said that loss of FGF and Wnt signaling cause a synergistic increase in etv2 cells. A change in morphology of the tailbud may also occur, so the red bar between etv2 cells and the end of the tailbud is not sufficient a measure. The distance from etv2 cells to the dorsal edge of the embryo appears smaller in Supplementary Figure 2C compared to 2D, possibly indicating a morphology change.</p></disp-quote><p>This figure was intended to link this work with some of our prior work (Martin and Kimelman, 2012) in which we showed a role for canonical Wnt signaling during the paraxial / endothelial fate decision. Since this is the only figure that examines Wnt function and does not add to the main message of the paper, which focuses on FGF and BMP interactions, and given the reviewers concerns, we decided to remove this supplemental figure from the manuscript. We plan to integrate the Wnt data into subsequent work that will take a more in-depth approach to understanding the role of Wnt signaling in this cell fate decision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For experiments in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, these would be most convincing if done blindly (if not already done this way) by mixing the embryos in one tube, heat shocking, followed by in situ hybridization, and then genotyping. Also, in situ hybridizations are not a good assay for quantitative changes, since length of staining can strongly affect the amount of staining. Quantitative RT-PCR would be an alternative to the blind experiment suggested, which provides better controls for fixing, staining, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated these experiments as the reviewers suggested by performing a blind analysis of mixed embryos that were PCR genotyped after in situ hybridization and image capture. Embryos were sorted based on whether they exhibited strong, medium, or weak expression of <italic>id1</italic> or <italic>id3</italic>. The embryos were subsequently PCR genotyped using primers specific for the <italic>HS:dnbmpr</italic> or <italic>HS:caalk6</italic> transgenes. In the vast majority of embryos, strong expression of either <italic>id1</italic> or <italic>id3</italic> correlated with the presence of the <italic>HS:caalk6</italic> transgene, weak expression correlated with the presence of the <italic>HS:dnbmpr</italic> transgene, and medium expression with the absence of both transgenes. These results are presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1G and H, with numbers given in legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Based on comparisons of Figure 8V (HS:id3) and 8W (HS:caalk6), it is concluded that Id3 does not affect AP patterning, while overexpression of BMP does. There are few controls or analysis performed to substantiate this conclusion. Is Id3 expressed widely and sufficiently at shield stage compared to caalk6? Caalk6 may act cell non-autonomously because it likely will induce bmp gene expression during gastrulation where ectopically expressed, which Id3 may not do. Much more analysis should be performed if the authors would like to make such a conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise a valid point here. Although we feel this is potentially a very interesting result, the differences in the effect of Id3 and BMP are not central to the conclusion regarding the mediolateral mesoderm patterning mechanism presented in the manuscript, and thus we removed this conclusion and will expand upon it in future work. Furthermore, as discussed below, other comments from the reviewers (e.g. point 7 below) have helped us to realize that the broad focus on dorso-ventral patterning would be better framed in terms of a specific focus on lateral vs. medial (paraxial) mesoderm patterning. This makes it even clearer that this particular conclusion is only marginally relevant the overall message of the paper. We removed panels V and W from Figure 8 and adjusted the text accordingly to reflect these changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The Myogenin/Myod/Myf5 experiments clearly show their requirement for muscle development, and in their absence the cells form endothelium or blood. But that doesn't show that these myogenic genes inhibit 'ventral mesodermal fate'. Perhaps it is not useful to refer to Myogenin/Myod/Myf5 or Gata1a as dorsalizing or ventralizing the mesoderm. Rather, they are acting in specific cell fate decisions. Myogenin/Myod/Myf5 have a long history and are well known for their roles in specifying somitic mesoderm. Referring to them as dorsalizing factors is confusing. These factors are the outputs acting at more specific cell fate decisions, so it would be better to discuss them in that way. In the last paragraph of the subsection “Id genes are the essential targets mediating BMP induced ventralization of mesoderm”, the authors are trying to argue that their results show that Myogenin/Myod/Myf5 play roles other than in somite-muscle specification, which does not seem well supported by their results. On the other hand, Id genes may be acting more broadly and may therefore be appropriate to discuss in terms of ventralization/dorsalization.</p></disp-quote><p>These comments are very helpful. We made changes to the text to be specific about the roles of Msgn1/Myod/Myf5 in somite/muscle specification and eliminate mention of them acting as dorsalizing factors in the mesoderm. This also helps to clarify the parallels between the zebrafish and the mouse work raised in point 13 and improves the overall clarity of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) One major question that comes to mind is the specificity of Id proteins. Do they bind to and inhibit all bHLH proteins? If so, then one can assume that they act by preventing Mesogenin et al. from activating transcription. However, if they have some specificity, it would be good to show the physical interaction, since the authors' conclusions assume that Id is sequestering mesogenin et al. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation has been used to show binding specificity between hairy-related proteins (also bHLH proteins) in live zebrafish and could be employed in a similar manner here.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that we did not explain the mechanism by which Id inhibits bHLH proteins. Id proteins do not directly bind bHLH transcription factors such as Mesogenin in order to inhibit their activity. Rather, Id proteins bind and sequester E proteins, which are essential heterodimerisation partners of bHLH transcription factors. E proteins are expressed ubiquitously so we would not expect any specificity of Id proteins with respect to particular bHLH transcription factors. We have clarified this in the revised version of our manuscript (subsection “BMP signaling lateralizes mesoderm through activation of id gene transcription in both mouse and zebrafish”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In the Discussion, the authors ask whether Id is a morphogen. The answer is no. A morphogen diffuses from a source and specifies at least two cell fates above a ground state in a concentration-dependent manner. Given that the vertebrate embryo is not a syncytium and that Id is a transcription factor, it cannot function as a morphogen. BMPs can function as morphogens and, perhaps as an effector of BMP signaling, Id can function to specify multiple cell fates, which seems to be what the authors are trying to say in the discussion. However, Id cannot be a morphogen and the authors should use this terminology appropriately.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. The intention was to suggest that differential Id levels may lead to alternative cell fates, and thus might be the downstream effector accounting for the morphogenetic activity of BMP during mesoderm patterning. We changed the text to clarify this in the Discussion and eliminate reference of Id as potentially being a morphogen itself (Discussion subsection “Id genes are the essential targets mediating BMP induced lateralization of mesoderm”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Regarding the discussion: &quot;Distinct molecular control of AP and DV axis formation downstream of FGF and BMP signaling&quot;: The role of BMP signaling in AP patterning is very distinct from the roles of Wnt, FGF, RA in AP patterning of the embryo and needs to be clarified. As written, it could be misleading to many readers and confusing to those more familiar with the roles of Wnt and RA that pattern AP tissues. Because tail tissues are derived predominantly from ventral regions of the gastrula, they are affected by BMP loss or gain of function. I think it is worth clarifying this, so the distinct roles of these signaling pathways is conveyed. The discussion on BMP signaling controlling AP and DV patterning of mesodermal tissue should also be discussed in terms of loss of function studies. A few studies examining AP patterning of neural tissue shows that it is unaffected in BMP loss of function mutants, related to the prior point.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise several good points here. Based on this and previous points, we have modified the text to focus on mediolateral patterning of the mesoderm, and thus we have removed this section which will be the focus of an ongoing study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) &quot;Our results show for the first time a molecular pathway downstream of BMP and FGF signaling that controls DV pattern without affecting AP pattern.&quot; It does not seem that this conclusion, which is also in the Abstract, can be made based on the Figure 8 results.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we changed the text to reflect a role in mediolateral mesoderm patterning rather than DV vs. AP patterning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Although the Id genes are well known as BMP direct targets, it does not seem like they have been shown to be direct targets in these tissues for zebrafish. The authors should qualify their conclusions and say, for example, presumptive (or likely) direct target. A role for different levels of Id protein in patterning DV tissues is stated in the Discussion (subsection “Do ID proteins act as morphogens?”, first paragraph), although it's unclear which experiments demonstrated this. Since the Hs:Id experiments do not show this, this conclusion seems likely to be an overstatement. Later in this paragraph two mechanisms by which Id could act is discussed, which is good, but the previous statement should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this and modified the text as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The cross-species approach employed here is a great strength of this work. However, although this manuscript tries to propose an integrated model of signaling between zebrafish and mouse, much of the insight comes from the fish experiments, which are somehow disconnected from the mouse and pluripotent stem cell work. It is not expected that all work will be performed in parallel in all contexts (e.g. it is not necessary for all fish experiments to be recapitulated in the mouse), but it is important for the authors to integrate their coverage of the experiments performed in each system as well as they can. It will also be worthwhile for the authors to make each part of the manuscript as accessible as possible (e.g. making the zebrafish portions of the manuscript highly accessible to readers from the mouse field, and vice versa). In this regard, the authors should consider how they can revise their manuscript to address the following comments from the reviewers:</p><p>a) This study specifically identifies and characterizes a role of BMP and FGF signaling in D-V (but not A-P) patterning. While BMP acting as a ventralizing signal may be well described in zebrafish, it is not well documented in the mouse, and so many of the analogies the authors make are hard to reconcile between the two species making it even more difficult for the reader to integrate.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we modified the text to focus on lateral vs. paraxial mesoderm patterning rather than DV patterning. BMP is well documented in both species as promoting lateral mesoderm specification and thus we feel this change will make the text more unified and easier to understand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The introduction to the manuscript presents a discussion of NMPs. However, it is somewhat polarized and centered on studies in the zebrafish. It neglects to mention that NMPs were first identified through studies in mice, which were in many people's opinion spearheaded by a tour-de-force and landmark fate mapping study (Tsouanacou et al. 2009).</p></disp-quote><p>We will modify the Introduction to include more details about mouse NMPs, including referencing the Tzouanacou paper in addition to the current NMP reviews that were cited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The analysis of gastrulation is only performed (or extended) to zebrafish. This is fine, although it sort of stands out.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we are interested in performing a gastrula stage analysis in mouse, it is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The mouse grafting experiments (Figure 2A) seem a little disjointed with the rest of the study and could be better explained and integrated into the big picture of the story.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address this comment, we modified the text of the manuscript to improve our explanation for the rationale behind these experiments, including making sure the explanation of the manipulations is clear. We also changed the text to make sure the results are better integrated into the big picture by discussing how they are related to the fish experiments.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All of the reviewers agree that the manuscript has been improved through revision. The new data provided are helpful to address the prior critiques, the conclusions are well substantiated by the data, and the overall findings are quite interesting and provide a more integrated understanding of how FGF and BMP signaling pattern the vertebrate mesoderm. However, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) An important issue remains regarding whether Id and Myod/Myog/Myf5 function during gastrulation. Although the experiments (subsection “bHLH transcription factor activity functions during zebrafish gastrulation to pattern the mediolateral mesodermal axis”, first paragraph) are convincing that triple loss of myod, myog, and myf5 leads to loss of skeletal muscle and an increase in endothelial cells and blood, the results do not support a role for an alteration in cell fate specification during gastrulation. Analysis was done at 24 hpf or 22-somite stage, which is a long time from gastrulation. These genes are expressed throughout this period, so it seems a leap in logic to make conclusions about gastrulation, without examining much earlier stages in development. This is a weak point and these experiments are not evidence for function in gastrulation.</p><p>The HS:id3 experiment where heat-shock is done at shield stage provides some evidence for a role in gastrulation; however, it is not conclusive. It would have been desirable to show that the same expansion in blood was not observed with a heat-shock after gastrulation. The persistence of the transcript and Id3 protein beyond gastrula stages could lead to the expansion, rather than actual patterning during gastrulation. Indeed, Figure 8—figure supplement 1 supports long persisting Id3 protein, as an early heat-shock (shield, 75% epiboly) affects cell fates extensively along the AP axis. In addition, heat-shock at 75% epiboly (mid-gastrula) looks nearly identical to heat-shock at shield stage (early gastrula), indicating that Id3 is sufficient at late gastrula stages to inhibit somite and promote endothelial cell fates. Further, heat-shock after gastrulation at bud stage still strongly affects anterior somites (some myoD expression anteriorly but still significantly reduced compared to WT) and shows an expansion of kdrl (endothelial) expression along the entire AP axis, including the most anterior. Thus, it seems that the results do not support a role for patterning during gastrulation. Here too patterning was only analyzed at 24 hpf, rather than during gastrulation or at early somite stages, so concluding that patterning is affected during gastrulation should be softened here or more experiments need to be performed to rigorously test this point. This is a minor point of the manuscript, and does not affect the main, important conclusions of the paper. Perhaps the simplest solution would be for the authors to remove the conclusion that patterning is occurring during gastrulation (or at least to substantially tone down this interpretation and to discuss the appropriate caveats.)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this assessment and have changed the conclusion in the Abstract and body of the Results and Discussion. We now emphasize that gastrulation stage induction of Id3 has broad patterning effects throughout the mesodermal germ layer (beyond NMP derived mesoderm), and recapitulates the early ectopic activation of BMP signaling. We have done this without making a conclusion about whether the time of action is during gastrulation or at later stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should also comment on where the id1 and id3 genes are expressed in zebrafish. ZFIN shows ubiquitous expression of id1 during gastrulation and id3 expressed strongly in the dorsal midline with weaker ventral levels. It seems unclear if these expression domains fit well with the authors' models.</p></disp-quote><p>We no longer conclude that Id3 (or other Id genes) is acting specifically during gastrulation (see response to point 1). We also show that at later time points (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 for fish, Figure 5 for mouse) that Id1 and Id3 are expressed in the appropriate regions of the embryo to fit with our model. Thus, we have not commented on the gastrula stage expression based on the modified conclusions, as it would seem out of place.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The style of the text still leaves something to be desired. Both clarity and precision could be improved. Below are a few specific examples.</p><p>- In the legend of Figure 1, it should be specifically noted that panels F, G, K and L are transverse sections.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now noted in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the legend of Figure 4, panels G and H should be specifically noted.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now noted in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the last paragraph of the subsection “Lateral mesoderm is the default state of zebrafish tailbud derived mesoderm” and in the legend of Figure 3, it is stated that inhibition of BMP signaling failed to &quot;rescue&quot; MEK inhibitor mediated etv2 expansion. &quot;rescue&quot; is a confusing verb here. &quot;prevent&quot; or 'block' would be much clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the wording as suggested for better clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors write, &quot;Together, the zebrafish and mouse data show that BMP mediated lateralization of NMP derived mesoderm occurs through Id gene activation across vertebrates.&quot; A more precise phrasing would be, &quot;The mouse and zebrafish data show that BMP mediates lateralization of NMP derived mesoderm via activation of Id expression and suggests that this mechanism acts across vertebrates.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the wording as suggested for better clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the first paragraph of the subsection “bHLH transcription factor activity functions during zebrafish gastrulation to pattern the mediolateral mesodermal axis”, it should refer to the transplant analysis as 'chimeric' rather than 'mosaic', since these are chimeras (cells from two different embryos) and not mosaic embryos (which would be all cells from the same embryo but genetically different).

Although the result is convincing in the two embryos shown, quantitation is always more rigorous.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the wording as suggested.
