Here we utilize single-molecule observations of RNA in fixed and living cells to develop a single-cell model of steroid-receptor mediated gene activation. We determine that steroids drive mRNA synthesis by frequency modulation of transcription. This digital behavior in single cells gives rise to the well-known analog dose response across the population. To test this model, we developed a light-activation technology to turn on a single steroid-responsive gene and follow dynamic synthesis of RNA from the activated locus.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00750.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00750.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00750.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The process by which a gene is expressed as a protein consists of two stages: transcription, which involves the DNA of the gene being copied into messenger RNA (mRNA); and translation, in which the mRNA is used as a template to assemble amino acids into a protein. Transcription and translation are controlled by many interlinked pathways, which ensures that genes are expressed when and where required.</p><p>One of these regulatory pathways involves steroid receptors. The binding of a steroid molecule to its receptor causes the receptor to move into the nucleus and interact with a specific gene, triggering transcription of that gene. When measured at the level of the whole organism, this transcriptional response is dose-dependent—the more steroid molecules that are present, the greater the amount of transcription. However, this is not the case in single cells, in which transcription is either activated or not. This ‘on/off’ behaviour is also seen over time: steroid-activated transcription occurs in bursts, separated by periods of inactivity.</p><p>To unravel the molecular mechanism behind this phenomenon, Larson et al. created a light-activated form of the ligand that activates a specific steroid receptor. Using this molecule, they were able to switch transcription of the gene controlled by that receptor on and off. They then used fluorescent proteins to label the mRNA and protein molecules that were produced as a result.</p><p>They found that activating the steroid receptor increases the likelihood of transcription occurring inside a cell, but not the duration of individual bursts of transcriptional activity, nor the amount of mRNA produced during each burst. Activation of a steroid receptor seems to control transcription by reducing the length of time each cell spends in the ‘off’ state between bursts.</p><p>Larson et al. incorporated their findings into a model that also takes into account the natural variability in levels of transcription between cells, and found that this could explain how the digital (on/off) control of transcription at the cellular level leads to analogue, dose-dependent control at the level of a whole organism. These findings should lead to further insights into how transcription is controlled at the molecular level.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00750.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00750.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>single-molecule</kwd><kwd>fluorescence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM 86217</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singer</surname><given-names>Robert H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program of the NIH</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larson</surname><given-names>Daniel R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Steroid hormone receptors control the expression of their target genes through a digital on-off switch in individual cells, which leads to an analogue dose-response relationship at the level of the whole organism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Steroid receptors coordinate a diverse range of responses in higher eukaryotes and are involved in a wide range of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gronemeyer et al., 2004</xref>). Steroid receptor response elements are present throughout the human genome and modulate chromatin remodeling and transcription in both a local and long-range fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">John et al., 2011</xref>). As such, steroid receptor-mediated transcription is a paradigm of genetic control in the metazoan nucleus. Moreover, the ligand-dependent nature of these transcription factors makes them appealing targets for therapeutic intervention, necessitating a quantitative understanding of how receptors control output from target genes.</p><p>The classic sigmoidal dose response of steroid-regulated gene products belies the complexity of a system which relies on an intricate, multi-step sequence of events to initiate transcription from a target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McKenna et al., 2009</xref>). Depending on the particular steroid receptor, a partial list of events required to activate the target gene includes ligand-binding, receptor dimerization, nuclear translocation, eviction of co-repressors (i.e., histone deacetylases), recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes (histone acetyltransferases, ATP-dependent remodeling enzymes, methyltransferases), and eventually recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. Despite this complexity, the dose-response is deceptively simple: it often takes the form of a simple Hill function with a coefficient of unity, which has traditionally been interpreted to imply that ligand-binding is the only rate-limiting step in the activation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ong et al., 2010</xref>). This description models the dose response as a continuum where each cell transcribes RNA at rates proportional to the dosage level.</p><p>However, single-cell studies of gene expression demonstrate that this description is incorrect. First, gene expression is not uniform over a population for a given dose, but shows variation from cell to cell, an observation which was first made for a steroid-responsive MMTV reporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ko et al., 1990</xref>). The authors demonstrated that the observed analog dose response was in fact a digital dose response (on or off) when viewed in single cells. Likewise, previous studies initially demonstrated that enhancers increase the <italic>probability</italic> of activation of a cell but not the strength of activation in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moreau et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weintraub, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moon and Ley, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walters et al., 1995</xref>). Second, expression is only a snapshot of temporally evolving gene activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ross et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">White et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suter et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, a cell is counted as activated or not activated dependent on the moment it is observed. Thus far, all single-cell measurements on metazoans suggest that genes are transcribed in ‘bursts’ of transcription, meaning that short periods of RNA synthesis are interspersed by long periods of inactivity. The causes of transcriptional bursting are unknown. Third, since molecules involved in regulating transcription are usually present at low copy number, this leads to stochastic fluctuations (‘noise’) and hence gene expression variation across the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larson et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, dynamic interactions between upstream regulators and chromatin add another level of complexity to the molecular events occurring during transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McNally et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darzacq et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ong et al., 2010</xref>). Under such conditions, the observed dose response does not result solely from ligand-binding but rather the composite result derived from many coupled reactions. In summary, population models of gene activation are too coarse to explain activation in single cells. Moreover, tools do not exist whereby the activity of single genes in single cells can be directly manipulated and measured.</p><p>In this work, we describe an approach for activating a steroid-receptor in order to achieve high temporal and spatial precision and to measure the activity of a responsive gene in the same cell over time. In contrast to the ensemble approach derived from observations of cell populations, we have developed a single-molecule kinetic approach for interrogation of a single gene. This approach is based on photoactivation of a steroid receptor ligand followed by observation of pre-mRNA synthesis at an active locus. The system consists of an exogenous reporter gene under control of the ecdysone receptor which is activated by the agonist ponasterone A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">No et al., 1996</xref>). The real-time behavior of the gene is visualized using a bacteriophage capsid protein which binds MS2 RNA stem loops with high affinity to label nascent pre-mRNA in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertrand et al., 1998</xref>). We demonstrate experimentally how the ensemble steroid dose response arises from the stochastic behavior of individual genes. These results suggest that the response element controls the <italic>frequency</italic> of gene activity but affects neither the <italic>duration</italic> of the active period nor the actual <italic>rate</italic> of transcripts produced during an active period. By using a caged ligand that could be uncaged by a light pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2002</xref>) we measured the impulse-response of the gene and determined that a single pulse of active ligand resulted in a corresponding burst of polymerase activity several hours later. Further, this photoactivatable ligand has the property of being an <italic>antagonist</italic> in the caged state and an <italic>agonist</italic> in the uncaged state, enabling a precise window for kinetic perturbation in single cells. Thus, we were able to propose and validate a stochastic model of steroid-receptor activity for a reporter gene which provides a new framework for studying this ubiquitous mechanism of eukaryotic gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We sought to design a reporter system that would enable visualization of multiple steps in gene expression: 1) the nascent pre-mRNA as it is synthesized by RNA polymerase II at an activated locus, 2) the completed mRNA in the cytoplasm and 3) the protein product produced from the mRNA. Furthermore, we desired a gene that would be unresponsive to endogenous steroid receptor (SR) ligands but also recapitulate the basic mechanism of SR transcriptional regulation. For these reasons, we chose to reconstitute ecdysone receptor-mediated transcription in human U2-OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">No et al., 1996</xref>). We first introduced a chimeric ecdysone receptor into the cells and subcloned a cell line which showed a strong response of a luciferase reporter. We next introduced an ecdysone-responsive reporter gene. The gene consists of a multimerized E/GRE response element (hybrid ecdysone/glucorticoid response element) in front of an Sp1 activator and a minimal heat shock promoter (mHSP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">No et al., 1996</xref>). The coding region is bi-cistronic with the upstream region coding for CFP with a C-terminal SKL amino acid peroxisome-targeting motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janicki et al., 2004</xref>), and the downstream region coding for DsRED expressed in the cytosol from an IRES. Located in the 3′ UTR of the upstream cistron are 24 MS2 stem loops. The entire construct is 7.1 kb in length and is stably infected into the target U2-OS cells using lentiviral vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mostoslavsky et al., 2006</xref>). Infections were carried out at MOI = 0.1 to obtain cells enriched for single integrations, and multiple clones were isolated and expanded for further analysis. The MS2 RNA stem loops are bound by the high affinity bacteriophage MS2 capsid protein dimer, where each monomer is labeled with YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertrand et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chao et al., 2008</xref>). Since the MS2-YFP is constitutively expressed and localized to the nucleus with an NLS, as soon as the RNA stem-loops are transcribed at an active locus, the MS2-YFP protein binds, thus making the transcription site (TS) visible in the microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, white arrow). The mature mRNAs carry the bound fluorescent proteins into the cytoplasm and are visible in the microscope as punctuate diffraction-limited fluorescent spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, green, inset) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shav-Tal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mor et al., 2010</xref>). The translated protein is targeted to peroxisomes which are likewise visible as punctuate diffraction-limited fluorescent spots consisting of many copies of the CFP-SKL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, blue). Therefore, the reporter gene provides a live cell fluorescence readout that reflects both the history of the gene (total amount of mRNA and protein) and the current state of the gene (presence of the active transcription site).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00750.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reporter gene design enables observation of multiple steps in gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The reporter gene consists of a SR response element multimerized 85 ×, upstream of the transcription start site. The gene is a bi-cistronic construct introduced via lentivirus infection. The first ORF codes for CFP-SKL which results in CFP-labeled peroxisomes, and the second ORF codes for DsRED which is non-specifically expressed in the cytosol. In the 3′ UTR of the CFP-SKL cistron, there is a 24 × MS2 stem-loop encoding region. mRNA is drawn to scale.

In this case, we hybridize a fluorescently labeled 20-mer oligodeoxynucleotide to the region between each MS2 RNA stem loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Femino et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>). FISH is a complementary approach to the live-cell MS2 system and likewise enables direct observation of both nascent RNA at an active transcription site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, white arrow) and total cellular reporter mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, inset). The benefit of FISH is that it allows very high signal to noise observation of mRNA in fixed cells, while the advantage of the MS2 system is that one can directly observe dynamics in living cells. Both approaches utilize the polymeric nature of mRNA to label single molecules with large numbers (&gt;40) of fluorophores, and both approaches enable quantification of the earliest steps in gene expression on single molecules, single genes and in single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larson et al., 2009</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Direct measurement of transcriptional bursting on single genes in human cells</title><p>First, we directly observed RNA synthesis at an active locus in a clonal cell line using single-molecule live-cell microscopy. Consistent with previous studies which directly observe transcriptional activity of single genes in eukaryotes we observed transcriptional bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chubb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stevense et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yunger et al., 2010</xref>). We then measured the bursting dynamics in the microscope for three different concentrations of the steroid Ponasterone A (PA) (3.125 μM, 12.5 μM, 50 μM, control: 0.0 μM), which is the high affinity ligand for the chimeric ecdysone receptor. An example time series is shown for 50 μM PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2 media3 media4 media5">Videos 1–5</xref>). The first transcription sites were visible several hours after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). At steady state (24 hr after induction) for each dose, single gene transcription sites were captured at 15 min intervals for ∼ 15 hr, resulting in representative transcription intensity traces shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref> (red, green lines, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). As is evident from the images and the intensity analysis, individual cells show punctuated periods of transcriptional activity. The intensity traces were fit using a two-state hidden Markov model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>, black lines, 50 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, 12.5 μM, 3.125 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee, 2009</xref>), allowing the distribution of on-times and off times to be determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). We observed that the duration of inactivity (off-time) decreased in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, gray bars). However, the duration of transcription activity (the on-time) did not significantly change over the dose response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, black bars). Moreover, the average peak brightness did also not change significantly with [PA] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). In the case of treatment with a vehicle ([PonA] = 0.0 μM), occasional spurious spots are detected by the tracking algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, 0.0 μM, black bar), and the off-time is statistically indistinguishable from the duration of the entire time-lapse video (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2I</xref>, 0.0 μM, gray bar, compared to red-dashed line). Since the brightness of the nascent RNA signal reflects the number of individual RNA at the site of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larson et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), these data indicate the average number of polymerases which fire during an active period is insensitive to [PA]. This live-cell analysis was also repeated for an additional clone with equivalent results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and below). In summary, direct measurements of transcription activity suggest that changing steroid levels affects the frequency of active periods but neither the duration of the active period nor the number of polymerases fired during the active period. Even for this highly-induced artificial reporter gene, the gene is active approximately 50% of the time at saturation (average on time = 38 ± 6 min; average off time = 35 ± 4 min) and shows a total gene cycling time of approximately 80 min.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00750.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dynamic observation of integrated reporter genes shows transcriptional bursting.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) Time-lapse images of active transcription in two separate nuclei.

We used the ‘Random Telegraph model’, which is a paradigm for stochastic transcription and quantitatively describes the distribution of RNA/cell in a variety of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peccoud and Ycart, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larson et al., 2009</xref>). The key feature of this model is the hypothesis that the gene toggles between an active state where transcripts can be synthesized and an inactive state where no transcripts are produced. It is important to note that the gene can be ‘active’ even when no nascent RNA is detected, owing partly to the stochastic initiation events within an active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and partly to the placement of the MS2 cassette in the middle of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The biochemical determinant(s) of this active state is unknown and is likely to vary between genes. Consequently, it is not possible at present to do a direct measurement of the active state. However, the distribution of <italic>total</italic> cellular reporter mRNA reflects the dynamics of this active-inactive switching, so we measured the steady state distribution of total cellular reporter mRNA over a population using single-molecule FISH in fixed cells.</p><p>For each cell line, the variation of total cellular mRNA within a population is indicative of infrequent bursts of transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Golding et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chubb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raj et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voss et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). At low PA induction levels (3.12 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), there is a large heterogeneity of cellular mRNA in the population: some cells contain dozens of mRNAs and others have none. Transcription sites are infrequent. At medium induction levels (12.5 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), most cells contain mRNA, and many are actively transcribing. At high levels of induction (50 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), cells contain a high abundance of mRNA in the cytosol, and most cells show an active transcription site in the nucleus. At each concentration of the steroid, we fit the full distribution of mRNA/cell to the steady-state solution for the random telegraph model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–L</xref>, N = 60 cells at each dose). The steady state distribution function used for fitting is a function of three unitless kinetic parameters (<italic>a/d, b/d, c/d</italic>) corresponding to the rate of activation (a), the rate of inactivation (b), and the rate of firing once the gene is active (c), each normalized by the RNA decay rate, <italic>d</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These parameters correspond to the frequency of bursts, the duration of bursts, and the initiation rate from a burst, respectively.

This correspondence indicates that non-cooperative behavior for the hormone response (<italic>h = 1,</italic> <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) is mathematically equivalent to frequency modulation. In other words, the rate of switching to the active state (<italic>a</italic>) is the only variable which changes with ligand concentration. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–L</xref> we show the distribution of mRNA/cell compared to the theoretical fit arising from the telegraph model as a function of dose. Indeed, these data are consistent with a model where the only variable which varies with dose is the rate of activation (<italic>a</italic>), while the other parameters (<italic>b,c</italic>) are globally fit for the entire dose response for a particular cell line (<italic>b/d</italic> = 1.5, <italic>c/d</italic> =340). When the same analysis is carried out on cell lines with different insertion sites (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), the dose-dependent activation rate (<italic>a</italic>) and the dose-independent inactivation rate (<italic>b</italic>) remain invariant, but the initiation rate (<italic>c</italic>) changes with the cell line. Thus, the absolute number of polymerases loaded during an active period does not depend on steroid level but rather some extrinsic factor such as local chromatin environment or abundance of some component of the core transcriptional machinery. This is evident when comparing the episomal genes, which do not show frequency modulation. In summary, both fixed-cell and live-cell single-molecule measurements are consistent with a model where the steroid is a robust frequency modulator.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Triggering a single activation event in living cells with UV photolysis</title><p>We emphasize that the frequency change observed here is in response to changes in the time-invariant level of steroid.

We therefore examined the dose-dependent induction properties of the reporter gene in the presence and absence of the caged reagent by performing an in vivo competition experiment. First, we confirmed that both forms of the caged PA were inactive by measuring a dose response of the caged ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, the cells were incubated with two different forms of the caged PA (DMNB-PonA and CNB-PonA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). After overnight incubation, the cells were exposed to 25 μM of the active, unmodified PA for 30 min. The cells were then washed and returned to the incubator for 8 hr to allow the buildup of protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). At 100 μM of DMNB-PA, we observed a fivefold reduction in protein levels, indicating that the caged ligand blocks the activity of the active, uncaged form in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, gray, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). When the DMNB-PonA and uncaged PA are present in equimolar amounts, the competition is alleviated, and the protein output from the reporter gene is close to the levels observed in the absence of the caged ligand. Thus, we show that this ligand has the unique property of being an <italic>agonist</italic> in the uncaged state and an <italic>antagonist</italic> in the caged state.</p><p>The benefit of a reagent that can be switched from repressive to activating is that the effect of small amounts of the agonist are suppressed by the presence of the antagonist. Such a feature is especially important for a reagent that is membrane-permeable and might diffuse to neighboring cells in the tissue. Thus, the caged compound has built-in protection against ‘leakiness’ and is capable of acting in a highly localized spatial manner when uncaged. The method of activation, therefore, has to be all or none: the balance between agonist/antagonist must be shifted past a threshold in order for gene activation to occur. A typical experimental design is schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. The nucleus is activated with a UV laser at 349 nm. The above-threshold dose of uncaging light (40 pulses, 100 Hz, 2 J/cm<sup>2</sup> total dose at the sample) is delivered in approximately 400 ms over the area of the nucleus (∼80 μm<sup>2</sup>). Now, all the receptors in the nucleus are active, leading to the initiation of transcription at the single locus. Concurrently, any activating ligand that diffuses away encounters neighboring cells that are in the repressed state due to the presence of the antagonist. Once the activation occurs in the target cell, the diffusion into the cell of unactivated antagonist coupled with the rapid turnover of receptor-bound agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stavreva et al., 2004</xref>) results in antagonist-bound receptors that bind to the response element and repress transcription.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00750.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Photoactivation of single genes in vivo relates agonist kinetics to transcription dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic uncaging experiment in tissue culture. The target cell is photolyzed with a laser that has the physical dimensions of a single nucleus (dotted circle). The transcription site in that cell becomes active, but transcription sites in neighboring cells are still repressed due to the antagonistic effects of caged PA.

By contrast, the two non-photolyzed neighboring cells show no evidence of CFP expression. The photolysis protocol above results in: 1) an average 106 +/− 36 min between uncaging and the appearance of a transcription site which then persisted for 35 +/− 12 min, 2) 40% success rate for protein expression, and 3) a single on-state in 70% of those cells which activated, with the remainder showing either no detectable on-period (13%) or multiple periods (17%) (N = 30).

By a variety of approaches, we show that the frequency of initiation is the variable that determines RNA levels, but only when the gene is integrated into the chromatin. By measuring the synthesis of pre-mRNA directly, we connected the dynamics of the gene with the availability of an upstream transcription factor, the ligand-bound steroid receptor. We demonstrated how steroid receptors, which are present in all metazoans, can control transcription through frequency modulation. This digital frequency modulation of transcription in single cells manifests as an analog dose response in cellular mRNA and protein in a population. Importantly, the ability to activate the transcription factor (steroid receptor) using light provided a precise temporal start to measure the time needed for the gene to respond, an unexpectedly long time (2 hr). Hence our observations clarify the mechanics behind these observations and extend the understanding to the intrinsic cycling on and off for a gene. One dose of a transcription factor yields one cycle of transcription.</p><p>The precise timing of the transcriptional response places constraints on the regulation of the gene: one can infer regulatory principles based on the observed synthesis of pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pedraza and Paulsson, 2008</xref>). A stochastic model of kinetic rates allowed us to break down the steroid transcriptional response into distinct processes, which could be measured independently in the microscope. Although a number of studies have inferred transcriptional bursting by measuring events which are downstream of transcription, such as cellular RNA or protein production, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blake et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raser and O’Shea, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becskei et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-Even et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Newman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raj et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batenchuk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skupsky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">So et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suter et al., 2011</xref>), we are able to unambiguously resolve the properties of individual bursts and relate these measured kinetic steps to steroid abundance. For this ecdysteroid-responsive reporter gene in mammalian cells, the time between on-states decreased at higher doses of PA. The duration of the active state and the transcription rate from the active state were invariant. However, the ‘on’ times and ‘off’ times were both exponentially distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>), which suggested that both processes were determined by a single rate-limiting step. The simplest biochemical model to explain this result is that the state of the gene is determined entirely by the on rate and off rate of the active ligand-receptor complex from the response element. The corollary to this model is that the actual transcription rate (<italic>c</italic>) from the active state is determined by factors other than the response element. For example the ability of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors to access <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences in the core promoter may determine the firing rate from the active state. In agreement with this supposition, the dynamic frequency modulation by the steroid was invariant with the insertion site, but the transcription rate varied over fivefold with insertion site. In this way, genetic regulation can be conceptualized as the superposition of individual parts, with distal enhancers and response elements controlling frequency of activation and proximal promoters determining the firing rate. Future experiments will be able to directly test this hypothesis using further development of the single-molecule approaches described here.</p><p>This simple model must address the fact that the exchange rate of SRs on chromatin has been observed to be extremely dynamic. Fluorescence photobleaching recovery measurements on tandem gene arrays in single cells record dwell times on the order of seconds to minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darzacq et al., 2009</xref>), while the duration of the active transcriptional state in this study is on the order of an hour. One possibility is that SR binding is actually much longer, and FRAP data on arrays is dominated by non-specific interactions and is not capable of detecting the small percentage of receptors which might be stably bound. Another possibility is that SR binding is in fact short-lived but initiates a cascade of events involved in activation of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herschlag and Johnson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hager et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Metivier et al., 2006</xref>). In support of this latter view, we observe that there was a delay between photoactivation of the ligand and the appearance of the first transcription sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This delay was comparable in size to the average duration of the off period. In contrast, a non-chromatinized or weakly chromatinized template showed extremely rapid induction (&lt;20 min). It is plausible that chromatin remodeling is inefficient at this reporter gene, possibly because the promoter lacks <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements which might aid in a more rapid chromatin remodeling response. Taken together, these results support the notion that opening of chromatin interposes a delay between the docking of active ligand-receptor complex on the response element and the eventual synthesis of pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janicki et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The synergy between DNA binding factors and chromatin modifying proteins is essential for control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Segal and Widom, 2009</xref>), and the role of chromatin in a bimodal model of gene regulation has been proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Archer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Croce et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, recent evidence points strongly toward chromatin as directly controlling the duration of the on and off states. Histone methylation has been implicated in the transmission of transcriptional frequency between mother and daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muramoto et al., 2010</xref>). Manipulation of histone acetylation changes transcriptional cycle timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suter et al., 2011</xref>). Histone deacetylases and nucleosome-remodeling complexes are cyclically recruited during transcriptional activation of an estrogen-responsive gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Métivier et al., 2003</xref>). Importantly, FRAP studies on histones and genome-wide pulse-chase measurements on histones suggest a timescale of turnover (∼hour) that is more consistent with the time scales of transcriptional activity observed in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kimura and Cook, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dion et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deal et al., 2010</xref>). The bimodal ‘telegraph’ model is likely a simplification of the number of biological steps involved in gene activation, but the quantitative agreement between this model and our data suggests that at steady state, the requirements for re-activating a gene that has cycled off may depend on only a few rate-limiting steps.</p><p>In summary, we have described a comprehensive approach for unraveling the dynamic behavior of genetic control in single cells. By using a combination of nascent RNA visualization, single molecule microscopy, computational modeling, and light activation, we were able to construct a quantitative model of steroid-receptor mediated activation in which SRs control the frequency of the transition to an active transcriptional state in a dose-dependent manner. This model is based on a stochastic, kinetic description that reflects the molecular events occurring in single-cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of ponasterone responsive cell lines</title><p>The chimeric ecdysone receptor (pERV3, Stratagene, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) was introduced into U2-OS cells by nucleofection (Amaxa, Lonza, Allendale, NJ), and stable insertions were selected by screening for G418 resistance followed by isolation of single colonies.

The system consists of an X-Cite 120 PC light source (EXFO, Mississauga, Canada) for imaging, an Explorer 339 nm pulsed laser for photolysis (Newport, Santa Clara, CA), and ASI shutters and automated stage (Applied Scientific Instrumentation). The laser is capable of operating from single-shot to 1 kHz at 120 μJ/pulse. All data was acquired at 37°C using a Delta T stage incubator and objective heater (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). The UV and visible excitation were focused through a U-Apo 40 × 1.35 NA oil lens, and the emission was collected through the same objective. Excitation, emission, and dichroic optics were custom designed for simultaneous UV and visible excitation (Chroma). The microscope was controlled by IPLab (BioVision, Exton, PA), and images were acquired on an Orca R2 CCD (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu, Japan).</p><p>Time-lapse images of active transcription were analyzed using previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larson et al., 2011</xref>). First, nuclei are segmented and individual cell videos are separated out from the raw data. The intermediate which results is a time-lapse image stack where the fluorescent nucleus is always centered in the frame (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). Next, the diffraction-limited spots are fit using a Gaussian mask algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thompson et al., 2002</xref>) to generate a list of positions. The complete time-dependent trajectories were then constructed using a tracking algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crocker and Grier, 1996</xref>). We used a Hidden Markov Model fitting algorithm taken directly from Lee et al. to analyze the resulting intensity traces and extract the duration of active and inactive states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee, 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the Transcription Imaging Group at the Janelia Farm Research Campus of the HHMI and helpful discussions with Gordon Hager and Aviv Bergman.

The Editor-in-Chief, a Senior Editor, a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors, and two expert reviewers have assessed your work.</p><p>We have some interest in the publication of this work, but there are several key issues that need to be addressed before we can proceed further. We therefore ask whether you would be willing to respond to the specific points below.</p><p>1) The reviewers appreciated the novelty of the use of a next-generation system for the analysis of steroid receptor-mediated activation at the single cell/single reporter/single molecule level. It was also felt, however, that in spite of the technical novelty the main conclusions of this work mostly confirmed previous observations indicating that the on-off states are digital in nature.

Several examples are as follows:</p><p>a. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2I and 2J</xref>. It is necessary to show the data with 0 micromolar PA. This is the baseline control.</p><p>b. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The authors conclude that local chromosomal environment affects initiation rates by comparing different clonal cell lines that accrue different amounts of total labeled construct mRNA. Were analyses, such as those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–J</xref>, carried out for each clonal cell line to confirm for each the dose-dependent off-time and dose-independent on-time? (It is not apparent if <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows data from one clonal cell line or the averages of all three clonal lines.)</p><p>c.

It was also felt, however, that, in spite of the technical novelty, the main conclusions of this work mostly confirmed previous observations indicating that the on-off states are digital in nature. We therefore ask if the authors could clarify the novelty of their findings in the context of prior knowledge</italic>.</p><p>We point out that it is likely that <italic>all</italic> metazoan genes are transcribed by bursts of transcription, meaning that short periods of RNA synthesis are interspersed by long periods of inactivity. The causes of transcriptional bursting are unknown, but this ubiquitous phenomenon has profound consequences for development, differentiation, and disease progression. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of gene regulation in vivo requires understanding how <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-acting elements work in concert to modulate properties of the gene burst. With the exception of one other study that observed single gene bursting directly (Yunger, et al. (2010)), all other studies in mammalian cells are based on measuring protein distributions and inferring transcriptional activity. While such studies have been informative, they depend on numerous assumptions about RNA export, translation, RNA decay, proteolysis, etc. Such an approach would not have revealed the phenomena we observed in our work. In this study, we have shown that steroid receptors, which are present in all metazoans and are also the target of a billion dollar pharmaceutical industry, have a mechanism of action in vivo (frequency modulation) that is at odds with the standard pharmacological description of the last 60 years. This advance in basic biological understanding is concomitant with technical advances such as development of a true opto-genetic method for uncaging single genes and the ability to monitor single genes for hours in vivo. We believe this work establishes a template for understanding gene regulation at the cellular and molecular level. In the revised manuscript, we have made a more strenuous effort to emphasize the novelty of the approach and the findings.</p><p><italic>2) There is missing information that is needed to understand the results.

Under these conditions, we also do not see transcription sites, either by fixed-cell FISH or live-cell imaging.</p><p><italic>b.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>.

We have clarified this in the text. In the original version, subsequent cell lines were only analyzed by FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), demonstrating the insertion effects on transcription dynamics. We have since repeated the live-cell analysis for another clone and observed the same frequency modulation behavior.</p><p><italic>c. The cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig6">Figures 3 and 6</xref> look sick. In particular, the nuclear blebbing and irregularly shaped nuclei are indicative of apoptosis. This needs to be examined carefully as it could alter the interpretation of the data</italic>.</p><p>We have chosen different cells for the figures and videos where necessary so as to avoid any confusion on this matter. In addition, we have added data showing the export of RNA into the cytosol along with cell division to demonstrate that these cells are healthy, dividing cells (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>).</p><p><italic>d.

Labeling with</italic> <bold>γ</bold><italic>-H2A.X must be done +/- uncaging to be sure that the observed results are not influenced by DNA damage</italic>.</p><p>We share the reviewers’ concern about potential DNA damage. However, to see <bold>γ</bold>-H2A.X staining requires a dose of 60 J/cm<sup>2</sup> UVA (Wischermann, et al. (2008)). Our dose is 2 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is an order of magnitude below that threshold. We have added that information to the main text and the Materials and methods. We have also included a time-series of cell division after uncaging (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref>) that we think is a more functional phenotype for cell viability after UV exposure.</p><p><italic>e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. It appears that the authors presume that the PA that is released upon UV treatment exists only transiently because it becomes blocked by an excess of caged PA. Is this what the authors mean to suggest? If so, can they prove this point</italic>?</p><p>We have added an additional experiment to show that upon addition of caged PA to an actively transcribing sample, transcription sites disappear over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p><italic>f. Can the authors confirm that there is only one transcription site per cell? Is this single transcription site stably maintained through multiple generations</italic>?</p><p>It is certainly possible that lentiviral infection would result in multiple insertions in different parts of the genome. We performed infection at MOI &lt;1, resulting most often in 1 or 0 integrations per cell. However, in some of our subclones we do see multiple integrations. For the cell lines we sub-cloned and analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2 and 4</xref>, we never observed more than one transcription site per cell, as indicated in the data we present in the paper. Since lentiviral infection is a standard technique that results in genomic integration, we have no reason to suspect that the reporter gene is not stable. Indeed, we can passage cells dozens of times without seeing any change in the microscope.</p><p><italic>3) There is also an issue with the Random Telegraph model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, is the x-axis equal to time? If so, wouldn't (a) and (b) be times rather than rates? Also, would the fraction of time in the active state be equal to (b)/(b)+(a)? Please clarify the formulas as well as the use of the terms “rate” vs. “time” in this section</italic>.</p><p>We have clarified the text and the figure on these points. a, b, c are rates. 1/a, 1/b, 1/c are times.</p><p><italic>4) It is unclear why the first transcription sites are only visible several hours after induction. Opening of chromatin of a single copy gene should not impose such a large delay between docking of the active ligand-receptor complex and subsequent RNA synthesis. Is this a result of the complexity of the reporter system? How well does this reflect the induction of endogenous steroid regulated genes? This can be easily tested by in situ hybridization</italic>.</p><p>Since there are no other published examples of steroid response following a brief burst of ligand (as we achieve with uncaging), there is no reference point to which we can compare our results. Most studies look at the time response to a step increase in ligand concentration, where there is continuous availability of the ligand. With that caveat in mind, we agree with the referees that the long time lag is intriguing, especially since there is essentially no time lag for a transfected reporter. These data suggest that chromatin remodeling is perhaps inefficient at the reporter. It is possible that these exogenous <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in the reporter lack features that aid in the rapid chromatin remodeling response for an endogenous steroid responsive gene. We have added several sentences to the Discussion to address this point. Building a reporter from the bottom up that recapitulates the rapid steroid response after uncaging is likely to yield fundamental insight. Such experiments are in progress but are beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>As for endogenous steroid responsive genes, the comparison is difficult. To our knowledge, there are no genes in mammalian cells that respond to ecdysteroids.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.
