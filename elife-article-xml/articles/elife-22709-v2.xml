trachomatis</italic> is an obligate intracellular pathogen that resides in a membrane-bound compartment, the inclusion. The bacteria secrete a unique class of proteins, Incs, which insert into the inclusion membrane and modulate the host-bacterium interface. We previously reported that IncE binds specifically to the Sorting Nexin 5 Phox domain (SNX5-PX) and disrupts retromer trafficking. Here, we present the crystal structure of the SNX5-PX:IncE complex, showing IncE bound to a unique and highly conserved hydrophobic groove on SNX5. Mutagenesis of the SNX5-PX:IncE binding surface disrupts a previously unsuspected interaction between SNX5 and the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). Addition of IncE peptide inhibits the interaction of CI-MPR with SNX5. Finally, <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection interferes with the SNX5:CI-MPR interaction, suggesting that IncE and CI-MPR are dependent on the same binding surface on SNX5. Our results provide new insights into retromer assembly and underscore the power of using pathogens to discover disease-related cell biology.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22709.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22709.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic></kwd><kwd>retromer</kwd><kwd>sorting nexin</kwd><kwd>bacterial pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>mannose-6-phosphate receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08AI091656</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenberg</surname><given-names>Oren S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI073770</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Joanne N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI105561</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Joanne N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure of a pathogen effector complexed to Sorting Nexin 5 reveals an evolutionarily conserved interface that is required for retromer-dependent host restriction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Chlamydia</italic> species are obligate intracellular pathogens that are important causes of human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mandell et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease and a leading cause of preventable infertility in the western world. Infections by <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> also lead to blinding trachoma, the major cause of non-congenital blindness in developing nations. Understanding the pathogenesis of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infections is critical to the development of a successful vaccine, which remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rey-Ladino et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>All <italic>Chlamydia</italic> species share a common intracellular developmental cycle in which they alternate between an infectious, spore-like elementary body (EB), and a non-infectious, metabolically active reticulate body (RB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastidas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elwell et al., 2016</xref>). Upon entry into non-phagocytic cells, the EB resides within a membrane-bound compartment—the inclusion—and quickly diverges from the canonical endo-lysosomal pathway. The EB differentiates into an RB and bacterial cell division commences. After replicating within the ever-enlarging inclusion over a 24–72 hr time period, the RB differentiates back to an EB. Mature EBs are released by host cell lysis or through an active extrusion process, ready to infect neighboring cells.</p><p>As obligate intracellular pathogens, <italic>Chlamydiae</italic> are absolutely reliant on altering host cell trafficking to scavenge nutrients while avoiding lysosomal fusion and recognition by the host innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastidas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elwell et al., 2016</xref>). The <italic>Chlamydia</italic> inclusion maintains an intimate interaction with multiple host cell compartments and organelles, including the Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, endosomes, and lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastidas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elwell et al., 2016</xref>). However, the <italic>Chlamydia</italic> factors and host cell proteins that mediate these interactions are largely unknown. Likely bacterial candidates include the inclusion membrane proteins (Incs), a group of proteins that are unique to <italic>Chlamydiales</italic> and that are translocated from the bacteria through the Type III secretion system (T3SS) and inserted into the inclusion membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moore and Ouellette, 2014</xref>). These proteins encode one or more bilobed hydrophobic domains composed of two closely spaced membrane-spanning domains, ~30 amino acids each, typically separated by a short loop region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bannantine et al., 2000</xref>). Once inserted into the inclusion membrane, the Inc N- and C-terminal domains extend into the host cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rockey et al., 2002</xref>) and are thus ideally poised to modulate interactions at the host-pathogen interface.</p><p>Until recently, the host targets of only a few Incs had been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moore and Ouellette, 2014</xref>). We used high-throughput affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to globally define the Inc-human protein interactome and identified putative binding partners for 38/58 of the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> Incs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>). One of the most robust interactions was between IncE, an early expressed Inc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scidmore-Carlson et al., 1999</xref>), and a subset of retromer components. The retromer is a phylogenetically conserved multi-subunit complex that mediates retrograde transport of transmembrane protein cargo, such as the well-studied cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), from endosomes to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu, 2016</xref>]). Retromer is composed of two distinct sub-complexes of tightly assembled subunits: a cargo recognition trimer (VPS26/29/35) and a membrane deforming heterodimer made up of sorting nexin (SNX) SNX1 or SNX2 paired with either SNX5 or SNX6. In mammals, as opposed to yeast, the association between the VPS trimer and the SNX sub-complexes is transient. The individual SNX1/2/5/6 proteins encode a Phox-homology (PX) domain that recognizes and binds to specific phosphoinositides on membranes and a Bin-amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain that both senses and induces membrane curvature. These SNX-BAR proteins facilitate formation of tubules into which the cargo receptors are sorted. We recently discovered that <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> IncE binds directly to the PX domains of SNX5/6 but not SNX1/2 and that IncE is sufficient to disrupt retromer-dependent trafficking of CI-MPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, we and others found that SNX-BAR proteins relocalize from endosomes to the inclusion membrane during <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection and that depletion of SNX5/6 enhances <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aeberhard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings suggest that IncE binding to SNX5/6 redirects SNX1/2/5/6 away from their normal functional location and thereby limits the ability of retromer to control <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>). However, the molecular details by which IncE binds to the SNX5/6-PX domain are unknown; for example, does IncE binding form a novel interface, and does IncE displace a normal host binding partner? The mechanistic implications of this interaction are critical to our understanding of retromer function in pathogenesis.</p><p>In this work, we solved a high-resolution co-crystal structure of the C-terminus of IncE bound to the PX domain of SNX5. We demonstrate that IncE binds to a previously unappreciated highly conserved hydrophobic groove in the SNX5-PX domain and that the binding site is distinct from the SNX5 phosphoinositide-binding site. Using quantitative AP-MS of wild type (WT) SNX5 and SNX5 mutated in key conserved residues in the hydrophobic groove, we identified an unsuspected interaction between SNX5-PX and CI-MPR. Together with direct biochemical assays and in vivo infection assays, we demonstrate that IncE disrupts the SNX5-PX:CI-MPR interaction to alter retromer-dependent trafficking. Modulation of retromer trafficking by this intracellular pathogen may facilitate its ability to survive within the hostile intracellular environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The structure of the SNX5-PX<sub><bold>20-180</bold></sub>:IncE<sub>108-132</sub> complex</title><p>To uncover the molecular basis for the strong interaction between IncE and SNX5 and to illuminate the biological function of this interaction, we determined the crystal structure of the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> SNX5-PX domain (SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub>) bound to the C-terminal 25 amino acids of IncE (IncE<sub>108-132</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement at a resolution of 2.31 Å, using the SNX5-PX apo-structure as a model (PDB ID 3HPC) ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koharudin et al., 2009</xref>] and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The structure contained four copies of the SNX5-PX:IncE complex in the asymmetric unit, which are all less than 0.41 Å RMSD between the molecules and do not appear different in conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The discussion below refers to SNX5-PX chain A and its associated IncE (chain P) of the structure but could apply to any of the other chains. Inspection of <italic>F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub></italic> maps indicated strong electron density in the structure that was absent in the 3HPC model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using bulky hydrophobic residues as a guide, we were able to unambiguously place the IncE<sub>108-132</sub> peptide into the density, although amino acids 108–110 and 132 were disordered in the crystal and could not be built. The final model of the complex (R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> 20.32/26.00) showed that IncE<sub>108-132</sub> forms a β-hairpin that does not appear to be externally stabilized by its interaction with the PX domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When compared to the apo-SNX5-PX structure (PDB ID 3HPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koharudin et al., 2009</xref>]), IncE<sub>108-132</sub> was found to bind in a deep, hydrophobic groove that is approximately 10 Å x 18 Å in area running perpendicular to the long axis of the SNX5-PX domain. SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> is a mixed α-β structure with three antiparallel β-sheets running along the surface of a long α-helix (α3) stabilized by two shorter helices. Two of the helices extend past the end of the β-sheets to form a long α-helical hairpin not seen in the crystal structures of other SNX-PX domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koharudin et al., 2009</xref>). In the SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub>:IncE<sub>108-132</sub> structure, the SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> β-sheet is completed by the IncE<sub>108-132</sub> β-hairpin, which binds on the surface of the α-helical hairpin in the hydrophobic groove, hydrogen bonding with the SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> β-sheet to form a hybrid, five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Outside of this β-sheet formation, the structure of SNX5 complexed with IncE<sub>108-132</sub> is notable for its almost complete lack of hydrogen bonding or ionic charge-charge interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), relying instead on the formation of a small hydrophobic core at the interface of the two proteins. This core buries five residues at the interface: Y132, L133 and F136 from SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> and V114 and F116 from IncE<sub>108-132</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22709.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IncE binds in a hydrophobic groove on SNX5-PX, extending the SNX5-PX β-sheet.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The structure of SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> (green) bound to IncE<sub>108-132</sub> (gold).

The changes between the apo-SNX5-PX structure and the IncE<sub>108-132</sub> bound SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> structure are small and consist mainly of an inward rotation of the SNX5 α-helical hairpin ~30° toward the IncE peptide. This region appears to be quite flexible as it has the highest B-factors in both the apo- and IncE-bound structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koharudin et al., 2009</xref>).

IncE<sub>108-132</sub> does not bind at this BAR domain interface, and the BAR domain interface does not appear to be significantly altered by binding of IncE. Although SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> exhibits a unique structure that differs from other PX proteins, the regions that distinguish the SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> structure are distant from the BAR domain interaction site.

This conservation was observed even in the most distantly related sequence we analyzed, SNX6 from <italic>Trichinella spiralis</italic>, which shows overall identity of only 49%. This region of conservation in the SNX5/6/32 family extends outside of the hydrophobic groove that binds to IncE and includes several solvent exposed residues, including K138 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, these residues are absent in other SNX-BAR proteins including SNX1 and SNX2, as has been previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koharudin et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the residues lining the SNX5 hydrophobic groove are not involved in the core folding of the SNX5/6/32-PX domain. These residues are solvent exposed in the unbound crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koharudin et al., 2009</xref>), and yet they are identical throughout metazoan evolution, implying an essential function.

We have previously shown that the C-terminus of IncE binds directly to the PX domain of the retromer components SNX5 and SNX6, but fails to bind to the closely related SNX1-PX and SNX2-PX domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>). By solving the crystal structure of the IncE-C-terminus in complex with the SNX5-PX domain, we demonstrate that IncE binds to a hydrophobic groove that is highly conserved among SNX5/6/32 homologs but absent in SNX1/2 homologs, thus explaining the exquisite specificity of the IncE:SNX interaction. The high conservation of this SNX5/6/32 hydrophobic groove further suggests that IncE may be displacing or mimicking a host binding partner that is essential for host function. We therefore employed an unbiased quantitative AP-MS approach to identify host proteins whose interaction with SNX5-containing complexes was dependent upon an intact IncE binding surface. Unexpectedly, this analysis identified the CI-MPR, the most well-characterized transmembrane receptor sorted by the mammalian retromer. We confirmed in vivo that CI-MPR co-immunoprecipitates with ectopically-produced SNX5 and that co-immunoprecipitation is diminished in the IncE binding surface mutants. An IncE peptide corresponding to residues 108–132 inhibited binding of the CI-MPR to affinity-purified SNX5-containing complexes, whereas a mutant peptide altered in the predicted SNX5 binding residues was without effect. Finally, we demonstrate that <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection disrupts the association of CI-MPR with SNX5-associated complexes and that the SNX5 hydrophobic groove is required for its interaction with the inclusion. We conclude that the highly conserved IncE binding surface on SNX5 is required for its interaction with the CI-MPR. Based on our results, we favor the hypothesis that during <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection, inclusion-localized IncE displaces a lower affinity SNX5:CI-MPR interaction. From these studies, we can mechanistically link IncE to <italic>Chlamydia-</italic>mediated disruption of retromer trafficking, and thereby illuminate a new mechanism by which a vacuolar pathogen avoids retromer-mediated restriction of its intracellular developmental cycle.</p><p>Our most striking and unexpected result is that the conserved IncE binding surface on SNX5 was required for the association of the CI-MPR with retromer, as this membrane receptor is thought to interact with retromer through VPS35, which in turn interacts with SNX1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arighi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rojas et al., 2007</xref>). Prior to solving the co-crystal structure, we predicted that IncE binding to SNX5 would affect the interaction of SNX5 with its known binding partners, SNX1/2 BAR domains or phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cullen and Carlton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seaman, 2012</xref>). However, our structure revealed no major conformational changes in the PX domain or the BAR domain-interacting surface. This finding is consistent with our observation that IncE peptide does not interfere with SNX5 binding to immobilized phospholipids or to SNX1. Our studies thus identify a previously unrecognized and functionally important surface of SNX5 that may provide an additional level of cargo specificity during retrieval of CI-MPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The requirement of the hydrophobic groove in SNX5:CI-MPR interactions may be explained by several models. CI-MPR, and perhaps other retromer cargo, may bind directly to this site, which could serve as an additional low-affinity binding site for CI-MPR or CI-MPR may be sequentially transferred to SNX5 once it has been selected for retrieval by VPS. Alternatively, retromer cargo binding to SNX5 may be indirect, mediated by one or more additional protein(s). Finally, the hydrophobic binding groove could contribute to SNX5 association with membranes that contain the CI-MPR, leading to co-purification of the two proteins. Work is ongoing to differentiate these models.</p><p>Our work adds to our understanding of how intracellular pathogens modulate the retromer. Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Human Papilloma Virus, <italic>Coxiella burnetii,</italic> and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> require retromer function for efficient intracellular survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bujny et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groppelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lipovsky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McDonough et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Personnic et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> infection inhibits retromer function through a secreted effector, RidL, which binds to VPS29 and PI(3)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finsel et al., 2013</xref>). Our results provide important mechanistic insights as to how <italic>Chlamydia</italic> interferes with host cell trafficking pathways and provide possible explanations for the intriguing result that depletion of SNX5/6 during <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection leads to increased infectious progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aeberhard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>). CI-MPR plays a role inlysosomal function by virtue of its ability to transport newly synthesized acid hydrolase precursors from the TGN to endosomes for eventual delivery to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonifacino and Hurley, 2008</xref>). RNAi-mediated depletion of retromer components prevents retrieval of acid hydrolase receptors to the TGN and results in their missorting to lysosomes and eventual degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arighi et al., 2004</xref>). Mislocalization of CI-MPR also causes mistrafficking of Niemann-Pick Disease Type C2 Protein (NPC2), resulting in cholesterol accumulation in the late endosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marquer et al., 2016</xref>). During <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection, disruption of CI-MPR association with SNX5 may perturb retromer-dependent receptor recycling, which could disrupt lysosomal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Riederer et al., 1994</xref>). The role of lysosomes in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection remains incompletely understood; <italic>Chlamydia</italic> avoids fusion with lysosomes but may utilize them as a source of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Al-Younes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heinzen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ouellette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rzomp et al., 2003</xref>). Alternatively, since <italic>Chlamydia</italic> acquires cholesterol from the host and since the <italic>Chlamydia</italic> inclusion maintains an intimate association with late endosomal and lysosomal compartments where cholesterol accumulates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carabeo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elwell et al., 2016</xref>), retromer dysfunction could enhance cholesterol transport to the inclusion. Altogether, our structural studies of IncE binding to the SNX5-PX domain reveal a highly conserved hydrophobic groove on SNX5 that is required for the interaction of the CI-MPR with retromer, a process that can be targeted by pathogens to avoid retromer-mediated host restriction of vacuolar pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Mouse 8xHis-SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> (UniProt Q9D8U8), which is 98% identical to human, was expressed in BL21(DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> cells.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Suzanne R Pfeffer, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Oliver Daumke (Reviewer #2) and Volker Haucke (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The transmembrane protein IncE from Chlamydia is incorporated into a membrane-bound compartment containing the bacteria, the inclusion, with the N- and C-terminal moieties pointing towards the cytosol. In proteomic screens, the authors of this study have previously found that the C-terminal portion of IncE interacts with the PX domain of SNX5, leading to missorting of retromer. In the current study, they report the crystal structure of the IncE-SNX5 complex. IncE forms an antiparallel hairpin structure that binds as an extension of the SNX5-PX domain β-sheet. The authors confirm their structure by mutagenesis and pull-down experiments. They find that the IncE interaction site in the SNX5-PX domain is evolutionary highly conserved, suggesting a conserved cellular function. Using mass spectrometry, they identify the known retromer cargo cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) as binding partner of the SNX5 PX domain. They then show that addition of an IncE peptide, but not of an IncE variant peptide with mutations in the PX domain binding interaction site, disturbs the SNX5-CI-MPR interaction in cell lysates. In the final experiment, they demonstrate that Chlamydia infection interferes with binding of CI-MPR to SNX5.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and easy to follow. It describes the first structural characterization of a Chlamydia Inc protein with its cellular target, therefore elucidating a molecular mechanism how Chlamydia survives in its host environment; it is therefore of general interest to researchers of several disciplines. Most of the experiments are convincing. However, the story would be significantly enhanced by extending the structural and mass spectrometry analyses to better characterize the interaction of Cl<sup>-</sup>MPR with IncE. Given that the CI-MPR cytoplasmic domain is only 163 residues, it should not require much work to synthesize peptides covering that region to determine which residues bind to SNX5, to complete this satisfying and high quality story.</p><p>Structural analyses:</p><p>In the validation report, four SNX5-IncE complexes are mentioned.

Again, some additional figures or clarification will help.</italic> </p><p>In the revised paper, we have provided a new table of results and statistics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The methods we used are also further clarified in the text, as follows:</p><p>“Using SAINT-Express (Teo, 2014), we compared the protein-protein interactions of affinity purified lysates from untransfected cells to those prepared from SNX5<sub>WT</sub>, SNX5<sub>Y132D</sub>, or SNX5<sub>F136D</sub> transfected cells. […] We focused on CI-MPR because it is the most well-studied retromer cargo and because we have previously established that ectopic expression of IncE is sufficient to disrupt CI-MPR trafficking (Mirrashidi, 2015).”</p><p>The legend for the new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> reads:</p><p>“<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>: SNX5 protein-protein interactions and their dependence on the IncE binding groove.[…] Of the proteins found to interact with SNX5<sub>WT</sub>, CI-MPR and IGF1R show a difference in their SAINT score between the WT and the mutants, suggesting that the mutations block the protein-protein interaction.”</p><p><italic>Interaction of CI-MPR with SNX5.</italic></p><p><italic>It is important to demonstrate that the IncE interface in SNX5 is the direct binding site of cargo, such as CI-MPR, which was also reported to bind to the Vps35 subunit (Arighi, JCB 2004). The authors should finish and include their ongoing experiments to find out what is the direct interaction partner of SNX5.</italic> </p><p>We provide strong evidence that CI-MPR and SNX5 interact and that this interaction is disrupted by the binding of SNX5 to IncE, either <italic>in vitro</italic> or with infection. These data are consistent with our earlier finding that overexpression of IncE and subsequent binding of SNX5/6 disrupts normal trafficking of CI-MPR. As the reviewers rightly indicated, our findings do not prove the interaction between CI-MPR and SNX5 is direct. This point is especially important because CI-MPR has been demonstrated to interact with VPS35, another component of the retromer. A direct interaction of CI-MPR and VPS35 has been demonstrated by yeast two hybrid studies. Since SNX5/6 is in the cytosol, we assume that any interaction between SNX5/6, either direct or indirect, would be mediated by the cytosolically exposed C-terminal region of CI-MPR. We have pursed several methods to purify the C-terminus of CI-MPR for use in direct <italic>in vitro</italic> binding studies. First, we purified CI-MPR fused to maltose binding protein (MBP) but unfortunately this construct yielded protein that was likely insoluble and/or improperly folded, making it impossible to interpret binding studies. We then purified CI-MPR fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST), but the yields were low and highly contaminated with free GST from cleavage events. In general, we had significant issues with proteolysis of the CI-MPR.</p><p>We used three different assays with these purified proteins to try to demonstrate a direct interaction between SNX5 and CI-MPR. First, we attempted pulldown experiments using immobilized GST-CI-MPR. As this was not successful possibly due to high background binding, we were concerned this was a weak interaction that was disrupted by the washing steps in the pull-down protocol. Therefore, we took a subtractive approach that did not rely on washing. This also was not successful, despite extensive trouble- shooting. Next, we further purified away as much free GST as possible and bound the GST-CI-MPR to the sensor tip on an Octet. Again, we observed substantial non-specific binding, even in the presence of BSA and detergent. Troubleshooting the technical issues encountered in our binding assays are beyond the scope of this paper. We note that our experimental approach might not have been successful for the additional following reasons:</p><p>1) Binding requires the presence of or is mediated by another protein. This partner is present when we do pull-downs from cells but not detectable by MS;</p><p>2) Binding requires a post-translational modification that is not present in bacterially produced purified protein;</p><p>3) Binding is direct, but our constructs do not contain the correct resides to allow for binding or the correct residues may have been lost due to proteolysis.</p><p>Although we strongly favor the hypothesis that CI-MPR binds directly to the hydrophobic binding domain of SNX5/6, at this time we cannot prove a direct interaction between CI- MPR and SNX5/6. However, we still believe we have made an important and original contribution about the interaction by showing: 1) CI-MPR interacts with SNX5 in a VPS35-independent manner (as shown by western blot and mass spectrometry), 2) Interactions between CI-MPR and SNX5 are dependent on the same hydrophobic groove that is required for direct binding of SNX5/6 to IncE and 3) the interaction between CI-MPR and SNX5 can be competed away by addition of wild type, but not mutant, IncE, both during an affinity purification experiment and in the context of infection, showing that one effect of IncE expression is to delocalize SNX5 from CI-MPR.</p><p><italic>Other comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Some of the key biochemical data are qualitative (dot blots and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Please try to be quantitative wherever possible. We suggest that you remove the dot blots or move them to supplemental because they are not relevant to the main part of your story and are only initial screens of PIP binding capacity and specificity. If included as supplemental, please use tentative wording in terms of interpretation.</italic> </p><p>While we concur that the PIP strip experiment is qualitative, we believe that this data provides important confirmatory data that IncE interacts with a SNX5 surface distinct from the PI binding site. As in our initial submission, this data is provided as supplemental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We have revised the text as follows:</p><p>“In the SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub>:IncE<sub>108-132</sub> crystal structure, we observed no direct interaction between IncE<sub>108-132</sub> and the previously observed PIP binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). […] Together, this data supports the notion that binding of IncE to SNX5-PX does not interfere with SNX5 binding to PIPs.”</p><p>In the Discussion, we have revised the text as follows:</p><p>“However, our structure revealed no major conformational changes in the PX domain or the BAR domain-interacting surface. This finding is consistent with our observation that IncE peptide does not interfere with SNX5 binding to immobilized phospholipids or to SNX1.”</p><p><italic>2) No information is presented on the effect of SNX5 mutations with respect to its localization to endosomes vs. the bacterial inclusion.</italic> </p><p>We have now included a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) in which we compare the localization of transfected FLAG-SNX5WT and SNX5<sub>Y132D,F136D</sub> in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells. Whereas wild type FLAG-SNX5 is robustly recruited to the inclusion, FLAG-SNX5<sub>Y132D,F136D</sub> fails to localize to the inclusion.</p><p>We have edited the text as follows:</p><p>“We previously demonstrated a robust recruitment of full-length FLAG-SNX5<sub>WT</sub> to the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> inclusion and associated tubules (Mirrashidi, 2015). We next determined whether the IncE binding groove is necessary for recruitment of SNX5 to the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> inclusion by analyzing the localization of FLAG-SNX5<sub>Y132D, F136D</sub> during infection. FLAG-SNX5<sub>Y132D,F136D</sub> fails to localize to the inclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), although endogenous SNX6 was still recruited. Together, these data provide further support that IncE interacts with the SNX5 hydrophobic binding groove.”</p><p><italic>3) Based on the model one would expect structural similarity between the CI-MPR tail and IncE. Has this been looked at? Moreover, how do the authors envision competition between IncE and CI-MPR to occur? Is this via mass action due to excessive production of IncE or is the affinity of SNX5 higher for IncE compared to the MPR?</italic> </p><p>The C-terminal tail of CI-MPR is predicted to be “unstructured”, but contains hydrophobic elements that could potentially mimic IncE. Without a direct binding assay or a structural model, it would be highly speculative to comment on the mechanisms of binding between CI-MPR and SNX5.</p></body></sub-article></article>
