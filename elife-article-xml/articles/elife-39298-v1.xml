A fundamental question in plant development is how this tissue patterning is first specified. Recently, we reported evidence in support of a previously proposed hypothesis that dorsoventral leaf patterning is derived from a pre-pattern present in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), where leaves arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hagemann and Gleissberg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Husbands et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kerstetter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Koch and Meinhardt, 1994</xref>). We found that transcription factors that promote dorsal and ventral leaf cell types are expressed in the SAM in a pre-pattern that determines the orientation of the leaves that subsequently form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caggiano et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, we found that the plant hormone auxin promotes dorsal cell fate by maintaining expression of the Class III HD-ZIP transcription factor REVOLUTA (REV) and repressing KANADI1 (KAN1) expression in the adaxial cells of organ primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caggiano et al., 2017</xref>). These findings however contrast with that of another study which concluded that leaf polarity is dependent on an asymmetry in auxin levels within leaf primordia, with relatively low levels of auxin in adaxial cells compared to abaxial cells being critical to maintain dorsal identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Qi et al., 2014</xref>). This conclusion was based in part on the finding that exogenous auxin application to tomato leaf primordia resulted in the formation of radialized leaves that appeared ventralized. Also, it was found that an auxin sensor, the DII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunoud et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vernoux et al., 2011</xref>) indicates low levels of auxin in adaxial leaf tissues compared to abaxial tissues at leaf initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Qi et al., 2014</xref>). Hence asymmetries in auxin concentrations between the adaxial and abaxial tissues in leaf primordia, as a result of PIN1 mediated auxin transport, were proposed to help establish leaf dorsoventral cell type patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Qi et al., 2014</xref>), in contrast to the proposed pre-pattern mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caggiano et al., 2017</xref>). Building further on this conclusion, a more recent study proposed that low levels of auxin in adaxial primordium tissues are necessary to restrict the expression of the WOX1 and PRS genes to the middle domain, since auxin promotes their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Guan et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, the reported asymmetry in auxin has also been linked to asymmetries in the mechanical properties of leaf tissues and their morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Qi et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>In-order to investigate the proposed auxin asymmetry proposal in more detail, we decided to examine the distribution of auxin within initiating leaf primordia using the ratio-metric R2D2 reporter, which acts as a proxy for the cellular sensing of auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liao et al., 2015</xref>). A high DII/mDII ratio indicates relatively low levels of auxin sensing while a high mDII/DII ratio indicates relatively high levels of auxin sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liao et al., 2015</xref>). We first focused on the incipient stages when PIN1 convergence patterns are established, by looking at later forming primordia (third, fourth or fifth) in seedlings 4-5DAS (days after stratification). In general, during these early stages DII/mDII ratios were extremely low in cells coinciding with high levels of PIN1-GFP expression while on either side of these cells, ratios were higher but to a similar degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Previously, by examining PIN1-CFP together with <italic>pREV::REV-2xYPet</italic> and <italic>pKAN1::KAN1-2xGFP</italic> in similarly staged primordia we found that REV expression can coincide with PIN1 at later stages when it expands peripherally but that KAN1 expression is invariably complementary to cells with high PIN1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caggiano et al., 2017</xref>). Overall our observations therefore indicate that KAN1 expression is associated with low auxin sensing cells while REV expression is associated with different levels of auxin sensing depending on the stage of development. We then examined DII/mDII ratios in the leaves after initiation. For this we imaged the first two leaves when they are approximately 4–5 cells long along their proximo-distal axis (3DAS), as well as a day later as they begin to elongate (6–9 cells along the proximo-distal axis; 4DAS) and again included the PIN1-GFP marker in our analysis to correlate cellular auxin sensing with PIN1 expression and polarity. At 3DAS, the expression patterns of REV and KAN1 are already polar within such primordia, although the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL) expression domain at this stage of development is still being refined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caggiano et al., 2017</xref>). At this stage, PIN1 is polarized towards the distal tip of leaf primordia but has reversed polarity away from the primordia, towards the meristem, in cells adjacent to primordia on the adaxial side. According to the ratio-metric auxin sensor R2D2, DII/mDII ratios varied from moderate to high in adaxial cells of the primordia but also varied similarly in abaxial regions - indicating no obvious asymmetry between the two tissue types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> to C and M-N; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). A low DII/mDII ratio was only found consistently in more distal regions towards the tip of the primordia and in the provasculature, matching the overall pattern of signal from PIN1-GFP. By carefully monitoring DII/mDII ratios from the distal to proximal end of the initiating leaves, the variability in DII/mDII ratios within adaxial and abaxial tissues was clearly apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–L and O–S</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). This same overall pattern of signal was found in 28 out of 28 leaves that were examined each for 3DAS and 4DAS (14 seedlings each). Lastly, by inverting the ratio and visualizing the mDII/DII (high ratio intensity corresponding to high cellular auxin sensing), we could further confirm that high levels of auxin sensing were only found in the more distal regions towards the tip of the primordia and within the provasculature, where PIN1-GFP was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39298.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of DII/mDII ratio intensities in incipient leaf primordia (third, fourth or fifth).</title><p>(<bold>A, D, G, J</bold>) Confocal projections of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings aged 4 or 5 DAS (days after stratification) showing DII/mDII ratio intensity distributions (magenta) along with PIN1-GFP (green) in third, fourth or fifth leaves. (<bold>B–C, E–F, H–I, K–L</bold>) Corresponding median longitudinal optical sections of incipient primordia along the dashed lines in (<bold>A,D,G,J</bold>) showing DII/mDII ratio intensity distributions (magenta) along with PIN1-GFP (green) (<bold>B, E, H, K</bold>) and DII/mDII ratio intensity distributions only (magenta) (<bold>C, F, I, L</bold>) .

Using PIN1-GFP marked vasculature as a dividing line to demarcate adaxial and abaxial tissues, we manually cropped adaxial and abaxial confocal volumes from our confocal image stacks of 4DAS old leaves expressing R2D2 using ImageJ (Fiji; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fiji.sc">https://fiji.sc</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). We then processed these data using a pipeline that included deconvolution of the image stacks, segmentation of nuclear volumes and calculations of R2D2 ratios averaged over the segmented nuclear volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>) (Materials and methods). The aggregated ratios from 20 leaves (10 seedlings) illustrated as separate violin plots for adaxial and abaxial leaf tissues reveals high variability between individual nuclei throughout the leaves and very similar ratio distributions between adaxial and abaxial nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). According to the data, abaxial tissues have a slightly larger proportion of cells with high DII/mDII ratios (low auxin sensing) with a mean of 0.29; standard deviation, SD (0.24); standard error of mean, SEM (0.01) compared to adaxial tissues, which have a mean ratio of 0.24, SD (0.20), SEM (0.004) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Similar distributions are found for individual leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), although there is leaf to leaf variability, which is also apparent in the spatial distribution of ratios within and between leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given that the data are not normally distributed we analysed the similarity of the distributions using a plot of the ranked ratios from aggregated adaxial and abaxial nuclei. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) measure of similarity was found to be 0.556, which again indicates that the distributions are overall very similar (0.5 would indicate they are identical) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). All together our results demonstrate that the relative levels of auxin sensing in adaxial and abaxial tissues in young leaf primordia, are overall, very similar. The small difference we identify is that a larger proportion of cells in abaxial tissues display higher DII to mDII ratios compared to adaxial tissues, indicating slightly higher levels of cellular auxin sensing in adaxial tissues, which is the opposite conclusion to that reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Guan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Qi et al., 2014</xref>). However, we again would like to emphasize that overall, the ratio distributions are very similar.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39298.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Quantification of DII/mDII ratio intensities within the nuclei of the first two leaves in 4DAS old seedlings.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative example of adaxial and abaxial volume estimation and cropping.

In contrast to the R2D2 pattern, the DII pattern showed an asymmetry of expression in leaf primordia at 3 DAS, indicating relatively low auxin levels in adaxial primordium cells, as found previously. DII signal appeared strongest in the adaxial epidermis but was also stronger in the adaxial sub-epidermal cell layer compared to abaxial epidermal and sub-epidermal cell layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4- A, C, E and</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) (n = 18/18 leaves, nine seedlings). One day later, DII signal started to show increased relative expression in the abaxial epidermal and sub-epidermal layers compared to earlier stages (n = 14/14 leaves, seven seedlings) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). At least for very young primordia, aged 3DAS, our results are similar to those obtained previously and consistent with the proposal that there are low levels of auxin in the adaxial regions of leaf primordia, in contrast to our results using the R2D2 sensor. Given this discrepancy, we next examined the expression of the mDII sensor which is driven by the same 35S promoter as the DII sensor but is not auxin sensitive. Surprisingly we found that, like the DII results, expression of the mDII marker was also higher in the adaxial cells of leaf primordia at 3DAS (n = 16/16 leaves, eight seedlings) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-B,D,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The pattern appeared almost identical to the pattern found using the DII marker except that the mDII marker also exhibited high levels of expression in the shoot meristem whereas the DII sensor did not (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–F</xref>). The similarity of expression between DII and mDII was also apparent at 4DAS when both markers started to show expression on the abaxial side as well with no obvious asymmetry in their expression (n = 20/20 leaves, 10 seedlings) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). To verify the auxin sensitivity of the sensors used we imaged seedlings before and after treatment with 5 mM NAA and found a strong decrease in DII expression compared to mDII and an increase in the mDII-tdTom/DII-V ratio for the R2D2 sensor, consistent with an increase in auxin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39298.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Signal intensity distribution in young leaves generated by <italic>p35S</italic> driven auxin sensor and control.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Confocal projections of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings aged 3DAS (days after stratification) showing expression pattern of <italic>p35S::DII-VENUS</italic> (magenta) (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>p35S::mutatedDII-VENUS</italic> (mDII, magenta) (<bold>B</bold>).

We note that although a single section showing expression of the control mDII sensor in older leaves was cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Guan et al., 2017</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), this information was not adequate for properly assessing similarities and differences, emphasizing the importance of using ratio-metric reporters and quantitative analyses. More recently, these authors have posted a pre-print reporting data for both R2D2 and mDII markers in leaf primordia and concluding that the 35S promoter driven mDII marker is not asymmetric at early leaf stages and that R2D2 ratios again indicate lower auxin levels in adaxial leaf tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Guan et al., 2018</xref>). However for the R2D2 data, the analysis is again based on arbitrarily chosen sections taken from confocal volumes. Regarding the 35S mDII data, the leaves shown have developed to a later stage compared to the leaves we analyze at both 3DAS and 4DAS (4–6 cells long in this study vs 8–9 cells at 2DAS and 6–9 cells in this study vs 9–11 at 3DAS). As our time-lapse imaging shows, the pattern changes rapidly over 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) and so a staging discrepancy can explain this difference.</p><p>In summary, our findings strongly argue against the proposal that asymmetries in the distribution of auxin within young leaf primordia have a strong influence on leaf polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Qi et al., 2014</xref>) or regulate tissue mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Qi et al., 2017</xref>). Might low levels of auxin in adaxial tissues still limit the pattern <italic>WOX1</italic> or <italic>PRS</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Guan et al., 2017</xref>)? In this study, we find high levels of auxin sensing in presumptive provascular cells that also express high levels of PIN1-GFP. Is this where <italic>WOX1</italic> and <italic>PRS</italic> are normally expressed? In fact simultaneous imaging of PIN1-GFP together with PRS-GFP in young leaf primordia indicates that PRS expression is not restricted to cells with high PIN1-GFP expression, although they are both in the middle domain (reconstructed transverse optical section; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caggiano et al., 2017</xref>)). More significantly, it was shown that if auxin is applied exogenously, <italic>WOX1</italic> and <italic>PRS</italic> do not become expressed ectopically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caggiano et al., 2017</xref>). Overall then, our data argue against a role for auxin in limiting <italic>WOX1</italic> and <italic>PRS</italic> expression to the middle domain. Rather, they support previous results indicating that, like the ventrally expressed KANADI and Auxin Response Factor genes (<italic>ARF2</italic>, <italic>ARF3</italic> and <italic>ARF4</italic>), the adaxially expressed <italic>HD-ZIPIII</italic> genes restrict auxin response, thereby limiting <italic>WOX1</italic> and <italic>PRS</italic> expression to the middle domain whether the level of auxin in adaxial cells is high or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caggiano et al., 2017</xref>). Our results do however leave other observations unexplained. In particular, to understand the apparent ventralisation of leaf primordia in tomato in response to exogenous auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Qi et al., 2014</xref>) will require further work in assessing how auxin distribution patterns change in response to exogenous treatments and how auxin is distributed during regular development in tomato, preferentially using a ratio-metric auxin sensor such as R2D2.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Seeds of the plants expressing <italic>p35S::DII-VENUS</italic> and <italic>p35S::mDII-VENUS</italic> transgenes (<italic>Columbia</italic> ecotype) were obtained from Dr. Teva Vernoux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunoud et al., 2012</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor, Dominique Bergmann as the Reviewing Editor and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>This has been a complicated paper to review (as you likely know) and the reviewers and I had a number of discussions about how to proceed. The consensus was that there were two, not totally integrated stories here, one on KAN/REV and a second on auxin distribution. The &quot;Advance&quot; format is really designed to build on a recent <italic>eLife</italic> paper, but the KAN/REV story was not thought to be advanced enough to be suitable for this. On the other hand, the auxin distribution section was a more developed story. Our conclusion is to reroute this into the <italic>eLife</italic> &quot;short report&quot; format, and so we ask that you submit a revision addressing the reviewers' concerns in that form.</p><p>A revision focused on the auxin distribution story needs to address the following points:</p><p>1) More precise, quantitative analysis on a large number of samples is needed. Specifically,</p><p>- Need essential information on the number of plants that were imaged in each experiment at each time point, how many plants showed the patterns shown in the figures, how many plants were discarded, because they suffered growth arrest etc.</p><p>- You make the point that the 35S promoter may be highly variable in different transgenic lines and provide two examples with two very different reporter proteins in Figure 4. Since the reporters inevitably will have a massive influence on protein accumulation and hence the measured entity, this experiment does not support the claim made by the authors. It is essential to analyze multiple T1 lines of a single reporter to assess the variability of the promoter without confounding effects by the reporter. Ideally compare variation between 35S and other commonly used promoters, such as Ubiquitin10 or RPS5.</p><p>2) The methods need to be described in more detail. Specifically,</p><p>- The critical experiments on auxin signaling are poorly described. One example is found in the Results and Discussion section &quot;We first focused on incipient stages where PIN1 convergence pattern is obvious but the expression patterns of REV and KAN are being defined, by looking at later forming primordia (third, fourth or fifth). We found no asymmetries in auxin levels in the future adaxial and abaxial cells (Figure 2).</p><p>- I´d like to point out that the reporters used do not measure auxin levels but are proxies for the cellular sensing of auxin. This needs to be corrected throughout the manuscript.</p><p>- The color coding of Figure 2 is not explained and simply labeled R2D2 ratio. Does signal suggest absence of auxin sensing or the converse?</p><p>- Again, it is quite difficult to know what one is looking at – where is the centre of the SAM, where are the first visible organs?</p><p>- You claim that there is no asymmetry in R2D2 signal at the early primordia stage and provide longitudinal optical sections to support this claim. However, depending on which cells you define as being the primordium, there are substantial differences in signal intensities. Most notably, the &quot;outermost cell&quot; that is PIN1-GFP positive consistently appears to have much less R2D2 signal (see Figure 2 E, F, H). You need to be much more careful in interpreting, presenting and describing their data.</p><p>- What does &quot;mDII/DII (auxin)&quot; in Figure 3 mean? Is it different from &quot;mDII/DII (R2D2)&quot; in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, or Figure 3—figure supplement 2 (R2D2 ratio), or Figure 3—figure supplement 5 (R2D2 auxin sensor), or Figure 2 (R2D2 ratio)?</p><p>3) The discussion of discrepancies between this report, previous reports (and now the new bioRxiv report from Jiao) need a more nuanced discussion.</p><p>- While you focus here on auxin distribution mainly, Guan et al. describe a much more complex scenario, where auxin concentrations, the level of several ARFs and the final auxin signaling output level (DR5) do not clearly overlap. This view is not profoundly challenged by your work.</p><p>- You argue that previous work by Guan et al., led to erroneous conclusions, because the DII line used shows an auxin independent, asymmetric expression possibly due to the 35S promoter. Proof for this is that another line expressing the auxin insensitive mDII marker shows the same asymmetry. This is in sharp contrast with Guan et al., (2017) or Wang et al., (2014) who did not find this asymmetry for the mDII line (Wang et al., 2014, Supplementary figure 2 for example).</p><p>Are these just different interpretations of the same result (i.e. one concludes that the glass is half empty, the other one that it is half full)? If not, what is the cause of this discrepancy (biased selection of results in one of the articles, differences in growth conditions)? The patterns of the different markers used also seem highly dynamic and might even differ between plants at more less the same stage. Could that play a role? Looking at Figure 3G for example, one might conclude that the level of auxin is slightly higher at the adaxial side than at the abaxial side. The same for supplementary Figure 30. If true there might indeed be a (transient) gradient, in contrast to what is concluded. At a slightly later stage, auxin concentrations are higher in the internal (pro) vascular tissues, which is suggested by both R2D2 and DII (e.g. compare Figure 3G/J and H/K). Guan et al., also find this difference between the adaxial side and internal tissues. This implies that there might be less difference between the two markers (and the two manuscripts) than suggested.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39298.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A revision focused on the auxin distribution story needs to address the following points:</p><p>1) More precise, quantitative analysis on a large number of samples is needed.

We did this because we found that DII/mDII ratios appear highly variable and that depending on the optical section examined, different patterns could be perceived from visual examination (Figure 2 and associated supplements). Hence, we used the PIN1-GFP marker as a dividing line to split R2D2 imaging data from whole leaf primordia into adaxial and abaxial halves. We then segmented the mDII signal to demarcate nuclei, calculated the DII/mDII ratios within these nuclei and averaged these results for each nucleus. This analysis thus encompasses all nuclei detected throughout the 3D volume of each leaf. Our results are provided in Figure 3 and clearly show that there is little difference in the distribution of DII/mDII ratio intensities between the two halves. If anything, we find a slightly larger proportion of abaxial cells with high DII/mDII ratios (low auxin sensing) compared to adaxial cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- What does &quot;mDII/DII (auxin)&quot; in Figure 3 mean?

This view is not profoundly challenged by your work.</p></disp-quote><p>A central message from Guan et al., is that low levels of auxin limit WOX/PRS expression in adaxial tissues while ARF2/3/4 repress these genes abaxially – hence they are expressed in the middle domain. In this study, we show that cellular auxin sensing is not lower in adaxial tissues compared to abaxial tissues – instead they are similar. Nevertheless, it could still be argued that low auxin levels may limit WOX/PRS expression in adaxial tissues, as Guan et al., propose. Are WOX1 and PRS normally expressed only in cells with higher cellular auxin sensing than adaxial cells? In this study, we find high levels of auxin sensing in cells that also express high levels of PIN1-GFP (provascular cells). Is this where WOX1 and PRS are expressed? At least for PRS, the answer is no – data from Caggiano et al., show that although both PIN1 and PRS are expressed in the middle domain, PRS is not restricted to those cells expressing high levels of PIN1-GFP in the centre of the leaf (pro-vasculature). Hence PRS expression does not only occur in cells with obviously higher levels of auxin sensing compared to adaxial cells. Perhaps more convincingly, in Caggiano et al., it was also shown that if auxin is applied exogenously, WOX/PRS do not become expressed ectopically. Overall then, the data in both this study and Caggiano et al., argue against a role for auxin being a limiting factor for defining WOX/PRS expression in the middle domain. Instead, these data are consistent with the hypothesis proposed in Caggiano et al., which is that WOX/PRS expression is actively repressed in adaxial tissues by the HD-ZIPIII proteins. We do not argue against Guan et al. in terms of what happens in abaxial tissues.</p><p>These points are now better described in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- You argue that previous work by Guan et al., led to erroneous conclusions, because the DII line used shows an auxin independent, asymmetric expression possibly due to the 35S promoter.

Previous studies such as Guan et al., (2017) or Wang et al., (2014) or even the new preprint from Jiao at BioRxiv do not present mDII data in leaf primordia at this early stage, only older stages. This is discussed in detail in our text, with the conclusion being that the data they report is not sufficient to justify their conclusion or properly compare to our data (Results and Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are these just different interpretations of the same result (i.e. one concludes that the glass is half empty, the other one that it is half full)?

This implies that there might be less difference between the two markers (and the two manuscripts) than suggested.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggests, a striking feature of R2D2 ratios in young leaf primordia is the variation in pattern. Not only between leaves but even within adaxial and abaxial tissues of the same leaf (Figure 2). Hence being restricted to a limited number of individual sections for analysis easily leads to bias. To eliminate bias in our analysis we therefore undertook a quantitative comparison of DII/mDII ratio intensities in the different sides of the leaf. This involved assessing all detectable nuclei within the adaxial and abaxial tissues of twenty leaves, using PIN1-GFP to mark the boundary between the tissue types. Our quantitative and comprehensive analysis clearly indicates no dramatic differences in R2D2 ratios between adaxial and abaxial nuclei. We conclude that for a case such as this, taking a quantitative and unbiased approach to the cells chosen for analysis is absolutely critical for making a fair conclusion (See Results section).</p></body></sub-article></article>
