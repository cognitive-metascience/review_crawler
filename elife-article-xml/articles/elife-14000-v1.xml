In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> pairing odor with food deprivation results in aversive olfactory learning, and pairing odor with food results in appetitive learning. Aversive learning requires nuclear translocation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 in AWC olfactory neurons and an insulin signal from AIA interneurons. Here we show that the activity of neurons including AIA is acutely required during aversive, but not appetitive, learning. The AIA circuit and AGE-1, an insulin-regulated PI3 kinase, signal to AWC to drive nuclear enrichment of EGL-4 during conditioning. Odor exposure shifts the AWC dynamic range to higher odor concentrations regardless of food pairing or the AIA circuit, whereas AWC coupling to motor circuits is oppositely regulated by aversive and appetitive learning. These results suggest that non-associative sensory adaptation in AWC encodes odor history, while associative behavioral preference is encoded by altered AWC synaptic activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14000.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14000.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14000.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>We learn from experience. When we repeatedly encounter a signal that is coupled to either reward or punishment, we eventually learn to expect the two to occur together. This phenomenon is called associative learning. Within the brain, distinct groups of neurons process information about the signal and about reward and punishment. In addition to storing information individually (as non-associative memories), the neurons communicate with one another and combine their information to create associations.</p><p>Like humans and many other animals, the roundworm and model organism <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> can learn to associate odors with rewards or punishments.

Repeated exposure to an odor reduces a neuron’s sensitivity to that odor, and Cho et al. show that this occurs irrespective of whether the odor is paired with reward or with punishment. This indicates that the neuron stores information about the odor as a non-associative memory. By contrast, pairing an odor with reward has differing effects on associative learning to pairing that same odor with punishment. Pairing an odor with a reward increases a sensory neuron’s ability to communicate with target neurons – ultimately, those that control movement – whereas odor-punishment pairing reduces this ability. Further experiments showed that an insulin peptide supports learning about odors and punishments, but not about odors and rewards.</p><p>The next challenge is to identify the molecules that strengthen or weaken communication between sensory neurons and target neurons after associative learning. It will also be important to identify the other neurons and molecules that detect rewards and punishments, to gain a more complete picture of how the brain acquires this information.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14000.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14000.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>neural circuits</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bargmann</surname><given-names>Cornelia I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Christine E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC005991</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>L'Etoile</surname><given-names>Noelle D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Odor conditioning induces two changes in olfactory neurons: non-associative sensory adaptation to odor history, and associative, bidirectional changes in behavioral output that are oppositely regulated in aversive and appetitive learning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory experience shapes sensory behavior. Primary sensory neurons adjust their sensitivity and dynamic range to capture ongoing sensory information without saturating, a phenomenon illustrated by the adaptation of the retina to ambient light levels over a 10<sup>10</sup>-fold range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arshavsky and Burns, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fain et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, animals learn to increase, decrease, or switch their preference for sensory cues experienced in attractive or aversive contexts. Sensory adaptation and context-dependent learning affect overlapping circuits, which must preserve robust function in the face of continuously changing neuronal properties. Here, we show how an olfactory circuit implements these two processes by encoding sensory adaptation and aversive learning at distinct sites.</p><p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> whose nervous system is composed of 302 neurons, shows robust plasticity in olfactory, mechanosensory, thermosensory, and gustatory behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colbert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rankin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hedgecock and Russell, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saeki et al., 2001</xref>). Olfaction may be its most complex sense. <italic>C. elegans</italic> detects hundreds of volatile odors using dedicated sensory neurons, each of which expresses multiple G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Troemel et al., 1995</xref>). For example, an olfactory neuron called AWC<sup>ON</sup> (one of two AWC neurons) detects benzaldehyde, butanone, and isoamyl alcohol, and expresses at least five chemosensory GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lesch and Bargmann, 2010</xref>). Calcium imaging and genetic studies indicate that AWC signal transduction resembles mammalian phototransduction: odors are inferred to decrease the level of cGMP, close a cGMP-dependent transduction channel, and hyperpolarize AWC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>When <italic>C. elegans</italic> is exposed to high concentrations of an odor in the absence of food, it gradually loses its attraction to that odor over an hour or more, and recovers over a similar timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colbert and Bargmann, 1995</xref>). This process has been called adaptation, but will here be called aversive olfactory learning to reflect its long duration and the required pairing with food deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nuttley et al., 2002</xref>), and to distinguish it from short-term sensory adaptation. Aversive learning is selective for the experienced odor, even when two odors are sensed by partly overlapping olfactory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colbert and Bargmann, 1995</xref>). The genetic requirements for aversive learning vary depending on the odor and the duration of odor exposure, and include G protein signaling pathways, ion channels, and transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ardiel and Rankin, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The cGMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 is closely associated with aversive learning. <italic>egl-4</italic> mutants show learning defects to multiple AWC-sensed odors, among other sensory defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daniels et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">L’Etoile et al., 2002</xref>). After prolonged odor conditioning, EGL-4 translocates from the AWC cytoplasm to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O'Halloran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), where it phosphorylates the heterochromatin protein HPL-2 and alters gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Juang et al., 2013</xref>). Nuclear translocation of EGL-4 is a real-time marker for AWC plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). EGL-4 translocation requires olfactory signal transduction and endogenous cGMP signaling in AWC, but exogenous cGMP is not sufficient to modify EGL-4 localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Halloran et al., 2012</xref><italic>﻿﻿</italic>), suggesting that a second coincident signal is required.</p><p>The existence of a coincident context signal for learning is further supported by the observation that aversive learning only occurs when odors are paired with food deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nuttley et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, butanone odor becomes more attractive after pairing with food, indicating that food context drives bidirectional olfactory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Torayama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kauffmann et al., 2010</xref>). The integration of food context may involve communication between neurons, as aversive learning requires insulin signals from other neurons that feed back onto AWC and reduce its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chalasani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The circuits for aversive olfactory learning are only partially understood. First, it is unclear how information about odor and food context is represented and associated during odor conditioning. Second, the neuronal sites at which information is stored are unknown. Here, we use circuit manipulations, molecular markers, and in vivo calcium imaging to map the effects of odor history and food context on the olfactory circuit. We show that during aversive learning, the food-deprivation context engages feedback from AIA and other neurons, as well as insulin signaling. This feedback regulates EGL-4 localization and the behavioral output of AWC. In parallel, non-associative sensory adaptation shifts the dynamic range of AWC during both appetitive and aversive learning. Thus olfactory learning induces both associative and non-associative plasticity in a single sensory neuron.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AIA and other neurons are required for aversive olfactory learning</title><p>C. <italic>elegans</italic> is strongly attracted to butanone, an odor sensed by the AWC<sup>ON</sup> olfactory neuron, but this attraction is lost after butanone is paired with food deprivation for 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

This transgene is expressed reliably in AIA (100%) and AVF (90%) neurons and less frequently in ASI, I1, IL2 and M3 neurons (see Materials and methods); AIA and ASI form synapses with AWC. No defect was observed after HisCl1 silencing of several other AWC synaptic partners (AIB, AIY, RIA), other sensory neurons (AWB), or neuromodulatory neurons (NSM, RIM, RIC). Control experiments demonstrated that histamine did not affect butanone chemotaxis or aversive learning in wild-type animals, and that the HisCl1 transgenes were innocuous in the absence of histamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus <italic>gcy-28d::HisCl1</italic> selectively silences neurons required during the conditioning period for aversive olfactory learning.</p><p>To narrow down the relevant neurons expressing <italic>gcy-28d::HisCl1</italic>, we took two complementary approaches: expressing HisCl1 in subsets of the <italic>gcy-28d-</italic>expressing neurons in a wild-type strain, and expressing double-stranded HisCl1 RNA in subsets of neurons to silence transgene expression in the <italic>gcy-28d::HisCl1</italic> strain. We were unable to identify a single neuron in which HisCl1 expression could replicate the strong learning defect of the <italic>gcy-28d::HisCl1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The most promising initial candidate in the <italic>gcy-28d</italic> set was AVF, because an <italic>unc-4::HisCl1</italic> transgene that is expressed in AVF caused a partial learning defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, <italic>unc-4::HisCl1</italic> is expressed in many neurons other than AVF that might contribute to its effect. Moreover, dsRNA-induced silencing of the <italic>gcy-28d::HisCl1</italic> transgene in AVF did not rescue aversive learning, but instead caused a mild chemotaxis defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggest that AVF might affect chemotaxis rather than learning per se.</p><p>Silencing the <italic>gcy-28d::HisCl1</italic> transgene in AIA consistently restored aversive learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), a result that implicates AIA in learning. However, silencing AIA alone or in several combinations with other neurons with HisCl1 did not disrupt learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Combining transgenes that express HisCl in AIA and AVF resulted in a learning defect even in the absence of histamine, an ambiguous result. These results suggest that simultaneous silencing of AIA and at least one unidentified neuron cause the aversive learning defect in the <italic>gcy-28d::HisCl1</italic> strain.</p><p>As an alternative chronic silencing method, we expressed an overactive UNC-103 potassium channel under the <italic>gcy-28d</italic> promoter. This transgene resulted in a strong defect in aversive olfactory learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The <italic>gcy-28d::unc-103(gf)</italic> transgene is expressed reliably in AIA interneurons and only occasionally in other neurons (see Materials and methods), supporting the hypothesis that AIA promotes aversive learning. For simplicity, the neurons affected by this <italic>gcy-28d::unc-103(gf)</italic> transgene will be described as 'the AIA circuit,' with the recognition that other neurons may also contribute to its effects.</p><p>Pairing butanone with food results in increased attraction to butanone, a phenomenon called appetitive olfactory learning or butanone enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Torayama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>).

Aversive and appetitive conditioning elicited similar changes favoring higher odor concentrations, suggesting that this change represents sensory adaptation to the average odor intensity in the animal’s environment.</p><p>The shift in AWC<sup>ON</sup> dynamic range after odor conditioning may prevent saturation at higher odor concentrations, allowing detection of increasing odor concentrations against an odor background.

Candidate mechanisms for plasticity are changes in the composition or level of the neuropeptides produced by AWC, changes in the relative rates of release of the two vesicle classes, or changes in resting potential that affect basal neurotransmitter release. Gene expression changes induced by nuclear EGL-4 or other transcriptional regulators may contribute to these functional effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Juang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neal et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Sensory neuron synapses and related signaling pathways also contribute to gustatory learning in <italic>C. elegans.

Salt preference changes are accompanied by synaptic changes in the ASER gustatory neuron that are induced by INS-1, AGE-1, and an axonal isoform of the DAF-2 insulin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohno et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tomioka et al., 2006</xref>).

A key difference between olfactory learning and these other forms of plasticity is the nature of sensory preference. In thermotaxis and gustatory plasticity, animals seek out a preferred concentration at the 'setpoint', the temperature or salt condition associated with chronic cultivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hedgecock and Russell, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2014</xref>). Returning to the setpoint is the apparent homeostatic goal of the directed behavior. Olfactory plasticity, by contrast, is relatively insensitive to setpoint. It is linked to the identity of the odor, not the quantity, and the readouts of aversive and appetitive learning are observed across 100-fold concentration changes in the odor source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colbert and Bargmann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Torayama et al., 2007</xref>). Although odor history does change sensory representations in AWC<sup>ON</sup>, this is not central to the behavioral preference; it is the context-dependent synaptic changes that appear to be instructive. Individual neurons may tune history-dependent changes in sensory detection and associative changes at sensory synapses in a variety of ways, generating different forms of sensory plasticity to solve different behavioral problems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Nematode cultures and strains</title><p>Animals were grown at 20–22°C on Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) plates seeded with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 4–10 days before use.

AWC response magnitude was measured as the decrease in normalized fluorescence following the first odor addition in the series, which was calculated by subtracting the average fluorescence in the last 10 s during the odor presentation from the average fluorescence from the 2 s preceding the odor addition. Half-time of recovery was defined as the time for fluorescence to recover to 50% of the peak magnitude after the last odor removal in the series, and was only calculated when there was a response to odor (defined as a reduction in fluorescence of magnitude 0.075 or greater). Averages in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C,F and I</xref> were only calculated when at least half of the individuals responded to odor. Naive animals did not recover fully from the last 1 mM pulse within the five minutes of recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A,C</xref>), so for this concentration the half-time of recovery is a lower bound.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Channelrhodopsin-induced behavior</title><p>L4-stage animals expressing the H134R variant of Channelrhodopsin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2009</xref>) under the <italic>str-2</italic> (AWC<sup>ON</sup>) or <italic>inx-1</italic> (AIB) promoter were incubated overnight on plates seeded with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 and 50 µM retinal. The following day, adult animals were conditioned with odor and with or without food as described above. After conditioning, animals were washed twice with S basal and once with NGM buffer (25 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.0, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 52 mM NaCl) and transferred to a 6 cm NGM plate with a square filter ring soaked in 20 mM CuCl<sub>2</sub> to prevent animals from crawling out of the field of view. Animals received 20-second pulses of blue light (455 nm, 25 µW/mm<sup>2</sup>) every two minutes, repeated ten times, and were video-recorded; pulses six through ten were analyzed. A Pixelink camera and Streampix software were used to generate recordings. Movies were analyzed using custom Matlab scripts that tracked animal locomotion and identified reversals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gordus et al., 2015</xref>). Custom Matlab scripts were used to bin and plot the frequency of events over time (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Source code 2</xref>). Each group was tested on 7–14 experimental trials, with 15–25 animals in each trial.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Oliver Hobert, Yuichi Iino and Douglas Kim for reagents and Xin Jin and Donovan Ventimiglia for discussion and comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mani Ramaswami as Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Cho et al. probe the mechanisms that underlie two forms of olfactory learning induced when the odorant butanone is presented to <italic>C. elegans</italic> either without or with food. A series of chemogenetic inactivation and optogenetic activation experiments, augmented by calcium imaging from key sensory neurons and interneurons in the olfactory circuit, shows that negative conditioning occurs downstream of primary chemosensory neurons and requires activation of a specific set of interneurons. Sites where associative context and sensory input converge are proposed.</p><p>The quality of the experiments is excellent and the writing is clear. However, in its present form the paper lacks a clear narrative that conveys any broad implications necessary for a general interest journal like <italic>eLife</italic>. In current form, it is not made clear why the findings should be of interest to those outside the field of <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurobiology.</p><p>While appreciating that the authors may have their own ideas here, the reviewers, in an effort to be constructive, suggested three possible ways in which the work could be elaborated or presented to achieve wider interest: (1) To focus on the question of how two mechanisms of learning are differentially achieved in one circuit (comparisons with the recent <italic>Drosophila</italic> literature could be useful). (2) To convincingly propose potentially universal molecular or mechanistic insight (e.g. on retrograde signaling). (3) To present the work in context of some general problem: e.g. of plasticity of sensory-motor circuits involved in guiding food-seeking behavior. The Introduction and Discussion as well as the presentation of the Results will need to be revised accordingly.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Is &quot;adaptation&quot; the best term to describe <italic>C. elegans</italic> olfactory learning associated with food-deprivation for 80 minutes? It would help increase the broad impact of the paper by using terminology more widely accepted in the literature on learning and memory. While there is a long history in <italic>C. elegans</italic> of using &quot;adaptation&quot; to refer to the reductions in chemotaxis behavior observed in response to prolonged exposure to attractants, it seems that now may be a time to reconsider this term. If food deprivation has strong negative consequences (if the worms feel strong hunger and fat stores are depleted as suggested by some previous papers) then perhaps this should be termed aversive conditioning as the worms on blank plates are actually learning a conditioned association between odor and starvation? This should be clarified early, as it would help justify and explain subsequent parallels being drawn to better-established forms of aversive conditioning. It also seems reasonable that associations formed between butanone and a rich source of food should be referred to as &quot;appetitive conditioning.&quot; The suggested change in terminology would also make the paper easier to understand, by avoiding the many different meanings of &quot;adaptation.&quot;</p><p>2) The EGL-4 story could be better integrated into the paper. To better communicate the summary model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), one of the key premises of the work should be made clear in the Introduction: that EGL-4 translocation is both necessary and sufficient for persistent &quot;behavioral adaptation.&quot; A related limitation that the authors should discuss is that the evidence for the sufficiency part of the premise may be weak. In the cited work, Lee et al. 2010 report that constitutive nuclear localization of EGL-4 &quot;renders the animals unresponsive to AWC-sensed odors.&quot; The concern is that constitutive expression may have larger and/or additional/different effects than acute translocation to the nucleus during an actual adaptation experiment. With respect to the model, it is also recommended that the authors provide one or more plausible scenarios (ideally with precedents in the literature) for how nuclear EGL-4 might reduce the effectiveness of AWC activation.</p><p>3) Since silencing AIA or ASI neuron separately did not reduce adaptation the authors believe that AIA plus ASI neurons contribute to adaptation. Therefore, they should assess the effects of silencing these two neurons simultaneously using the <italic>ins-1::HisCl1</italic>, which should drive HisCl1 expression in both AIA and ASI</p><p>4) The claim/premise that the AIA circuit is butanone selective is overstated.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>5) Overall impact is lessened by the rather vague definition of the AIA et al. circuit. This vagueness is not the authors' fault, merely a result of how the experiments turned out, but it's a problem nonetheless.</p><p>6) It would help to have the term &quot;context&quot; formally defined at first use. To some, it carries the strong connotation of &quot;surrounding external cues,&quot; whereas it is used here (as of course in many other cases) to denote internal state (satiety/starvation).</p><p>7) Most readers outside the <italic>C. elegans</italic> field will not be able to make the connection between changes in the downstream effectiveness in AWC and changes in the chemotaxis scores by which adaptation and enhancement are quantified.</p><p>8) It is often unclear when &quot;adaptation&quot; means: sensory adaptation (reduction in gain of sensory transduction) versus behavioral change (reduction in the strength of chemotaxis). It would help greatly to use different terms to refer to cell biological and behavioral changes.</p><p>9) The term &quot;starvation&quot; connotes an internal metabolic state.

If &quot;starvation&quot; is used, as indeed may be more appropriate, then this should be justified on the basis of existing experimental data.</p><p>10) In the last paragraph of the subsection “AWC output reflects bidirectional odor preference”. The claim that the AIB::ChR2 experiment localizes the site of adaptation to somewhere between AWC depolarization and AIB depolarization doesn't seem to take into account the parallel pathways from AIY, another follower of AWC, to the reverse command neurons such as AVA. From the experiment we learn that loci postsynaptic to AIB are unlikely but there are many possible sites postsynaptic to AIY.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

The authors say that restoring AVF activity in the <italic>gcy-28d::HisCl</italic> transgene does not rescue (restore?) adaptation. This claim is presumably made on the basis of the similarity between the Naive + histamine and Adapted + histamine groups. But a closer look also suggests the chemotaxis index of the Naive + histamine is pretty close to the adapted level. So another valid interpretation is that the Adapted + histamine group IS adapted, such that restoring AVF active actually rescue &quot;adaptation.&quot; The authors should please clarify this point and discuss it more completely.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14000.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The quality of the experiments is excellent and the writing is clear.

The Introduction and Discussion as well as the presentation of the Results will need to be revised accordingly.</italic></p><p>To bring forward a clear narrative that conveys broad implications to a general-interest reader, we have made the following changes to the manuscript.</p><p>First, we emphasized the idea that we are observing both non-associative and associative learning that occur at the same time in the same circuit, beginning with the abstract. This highlights the “two mechanisms of learning achieved in one circuit” as well as addressing the work “in the context of some general problem” as suggested.</p><p>Second, we addressed molecular mechanisms more deeply by adding experiments examining the insulin/PI3 kinase pathway in aversive learning. Previous work from our group and others implicated retrograde signaling from insulin to sensory neurons in aversive learning. We now show that retrograde insulin/PI3 kinase signaling from AIA to AWC affects aversive learning to butanone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); that this signaling pathway is required for the nuclear translocation of the EGL-4 cGMP-dependent kinase in AWC during conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>); that the insulin/PI3K signaling pathway is not required for non-associative sensory adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-F</xref>); and that the insulin/PI3K signaling pathway is required for the acute behavioral changes relevant to associative aversive learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E-F</xref>). Thus insulin/PI3K signaling, and its unanticipated effect on the EGL-4 kinase, mark the convergence of CS (odor) and US (food deprivation) in AWC.</p><p><italic>Major points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Is &quot;adaptation&quot; the best term to describe C. elegans olfactory learning associated with food-deprivation for 80 minutes?

We show that insulin/PI3K signaling regulates EGL-4 localization in AWC neurons. This result ties together insulin and EGL-4, two genetic requirements for aversive learning whose relationship was previously unknown. In the Discussion we describe the known ability of nuclear EGL-4 to change gene expression, and suggest that aversive learning changes the expression of molecules required for glutamatergic or peptidergic neurotransmission by AWC.</p><p><italic>3) Since silencing AIA or ASI neuron separately did not reduce adaptation the authors believe that AIA plus ASI neurons contribute to adaptation. Therefore, they should assess the effects of silencing these two neurons simultaneously using the ins-1::HisCl1, which should drive HisCl1 expression in both AIA and ASI</italic></p><p>We have added results to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> that show that simultaneous acute silencing of AIA and ASI is not sufficient to block aversive learning. Combining transgenes for simultaneous silencing of AIA and AVF caused aversive learning defects even without histamine, making the result uninterpretable.</p><p><italic>4) The claim/premise that the AIA circuit is butanone selective is overstated.</italic></p><p>We removed the point about butanone specificity.</p><p><italic>Other points:</italic> </p><p><italic>5) Overall impact is lessened by the rather vague definition of the AIA et al. circuit.
