As commissural axons navigate across the CNS midline, ROBO-mediated repulsion has traditionally been thought to be repressed before crossing, and then to become upregulated after crossing. The regulation of the ROBO receptors involves multiple mechanisms that control protein expression, trafficking, and activity. Here, we report that mammalian ROBO1 and ROBO2 are not uniformly inhibited precrossing and are instead subject to additional temporal control via alternative splicing at a conserved microexon. The NOVA splicing factors regulate the developmental expression of ROBO1 and ROBO2 variants with small sequence differences and distinct guidance activities. As a result, ROBO-mediated axonal repulsion is activated early in development to prevent premature crossing and becomes inhibited later to allow crossing. Postcrossing, the ROBO1 and ROBO2 isoforms are disinhibited to prevent midline reentry and to guide postcrossing commissural axons to distinct mediolateral positions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon guidance</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>microexon</kwd><kwd>SLIT ROBO signaling</kwd><kwd>NOVA</kwd><kwd>Netrin DCC signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005508</institution-id><institution>Boettcher Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY024261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Junge</surname><given-names>Harald J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ROBO isoforms with minute sequence variations have significant and distinct functions in axon guidance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Temporal and spatial regulation of cell signaling ensures the fidelity of axon pathfinding, which is crucial for nervous system development and function. Multiple signaling pathways coordinate the projection of commissural axons across the CNS (central nervous system) midline, such that the axons are attracted as they approach and enter the midline, but subsequently become repelled in order to exit the midline and to never recross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans and Bashaw, 2010</xref>). Within the spinal commissural axons, Netrin/DCC (Deleted in colorectal carcinoma) signaling is activated to promote midline attraction while SLIT/ROBO (Roundabout) signaling that mediates repulsion is inhibited prior to crossing. Following crossing, SLIT/ROBO signaling becomes upregulated to facilitate midline expulsion and to block midline reentry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans and Bashaw, 2010</xref>).</p><p>SLIT/ROBO signaling is evolutionarily conserved and plays an important role in various biological processes, including cell migration, axon guidance, angiogenesis, and organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blockus and Chédotal, 2016</xref>). Dysregulation of the SLIT/ROBO pathway has been implicated in several forms of cancer and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballard and Hinck, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blockus and Chédotal, 2014</xref>). In both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates, control over ROBO repulsion is achieved through multiple mechanisms. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Comm blocks ROBO insertion into the axonal surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keleman et al., 2005</xref>). In vertebrates, PRRG4 (Proline-rich and Gla domain 4) represses ROBO1 surface trafficking, whereas USP33 (Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 33), RabGDI/GDI1 (GDP dissociation inhibitor 1), and CLSTN1 (Calsyntenin1) stabilize or promote ROBO1 surface localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alther et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Justice et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Philipp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuasa-Kawada et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, miR-92 has been shown to suppress vertebrate ROBO1 protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Without affecting ROBO1 protein expression or trafficking, fly <italic>Robo2</italic> and mammalian <italic>Robo3</italic> have been shown to inhibit <italic>Robo1</italic> activity using different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sabatier et al., 2004</xref>). Mammalian <italic>Robo3</italic> has also been suggested to promote midline crossing by facilitating Netrin/DCC attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zelina et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The mammalian <italic>Robo</italic> genes undergo alternative splicing to produce variants with complex expression patterns and guidance activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dalkic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>Robo1</italic> and <italic>Robo2</italic> share a homologous alternative exon 6b, which is 9 and 12 bp in length, respectively. Recent studies demonstrate that alternatively spliced ‘microexons’ (≤51 bp) are highly conserved in the nervous system and are frequently misregulated in autistic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Whether the alternative splicing of microexon 6b in <italic>Robo1</italic> and/or <italic>Robo2</italic> contributes to the dynamic regulation of midline repulsion was until now completely unknown.</p><p>Here, we report that the alternative splicing of <italic>Robo1</italic> and <italic>Robo2</italic> (referred to herein as <italic>Robo1/2</italic>) at microexon 6b is crucial for axon guidance and is controlled by the NOVA (Neuro-oncological ventral antigen) family of splicing factors, which are neural-specific KH (hnRNP K homology)-type RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darnell, 2006</xref>). We show that loss of <italic>Nova1 and Nova2</italic> (referred to herein as <italic>Nova1/2</italic>) alters the expression of exon 6b and leads to severe midline crossing and postcrossing guidance defects. Genetically restoring the normal expression profiles of <italic>Robo1/2</italic> exon 6b is able to reverse these defects in <italic>Nova1/2</italic> mutants. Interestingly, exon 6b alternative isoforms display distinct guidance activities and their production is developmentally regulated. Consequently, ROBO-mediated repulsion is not uniformly repressed precrossing as previously believed, but is instead activated initially to block premature crossing and is sufficiently blocked during crossing. Together, our study demonstrates that mammalian ROBO1/2 are subject to complex regulation, which is coordinated by alternative splicing, protein translation and trafficking, and activity inhibition by <italic>Robo3</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Double knockout of <italic>Nova1/2</italic> disrupts midline crossing and postcrossing guidance of spinal commissural axons</title><p>We reported previously that <italic>Nova1/2</italic> double knockout (dKO) dampens DCC signaling by reducing the full-length <italic>Dcc<sub>long</sub></italic> isoform while increasing the truncated <italic>Dcc<sub>short</sub></italic> isoform, which results in delayed commissural neuron migration and axonal projection toward the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leggere et al., 2016</xref>).

These findings suggest that in the absence of <italic>Robo3</italic>, elevated ROBO1/2 activity can block midline crossing. To determine if elevated ROBO repulsion also blocks crossing in <italic>Nova1/2</italic> dKO embryos, we constructed <italic>Nova1; Nova2; Robo1</italic> triple KO mutants. <italic>Robo1</italic> single KO embryos have a normal commissure size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaworski et al., 2010</xref>), and by anti-ROBO3 staining, we found that <italic>Nova1; Nova2; Robo1</italic> triple KO mutants had slightly thicker commissures than <italic>Nova1/2</italic> dKO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

Meanwhile, ROBO1/2 are inhibited by a number of factors and consequently the axons are believed to be nonresponsive to the SLIT family of midline repellents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our previous study shows that NOVAs modulate DCC activity by regulating the production of two distinct splice variants, DCC<sub>long</sub> and DCC<sub>short</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leggere et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>Nova1/2</italic> dKO embryos, where DCC<sub>long</sub> is reduced, fewer axons are able to reach the midline, similar to in <italic>Dcc</italic> KO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In this study, we report that NOVAs also control midline repulsion by regulating the temporal production of two <italic>Robo1/2</italic> isoforms, e6b+ and e6b-. The ROBO1/2(e6b+) and ROBO1/2(e6b-) receptors have minute sequence variations yet display distinct activities, with e6b+ being more repulsive than e6b- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). <italic>Robo1/2(e6b+)</italic> is initially predominantly expressed in spinal commissural neurons. Over development, as <italic>Nova1/2</italic> levels increase in spinal commissural neurons, e6b+ expression is reduced while e6b- expression is elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Consequently, we found that ROBO1/2 repulsion is not uniformly inhibited precrossing. Instead, when e6b+ is predominantly expressed early on, commissural axons are sensitive to SLIT, because loss of e6b+ in <italic>Robo1</italic> e6bΔ/Δ mutants allows the axons to cross the midline precociously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). Later on, in order for axons to enter the midline, ROBO1/2 repulsion must be attenuated and sufficiently inhibited, as the persistence of e6b+ as the predominant variant in <italic>Nova1/2</italic> dKO embryos blocks midline crossing in some axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, besides being predominantly attracted by Netrin, precrossing axons are also somewhat repelled by SLIT to ensure proper timing in approaching and crossing the midline. A balance between Netrin and SLIT signaling systems has been implicated in other guidance events, such as in positioning spinal motor neuron cell bodies and in guiding longitudinal axons in the midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46042.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of NOVA1/2 regulation of commissural axon guidance.</title><p>As commissural axons approach and enter the midline, Netrin/DCC signaling promotes axonal outgrowth and midline attraction. <italic>Nova1/2</italic> regulate <italic>Dcc</italic> alternative splicing by promoting the production of the full-length <italic>Dcc<sub>long</sub></italic> isoform.

In precrossing axons, SLIT/ROBO repulsion is repressed by multiple genes including <italic>Prrg4</italic>, <italic>miR-92</italic>, and <italic>Robo3</italic> to allow midline entry. We show here that ROBO repulsion is not uniformly repressed precrossing, but is developmentally controlled such that ROBO repulsion is active early on to prevent premature crossing and is sufficiently inhibited later to allow crossing. This is achieved through the regulation of <italic>Robo1/2</italic> alternative splicing at microexon 6b by the NOVA splicing factors. As NOVAs increase during development, the <italic>Robo1/2(e6b+)</italic> isoform, which has a greater repulsive activity, is reduced, whereas the <italic>Robo1/2(e6b-)</italic> isoform is upregulated.

First, the deficiency in Netrin/DCC attraction causes fewer axons to reach the midline. Second, elevated SLIT/ROBO repulsion partially blocks axons from entering once they arrive at the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Although elevated ROBO repulsion may also prevent some axons from getting to the midline, the fact that restoring <italic>Dcc<sub>long</sub></italic> expression in <italic>Nova1/2</italic> dKO embryos almost completely reverses the defect argues that ROBO repulsion does not play a major role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leggere et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this notion, overexpression of ROBO3.1, which represses ROBO1/2-mediated repulsion, is not sufficient to restore axonal outgrowth and projection to the midline in <italic>Nova1/2</italic> dKO embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leggere et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, dampened DCC attraction may also block some axons from entering the midline. However, the fact that reducing <italic>Robo1/2(e6b+)</italic> levels largely enables crossing in <italic>Nova1/2</italic> dKO embryos argues against a major contribution by DCC misregulation. Thus, NOVAs regulate both midline attraction and repulsion by controlling the alternative splicing of two groups of key guidance receptors, DCC and ROBO1/2. Consistent with our findings in the spinal commissural neurons, <italic>Dcc</italic> and <italic>Robo2</italic> alternative splicing has been reported to be disrupted in the same manner in E18.5 <italic>Nova2</italic> KO cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saito et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Nova2</italic> KO mutants are missing the corpus callosum, a major brain commissure, and restoring <italic>Dcc<sub>long</sub></italic> expression in <italic>Nova2</italic> KO cortex alone is not sufficient to rescue midline crossing by callosal axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saito et al., 2016</xref>). Our results suggest that restoring the normal <italic>Dcc<sub>long</sub></italic> level and simultaneously reducing <italic>Robo1</italic> and/or <italic>Robo2</italic> e6b+ expression are likely to be required to rescue the acallosal phenotype.</p><p>Given that <italic>Nova1/2</italic> dKO does not significantly alter the overall levels and patterns of <italic>Robo1/2</italic> expression, it is likely that the ROBO1/2 isoforms are subject to similar repression in their translation and/or trafficking, such as by mir-92 and PRRG4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Justice et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). As overexpressing either e6b isoform results in the presence of the receptors on precrossing axons and blocks crossing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), downregulating both isoforms will be crucial to inhibiting midline repulsion. Due to a lack of specific antibodies to distinguish between the endogenous ROBO1/2 isoforms and the fact that ectopic expression alters the normal protein distributions, we could not directly test if the different ROBO1/2 isoforms are similarly inserted into the axonal surface in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Without affecting ROBO1/2 levels or localizations, both <italic>Robo3</italic> and <italic>Nova1/2</italic> inhibit ROBO1/2 receptor activities. The mechanism underlying ROBO3-mediated inhibition remains unknown, and NOVAs repress the production of the e6b+ variant with a higher repulsive activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Partial loss of function in <italic>Nova1/2</italic> and <italic>Robo3,</italic> which somewhat increases <italic>Robo1/2(e6b+)</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and reduces <italic>Robo1/2</italic> inhibition, respectively, can synergistically block midline crossing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Taken together, repressing ROBO1/2 precrossing involves the collaboration of multiple mechanisms, and the microexon 6b isoforms are likely to be regulated by all the factors, although there may be some quantitative differences. The temporal regulation of exon 6b by NOVAs remains to be further examined at the protein level and at single-neuron resolution, and we cannot yet distinguish if it plays an instructive or a permissive role in midline crossing.</p><p>Given that deleting <italic>Robo1(e6b+)</italic>, but not <italic>Robo2(e6b+),</italic> allows premature midline crossing, <italic>Robo1</italic>-expressing axons are likely to be pioneer axons that initiate midline crossing. <italic>Robo2</italic>-expressing axons, by contrast, may cross by following an existing axonal scaffold. The leader and follower commissural axons have been demonstrated to have distinct growth cone morphology and growth kinetics during midline crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bak and Fraser, 2003</xref>). This hypothesis may help to explain why <italic>Robo2</italic> deletion alone cannot promote midline crossing in <italic>Robo3</italic> KO mutants, but can help facilitate crossing when <italic>Robo1</italic> is also deleted to allow some axons to cross first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaworski et al., 2010</xref>).

ROBO3.1 and mir-92 have been shown to be absent on postcrossing axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), and factors including USP33, RabGDI, and CLSTN1 stabilize or promote ROBO1 surface level postcrossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alther et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Philipp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuasa-Kawada et al., 2009</xref>). High ROBO repulsion thus facilitates midline exit, blocks reentry, and guides postcrossing axons away from the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Previous studies have shown that <italic>Robo1</italic> directs longitudinally projecting axons close to the midline, whereas <italic>Robo2</italic> guides them more dorsolaterally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farmer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaworski et al., 2010</xref>).

For example, the ventral-most spinal commissural neurons do not require Netrin to project toward the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rabe et al., 2009</xref>). In the hindbrain, Netrin/DCC signaling is not required to attract commissural axons toward the midline, but it instead attracts postcrossing axons close to the midline. In these hindbrain commissural axons, ROBO1/2 are important for expelling axons out of the midline, but are not involved in their postcrossing projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shoja-Taheri et al., 2015</xref>). The available tools for our analyses, including DiI and axonal markers (e.g. anti-ROBO3 and anti-L1), did not allow us to distinguish between specific subgroups of commissural axons.</p><p>As SLIT/ROBO signaling is only partially responsible for midline repulsion, additional guidance pathways, including Ephrin/Eph, Semaphorin/Neuropilin/Plexin, and Slit2(C-term)/PlexinA1 are in play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kullander et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zou et al., 2000</xref>).

ROBO1/2 proteins were detected by a C-terminal HA peptide tag (HRP-conjugated anti-HA, 3F10, Roche) and CDC42/RAC1 were detected by a C-terminal FLAG tag (HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG, M2, Sigma Aldrich). To quantify the fold change in CDC42/RAC1 activation, the signal intensity of protein bands was measured using ImageJ. GTP-bound protein was first normalized to the total protein for each condition. The ratio between the normalized signals from before and after SLIT2 stimulation was then calculated as the fold change for each ROBO1/2 isoform. Three independent assays were performed and are illustrated in the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>AP-SLIT2/ROBO-binding assay</title><p>AP-SLIT2 was produced by fusing alkaline phosphatase to the N-terminus of human SLIT2. This fusion protein has been previously shown to bind the ROBO receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brose et al., 1999</xref>). The fusion protein was produced in HEK293T cells and the protein concentration was determined by measuring the AP activity against an AP protein standard (Colorimetric AP assay kit, Abcam). COS-1 cells were transfected with <italic>Robo1/2</italic> cDNAs and cultured for 24 hr. Binding of AP-SLIT2 was performed using a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng and Flanagan, 2001</xref>). Briefly, AP-SLIT2 proteins were added to the culture medium at a series of concentrations and binding was performed at room temperature for 90 min in the presence of 1 μg/ml heparin. After 3–6 washes in Hank’s balance buffer supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 20 mM HEPES, and 1 μg/ml heparin, pH 7.4, the cells were lysed (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8, with protease inhibitors). After clearing the lysate by centrifugation, AP substrate, para-nitrophenyl phosphate, was added to the lysate and optical density was measured at 405 nm. Data were analyzed using Prism7 and fitted with one site specific binding with Hill slope method. Three independent binding assays were performed and the level of binding was normalized to the saturating level of signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cell surface biotinylation assay</title><p>Biotinylation was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lai et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, <italic>Robo1/2</italic> cDNAs were transfected into COS-1 cells. At 24 hr post-transfection, the cells were washed with cold 1x PBS (pH 8.0), and biotinylated at 4°C with EZ-Link-Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s protocol. After removing excess reagent and washing the cells with 1xPBS, the cells were lysed (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8, with protease inhibitors). After clearing the lysate by centrifugation, biotinylated cell-surface proteins were pulled down using NeutrAvidin agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins in the total lysate and in the pull-down fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants: Boettcher Foundation (ZC); Linda Crnic Institute (ZC); National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01EY024261 (HJJ).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Alternative splicing of mammalian ROBO1/2 microexons provides temporal regulation of axonal repulsion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Grant Mastick (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The three reviewers generally had positive assessments of your study on a new role for the Nova RNA binding proteins in the regulation of Robo receptor alternative splicing during spinal commissural axon guidance. They applauded your efforts to test the function of the poorly understood Robo 1 and 2 isoforms, with strong genetic experiments, expression of altered Robo constructs, and the mechanisms of splicing by the Nova1/2 splicing factors, including the timing of splicing. You show that splicing isoforms have distinct guidance and signaling activities, revealing physiological function of alternatively spliced microexons. Especially interesting is your Crispr-based manipulation of the Robo locus to restore the balance of alternative splicing in the Nova1/2 mutant background results in a significant rescue of the Nova1/2 crossing defects.</p><p>Nonetheless, the reviewers call for revision, both additional experimental analysis and textual amendments in the Discussion section:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>I) Further analysisa) There was concern that the most significant function of the ex6b is shown in the context of Nova1/2 double knock-outs in which hundreds of other mRNA transcripts are also potentially changed), and that there is no definitive insight into mechanism of how the microexon impacts Robo1/2 function. To confirm that the microexon mutant mice indeed differ from wild-type only in the single microexon, the reviewers encourage you to survey additional splicing events surrounding the deleted exon. You report no changes in exon 21 and 26 – but generally the concern in such mutants is the unintentional generation of cryptic splice acceptor or donor sites in the mutant transcript in proximity to the mutated region. One question is whether splice isoforms are expressed at comparable levels in your gain of function experiments. Given the subtle nature of the protein coding differences in these Robo isoforms, it is important to demonstrate that they are comparably expressed in the context of the guidance events (not just in heterologous cells).</p><p>b) The reviewers ask you to probe with quantitative methods whether there are any changes in total Robo1/2 mRNAs or proteins in the mutants, because the staining in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 are not quantitative and the other functional experiments involve overexpression, which are difficult to interpret.</p><p>Thus, we ask that you to assess RNA and protein levels, as well as splice junctions, in NOVA1/2 DKO mice, to confirm whether the manipulations caused an indirect effect on protein or RNA stability. The outcome could change the interpretation of your results but may also strengthen your conclusions on splice isoforms.</p><p>II) Textual additionsa) Figure 1 shows that Nova1/2 mutants have a clear change in post-crossing trajectories, causing axons to angle away from the midline. While this may reflect changes in Robo-mediated repulsion, the text should consider the possibility that the post-crossing errors caused by Nova1/2 mutations also alter Netrin guidance. A study by Shoja-Taheri, et al., 2015 showed similar post-crossing errors in Netrin1 mutant hindbrain commissural axons, and explant experiments provided support for the retention of post-crossing commissural axon responsiveness to Netrin midline attraction. Given the similarity in axon responses, and your previous evidence of Nova1/2 regulation of Netrin/DCC signaling, the Shoja-Taheri paper should be cited and considered in interpreting the post-crossing trajectories.</p><p>b) Another reviewer request is that the Discussion section would be improved by integrating the Robo1/2 splicing evidence with the other previously identified mechanisms for Robo1/2 regulation. How do you weigh the relative importance of the other levels of regulation, such as receptor localization, interaction with other receptors and other signaling systems, etc. An obvious question to raise is to what extent that the regulatory steps may interact or be dependent on each other: are they hierarchical, or additive? Could the splice isoforms be differentially regulated by receptor trafficking mechanisms, for example?</p><p>c). A major issue is the conflict between the present results and those of your previous study -i.e., that both DCC and Robo splicing can rescue the Nova1/2 DKO phenotype. Previous work from your lab has implicated Nova1 and 2 in the control of alternative splicing of the Netrin receptor DCC (2016).</p><p>You show that DCC and Nova mutants result in strikingly similar phenotypes with similar severity in terms of midline crossing defects. Rescue experiments indicating that expression of specific Nova-dependent splice variants of DCC can restore midline crossing in Nova mutants, together with a number of in vitro assays, argue that Nova and DCC function together to regulate axon growth across the midline. In the present paper, you begin by showing that Nova1/2, DCC triple mutants have even stronger defects than DCC or Nova alone, suggesting that Nova and DCC act in parallel (Figure 1).</p><p>Moreover, why should both over-expressing DCC, and reducing Robo lead to a suppression of the Nova phenotypes? This is particularly puzzling given that in your prior work, you found that in contrast to expression of DCC (which rescues Nova mutants) that expression of Robo3 (which should attenuate Robo repulsion to some degree) has no effect (2016, Figure 8). In contrast, in the current work, you detect trans-heterozygous interactions between Robo3 and the Nova genes that reveal striking LOF phenotypes and suggest that Nova functions with Robo3 (Figure 2).</p><p>The reviewers thus urge you to reconcile this apparent disconnect in the Discussion section, especially the new genetic interactions with Robo3, since your previous study argued for the specificity of Nova function with DCC and showed that Robo3 was unable to rescue Nova phenotypes. You should also consider including DCC in your current model in Figure 8.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The manuscript has been improved and the reviewers thought your amendments were appropriate and sufficient to move forward. They continue to be concerned that the read-outs for phenotypes from dye tracing or antibody labeling to indicate bundle thickness, etc. are semi-quantitative, and that measurements of Robo1/2 mRNA and protein levels are limited by analysis of whole spinal cord rather than relevant cell populations within the spinal cord. In addition, questions remain about the differential action of the 6b+ vs 6b- isoforms. Nonetheless, they feel that the study does highlight a critical function of a micro exon in vivo.</p><p>However, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. As Reviewing Editor, I found that the Abstract, Discussion section and model in Figure 8 need further revision; the revisions listed would make the results more accessible and exhibit your story in the best light.</p><p>1) Your summary of results in the Introduction is very clear: &quot;Here we report that Robo1/2 alternative splicing at microexon 6b is crucial for axon guidance and is controlled by the NOVA (Neuro-oncological ventral antigen) family of splicing factors…. We show that loss of Nova1/2 alters the expression of exon 6b and leads to severe midline crossing and postcrossing guidance defects. Genetically restoring the expression profile of Robo1/2 exon 6b is able to reverse these defects in Nova mutants. Interestingly, exon 6b alternative isoforms display distinct guidance activities and their production is developmentally regulated. Consequently, ROBO-mediated repulsion is not uniformly repressed precrossing as previously believed, but is instead activated initially to block premature crossing and is sufficiently blocked during crossing.&quot;</p><p>The Abstract, however, is very vague and does not inform the reader on the results. You do not indicate that microexon 6b splice variants of Robo1/2 are controlled by Nova1/2. The abstract should be rewritten to be more precise and reflective of the results.</p><p>2) Likewise, the beginning of the Discussion section should summarize the results more concisely, as in the paragraph at the end of the Introduction. The remainder of the Discussion section wanders and there is a degree of hand-waving. Your findings and the advances they make in the control of DCC-Netrin and Robo-Slit signaling should be stated more clearly.</p><p>3) The model. In Figure 8, though very welcome, is not graphically clear; the reader should be able to glean the results without looking at the legend.</p><p>a) &quot;Mutant&quot; should be &quot;Mutants&quot;, as more than one mutant is included.</p><p>b) 1. and 2. titles should either be put on the midline (so as to refer to both Wildtype and Mutants) or the font should be bigger</p><p>c) Robo1/2 inhibition in red, and &quot;low repulsion&quot; are confusing. Put a space between axon under DCC and Robo1/2.</p><p>d) The graphic for Microexon 6b alternative splicing being developmentally controlled is not obvious.</p><p>4) Figure 8 legend is not at all clear; it attempts to compare wildtype and mutant but does not indicate wildtype vs mutant.</p><p>a) For example, Figure 8 legend: &quot;Nova1/2 regulate (should be &quot;regulates&quot;) Dcc alternative splicing (of what?), and (should be: &quot;but in the Nova1/2 dKO&quot;, Nova deficiency reduces Dcc<sub>long</sub> and causes fewer axons to reach the midline&quot;.</p><p>b) On the right of the diagram under Mutant, as drawn, it is not clear whether premature turning occurs with Robo3 KO or Nova1,2 dKO (when Robo1/2 (e6b+ increases), or whether there might be an interaction between robo3 and Robo1/2 and e6b+.</p><p>5) Text in English. We appreciate that you have utilized an English-speaking colleague to help edit the manuscript. However,</p><p>a) There are still many instances in this revision of inappropriate English usage, as in subsection “Microexon 6b splice variants of ROBO1/2 have distinct guidance activities”, Discussion section – &quot;Consistently&quot;, should be &quot;Consistent with these findings…&quot; or similar.</p><p>Figure 5 legend – &quot;orientated&quot; to the left should be &quot;oriented&quot;.</p><p>b) Throughout, there is incorrect use of singular vs plural.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46042.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The three reviewers generally had positive assessments of your study on a new role for the Nova RNA binding proteins in the regulation of Robo receptor alternative splicing during spinal commissural axon guidance.

One question is whether splice isoforms are expressed at comparable levels in your gain of function experiments. Given the subtle nature of the protein coding differences in these Robo isoforms, it is important to demonstrate that they are comparably expressed in the context of the guidance events (not just in heterologous cells).</p></disp-quote><p>To survey alternative splicing events surrounding the deleted exon 6b, we performed RT-PCR to amplify the coding sequences between exons 5 and 8, which encode the Ig3 to Ig4 domains. To detect potential sequence changes, we cloned the RT-PCR products and Sanger sequenced 15 individual clones from the mutants. Only one product was detected, which was the e6b- isoform. The results are now included in the text and in Figure 4—figure supplement 1D.</p><p>To confirm that <italic>Robo1/2</italic> isoforms are comparably expressed within axons in the gain of function assays, we performed immunohistochemistry on spinal cord sections and found that different isoforms were overexpressed to similar levels and the overexpressed proteins could be detected on both pre- and post-crossing axons. The results are now included in Figure 5C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The reviewers ask you to probe with quantitative methods whether there are any changes in total Robo1/2 mRNAs or proteins in the mutants, because the staining in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 are not quantitative and the other functional experiments involve overexpression, which are difficult to interpret.</p><p>Thus, we ask that you to assess RNA and protein levels, as well as splice junctions, in NOVA1/2 DKO mice, to confirm whether the manipulations caused an indirect effect on protein or RNA stability. The outcome could change the interpretation of your results but may also strengthen your conclusions on splice isoforms.</p></disp-quote><p>Using quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, we assessed the total mRNA and proteins levels of Robo1/2, respectively, in Nova1/2 dKO. We found that the levels were comparable to those in WT. We also cloned and sequenced the RT-PCR products from exons 5-8 in Nova dKO and confirmed that there was no cryptic splice site being used in Nova dKO. Using quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, we also examined the total mRNA and protein levels in exon 6b deletion mutants and did not detect any significant changes from WT levels. The results are included in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B and in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>II) Textual additionsa) Figure 1 shows that Nova1/2 mutants have a clear change in post-crossing trajectories, causing axons to angle away from the midline. While this may reflect changes in Robo-mediated repulsion, the text should consider the possibility that the post-crossing errors caused by Nova1/2 mutations also alter Netrin guidance. A study by Shoja-Taheri, et al., 2015 showed similar post-crossing errors in Netrin1 mutant hindbrain commissural axons, and explant experiments provided support for the retention of post-crossing commissural axon responsiveness to Netrin midline attraction. Given the similarity in axon responses, and your previous evidence of Nova1/2 regulation of Netrin/DCC signaling, the Shoja-Taheri paper should be cited and considered in interpreting the post-crossing trajectories.</p></disp-quote><p>The previous finding by Shoja-Taheri et al., is indeed crucial for our interpretation. The Shoja-Taheri paper shows that Netrin signaling regulates post-crossing projection of commissural axons in the hindbrain, but not in the spinal cord. Our observation in the spinal cord is consistent with these findings. We have modified the text to clarify Netrin’s role in the postcrossing errors in Nova1/2 mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Another reviewer request is that the Discussion section would be improved by integrating the Robo1/2 splicing evidence with the other previously identified mechanisms for Robo1/2 regulation. How do you weigh the relative importance of the other levels of regulation, such as receptor localization, interaction with other receptors and other signaling systems, etc. An obvious question to raise is to what extent that the regulatory steps may interact or be dependent on each other: are they hierarchical, or additive? Could the splice isoforms be differentially regulated by receptor trafficking mechanisms, for example?</p></disp-quote><p>We have significantly revised the text. We have discussed how ROBO splice isoforms may be regulated at different levels, such as in trafficking. We have discussed how ROBO isoforms may interact with other signaling pathways. We have also included discussions on the relationship between midline attraction and repulsion and the role of NOVA in both events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) A major issue is the conflict between the present results and those of your previous study -i.e., that both DCC and Robo splicing can rescue the Nova1/2 DKO phenotype. Previous work from your lab has implicated Nova1 and 2 in the control of alternative splicing of the Netrin receptor DCC (2016).</p><p> <italic>You show that DCC and Nova mutants result in strikingly similar phenotypes with similar severity in terms of midline crossing defects. Rescue experiments indicating that expression of specific Nova-dependent splice variants of DCC can restore midline crossing in Nova mutants, together with a number of</italic> in vitro assays, argue that Nova and DCC function together to regulate axon growth across the midline. In the present paper, you begin by showing that Nova1/2, DCC triple mutants have even stronger defects than DCC or Nova alone, suggesting that Nova and DCC act in parallel (Figure 1).</p><p>Moreover, why should both over-expressing DCC, and reducing Robo lead to a suppression of the Nova phenotypes? This is particularly puzzling given that in your prior work, you found that in contrast to expression of DCC (which rescues Nova mutants) that expression of Robo3 (which should attenuate Robo repulsion to some degree) has no effect (2016, Figure 8). In contrast, in the current work, you detect trans-heterozygous interactions between Robo3 and the Nova genes that reveal striking LOF phenotypes and suggest that Nova functions with Robo3 (Figure 2).</p><p>The reviewers thus urge you to reconcile this apparent disconnect in the Discussion section, especially the new genetic interactions with Robo3, since your previous study argued for the specificity of Nova function with DCC and showed that Robo3 was unable to rescue Nova phenotypes. You should also consider including DCC in your current model in Figure 8.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an important issue and we have revised the Results section, the Discussion section and the model in Figure 8 to better demonstrate the relationship between Nova and Dcc, and between Nova and Robo. To briefly summarize the changes here, we have found that the midline crossing defects in Nova1/2 mutants are twofold. One involves the reduction of DCC attraction, which impairs axonal outgrowth and causes fewer axons to reach the midline. The other is blocked crossing by axons that are able to reach the midline, which we show in this study results from elevated ROBO repulsion. In Dcc; Nova1/2 triple KO, both defects are manifested, in that Dcc KO blocks axons from reaching the midline (Nova1/2 dKO is loss of function but not completely null in this aspect), and elevated ROBO in Nova1/2 dKO blocks half of the axons at the midline from entering. We previously showed that restoring DCC<sub>long</sub> expression in Nova mutants is able to rescue axonal outgrowth and axonal attraction toward the midline (i.e. we quantified the amount of axons that were able to arrive at the midline in 2016). Here, we further show that restoring Robo isoform expression, by reducing e6b+ levels, enables midline entry within axons that are able to reach the midline. By contrast, overexpressing Robo3.1, which represses elevated Robo repulsion, is not sufficient to restore axonal outgrowth and attraction toward the midline (2016). Instead, Robo3 and Nova1/2 have a synergistic interaction in allowing midline entry, as both groups of genes downregulate ROBO activity. We also considered the possibilities that elevated ROBO repulsion can reduce the amount of axons reaching the midline and that dampened DCC attraction can block crossing. Given that projecting toward the midline can be restored by DCC isoform expression and that blocked crossing can be largely rescued by restoring Robo isoform expression, the alternative scenarios are unlikely to make major contributions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved and the reviewers thought your amendments were appropriate and sufficient to move forward. They continue to be concerned that the read-outs for phenotypes from dye tracing or antibody labeling to indicate bundle thickness, etc. are semi-quantitative, and that measurements of Robo1/2 mRNA and protein levels are limited by analysis of whole spinal cord rather than relevant cell populations within the spinal cord. In addition, questions remain about the differential action of the 6b+ vs 6b- isoforms. Nonetheless, they feel that the study does highlight a critical function of a micro exon</italic> in vivo.</p><p>However, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. As Reviewing Editor, I found that the Abstract, Discussion section and model in Figure 8 need further revision; the revisions listed would make the results more accessible and exhibit your story in the best light.</p><p>1) Your summary of results in the Introduction is very clear: &quot;Here we report that Robo1/2 alternative splicing at microexon 6b is crucial for axon guidance and is controlled by the NOVA (Neuro-oncological ventral antigen) family of splicing factors…. We show that loss of Nova1/2 alters the expression of exon 6b and leads to severe midline crossing and postcrossing guidance defects. Genetically restoring the expression profile of Robo1/2 exon 6b is able to reverse these defects in Nova mutants. Interestingly, exon 6b alternative isoforms display distinct guidance activities and their production is developmentally regulated. Consequently, ROBO-mediated repulsion is not uniformly repressed precrossing as previously believed, but is instead activated initially to block premature crossing and is sufficiently blocked during crossing.&quot;</p><p>The Abstract, however, is very vague and does not inform the reader on the results. You do not indicate that microexon 6b splice variants of Robo1/2 are controlled by Nova1/2. The abstract should be rewritten to be more precise and reflective of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the Abstract to summarize our results more precisely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Likewise, the beginning of the Discussion section should summarize the results more concisely, as in the paragraph at the end of the Introduction. The remainder of the Discussion section wanders and there is a degree of hand-waving. Your findings and the advances they make in the control of DCC-Netrin and Robo-Slit signaling should be stated more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the beginning of the Discussion section to better summarize the significance of our findings.
