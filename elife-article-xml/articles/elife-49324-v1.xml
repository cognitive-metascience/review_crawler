pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49324.001</object-id><p>A longstanding question is how influenza virus evolves to escape human immunity, which is polyclonal and can target many distinct epitopes. Here, we map how all amino-acid mutations to influenzaâs major surface protein affect viral neutralization by polyclonal human sera. The serum of some individuals is so focused that it selects single mutations that reduce viral neutralization by over an order of magnitude. However, different viral mutations escape the sera of different individuals. This individual-to-individual variation in viral escape mutations is <italic>not</italic> present among ferrets that have been infected just once with a defined viral strain. Our results show how different single mutations help influenza virus escape the immunity of different members of the human population, a phenomenon that could shape viral evolution and disease susceptibility.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49324.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human immune system protects the body from repeat attacks by remembering past infections. However, a typical person comes down with the flu every five to seven years. This is because flu viruses rapidly evolve to bypass our defenses. So, after a few years, the viruses look so different that the immune system no longer recognizes them.</p><p>The immune system recognizes flu viruses by producing proteins known as antibodies, which can bind to the virus and prevent it from infecting cells. Many of these antibodies bind to a protein on the surface of the virus called hemagglutinin, but each anti-flu antibody recognizes only a small region of the protein. This means that to escape recognition by a single antibody, all the virus needs to do is wait for a lucky mutation to change the part of hemagglutinin recognized by that antibody. But humans make many different antibodies. To escape them all, flu viruses would need lots of lucky mutations. So how do flu viruses keep winning the evolutionary lottery?</p><p>To answer this question, Lee et al. made all the possible individual mutations to the hemagglutinin protein of a human flu virus. A pool of these viruses was then exposed to the full mix of antibodies present in human serum (the liquid component of blood). Lee et al. then checked which mutations helped the virus survive contact with the antibodies. For most human serum samples, a single mutation was enough to allow the virus to escape most of one personâs anti-flu antibodies. This suggests that the immune response to flu is so focused on a small region of hemagglutinin that a mutation in this region can enable the virus to take a huge step towards evading immune detection.</p><p>Even more surprising was what happened when Lee et al. looked at serum from different people. A mutation that helped the virus to escape immune detection in one person often had little or no effect on escape from another personâs immunity. In other words, the lucky mutation that the virus needed to escape differed from one person to the next.</p><p>Every year there are many related flu viruses that infect humans. The results of Lee et al. suggest that people could be susceptible to different forms of the virus. Understanding how flu viruses escape immune detection in different people could help us identify which version of the virus different people are more susceptible to, and perhaps eventually better predict how the virus will evolve and spread.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd>deep mutational

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infection of humans with influenza virus elicits potent neutralizing antibodies targeting the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. These antibodies provide long-lasting immunity against the viral strain that elicited them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Couch, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davies et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Couch and Kasel, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krammer, 2019</xref>). Unfortunately, the effectiveness of this immunity against future strains is rapidly degraded by viral antigenic evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bedford et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2004</xref>), such that the typical human is infected by influenza virus roughly every 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Couch and Kasel, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kucharski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ranjeva et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Classic studies of this evolutionary process demonstrated that it is easy to experimentally select mutant viruses that escape neutralization by individual monoclonal antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yewdell et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laver et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Webster and Laver, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gerhard et al., 1981</xref>). But these same studies also found that monoclonal antibodies target a variety of non-overlapping regions on HA, such that no single viral mutation can escape a mix of antibodies targeting distinct regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yewdell et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laver et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Webster and Laver, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al., 1982</xref>). This work therefore posed a perplexing question: given that human immunity is polyclonal, how does influenza virus evolve to escape all the myriad antibody specificities in human sera?</p><p>Two primary explanations have been suggested for this conundrum. One explanation proposes that polyclonal immunity simply selects mutations that provide generalized neutralization resistance by increasing receptor avidity, without necessarily abrogating antibody binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yewdell et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hensley et al., 2009</xref>). Another explanation proposes that human immunity is sufficiently focused on one epitope in HA that single viral mutations can appreciably reduce binding by the mix of antibodies in polyclonal sera. This latter explanation has been shown to be true for the immunity of certain individuals against H1N1 influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Linderman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davis et al., 2018</xref>). It is also supported by mass spectrometry studies showing that HA-binding antibodies after vaccination are often dominated by relatively few âclonotypesâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2019</xref>), and studies with ferret sera suggesting that mutations to a small number of HA residues near the receptor binding pocket can lead to large antigenic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koel et al., 2013</xref>). Of course, how polyclonal immunity exerts selection on influenza virus may depend on the serum in question. However, although several studies have selected individual viral mutants with enhanced resistance to neutralization by human sera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DeDiego et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2016</xref>), there have been no systematic analyses of the immune selection exerted by sera from different individuals.</p><p>Here, we harness mutational antigenic profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doud et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doud et al., 2018</xref>) to map how all amino-acid mutations to HA affect neutralization of H3N2 influenza virus by human serum. We show that human serum can select single mutations that reduce viral neutralization by over an order of magnitude. Although the escape mutations usually occur in a similar region on HAâs globular head, there is remarkable person-to-person variation in their antigenic effect: we identify mutations that reduce neutralization byÂ &gt;10-fold for one individualâs serum but have little effect for another individualâs serum. Our work suggests that person-to-person variation in the fine specificity of anti-influenza immunity may play a major role in shaping viral evolution and disease susceptibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutational antigenic profiling comprehensively maps immune-escape mutations</title><p>Prior work studying immune selection from polyclonal sera has used escape-mutant selections, which simply isolate individual mutant viruses with reduced neutralization sensitivity. As a more comprehensive alternative, we recently developed mutational antigenic profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doud et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doud et al., 2018</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, this approach quantifies how every amino-acid mutation to HA affects viral neutralization.

To test how a single antibody can contribute to the selection of escape mutations by polyclonal serum, we spiked an antibody that targets lower on HAâs head into serum that selects mutations at the top of HAâs head. We spiked the antibody into the serum at three concentrations. In all cases, we kept the serum at a concentration where â¼4% of the viral library survived neutralization by serum alone. The three antibody concentrations were chosen such that in the presence of antibody alone, the percents of the viral library that survived neutralization wereÂ ~25% (low concentration),Â ~5% (mid concentration), and ~2% (high concentration). In the actual selections with the mix of serum and antibody, there was combined selection from the serum and antibody, so that the percents of the library that survived neutralization were lower than those due to the serum or antibody alone. Specifically, the percents of the library that survived selection with the mix were 1.7% (low antibody), 0.16% (mid antibody), and 0.015% (high antibody); see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref> for details. These selections therefore span a range in which the antibody is a modest versus dominant contributor to the overall neutralizing activity of the mix.</p><p>Even when the serum was spiked with the lowest concentration of antibody, the mutational antigenic profiling showed signals of selection at sites targeted by the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). At the middle antibody concentration, selection from the antibody exceeded that from the serum, although both were still apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). At the highest antibody concentration, selection at antibody-targeted sites completely overwhelmed selection at serum-targeted sites. These results do not imply a loss of serum activity when antibody is added, but rather indicate that at high concentration the antibody completely dominates the neutralizing activity of the mix, and so exerts all the measurable immune selection. But the dominance of a few sites in one of our antigenic maps does not imply that there are no antibodies targeting other sitesâonce a mutation escapes the dominant antibody specificity, mutations at other more weakly targeted sites would begin to have measurable antigenic effects.

This mutation introduces a N-linked glycosylation motif near the top of HAâs head. K160T appeared among natural human H3N2 viruses in late 2013 and is now present in the majority of circulating viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In addition, K160T and mutations at three of the sites strongly selected by just some sera (144, 159, and 193) distinguish the 3C2.A and 3C3.A clades that currently circulate in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bedford and Neher, 2018</xref>). Although the number of sera that we have characterized is too small to draw conclusions about population-level immunity, it is likely that evolutionary selection on a viral mutation depends both on how many individuals have immunity that is affected by the mutation and the magnitude of the antigenic effect in those individuals.</p><p>Notably, the amino-acid that emerges at a site in nature is not always the one that our experiments map as being under the strongest immune selection. There are several possible reasons: First, our experiments probe all amino-acid mutations but natural evolution is mostly limited to single-nucleotide changes. For instance, L157D is the largest-effect mutation at site 157 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) but L157S appears in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>)âlikely because S but not D is accessible from L by a single-nucleotide change. Second, natural evolution selects for viral replication and transmission as well as immune escape. Finally, the context of a mutation may influence its effect: for instance, F159Y has spread in nature but was not selected in our experiments, perhaps because in nature this mutation co-occurred with secondary changes such as N225D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jorquera et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, it is now feasible to also make high-throughput measurements of how mutations to H3N2 HA affect viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) and epistatic interactions among sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), so it may eventually be possible to build evolutionary models that incorporate all these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luksza and LÃ¤ssig, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Neher et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have mapped the selection that polyclonal human sera exert on all amino-acid mutations to a H3N2 influenza virus HA. Many sera are highly focused, and select single viral mutations that reduce neutralization by over an order of magnitude. This basic finding that human serum can be focused is consistent with other recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Linderman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davis et al., 2018</xref>). But because our experiments mapped selection on all mutations, we were able to systematically quantify the extent of focusing and compare its targets across sera.</p><p>A striking result is that the targets of serum selection vary widely from person to person. Viral mutations that greatly reduce neutralization by one individualâs serum sometimes have no effect for another individualâs serum, which is instead affected by different mutations. Our results suggest a model in which a virus with a single mutation could be strongly favored in pockets of the human population with immunity focused on that site. Does this type of selection actually drive influenza virus evolution? Many of the mutations mapped in our experiments are at sites that have recently substituted in nature, suggesting that selection from focused human sera may be relevant to viral antigenic drift. However, it is important to note that we performed our selections using near-neutralizing concentrations of relatively potent human sera. There is evidence that sub-neutralizing serum concentrations more often select generalized resistance mutations that increase receptor avidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yewdell et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hensley et al., 2009</xref>). Both types of selection may occur in nature, and understanding their roles in shaping influenza virus evolution will require comparing the serum focusing of individuals with the viral strains that actually infect them.</p><p>The sera that we profiled predominantly focus on the portion of HA classically categorized as antigenic region B, consistent with other studies reporting that this region is immunodominant in recent H3N2 strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Popova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Broecker et al., 2018</xref>). However, our results highlight the limitations of subdividing HA into broad antigenic regions. These regions were originally defined based on the idea that a mutation selected by one antibody targeting a region often also abrogated binding of other antibodies targeting that region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Webster and Laver, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wiley et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al., 1982</xref>). But our results show that different mutations in the same antigenic region can have very different effects across sera. The specificity of human sera is therefore more fine-grained than the classical categorization of HA into antigenic regions.</p><p>It is important to note that our experiments only mapped in vitro immune selection exerted by neutralizing anti-HA antibodies in serum. During actual human infections, antibodies to HA can also exert selection by non-neutralizing mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vanderven et al., 2018</xref>), activation of complement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rattan et al., 2017</xref>), and inhibition of the viral neuraminidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kosik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, antibodies in serum are mostly of the IgG class, but IgA antibodies predominate in the upper airway mucosa where human influenza virus typically replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gould et al., 2017</xref>). But despite these caveats, many studies have shown that neutralizing serum activity is a strong correlate of protection against influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hobson et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wagner et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krammer, 2019</xref>), so mapping selection from such serum provides an important if incomplete picture of the selection that human immunity imposes on the virus.</p><p>Why is the neutralizing activity of human polyclonal sera often so focused? One possibility is that very few distinct antibodies are responsible for the anti-HA activity of any given serum. Indeed, multiple studies have shown that relatively few clonotypes comprise the majority of the anti-HA serum repertoire of a single individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings further suggest that either most of these clonotypes target the same sites in HA, or that the serumâs neutralizing activity is due to very few of the clonotypes. In support of the second idea, recent work has shown that as an individual ages, much of the antibody response is diverted to non-neutralizing epitopes because sites targeted by potently neutralizing antibodies change during viral evolution, while non-neutralizing epitopes are more often conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henry et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ranjeva et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Prior work has shown that exposure history shapes human immunity to influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gostic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cobey and Hensley, 2017</xref>), and variation in exposure history is a plausible cause of the person-to-person variation we observe in the antigenic effects of viral mutations. A role for exposure history is further suggested by the lack of variation in immune selection among ferrets that have been experimentally infected just once with a defined viral strain.

This âsignificanceâ calculation is heuristic, and involves using robust regression to fit a gamma distribution to all of the positive site differential selection values, equating the p-value to the fraction of the distribution â¥ that siteâs differential selection, and then calling âsignificantâ sites that have a false discovery rate â¤Â 0.05.

It uses a novel (though previously described) technique developed in the Bloom lab to define the routes of antigenic escape from monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal sera in influenza HA. It represents a major step forward in our understanding, in particular:</p><p>1) Demonstrating that, surprisingly, significant escape can be obtained by a single AA change in HA despite multiple specificities of the response.</p><p>2) Different individuals at a given point in time (approximately) have very different polyclonal specificities and thus routes of escape.</p><p>3) The situation is different in ferrets that have received only one flu infection, suggesting (though not demonstrating, as this would require first-infection humans and multiple-infection ferrets) that the difference might be history of infection.</p><p>Obviously this raises many questions, most notably that raised in the Discussion of why a single mutation can create significant escape. But this is a large and comprehensive study that suggests a continuing line of research, and is certainly substantial enough for an <italic>eLife</italic> paper. Congratulations to the authors. Also commendable are the depth of assay validation shown in the figures, the availability of code, and the explanation of the numbering system used in the manuscript, which is easy to understand and makes the data much more accessible for non-aficionados.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should try to define a more quantitative null expectation of person-to-person variation. While the results show obvious differences in the escape mutants selected between individuals, is there a way to quantify exactly how the diversity of escape mutants among humans differs from the diversity of escape mutants among ferrets? Perhaps a beta diversity-like metric would provide a more precise measure of the difference in mutational profiles between individuals and facilitate a quantitative comparison of the human and ferret results.</p><p>2) While the results linking the natural diversity of influenza to the selected mutants are suggestive, the reviewers found claims about the relationship to global evolution difficult to fully justify. Specifically, given the small number of individuals in this study, it is unclear how we can classify a particular selective pressure being present in &quot;only a subset&quot; vs &quot;many individuals.&quot; If such claims are to be made, a more explicit link needs to be made between the results presented in the manuscript the fraction of the global population that may exert a particular selective pressure on influenza. Also, while the results involving the 53 year-old patient suggest stability of selective pressure over short timescales, that stability over longer timescales may be important to explaining global patterns of influenza evolution. This additional work is not essential, but tempering this section may be called for.</p><p>3) The authors focus only on in vitro neutralization, which is fine. However, antibodies have many functions and in vitro neutralization doesn't always correlate well with protection in vivo. Other antibodies that are present (HA side binders, stalk binders, non-neutralizing antibodies, antibodies that bind HA but inhibit NA etc.) might not show much activity in an in vitro entry inhibition assay but might be highly relevant in vivo. There is nothing wrong with using an in vitro assay here and the take away points from the study are important. But the above needs to be discussed and it needs to be pointed out that many other factors might influence drift. Also please discuss why such high titers were present (&gt;1:10,000), this will be a surprise to many readers.</p><p>4) The authors dilute the serum to approximately 1 IC90. By doing that, the effect of other antibodies present at lower titers that potentially target other sites is diminished or completely eliminated. The serum dilutions used should be stated and this should be discussed.</p><p>5) While IgG (which forms the majority of serum antibodies) protects the lung and is important for lower respiratory tract infections it is unlikely that it drives drift. Please add to the Discussion that the vast majority of influenza virus infections are restricted to the upper respiratory tract which is protected by IgA1.</p><p>6) In a way it is concerning that mAb spiked into serum kind of 'takes over', diminishing the effect of the antibodies in serum in the set up used. This might be an artifact of the library system or the fact that the serum is strongly diluted. But this discrepancy needs to be pointed out because it suggests that one dominant antibody clonotype in serum could skew what the authors see when they perform their analysis. It really begs the question why serum neutralizing activity seems to become irrelevant as soon as highly neutralizing mAb is present? One possible explanation is, that the mAb actually sterically blocks binding of the dominant neutralizing antibody in serum? But then, mutants that escape the mAb should still be neutralized by serum antibody? Please clarify.</p><p>7) Discussion section: &quot;the importance of history is demonstrated by the lack of variation among ferrets that have been experimentally infected just once with a defined viral strain.&quot; This is exactly right, but then there should not be a claim anywhere in the paper that humans and ferrets are different, but rather that adult humans (with presumed multiple infections) and ferrets after a single infection are different. I agree that history rather than host biology seems the more likely explanation, but in the current study the two are confounded.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49324.049</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should try to define a more quantitative null expectation of person-to-person variation.

We were unfamiliar with âbeta diversity,&quot; but it indeed is an excellent statistic for this type of comparison. We have now used beta diversity to compare how variable the ferret sera are in terms of the sites where they exert selection relative to the two groups of human sera. Indeed, the ferret sera exhibit substantially lower beta diversity than both groups of human sera, using either the Shannon or Simpson index. We have added these results for the Simpson index (which seems most appropriate as it emphasizes the sites of strongest selection) to the Results section where we compare the ferret sera to the human sera.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the results linking the natural diversity of influenza to the selected mutants are suggestive, the reviewers found claims about the relationship to global evolution difficult to fully justify.

We have removed the text about âonly a subset&quot; and âmany individuals&quot;, and instead simply note that some sites that evolve in nature are selected by only some sera that we tested. We then added the following sentence to underscore that our sample size is too small to draw more than these anecdotal observations:</p><p>âAlthough the number of sera that we have characterized is too small to draw conclusions about population-level immunity, it is likely that evolutionary selection on a viral mutation depends both on how many individuals have immunity that is affected by the mutation and the magnitude of the antigenic effect in those individuals.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors focus only on in vitro neutralization, which is fine.

We have added a full paragraph to the Discussion that emphasizes how neutralizing anti-HA serum antibodies are an incomplete measure of immunity during actual human infections:</p><p>âIt is important to note that our experiments only mapped in vitro immune selection exerted by neutralizing anti-HA antibodies in serum. During actual human infections, antibodies to HA can also exert selection by non-neutralizing mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytoxicity (He et al., 2016; Vandervan et al., 2018), activation of complement (Rattan et al., 2017), and inhibition of the viral neuraminidase (Kosik et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019). In addition, antibodies in serum are mostly of the IgG class, but IgA antibodies predominate in the upper airway mucosa where human influenza virus typically replicates (Gould et al., 2017). But despite these caveats, many studies have shown that neutralizing serum activity is a strong correlate of protection against influenza (Hobson et al., 1972; Wagner et al., 1987; Krammer, 2019), so mapping selection from such serum provides an important if incomplete picture of the selection that human immunity imposes on the virus.â</p><p>We have also elaborated on why the serum neutralizing titers were so high. We explain that we pre-screened the human sera to find samples that had high activity in order to allow us to potently neutralize the viral library. As suggested by the reviewers, we have also added a sentence to clearly emphasize that this pre-screening means that the sera we examine has quite high titers:</p><p>âNotably, this pre-screening means that all the sera that we characterized had high neutralizing activity, with inhibitory concentrations 50% (IC50s) ranging from ~1:800 to ~1:3,000 (Supplementary File 2).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors dilute the serum to approximately 1 IC90. By doing that, the effect of other antibodies present at lower titers that potentially target other sites is diminished or completely eliminated. The serum dilutions used should be stated and this should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that this is an important point. We indeed performed the selections with high but not completely neutralizing serum concentrations (typically around the IC95). This is a crucial point to make clear, as the reviewers are correct that at these relatively high concentrations we are primarily seeing the effect of the antibodies that most strongly contribute to serum neutralization.</p><p>In fact, we already give the exact serum dilutions used in Supplementary file 3, and the exact percent of the library surviving each selection in Supplementary file 4. But the reviewers are correct that this information was somewhat buried. In addition, it's not easy to interpret the meaning of any particular serum dilution without also examining the overall potency of that serum to know how much neutralization occurred.</p><p>Therefore, we have made an addition that should make all of this transparently clear to the reader: in all of the figures showing serum mapping (Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5), we have added dashed vertical lines on the neutralization curve at the serum concentration used. These lines therefore explicitly show the serum dilution in the context of a curve showing the serum potency, so the reader can immediately understand not only the concentration but how high it is relative to the serum's neutralizing activity. In addition, we have added text to the figure legends explaining these lines, and text to the Results and Discussion emphasizing that these concentrations mean we primarily see selection from the antibodies that most strongly contribute to serum neutralization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) While IgG (which forms the majority of serum antibodies) protects the lung and is important for lower respiratory tract infections it is unlikely that it drives drift. Please add to the Discussion that the vast majority of influenza virus infections are restricted to the upper respiratory tract which is protected by IgA1.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have added this caveat to the Discussion in a new paragraph, which discusses IgA versus IgG as well as the role of non-neutralizing antibodies. See our response to major point (3) above for the full text of the new paragraph we have added on these topics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In a way it is concerning that mAb spiked into serum kind of 'takes over', diminishing the effect of the antibodies in serum in the set up used. This might be an artifact of the library system or the fact that the serum is strongly diluted.

One possible explanation is, that the mAb actually sterically blocks binding of the dominant neutralizing antibody in serum? But then, mutants that escape the mAb should still be neutralized by serum antibody? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>These are good points, and we have substantially expanded the text discussing Figure 7 to address these points. This expanded text focuses on two main points:</p><p>First, we point out the fact that our experiments identify the mutations with the largest relative effect on viral neutralization, but do not measure the absolute effect of any given mutation on antibody binding. In other words, once a single antibody dominates the neutralization (as the monoclonal antibody does in the spike-in experiments in Figure 7), only mutations in its epitope will have effects because escaping other antibodies no longer appreciably changes neutralization. But this fact does not mean that no antibodies are binding other sites, it just means that these other antibodies are sufficiently minor contributors to overall neutralization that mutating their epitopes have minimal effects.</p><p>Second, it is possible (as the reviewer suggests) that there could be non-additive effects such as steric hindrance, and we now explicitly discuss this. Importantly, even with these effects, we can still map escape mutations. The reason is that although mutants that escape the monoclonal antibody would then be bound by other serum antibodies, these other serum antibodies are less important for overall neutralization, so mutants that escape the monoclonal antibody will still be the most favored (enriched in our experiment), even if they are still partially neutralized by other serum antibodies. The reason is that we are using high but not completely saturating serum concentrations (usually around the IC95). If we used extremely high saturating amounts of serum, then we would expect no single mutation to ever escape if the serum was polyclonal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion section: &quot;the importance of history is demonstrated by the lack of variation among ferrets that have been experimentally infected just once with a defined viral strain.&quot; This is exactly right, but then there should not be a claim anywhere in the paper that humans and ferrets are different, but rather that adult humans (with presumed multiple infections) and ferrets after a single infection are different. I agree that history rather than host biology seems the more likely explanation, but in the current study the two are confounded.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that differences in exposure history are the most likely cause of the large differences between the human and ferret sera. The reviewers are correct that in some places we did not clearly articulate this fact, and instead simply referred to differences between ferrets and humans without clearly emphasizing that the ferrets were singly infected. We have therefore revised the manuscript to ensure that every place where the differences between the human and ferret sera are mentioned, we also clearly emphasize that the ferrets were infected just once. This includes an edit to the Abstract, several edits to the Results section on the ferret sera, and an edit to the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
