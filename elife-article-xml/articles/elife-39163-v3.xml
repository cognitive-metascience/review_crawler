These pre-60S particles mature by transiently interacting with various assembly factors. The ~5000 amino-acid AAA+ ATPase Rea1 (or Midasin) generates force to mechanically remove assembly factors from pre-60S particles, which promotes their export to the cytosol. Here we present three Rea1 cryoEM structures. We visualise the Rea1 engine, a hexameric ring of AAA+ domains, and identify an α-helical bundle of AAA2 as a major ATPase activity regulator. The α-helical bundle interferes with nucleotide-induced conformational changes that create a docking site for the substrate binding MIDAS domain on the AAA +ring. Furthermore, we reveal the architecture of the Rea1 linker, which is involved in force generation and extends from the AAA+ ring. The data presented here provide insights into the mechanism of one of the most complex ribosome maturation factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Rea1</kwd><kwd>midasin</kwd><kwd>CryoEM</kwd><kwd>ribosome maturation</kwd><kwd>AAA+ protein</kwd><kwd>molecular machine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Région Grand Est</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>jeunes chercheurs fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sosnowski</surname><given-names>Piotr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ATIP-Avenir</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDP 0B1INSB-HS-9ADO1051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Helgo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004100</institution-id><institution>Labex</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABEX-30-HS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Helgo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The high-resolution structure of Rea1, an essential ribosome maturation factor in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, explains how the ATPase domain is regulated and reveals the linker domain, the mechanical element carrying out ribosome remodeling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic ribosome assembly is tightly controlled by more than 200 assembly factors to ensure faithful protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Thomson et al., 2013</xref>).

The AAA+ (<italic>A</italic>TPases <italic>A</italic>ssociated with various cellular <italic>A</italic>ctivities) family member Rea1 (or Midasin) consists of nearly 5000 amino acids and generates force to mechanically remove assembly factors. Rea1 pulls out the Ytm1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sahasranaman et al., 2011</xref>) to promote the transfer of pre-60S particles from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassler et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Rea1 also removes the assembly factor Rsa4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ulbrich et al., 2009</xref>), which triggers a signalling pathway that ultimately recruits RanGTP to pre-60S particles to export them to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ulbrich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Matsuo et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Like in other AAA +machines, the Rea1 ring AAA+ domains are arranged as inter-domain modules. Each AAAL, except AAA1L, is tightly associated with the AAAS of the previous domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). AAA1L would be expected to interact with AAA6S, but this domain is absent in Rea1 and its place is taken by the NTD.</p><p>The nucleotide-binding sites of AAA+ proteins are located at the interfaces between neighbouring AAA+ modules, which carry the conserved Walker-A, Walker-B, and arginine finger motifs responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wendler et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B,C</xref>). ATP binding brings these neighbouring modules into close contact to induce ATP hydrolysis. In Rea1, the AAA2, AAA3, AAA4, and AAA5 sites are functional, while AAA1 and AAA6 lack the Walker-B motif involved in ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kawashima et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D</xref>).</p><p>In the structure presented here, the nucleotide binding sites of AAA1 and AAA6 are closed and show densities consistent with a bound nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A,B</xref>).

In the dynein structure, the AAA1 site is trapped in the ATP-hydrolysis transition state due to the presence of ADP.vanadate. All catalytic residues of this site contact the nucleotide and have the right conformation to support hydrolysis, indicating that the site is completely closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>). We also carried out a comparison with the dynein AAA3 site, which is bound to ADP and, although overall still closed, appears slightly more open than the AAA1 site. The comparison was done by analysing the distance between the H4 α-helix, which carries the arginine finger, and the closest phosphate group of the nucleotide bound to the Walker-A motif of the H1 α-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7A–D</xref>). This distance is around 8 Å in the case of the dynein AAA1 site and around 12 Å in the case of the dynein AAA3 site. The equivalent distances in the Rea1 AAA1 and AAA6 sites are around 10 Å and 8 Å, respectively. For the Rea1 AAA1 site, the degree of closure is intermediate between the completely closed dynein AAA1 site and the ‘less closed’ dynein AAA3 site. The Rea1 AAA6 appears to be already fully closed in the ADP state.</p><p>In contrast to the AAA1 and AAA6 sites, the AAA2 and AAA5 nucleotide-binding sites of the Rea1 AAA+ ring are wide open as indicated by large gaps between modules AAA2/AAA3 and AAA5/AAA6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,C</xref>). The open state of the latter sites is stabilised by the AAA2L-H2α insert which sits in the AAA+ ring centre.

In the APO and AMPPNP states, the AAA+ ring was extended by an additional EM density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Docking the Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α APO structure into a recently published cryoEM structure of an Rsa4 containing Rea1-pre-60S particle complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrio-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>) would place the extra AAA+ ring density directly above the N-terminal MIDO domain of Rsa4, which is known to bind to the Rea1 MIDAS domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ulbrich et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). The docking revealed that that the potential MIDAS domain density would overlap with a so far unidentified density in the Rea1-pre-60S particle map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). We hypothesised that the extra AAA+ ring density is the Rea1 MIDAS domain. To confirm our interpretation, we deleted the MIDAS domain in the ΔAAA2L-H2α background and investigated the APO and AMPPNP states of the Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α_ΔMIDAS double deletion mutant by negative stain electron microscopy. In support of our interpretation as the MIDAS domain, the extra density had disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C–F</xref>). In contrast to the APO and AMPPNP states, there was no evidence for MIDAS domain AAA+ ring docking in the ATP or ADP states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>).</p><p>In order to gain insight into the molecular basis for MIDAS domain docking, we decided to determine the cryoEM structure of the Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α AMPPNP state. The overall resolution of the reconstruction was 7.8 Å. The reconstruction revealed a density consistent with a MIDAS domain in-between the AAA3 and AAA4 modules, above AAA2S and AAA3S, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As in the case of the Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α APO state, docking of this structure into the Rsa4 containing pre-60S structure would place the MIDAS domain in close contact with its Rsa4 substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5E</xref>). Since the auto-inhibitory AAA2L-H2α insert has been deleted, the presence of AMPPNP is able to induce movements between the AAA+ modules of the AAA+ ring. Comparing the AMPPNP cryoEM structures of the Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α mutant and Rea1 allowed us to analyse these conformational changes and investigate how they contribute to the formation of the MIDAS domain binding site. The NTD, AAA1, AAA6 and the linker can be superimposed as a single rigid body, whereas the AAA2-AAA5 part has moved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6A</xref>). The most drastic difference is apparent for the AAA4 module. Since the AAA2L-H2α insert is no longer pushing against AAA4L, the AAA4 module is free to move towards the central pore of the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Two rod-shaped cryoEM densities emerge from AAA4L that were not present in the Rea1 AMPPNP map. We interpret these densities as two α-helices of the previously disordered AAA4L-H2α insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,E</xref>). The AAA4L-H2α insert occupies the area taken by AAA2L-H2α in the Rea1 AMPPNP map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). It is located in close proximity to the AAA5L H2 and AAA6L H4-S3 β-sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), which contact each other because the AAA5 module has moved towards the AAA6 module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Contacts between AAA4L-H2α and the β-sheets inserts of AAA5L and AAA6L might help stabilising the movement of the AAA4 module towards the AAA+ ring centre.</p><p>Another prominent conformational change is evident for the AAA3 module. It has moved around 17 Å vertically towards the H2α insert side of the AAA+ ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The consequence of the combined movements of the AAA4 and AAA3 modules is that their small domains, AAA3S and AAA2S, adopt the right orientation with respect to each other to from the MIDAS domain binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The first Rea1 high-resolution structure has allowed us to gain important insights into the architecture and regulation of this essential molecular machine. The most prominent feature of the Rea1 AAA+ ring is the AAA2L-H2α insert that sits like a plug in the central pore of the AAA+ ring. In other AAA+ family members, such as the mitochondrial protease YME1, the disaggregase Hsp104, or the unfoldase VAT, the AAA+ ring pore interacts with their respective substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gates et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Puchades et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ripstein et al., 2017</xref>). Instead of binding to the Ytm1 or Rsa4 substrates, the Rea1 AAA+ ring centre hosts a structural element that regulates the ATPase activity. Its central position allows the AAA2L-H2α insert to influence all conserved Rea1 ATP hydrolysis sites in parallel. The structural and ATPase data presented here suggest that Rea1 exists in an auto-inhibited state with impaired hydrolytic activity at sites AAA2-AAA5. However, previous work has established the importance of ATP hydrolysis at these sites for yeast growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kawashima et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the AAA3 site has also been directly implicated in Rsa4 assembly factor removal and pre-60S particle export to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrio-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). This raises the question how Rea1 might be activated to carry out its essential function. Recent studies have established that the AAA2L-H2α insert interacts with the Rix1 component of pre-60S particles to recruit Rea1 to its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrio-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). We suggest here that this binding event relocates the AAA2L-H2α insert from the AAA+ ring pore to stimulate the Rea1 ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In support of this idea, a recent cryoEM structure of a Rea1-pre-60S particle complex has revealed a density extending from the Rea1 AAA+ ring centre towards Rix1 that was interpreted as the AAA2L-H2α insert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrio-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39163.022</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model for Rea1 mediated Rsa4 assembly factor removal.</title><p>In the absence of pre60S particles the Rea1 ATP-hydrolysis activity is inhibited by AAA2L-H2α. When Rea1 binds to pre60S particles, AAA2L-H2α relocates towards Rix1, and the Rea1 ATPase activity is stimulated. AAA2L-H2α removal allows nucleotide dependent conformational changes in the ring that cause a shift in the positions of the AAA3 and AAA4 modules and result in the recruitment of the MIDAS domain. The AAA+ ring binding site brings the MIDAS domain in close contact with its Rsa4 substrate. AAA6L of the AAA6 module has the ideal position to communicate ATP-dependent conformational changes of ring into the linker via its interface with the linker stem and the helix extension of the linker middle domain. The interface between linker stem and middle domain (black arrow head) might act as a pivot point during linker remodelling. The rearrangement of the linker during remodelling, and how it produces force to remove the Rsa4 engaged MIDAS domain from the AAA+ ring remains unknown (question mark).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39163-fig5-v3.tif"/></fig><p>A key question of the Rea1 mechanism is how ATP induced conformational changes in the AAA+ ring drive the remodelling of the linker to generate force for assembly factor removal. Our analysis of the AAA+ ring – linker interface identified interactions between AAA6L, the linker stem and the helix extension of the middle domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It is conceivable that a movement of AAA6L during ATP hydrolysis in the ring is transferred to the linker middle domain via the interaction between AAA6L and the middle domain helix extension. A subsequent shift in the position of the middle domain, with the linker stem as pivot point, would be suitable to disrupt the architecture of the linker top to trigger a large-scale remodelling event.</p><p>We determined Rea1 and Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α electron microscopy structures in the APO, AMPPNP, ATP, and ADP nucleotide states to get insight into Rea1 linker remodelling. However, we were not able to observe the expected large-scale rearrangement of the linker with respect to the AAA+ ring. The relative orientation between these Rea1 parts remained essentially the same in all structures. We can only speculate about the reasons for this absence of linker remodelling. One possibility would be that linker remodelling relies on critical interactions between Rea1 and the pre-60S particle so that it can only be observed when Rea1 is bound to pre-60S particles. Evidence for this hypothesis is provided by the Rea1-pre-60S particle cryoEM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrio-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). The AAA+ ring cryoEM density is much stronger than the linker cryoEM density. This suggests that the linker becomes flexible with respect to the ring when Rea1 is bound to pre-60S particles. Another possibility to explain the lack of alternative linker conformations are yet unidentified protein co-factors that participate in linker remodelling.</p><p>Our work on the Rea1 nucleotide states revealed the existence of a MIDAS domain binding site on the AAA+ ring. At the pre-60S particle, this binding site would place the MIDAS domain in direct contact with its Rsa4 substrate. The Rea1 and Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α AMPPNP structures provide strong evidence for the idea that the AAA2L-H2α insert interferes with the nucleotide-dependent conformational changes of the AAA3 and AAA4 modules that create the MIDAS domain binding site.</p><p>The D/E-rich region between the linker top2 domain and the MIDAS domain was not visible in our Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α AMPPNP map suggesting it remains flexible even when the MIDAS domain is fixed to the AAA+ ring. We observed the binding of MIDAS domain only in the APO and AMPPNP states, but not in the ATP and ADP states. This suggests that ATP hydrolysis correlates with the disappearance of the MIDAS domain binding site. When Rea1 is bound to pre-60S particles, this event might be accompanied by the removal of the Rsa4 assembly factor. The flexible D/E region between the MIDAS domain and the linker raises the question of how force can be transmitted to the MIDAS domain by a linker remodelling event. Since the Rsa4-bound MIDAS domain would be fixed on the AAA+ ring, a linker remodelling event might simply stretch the flexible D/E region and create the force for Rsa4 removal.</p><p>In summary, we presented the first Rea1 high-resolution structure and revealed the intricate subdomain architecture of the Rea1 linker. The AAA2L-H2α insert inhibits Rea1 ATPase activity as well as the formation of the MIDAS domain binding site on the AAA+ ring. Rea1 is recruited to pre-60S particles through an interaction between the AAA2L-H2α insert and Rix1. This binding event might relocate the AAA2L-H2α insert from the AAA+ ring centre to Rix1. Such a relocation event would stimulate the Rea1 hydrolysis activity and allow nucleotide driven conformational changes in the AAA+ ring that lead to the formation of the MIDAS domain binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisae</italic>)</td><td>JD1370</td><td>DOI: 10.1126/science.1212642</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>1,4-dithiotreitol (DTT)</td><td>Thermo Fisher SCIENTIFIC</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>ATP</td><td>ACROS Organics</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound</td><td>AMPPNP</td><td>Jena biosciences</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>ADP</td><td>SIGMA-ALDRICH</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound</td><td>Roche cOmplete, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor</td><td>SIGMA-ALDRICH</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)</td><td>SIGMA-ALDRICH</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)</td><td>SIGMA-ALDRICH</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Yeast Nitrogen Base without Amino acids</td><td>Formedium</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>D(+) - Glucose</td><td>Formedium</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound</td><td>D(+) - Galactose</td><td>Formedium</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>CSM, -Ura</td><td>Formedium</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Triton <break/>X-100</td><td>SIGMA-ALDRICH</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>EnzChek Phosphate Assay Kit</td><td>Thermo Fisher SCIENTIFIC</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Adobe Photoshop version 16.0.3 (for figure preparation)</td><td>Adobe Systems, Inc.

Other parts of this map were built by placing standardised α-helices and tracing the main-chain between them. Occasionally bulkier side-chains were visible that were included in the final model. The quality of the Rea1 linker map allowed de-novo building of a side-chain model. Phenix real space refine was used to refine the NTD-AAA+ ring and the linker model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). To create the Rea1 ADP AAA+ ring – linker composite model, both structures were aligned on the stem domain which was visible in both maps. For the Rea1 AMPPNP model, the Rea1 ADP model was split into the NTD-AAA+ ring linker stem and linker middle domain – linker top regions. Both regions were docked into the Rea1 AMPPNP map as two separate rigid-bodies. This initial docking already led to a close fit. Minimal rigid body fit adjustments were done for the AAA2, AAA3, AAA4, and AAA5 modules of the AAA+ ring. To create the Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α AMPPNP model, the NTD, the AAA1, and AAA6 modules, as well as the complete linker of the Rea1 ADP structure, were docked as a single rigid body into the Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α AMPPNP map. The AAA2, AAA3, AAA4, and AAA5 modules of the Rea1 ADP structure were docked as individual rigid bodies into the Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α AMPPNP map. All figures were prepared in Pymol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.2r3pre, Schrödinger, LLC) or Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). The programme Eman2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tang et al., 2007</xref>) was used for 2D projections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Negative stain sample preparation and data acquisition</title><p>Rea1 or the Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α deletion mutant in buffer B without glycerol were diluted to a final concentration of 45 nM. AMPPNP, ATP, or ADP were added to reach a final concentration of 3 mM. Negative-stain electron microscopy was performed on plasma-cleaned carbon film on 400-square-mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences). 3 μl sample was applied to the grids that were subsequently stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Data collection was done on an FEI tecnai G2 operated at 200kV and equipped with a Gatan Ultrascan 2K*2K CCD camera. Data were collected at ∼1 μm underfocus, with a pixel size of 3.629 Å and an estimated dose of 25 electrons / Å<sup>2</sup> during 1 s exposures. SerialEM was used for semiautomatic data acquisition. Around 8000 particles per data set were manually picked and processed with Relion using standard procedures. In order to not bias the orientation of the linker with respect to the AAA+ ring, the initial model consisted of the low pass filtered NTD-AAA+ ring map rescaled to the correct pixel size.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The atomic coordinates for the Rea1 AAA+ ring and the Rea1 linker in the ADP state have been deposited with PDB IDs 6HYP and 6HYD, respectively.

Rae1 belongs to the AAA family of AAA ATPase and participates in the remodeling of the large ribosomal subunit by removing several smaller associated factors during 60S biogenesis. While the importance of Rae1 in this pathway is clearly established, the molecular mechanism of these remodeling reactions is still poorly understood in large part because of a lack of structural information on the Rae1 AAA ATPase. This study presents the cryo-EM structure of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rae1, which reveals several novel structural features for this AAA ATPase and attempts to present a plausible mechanism for its removal of effectors from the ribosome through the MIDAS domain that is disordered and not visible in this structure. This is a straightforward structure paper that will no doubt catalyze interesting mechanistic studies and it should be published.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that there were four areas that required strengthening before the work can be published: (1) Validation of the structure; (2) A deeper discussion of the structure; (3) A better and more detailed discussion of their mechanistic model; and (4) Some testing of that model. Details on these four areas follow:</p><p>1) Validation of the structure</p><p>- The manuscript is surprisingly lacking in any validation of the structure. None of the standard metrics in the field have been reported. The authors should provide the following: FSC (gold standard) curves for all refinements; FSC (model-to-map) for their final models; maps showing local resolution; locally-filtered maps (is the map in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 locally-filtered?); table with MolProbity scores and Ramachandran statistics. (Although the authors did submit a PDB validation report, these statistics need to be in the manuscript itself.) Since the final model is a composite of structures that were refined separately, these statistics should be reported for each structure. Similarly, a table (or tables) with data collection and refinement statistics should be included as a supplementary figure. It is not sufficient to include this information in the Materials and methods.</p><p>- In Materials and methods it is stated that the authors used a total electron dose of 6.6 electrons/A<sup>2</sup> ? This seems low. Can the authors check or comment?</p><p>2) Deeper discussion of the structure</p><p>- In terms of interpretation of the structure, the authors find that AAA6-AAA1 and AAA1-AAA2 interfaces are in the closed conformation. Most often, AAA+ motors only adopt a closed configuration in the ATP state, as the arg finger from the adjacent subunit contacts the ATP γ-phosphate. In the absence of the γ-phosphate, We would expect that the interfaces would resemble the post-hydrolysis 'open' state. It is interesting that these are the two sites that are expected to be incompetent for ATP hydrolysis. We feel that the authors should comment on this unexpected finding.</p><p>- Given the parallels between Rae1 and dynein, the authors should include a structural comparison between these proteins in their Discussion.</p><p>- The significance of the nucleotide state of the structure is unclear. Why was the structure solved in the presence of ADP? Since AAA1 and AAA6 lack the catalytic residue in the Walker B motif, isn't the expectation that in vivo these two subunits are always bound to ATP, not ADP (as in the reconstruction)? Can the authors comment on this? Do they have any information on an ATP bound state? What was the reason for assembling Rea1 complex in excess ADP and not ATP? What functional state do the authors think their complex represents?</p><p>3) Better and more detailed discussion of their mechanistic model</p><p>- The structure should reveal insights into the mechanism of Rea1 activity. Unfortunately, the mechanism proposed in the current manuscript is too opaque. Figure 4 should summarize the findings and indicate the authors' proposal for how Rea1 modifies the pre-60S ribosome structure. The figure does have a small conformational change that the authors propose is important for regulating ATPase activity. While this regulation is of moderate interest, this was not convincingly shown. We would hope that the structure would lead to more insights than simply 'AAA+ communicates with the linker segment' which was not a new insight. In fact, the figure shows no conformational change in this segment despite the authors spending much time in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 discussing how the ATPase activity drives conformational changes in the linker. The section describing these conformational changes was confusing and not very informative. The authors allude to a conformational change at the AAA+/stem connection, but don't describe their thoughts cogently. Alternatively, it seemed as if the authors were proposing that the Top domains may move in a ball-in-socket fashion around the middle/stem regions. Furthermore, Figure 4 makes it appear that there is no conformational change in the linker segment, which was confusing considering the discussion of conformational change. What exactly are the authors proposing for the Ytm1/Rsa4 removal mechanism?</p><p>- Given the length of the flexible D/E rich region (over 600 residues), what is the mechanism of force transmission through the MIDAS domain, which is the one that binds to the substrate? Wouldn't the length and low complexity of the D/E region allow the MIDAS domain to freely interact with its substrate anyway without needing the motion of the linker?</p><p>4) Testing of the model</p><p>- The authors should present some data from experiments testing their mechanistic model. The reviewers agreed that it should be possible to make structural predictions about the transmission of conformational changes from the motor to the linker. These could be either functional assays, or some type of EM that shows that conformational changes the model predicts do take place.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39163.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that there were four areas that required strengthening before the work can be published: (1) Validation of the structure; (2) A deeper discussion of the structure; (3) A better and more detailed discussion of their mechanistic model; and (4) Some testing of that model.

We now provide gold standard FSC curves for the refinements, model-to-map FSC’s of the structural models as well as local resolution maps for the Rea1 ADP AAA+ ring and linker maps (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), the Rea1 AMPPNP map (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and the Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α AMPPNP map (Figure 4—figure supplement 5). MolProbity scores and Ramachandran statistics for the AAA+ ring and linker models are provided in Supplementary file 1. We don’t report these values for the Rea1 AMPPNP and Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α AMPPNP structures, because they were created via rigid-body docking of the Rea1 ADP structures. CryoEM data collection statistics are also provided in Supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Materials and methods it is stated that the authors used a total electron dose of 6.6 electrons/A<sup>2</sup> ?

The total dose varied between 45 and 50 electrons/A<sup>2</sup> for the three data sets reported here.

We now discuss the degree of the closure of the Rea1 AAA1 and AAA6 nucleotide binding sites in the section”Structure of the Rea1 AAA+ ring”. We compare the Rea1 AAA1 and AAA6 sites to closed and more open AAA sites in the Rea1 related dynein motor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Given the parallels between Rae1 and dynein, the authors should include a structural comparison between these proteins in their Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been done. We have now included a section entitled “Comparison of the Rea1 and dynein AAA+ rings” analysing the similarities between both proteins. In this paragraph we point out that the geometry of the Rea1 AAA+ ring closely resembles the dynein AAA+ ring in the ADP state. The geometry of the rings can be roughly described as two halves of three domains each. In one half, the AAA+ domains are more tightly associated. In the other half they are more loosely packed. In both cases the loosely packed half of the AAA+ ring features a central AAA+ domain that is rotated with respect to the other domains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The significance of the nucleotide state of the structure is unclear.

We hypothesised that ADP might also have a stabilizing effect on Rea1 so that a potentially higher resolution might be achieved compared to other nucleotide states. We did not choose ATP because we suspected that ongoing ATP hydrolysis in our sample would introduce additional conformational heterogeneity that would lower our chances of obtaining a high-resolution cryoEM reconstruction of Rea1.</p><p>Concerning the nucleotide states of AAA1 and AAA6, we tried to fit ATP instead of ADP. However, there was not enough space for the γ-phosphate. The cryoEM structure was also obtained in the presence of 3 mM ADP which makes it likely that the observed nucleotide is ADP.</p><p>We now provide additional cryoEM structures of the AMPPNP state for wildtype Rea1 and a mutant where the AAA2L-H2α insert (the central “plug” of the ring) has been deleted. In line with our original proposal of AAA2L-H2α as auto-inhibitory regulator, these structures now clearly demonstrate that important nucleotide dependent conformational rearrangements of the ring only take place when AAA2L-H2α is not present at its center. The Rea1 ADP structure in the original manuscript as well as the additional Rea1 AMPPNP in the revised version represent the identical, auto-inhibited Rea1 state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Better and more detailed discussion of their mechanistic model</p><p>- The structure should reveal insights into the mechanism of Rea1 activity.

What exactly are the authors proposing for the Ytm1/Rsa4 removal mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to better distinguish between the structural description of Rea1 and our ideas about the Rea1 mechanism, we have split “Results and Discussion” of the original manuscript in two separate “Results” and “Discussion” sections in the revised version. In our new “The AAA+ ring – linker interface and the structure of the Rea1 linker” paragraph of the Results section we now simply describe our findings about the structural elements that make up the AAA+ ring – linker interface and point out the architecture of the linker.</p><p>We have removed the speculative parts about movements and interactions of AAA+ domains AAA6, AAA1, AAA5 as well as AAA2-AAA4 and how these might introduce linker remodelling from the “Discussion” section of the revised version. We now simply remind the reader that AAA6 is the only AAA+ domain that directly contacts the linker via interactions with the linker stem and the helix extension of the middle domain, which are completely new insights that were not obvious from previous work. We go on to briefly point out that a potential movement of AAA6 during ATP hydrolysis in the ring could be transferred to the linker middle domain via the interaction between AAA6 and the helix extension of the middle domain. A conformational shift of the middle domain might trigger a large scale remodelling event given the importance of the middle domain for the architecture of the linker top. We also clearly state that we did not observe such an event despite testing various nucleotide states of Rea1 and the Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α mutant and discuss potential reasons for this unexpected finding.</p><p>We also added the additional aspect of the AAA+ ring MIDAS domain binding site to our Discussion. We provide strong evidence that this binding site would place the MIDAS domain in direct contact with the Rsa4 substrate when Rea1 is bound to pre60S particles and that the formation of the MIDAS domain binding site is controlled by the auto-inhibitory AAA2L-H2α insert. We believe that these findings provide important additional insights into the Rea1 mechanism and that they have significantly strengthened our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Given the length of the flexible D/E rich region (over 600 residues), what is the mechanism of force transmission through the MIDAS domain, which is the one that binds to the substrate?

Since the MIDAS domains is fixed at the Rea1 AAA+ ring when it binds to its Rsa4 substrate, a linker remodelling event might simply stretch the flexible D/E region to transmit the force for Rsa4 removal to the MIDAS domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Testing of the model</p><p>- The authors should present some data from experiments testing their mechanistic model. The reviewers agreed that it should be possible to make structural predictions about the transmission of conformational changes from the motor to the linker. These could be either functional assays, or some type of EM that shows that conformational changes the model predicts do take place.</p></disp-quote><p>We decided to follow the structural approach suggested by the reviewers since structural information is ultimately needed to understand the molecular events causing Rea1 linker remodelling. We determined cryoEM structures of the Rea1 AMPPNP state and negative stain electron microscopy structures of the Rea1 APO and ATP states. However, we were not able to observe linker remodelling. We hypothesised that the auto-inhibitory AAA2L-H2α insert might have prevented linker remodelling and continued to determine negative</p><p>stain electron microscopy structures of the Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α APO, AMPPNP, ATP and ADP states. Furthermore, we also determined a cryoEM structure of the Rea1_ΔAAA2L-H2α AMPPNP state. In all these cases we did not observe Rea1 linker remodelling.</p><p>These results strongly suggest that linker remodelling on isolated Rea1 molecules cannot be induced by simply adding different nucleotides. Rea1 behaves clearly differently from the related dynein motor, where linker remodelling correlates with defined nucleotide states. In the case of Rea1, additional factors seem to be needed to induce such an event. One such potential factor could be the pre60S particle that might provide important interactions for Rea1 linker remodelling.</p><p>Since the conditions under which linker remodelling occurs could not be identified, it is at the moment impossible to evaluate the effect of mutations. Even if we would observe nucleotide dependent linker remodelling in a mutant, we would not be able to distinguish if such an event is physiological or an artefact.</p></body></sub-article></article>
