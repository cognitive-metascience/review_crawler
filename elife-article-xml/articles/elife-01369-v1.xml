A surprising paradox emerging from recent studies is that ubiquitin ligases (E3s) and deubiquitinases (DUBs), enzymes with opposing activities, can both promote ERAD. Here we demonstrate that the ERAD E3 gp78 can ubiquitinate not only ERAD substrates, but also the machinery protein Ubl4A, a key component of the Bag6 chaperone complex. Remarkably, instead of targeting Ubl4A for degradation, polyubiquitination is associated with irreversible proteolytic processing and inactivation of Bag6. Importantly, we identify USP13 as a gp78-associated DUB that eliminates ubiquitin conjugates from Ubl4A to maintain the functionality of Bag6. Our study reveals an unexpected paradigm in which a DUB prevents undesired ubiquitination to sharpen substrate specificity for an associated ubiquitin ligase partner and to promote ER quality control.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01369.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01369.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01369.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells make proteins inside a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. However, some of these proteins cannot fold into the correct shape, so cells rely on a process called the ERAD pathway to degrade and eliminate these faulty proteins. First, however, the misfolded proteins must be moved from the endoplasmic reticulum to the main body of the cell (the cytosol).</p><p>The process by which the misfolded proteins are moved through the membrane that encloses the endoplasmic reticulum is complex, with ‘ERAD machinery proteins’ playing an important role. Among them, a series of enzymes called E3 ligases ‘tag’ the faulty proteins with a small protein called ubiquitin, and a complex called the proteasome then recognizes and degrades those proteins that have been tagged with ubiquitin. However, it is not clear why the E3 ligases that tag the misfolded proteins with ubiquitin don’t also tag the machinery proteins that from complexes with the faulty proteins.</p><p>Now Liu et al. have used a combination of biochemical and genetic tools to shed light on this puzzle by studying the interaction of gp78—which is an E3 ligase—and USP13, an enzyme that opposes the actions of the E3 ligases by removing ubiquitin. Liu et al. showed that gp78 can indeed tag certain machinery proteins with ubiquitin, which would stop the removal of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum. However, USP13 opposed the action of gp78, thus allowing the removal to continue.</p><p>It has been known for some time that enzymes with opposing roles—the addition and removal of ubiquitin—can work together, but the biological significance of this phenomenon was not fully understood. The work of Liu et al. suggests that USP13 makes the elimination of misfolded proteins more efficient by ensuring that gp78 only tags those proteins that are misfolded: it does this by removing ubiquitin from proteins that should not have been tagged. A similar phenomenon is known to occur in genetics during DNA replication, with the enzyme complex that replicates the DNA including an enzyme that performs a proofreading role.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01369.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01369.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>ERAD</kwd><kwd>deubiquitinase</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin ligase</kwd><kwd>Bag6</kwd><kwd>gp78</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health Intramural Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clemons</surname><given-names>William M</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Yihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A deubiquitinase antagonizes the activity of an associated E3 ligase to prevent uncontrolled ubiquitination of a degradation machinery protein and thus maintain its functionality in protein quality control at the endoplasmic reticulum.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotic cells, secretory and membrane proteins are processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this protein maturation process, nascent polypeptides need to pass stringent checkpoints monitored by a sophisticated quality control program. Only correctly folded proteins can exit the ER and reach their final destinations, whereas terminally misfolded or unassembled polypeptides are retained and eliminated by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vembar and Brodsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). This mechanism not only adapts cells to proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balch et al., 2008</xref>), but also fine-tunes signaling processes essential for the development of multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ron and Walter, 2007</xref>).</p><p>ERAD requires retrotranslocation of misfolded polypeptides across the membrane for ubiquitination by one of a few ER-associated ubiquitin conjugating systems, each comprising a ubiquitin ligase (E3) and a cognate conjugating enzyme (E2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ye and Rape, 2009</xref>). Ubiquitin ligases are a key component of the cellular ubiquitination machinery that acts at the final step of ubiquitin transfer to ensure only certain substrates are selectively ubiquitinated in both temporally and spatially regulated manners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</xref>). Substrate specificities of E3s are thought to be an intrinsic property of these enzymes, but whether it can be modulated by additional factors is an open question. In ERAD, substrate ubiquitination occurs on the cytosolic side of the ER membranes, immediately after substrates have emerged from the ER lumen. This modification serves as a signal to recruit the p97/VCP ATPase, leading to the extraction of substrates from the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bays et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ye et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jarosch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flierman et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally, it facilitates subsequent targeting of retrotranslocated substrates to the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vembar and Brodsky, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells, the multi-spanning membrane protein gp78 is one of the most extensively studied E3s in ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). gp78 is homologous to Hrd1p, an ERAD-specific E3 in yeast proposed to form a ‘retrotranslocon’ that channels misfolded proteins out of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>). Similar to Hrd1p, gp78 also forms a large membrane complex that communicates with machinery proteins on both sides of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christianson et al., 2011</xref>), establishing it as a master regulator of retrotranslocation. On the luminal side, ER chaperones and lectins recognize and deliver misfolded proteins to a gp78-containing complex for retrotranslocation. In the cytosol, gp78 uses a VIM (VCP-interacting motif) segment to bind p97/VCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballar et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, it has a CUE (coupling ubiquitin to ER degradation) domain that recruits a multiprotein complex comprising Bag6 and its cofactors Ubl4A and Trc35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Bag6 contains an unusual chaperone ‘holdase’ activity, capable of maintaining retrotranslocated polypeptides in a soluble state to enhance their turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, Bag6 was reported to interact transiently with the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Minami et al., 2010</xref>), raising the possibility that it may facilitate substrate hand over from the gp78–p97 complex to the proteasome. Importantly, this ‘holdase’ activity can also act in conjunction with other ubiquitin ligases to help degrade defective cytosolic and mislocalized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Minami et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hessa et al., 2011</xref>), establishing Bag6 as a major E3-associated chaperone in protein quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee and Ye, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition to ubiquitin ligases and associated factors, recent studies have implicated deubiquitinases (DUBs), enzymes that cleave ubiquitin conjugates, as important regulators of ERAD. However, unlike ubiquitin ligases, the functions of DUBs in ERAD are obscure. Many DUBs involved in ERAD associate with p97/VCP either directly or indirectly. These include YOD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ernst et al., 2009</xref>), ataxin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhong and Pittman, 2006</xref>), USP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blount et al., 2012</xref>), USP13, USP50, and VCPIP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, although deubiquitination has often been reported to cause removal of the proteasome targeting signals and therefore inhibition of protein turnover, many p97-associated DUBs apparently serve as positive regulators in ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ernst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>). Several models have been proposed to explain these surprising findings, but experimental data in support of any of these models are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu and Ye, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we characterize a p97-associated deubiquitinase termed USP13. Our study reveals an unexpected interaction between USP13 and the ERAD-specific ubiquitin ligase gp78. Despite having opposing activities, USP13 can cooperate with gp78 to promote ERAD. Mechanistically, USP13 plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the substrate specificity of gp78 as in its absence ubiquitin chains assembled by gp78 can accumulate on an ERAD machinery component—the Bag6-Ubl4A-Trc35 complex that is associated with proteolytic processing of Bag6 and altered interaction between Bag6 and SGTA. Together, these results established that the activity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase can be safeguarded by an accompanying deubiquitinase to enhance its specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>USP13 and USP5 differ in both activities and interactors</title><p>USP13 shares ∼80% sequence similarity to USP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), an isopeptidase that preferentially cleaves unanchored ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reyes-Turcu et al., 2006</xref>). However, only USP13, but not USP5 has been implicated in ERAD. To understand how these homologous enzymes can have distinct functions, we first purified recombinant USP13 and USP5 from both mammalian cells and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We tested their ability to bind free ubiquitin and to cleave ubiquitin-AFC (Ub-AFC) in vitro. Interestingly, USP5 readily bound to free ubiquitin and cleaved Ub-AFC with high efficiency, whereas USP13 was almost completely inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). USP13 could not efficiently cleave K48- or K63-linked di-ubiquitin either (data not shown). We next generated and purified USP13 mutants in each of which a fragment in USP13 was replaced by a corresponding segment in USP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Ub-AFC assay showed that the chimera (USP13/5-4) in which the first 722 amino acids of USP13 were replaced with a corresponding segment in USP5 still had no deubiquitinating activity. However, further incorporation of a USP5 segment encompassing the second ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (amino acids 717–781) to USP13 (USP13/5-5) led to an activity similar to that of USP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). These data suggest that USP13 and USP5 are distinct deubiquitinases and the second UBA domain accounts for the differential activities of these enzymes.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01369.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>USP13 and USP5 have distinct activities despite sequence homology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Purified USP13 is inactive whereas USP5 is active.

To understand the role of USP13 in ERAD, we characterized its interaction with p97 using an in vitro binding assay. We immobilized purified GST-USP13 or GST-USP5 on glutathione beads and incubated the beads with recombinant p97. As a positive control, we used GST-VIMP, a known p97 interactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ye et al., 2004</xref>). As expected, the glutathione beads containing GST-VIMP pulled down p97 efficiently. By contrast, neither GST-USP13 nor GST-USP5 bound p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, when glutathione beads containing the same set of proteins were incubated with whole cell extracts, both VIMP and USP13 co-precipitated with endogenous p97, but USP5 still failed to bind p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results indicate that USP13, but not USP5, interacts with p97 through an adaptor(s) in cells, which explains why USP13, but not USP5 can function in ERAD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>USP13 interacts directly with gp78 in ERAD</title><p>We used the GST pull-down assay to screen a collection of known p97 interactors in order to identify factor(s) that promotes the USP13-p97 interaction. We expressed these proteins in cells individually and examined the binding of endogenous p97 to GST-USP13. Compared to the control (cells transfected with an empty vector), expression of several UBX domain-containing p97 cofactors including ASPL, SAK1, and UbxD1 reduced the p97-USP13 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, lanes 3, 5, 7 vs lane 1), suggesting that these factors may compete with USP13 for p97 binding. By contrast, several other factors enhanced the p97-USP13 interaction. Among them, the most significant enhancer was gp78 (lane 16), a ubiquitin ligase known to mediate retrotranslocation and ubiquitination of many ERAD substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christianson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence confirmed that gp78 could bind to USP13 directly and promote its interaction with p97. Firstly, GST-USP13 co-precipitated with both endogenous and overexpressed gp78 in addition to p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 4, 7). By contrast, USP5 did not bind endogenous gp78, and only a negligible amount of overexpressed gp78 could be pulled down by GST-USP5 (lanes 5, 8). Secondly, depletion of gp78 by shRNA-mediated gene knockdown or gene deletion reduced the USP13-p97 interaction by threefold to fourfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). An endogenous interaction between USP13 and gp78 was also detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, GST-tagged gp78 cytosolic domain (gp78c) could bind recombinant USP13 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results demonstrated a specific and direct interaction between USP13 and gp78 that facilitates USP13-p97 association. The data also suggest that the interaction of USP13 with p97 is mediated by several cellular factors with gp78 being a major one.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01369.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>USP13 forms a complex with the ERAD E3 gp78.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) gp78 enhances the interaction of USP13 with p97.

Co-immunoprecipitation showed that the chimeras defective in cleaving Ub-AFC also behaved similarly to USP13 in binding gp78 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, lanes 3–7). By contrast, USP13/5-5 had similar DUB activity as USP5, and both the proteins only co-precipitated with marginal amount of gp78 (lanes 2, 8). It appears that the second UBA domain is crucial for USP13 to bind gp78. To further test this idea, we created an additional construct (USP13/5-6) that had the amino acid sequence downstream of the first UBA domain of USP13 replaced with the corresponding segment from USP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation showed that like USP5, this mutant also bound gp78 with significantly reduced affinity when compared to USP13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the second UBA in USP13 inhibits its DUB activity, but at the same time allows it to gain interaction with gp78.</p><p>When the degradation of the model ERAD substrate TCRα was examined in cells overexpressing either USP13 or the USP13 variants, we found that wild-type USP13 significantly increased the half-life of TCRα (from 1.6 hr to 4.6 hr). Because this phenotype was similarly observed in cells expressing the catalytically inactive USP13 mutant (USP13 C345S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), as well as in USP13 knockdown cells (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), we concluded that overexpressed USP13 had a dominant negative effect on ERAD. This was not entirely surprising as several reports had shown similar dominant negative activities with overexpression of other wild-type ERAD factors, presumably because the overexpressed proteins disrupt the normal stoichiometry of endogenous complexes. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that the ERAD inhibitory activity of USP13 was strongly dependent on gp78 binding because USP13/5-4, a chimera bound gp78 similarly to wild-type USP13, inhibited TCRα degradation (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 3.6 hr), whereas the chimera (USP13/5-5) that had reduced affinity to gp78 only slightly increased the half-life of TCRα (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 2.3 hr). The requirement of gp78 interaction for ERAD inhibition by ectopic USP13 indicates that the interaction of USP13 with gp78 is functionally relevant to ERAD.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01369.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>USP13 is required to maintain the solubility of a retrotranslocation substrate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) USP13 knockdown stabilizes the ERAD substrate TCRα.

First, we used two USP13 specific shRNAs to knock down USP13 in a cell line stably expressing TCRα-YFP. USP13 depletion significantly increased the levels of TCRα-YFP, as revealed by both immunoblotting and flow cytometry analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). This phenotype could be attributed to increased TCRα stability as demonstrated by cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 5–8 vs lanes 1–4). Because depletion of DUBs may cause ubiquitin deficiency that can indirectly inhibit proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reyes-Turcu et al., 2009</xref>), we generated a cell line expressing a TCRα variant lacking the signal peptide (ΔsTCRα-YFP). This TCRα mutant is not targeted to the ER. Consequently, it is degraded by an ERAD-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fiebiger et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, USP13 knockdown had no effect on the steady state level of ΔsTCRα-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We conclude that USP13 is specifically required for efficient turnover of ERAD substrates.</p><p>We next determined which step in ERAD is blocked by USP13 knockdown. To this end, we analyzed the glycosylation status of TCRα in USP13-depleted cells that had been exposed to a proteasome inhibitor. TCRα is a glycosylated type I membrane ERAD substrate that undergoes deglycosylation upon retrotranslocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 1997</xref>). Accordingly, in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, TCRα is accumulated in two forms, an ER-localized, glycosylated precursor and a deglycosylated intermediate that has emerged into the cytosol. The level of deglycosylated TCRα therefore can be used to gauge the retrotranslocation activity. As anticipated, knockdown of p97, the retrotranslocation-driving ATPase, reduced deglycosylated TCRα in MG132-treated cells due to inhibition of retrotranslocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, lane 3 vs 1). By contrast, USP13 depletion did not affect deglycosylation of TCRα (lane 2 vs 1), suggesting that USP13 promotes ERAD downstream of p97.</p><p>Because we recently established the Bag6-Ubl4A-Trc35 complex as a key mediator that channels substrates from the sites of retrotranslocation to the proteasome, we asked whether USP13 may cooperate with Bag6 to promote substrate delivery to the proteasome. As demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), depletion of Bag6 caused accumulation of TCRα-YFP in aggregates in a fraction of cells (∼30%) due to lack of chaperoning during the proteasome targeting steps. TCRα in these cells was resistant to extraction by the non-ionic detergent NP40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Intriguingly, we observed accumulation of TCRα in aggresome-like punctae in similar number of the TCRα-YFP-expressing cells under USP13 knockdown conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), whereas in control cells, TCRα-containing aggregates was detected only in ∼8% of the cells. Immunoblotting confirmed that USP13 depletion caused more TCRα to partition into the NP40-insoluble fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) compared to control cells. For comparison, knockdown of p97 resulted in greater levels of TCRα stabilization, but only a small fraction of TCRα was present in the NP40-insoluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, lane 8 vs 4). Because p97 depletion caused TCRα to accumulate primarily inside the ER, our data suggest that TCRα forms aggregates in USP13-depleted cells most likely after it has entered the cytosol.</p><p>To further characterize the localization of the TCRα-containing aggregates, we examined the localization of stabilized TCRα in cells expressing either USP13 or USP13 C345S. Compared to control cells in which TCRα was expressed at low levels and displayed a reticulum-like pattern co-localized with the ER marker PDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, left column), ∼50% of the USP13- and USP13 C345S-expressing cells contained TCRα-positive aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, middle and right columns). These punctae were not co-localized with PDI, suggesting that they had left the ER. The fact that similar ERAD phenotypes were detected under both USP13 overexpression and depletion conditions further confirmed that USP13 overexpression inhibits ERAD by a dominant negative manner.</p><p>We also tested the effect of USP13 knockdown on the solubility of several other ERAD substrates including a transmembrane domain (TMD)-deleted TCRα variant predicted to be an ERAD-C substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soetandyo et al., 2010</xref>), and the non-glycosylated ERAD substrate TTR D18G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christianson et al., 2011</xref>). Cells expressing these ERAD substrates together with USP13 shRNA were subjected to extraction using the NP40 lysis buffer followed by the Laemmli buffer. Immunoblotting showed that USP13 depletion caused accumulation of these substrates in cells. Importantly, in both cases, more substrates were detected in the NP40-insoluble fractions in USP13 knockdown cells than in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). Moreover, consistent with the model that USP13 acts together with Bag6 at a post-dislocation step, a significant fraction of TCRα-ΔTMD accumulated in USP13- and Bag6-knockdown cells in a deglycosylated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results demonstrate a function of USP13 in ERAD downstream of retrotranslocation and suggest a potential functional interplay between USP13 and Bag6 that is required to maintain retrotranslocated substrates in a soluble and degradable state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>USP13 forms a multiprotein complex with gp78 and Bag6</title><p>We next tested whether USP13 could physically interact with Bag6 and/or its cofactors. Immunoprecipitation of USP13 from a whole cell extract resulted in co-precipitation of a fraction of Bag6 and its cofactor Ubl4A in addition to gp78 and p97. By contrast, the cytosolic chaperone Hsp90 was not co-precipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), demonstrating a specific interaction between USP13 and the Bag6 complex. The interaction of USP13 with the Bag6 complex and gp78 did not require its deubiquitinating activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This interaction could be further demonstrated by pull-down experiments using GST-tagged USP13 and whole cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Notably, USP13 not only bound Bag6, but also interacted with MMS1 and α6, subunits of the proteasome (lane 5), further implicating USP13 in delivery pathways that targets substrates to the proteasome. Because depletion of gp78 did not affect the interaction of USP13 with Bag6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 7 vs 5), USP13 might bind Bag6 directly. Indeed, GST pull-down experiments using purified proteins showed that GST-USP13 bound Bag6, and the N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain in Bag6 was both necessary and sufficient for interaction with USP13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest a direct interaction between USP13 and Bag6 that is mediated by the Bag6 UBL domain.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01369.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>USP13 interacts with the Bag6 complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Endogenous interaction of USP13 with the Bag6 complex.

Given that knockdown of the ER-localized deubiquitinase USP19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hassink et al., 2009</xref>) did not result in accumulation of ubiquitinated Ubl4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), we concluded that ubiquitination of Ubl4A is specifically regulated by USP13.</p><p>Because USP13 depletion also led to accumulation of ubiquitinated ERAD substrate TCRα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, lane 2), it is important to distinguish whether USP13-mediated deubiquitination acts on Ubl4A, the ERAD substrates, or both. To this end, we screened several pH conditions in order to find a way to activate USP13 because previous studies showed that increased pH can facilitate deprotonation of the catalytic cysteine in some USP DUBs to promote their activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, at pH 8.0, the activity of USP13 was significantly elevated compared to pH 7.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We then treated endogenous ubiquitinated Ubl4A purified from USP13-depleted cells with recombinant USP13 under this condition. This treatment did significantly reduce ubiquitinated Ubl4A, as demonstrated by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, lane 4 vs 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>), which was blocked by the specific DUB inhibitor ubiquitin aldehyde (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, lanes 5–8 vs 1–4). As a control, we treated purified ERAD substrate TCRα under the same condition, but no obvious deubiquitination was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Together, these results suggest that USP13 preferentially removes ubiquitin conjugates from Ubl4A, probably because it forms a specific interaction with the Bag6 complex via the Bag6 UBL domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although our results have not ruled out the possibility that USP13 may contribute to deubiquitination of TCRα with the assistance of a substrate recruiting adaptor in cells, the inability to deubiquitinate TCRα by purified USP13 suggests that the accumulation of ubiquitinated TCRα in USP13 knockdown cells is probably due to ERAD inhibition at a step downstream of ubiquitination, as shown in Bag6-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Given that membrane-associated Ubl4A is preferentially ubiquitinated, we hypothesized that gp78 might contribute to Ubl4A ubiquitination. Incubating purified Ubl4A, E1, Ube2g2, ubiquitin with wild-type gp78c, but not a catalytically inactive gp78c mutant resulted in accumulation of high molecular weight products corresponding to ubiquitinated Ubl4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lane 2 vs 3). Likewise, overexpression of wild-type gp78, but not the catalytically inactive RING mutant (gp78 Rm) in cells significantly increased ubiquitination of endogenous Ubl4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These data suggest that gp78 can ubiquitinate Ubl4A directly in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, knockdown of gp78 did not significantly reduce ubiquitinated Ubl4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). One possible way to explain these seemingly contradictory results is that Ubl4A might be ubiquitinated by several Bag6-associated ligases, but only those conjugates assembled by gp78 were preferentially removed by USP13. If this was correct, ubiquitinated Ubl4A accumulated upon USP13 depletion should be reduced when gp78 was depleted together with USP13, which was indeed observed in USP13 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lane 9 vs 8) or deficient cells expressing gp78 specific shRNA (data not shown). These data suggest that USP13 and gp78 play antagonizing roles in regulation of Ubl4A ubiquitination: While gp78 assembles ubiquitin chains on Ubl4A, USP13 antagonizes this activity to limit Ubl4A ubiquitination.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01369.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>USP13 preferentially removes gp78-assembled ubiquitin chain from Ubl4A.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vitro ubiquitination of Ubl4A by gp78.

Intriguingly, we observed that a fraction of Bag6 (designated as Bag6*) had increased mobility on SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lane 5). This fast migrating Bag6 species was probably caused by proteolytic processing of Bag6 that removed a small C-terminal segment because Bag6* could not be detected by an antibody against the C-terminus of Bag6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Bag6* was primarily detected in NP40-insoluble fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lane 5 vs 1), and its generation appears to be associated with hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A because co-depletion of gp78 together with USP13 reduced ubiquitinated Ubl4A and also abolished Bag6* accumulation (Lane 6 vs 5). Moreover, Bag6* was preferentially detected in the membrane bound pool of Bag6 in USP13-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Coincidentally, membrane-associated Ubl4A was more prone to ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of gp78, a condition that significantly increased ubiquitinated Ubl4A, also induced Bag6 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). Expression of a ubiquitin-Ubl4A fusion protein (Ub-Ubl4A) but not wild-type Ubl4A also caused accumulation of Bag6* in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Importantly, even though overexpression of gp78 was previously shown to promote turnover of an ERAD substrate (CD3δ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2001</xref>) whose degradation is independent of Bag6 (data not shown), the degradation of the Bag6 substrate TCRα was significantly inhibited in cells expressing gp78 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Moreover, expression of Ub-Ubl4A also significantly reduced the rate of TCRα degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Together, these results suggest that hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A can cause ERAD inhibition in a dominant negative manner, probably because it is associated with the cleavage and subsequent inactivation of a fraction of membrane bound Bag6.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01369.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A is associated with Bag6 clipping and ERAD inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Membrane-associated Bag6 is preferentially cleaved in USP13 knockdown cells.

The result identified Lys48 in Ubl4A as the major ubiquitination site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To confirm that this Lys residue was ubiquitinated in cells, we initially attempted to overexpress a Ubl4A mutant bearing the Lys48 to Arg substitution. However, we found that most transiently expressed Ubl4A was not incorporated into the endogenous Bag6 complex because the complex had a slow turnover rate. As a result, overexpressed Ubl4A was not regulated by the same manner as endogenous Ubl4A. To overcome this problem, we established stable cell lines expressing either FLAG-tagged wild-type Ubl4A or Ubl4A K48R mutant under an inducible promoter. A careful titration experiment showed that when cells were grown in the presence of a low concentration of the inducer tetracycline (‘Materials and method’), Ubl4A and Ubl4A K48R could be expressed at a level comparable to that of endogenous Ubl4A, and a significant fraction of ectopic Ubl4A interacted with Bag6. Under this condition, ubiquitination still preferentially occurred on endogenous Ubl4A (data not shown). However, significant amount of ubiquitinated Ubl4A-FLAG could be detected when gp78 was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, lane 7). By contrast, overexpression of gp78 did not lead to ubiquitination of the Ubl4A K48R mutant (lane 8), suggesting that gp78-mediated ubiquitination primarily occurs at Lys48 in Ubl4A in cells. Moreover, when HA-tagged ubiquitin was expressed in these cells, gp78-independent basal ubiquitination of Ubl4A could be detected on wild-type Ubl4A, but not on the Ubl4A K48R mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, lane 3 vs 4).

We treated HEK293 cells with a cysteine reactive crosslinker to stabilize protein–protein interactions. Cell extracts were subject to immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions with SGTA antibody. Immunoblotting with SGTA antibodies detected a major crosslinking product whose molecular weight was consistent with a SGTA dimer. In addition, several SGTA-containing crosslinking products were detected only in anti-SGTA precipitated samples, but not in control samples (IgG pulldown). Among them, a crosslinking product of 250 kD was detected by both anti-SGTA and anti-Bag6 blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Two pieces of evidence further suggested that this 250 kD crosslinking product was a crosslinked complex containing both SGTA and Bag6. First, in vitro crosslinking using purified SGTA and the Bag6 complex generated a similar 250 kD complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). This complex was not detected when the Bag6 complex or SGTA was omitted from the reaction. Second, knockdown of either Bag6 or SGTA by shRNA significantly reduced this crosslinking product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, lanes 2, 4 vs 6). Consistent with the notion that Ubl4A facilitates the association of SGTA with Bag6, knockdown of Ubl4A also decreased this crosslinking product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Importantly, USP13 knockdown specifically reduced the 250 kD Bag6-SGTA crosslinking product without affecting either the SGTA dimer or other SGTA-containing crosslinking products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that USP13 facilitates the association between SGTA and Bag6.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We report a novel functional link between the deubiquitinase USP13 and gp78, an ER-associated E3 postulated to be part of a ‘retrotranslocon’ for some misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2001</xref>). Despite having opposing activities, these enzymes interact with each other to form a complex that coordinately promotes ERAD. We identify the Bag6 cofactor Ubl4A as a shared substrate of gp78 and USP13. USP13 depletion is associated with hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A and altered interaction between the Bag6 complex and its co-chaperone SGTA. SGTA is an ortholog of Sgt2p, a chaperone implicated in biogenesis of tail-anchored ER proteins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Like Bag6, SGTA also contains a chaperone-like activity that preferentially binds hydrophobic segments. We recently demonstrated that this activity facilitates substrate binding by Bag6 in ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). We also showed that the interaction of Bag6 with SGTA is facilitated by Ubl4A as the latter binds directly to SGTA in a highly dynamic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chartron et al., 2012</xref>). Because the interaction of Ubl4A with SGTA is mediated by positively-charged residues in Ubl4A including Lys48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chartron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2012</xref>), which happens to be the major ubiquitination site, the simplest model to explain reduced Bag6-SGTA interaction in USP13 knockdown cells is that ubiquitin conjugates on Ubl4A sterically hinder SGTA binding. However, given that USP13 can also interact physically with Bag6, it is also possible that USP13 may serve an adaptor function to promote Bag6–SGTA interaction.</p><p>Hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A in USP13-depleted cells is also associated with increased proteolysis of Bag6, resulting in a truncated variant (Bag6*). Based on the molecular weight, the cleavage seems to occur within or near the C-terminal BAG domain. It has been shown that the Bag6 co-factor Ubl4A binds to a site near the BAG domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is possible that Ubl4A normally covers a protease site in Bag6 either by itself or by recruiting a Bag6 cofactor. Hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A in USP13 knockdown cells may alter its function, leading to increased cleavage of Bag6. In support of this idea, Bag6* also accumulates in cells depleted of Ubl4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>) or cells expressing the Ub-Ubl4A fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Our results suggest that depletion of USP13 can impair Bag6 function via at least two ways. One is to cause its cleavage and the other is to inhibit its interaction with SGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The two events may be linked as increased cleavage of Bag6 may also contribute to reduced interaction with SGTA. Although hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A is clearly detrimental to ERAD, it is noteworthy that our results do not exclude the possibility that transient ubiquitination of Ubl4A by gp78 at the site of retrotranslocation may also serve a positive role in ERAD.</p><p>Because the accumulation of Bag6* upon USP13 depletion is significantly reduced in cells co-depleted of USP13 and gp78 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), we propose that USP13 is required to antagonize a promiscuous activity of gp78 towards Ubl4A, which would otherwise impair the function of the Bag6 complex by altering its interaction pattern and/or increasing its cleavage by a cellular protease. In this model, a DUB can cooperate with an E3 ligase to enhance its substrate specificity. The specificity of a ubiquitination reaction has generally been thought to be controlled at the E3 ligase level. In proteasomal degradation pathways, many E3s appear to directly recognize substrates bearing degradation signals, leading to their ubiquitination. However, in the complex cellular environment, ubiquitin ligases often function in large protein complexes, meaning that in addition to substrates, many cellular proteins containing ubiquitin acceptor lysine residues are also in proximity to these enzymes. How these E3 cofactors evade ubiquitination is completely unknown. Our study suggests that cooperation between an E3 ligase and an associated DUB may provide a simple solution that sharpens substrate specificity for the ligase. It is conceivable that while acting on substrates, E3 ligases may also ubiquitinate other factors that function in proximity. Such undesired ubiquitination, even occurring at a low frequency, could cause significant damage overtime, particularly if it leads to irreversible inactivation of the modified proteins. Removal of these unwanted ubiquitination products by DUBs ensures that only desired ubiquitination signals are maintained in cells. This concept is in line with a recent study, showing that even non-specific DUB activities can amplify the specificity of a quality control E3, allowing discrimination between two misfolded substrates bearing subtle structural differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our study also suggests that Lys48-linked ubiquitination can have a non-destructive function, which is to regulate protein–protein interactions. Previous studies showed that cells can use ubiquitin to regulate protein–protein interaction in many ways. The most common strategy is to have ubiquitin serve as a ‘signal’ that recruits a downstream effector containing a ubiquitin-binding domain. By contrast, the regulation of Bag6 by the gp78-USP13-mediated ubiquitination cycle seems to represent another paradigm; Ubiquitination inhibits the recruitment of a co-factor. It is noteworthy that a similar ubiquitin-dependent disassembly of a protein complex involved in TGFβ signaling has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dupont et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eichhorn et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>How Ubl4A escape proteasomal degradation despite carrying a bone fide proteasome degradation signal remains to be investigated. It is possible that ubiquitin conjugates on Ubl4A is bound by one of the many ERAD factors that carry ubiquitin-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). These interactions may prevent substrate recognition by the proteasome. Such a mechanism has been reported to maintain the stability of the ubiquitinated transcription factor Met4 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flick et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our model predicts that the USP13 activity needs to be tightly regulated both spatially and temporally in cells, a theme generally applicable to DUBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reyes-Turcu et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, we found that purified USP13 is inactive despite sequence homology to USP5, a constitutively active isopeptidase. Our data suggest that sequence variations in a UBA domain allow USP13 to acquire new interactors, which may activate it at the ER membrane. Since purified gp78 is insufficient to activate USP13 (Liu, Y unpublished results), further experiments using gp78-containing retrotranslocation complexes reconstituted in proteoliposome are required to elucidate how USP13 is regulated in the context of retrotranslocation.</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrates that a ubiquitin ligase and a DUB can act in concert to coordinate protein turnover at the ER by regulating the ubiquitination status of a degradation machinery factor. In addition, our findings reveal a mechanism by which an E3-DUB ‘tag team’ can enhance E3 specificity, a paradigm that may be applicable to other E3-DUB complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and plasmids</title><p>The HEK293 cell line stably expressing TCRα-YFP was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soetandyo et al., 2010</xref>).

Trc35 antibody from Novus Biological was used for immunoprecipitation. HRP-linked or fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (Rockland, Boyertown, PA) were used for immunoblotting detection. GST-E1, ubiquitin, ubiquitin-aldehyde, methylated ubiquitin, and ubiquitin K48R were purchased from Boston Biochem. MG132 was purchased from EMD Bioscience. EndoH was purchased from New England Biolab.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The purification of Bag6 and the Bag6-Ubl4A-Trc35 complex were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). The truncated Bag6 variants, SGTA, FLAG-USP13 and the USP13/5 chimeras were all purified using the same FLAG affinity chromatography procedure.

Proteins eluted from glutathione column (GE Healthscience, Piscataway, NY) or Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) were further fractionated on a Superdex 200 HR (10/30) column in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM potassium chloride, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 2 mM magnesium chloride.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunoprecipitations, GST pulldown, and immunoblotting</title><p>Cell lysates were prepared using the NP40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM magnesium chloride, 0.5% NP40, and a protease inhibitor cocktail). For most experiments, NP40 soluble fractions were used for immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting. Where indicated, the NP40-insoluble pellets were re-solubilized by the Laemmli buffer for immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation under denaturing condition, cells were first lysed in a buffer containing 1%SDS and 5 mM DTT. The lysates were heated at 65°C for 15 min and then diluted 10-fold by the NP40 lysis buffer. The samples were subject to centrifugation at 20,000×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. The soluble supernatant fractions were used for immunoprecipitation by antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. For sequential immunoprecipitation, cell extract was first incubated with FLAG beads. The bound materials were eluted by a buffer containing FLAG peptide (0.2 mg/ml). The eluate was subject to another round of immunoprecipitation by anti-gp78 antibody or a control antibody. Immunoblotting was performed following the standard protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>To measure the levels of YFP-tagged proteasomal substrates, cells were analyzed by the Cytomics FC 500MPL Flow Cytometry System (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) following a previously described procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). For the immunofluorescence imaging studies, cells transiently expressing YFP-tagged TCRα were grown in a Lab-Tek slide chamber (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) were fixed for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Images were taken using an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a 63× oil objective lens (Zeiss, Germany). For immunostaining experiments, fixed cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% NP40 and 5% normal donkey serum and then stained in the same buffer with the indicated antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vitro ubiquitination and deubiquitination assays</title><p>Ubiquitination experiments were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ye et al., 2003</xref>). Briefly, E1 (60 nM), Ube2g2 (200 nM), gp78c (400 nM), and ubiquitin (10 µM) were incubated with the substrate Ubl4A at 37°C for 1 hr in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM magnesium/ATP, and 0.1 mM DTT. The DUB activities were measured by detecting the increase in fluorescence upon cleavage of Ubiquitin-AFC (Boston Biochem, MA). Purified DUBs (∼50 nM) were added individually to 200 μl deubiquitinating assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 20 mM potassium chloride, 5 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM DTT, including 0.5 μM Ub-AFC), and incubated at 37°C. The fluorescence intensity was measured using an Aminco Bowman Luminescence spectrometer with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 400 and 505 nm, respectively. In vitro deubiquitination of Ubl4A was performed as follows. USP13-depleted cells were transfected with HA-Ub and TCRα-YFP and lysed in the NP40 lysis buffer. The whole cell extract was incubated with protein A beads pre-bound with GFP or Ubl4A antibodies to purify TCRα and endogenous Ubl4A, respectively. After immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed twice with the NP40 washing buffer and once with 2× deubiquitination buffer. The beads were then divided into equal portions, each containing 20 µl 2× DUB buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 40 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM DTT). The reactions were started by adding recombinant FLAG-USP13 (purified from mammalian cells) or GST-USP13 (purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>) as indicated in the figure legends. The samples were incubated at 37°C for 2 hr with shaking and then stopped by addition of 40 µl Laemmli buffer. The samples were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA (ubiquitin), anti-Ubl4A, or anti-GFP antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Miscellaneous biochemical assays</title><p>In vivo crosslinking experiments were performed by incubating 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells in a labeling buffer (95 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2) containing the indicated concentration of 1,6-bis-Maleimidohexane (BMH) (Pierce) at room temperature for 20 min. The cells were then treated with 5 mM DTT for 10 min on ice, followed by addition of 1% SDS. Cell extracts were heated at 65°C for 15 min. The soluble extracts were diluted in the NP40 lysis buffer prior to immunoprecipitation using 2.5 µg affinity purified anti-SGTA antibody. In vitro crosslinking was performed similarly except that purified proteins were used. Cycloheximide chase experiments were performed by incubating cells in DMEM medium containing 50 µg/ml cycloheximide at 37°C. At the time points indicated in the figures, ∼0.6 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were harvested. The cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank R Deshaies (Caltech), S Fang and M Monteiro (University of

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman as the Reviewing editor and two expert peer reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>ER-associated degradation is an important quality control mechanism that ensures the proteolytic removal of misfolded ER-proteins. The ER-associated ubiquitin ligase gp78 is a well-established, important regulator of ERAD that binds to the ubiquitin-selective chaperone p97. P97 also interacts with a series of different deubiquitinases (DUBs), including Usp13. Because ubiquitylation is required for proteasomal targeting, it is was a surprising finding that either loss of ubiquitin ligases (i.e., leading to decreased ubiquitylation) or loss of DUBs (i.e., leading to increased ubiquitylation) interfered with efficient ERAD. The reason for this paradox was unclear.</p><p>In this study, Liu et al. provide a potential answer to this paradox, i.e., in that they suggest that DUBs positively regulate ERAD by ensuring that functionality of ERAD-regulators that are complex with ubiquitin ligases. Having identified the ubiquitin ligase gp78 as potential bridging factor between the DUB Usp13 and p97, they show that Usp13 functions at a similar stage as the Bag6 chaperone complex recently isolated by the same group. Indeed, they provide very nice and convincing evidence that Usp13 acts in the same complex as Bag6. Next, they searched for substrates of Usp13 and identified a component of the Bag6-complex, Ubl4A, as a candidate. They suggest that Usp13 protects Ubl4A from spurious gp78-dependent ubiquitylation, thereby ensuring the Ubl4A can bind to downstream partners, such as SGTA. This part of the story, i.e., whether deubiquitylation of a fraction of Ubl4A-molecules in cells is required for the function of the Bag6-complex in vivo and whether this reaction is the key function of Usp13, is less well developed. Overall, especially the experiments in the first part of the paper are very well performed and interpreted; moreover, addressing the paradox of a dual requirement for DUBs and ubiquitin ligases is very important for the field. Thus, if the physiological relevance of the Usp13/Ubl4A axis can be strengthened, this paper is a candidate for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) One major weakness in this paper is the lack of direct evidence to demonstrate that USP13 removes the ubiquitin conjugates on Ubl4A. Obviously the most compelling data would be to show that purified recombinant USP13 can deubiquitinate the ubiquitin conjugates attached to Ubl4A. Given that USP13 did not display any deubiquitination activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), is this experiment possible? The closest data to support the authors' view are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, in which USP13 knockdown increased Ubl4A polyubiquitination. Whether this is due to the lack of USP13 or other indirect consequences of silencing USP13 is unclear. Can the authors rescue this phenotype by using WT but not catalytic-inactive USP13? Because this is a critical result, a positive control in which another irrelevant DUB is silenced (e.g., USP5) should be performed. Additionally, as catalytic-inactive DUBs often trap their substrates, can a catalytic-inactive USP13 bind preferentially to Ubl4A?</p><p>2) More key data to support this model are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> where USP13 knockdown disrupts the SGTA-Bag6 complex. However, because USP13 was shown to interact with the Bag6 complex in this paper, it is entirely possible that USP13 is simply acting as a scaffold to support the SGTA-Ubl4A-Bag6 complex. If so, USP13's catalytic function would not play any role in facilitating Bag6 complex formation. Again, can exogenous expression of WT but not catalytic-inactive USP13 rescue the formation of the SGTA-Bag6 complex? (Although the authors did demonstrate that WT USP13 over-expression can exert a dominant-negative phenotype during retro-translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F/G</xref>), this experiment was not performed in the context of silencing endogenous USP13.) Moreover, in this experiment, a double knockdown of USP13 and gp78 is expected to restore the SGTA-Bag6 complex. This finding would indicate that the lack of gp78-catalyzed Ubl4A ubiquitination negates the requirement of USP13 to deubiquitinate Ubl4A. The authors should do this experiment.</p><p>3) From a mechanistic point of view, it is unclear why Usp13 would target Ubl4A, but not the substrate (i.e., an event that would inhibit ERAD). If the model provided by the authors is correct, then one would expect that the effects of Usp13 depletion of ERAD-degradation (such as those seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) are rescued by expression of a Ubl4A-K48R mutant. Providing such evidence would immediately address the issue of physiological relevance in a very convincing manner.</p><p>4) The direct link between gp78 and Usp13 is fairly weak and to a large extent depends on the analysis of Usp5/Usp13 chimera. In this respect, the statement that the second UBA-domain accounts for the differential activity between Usp5 and Usp13 is not really supported by evidence (this would need a more specific swap of UBA-domains, rather than large protein segments). Adding these data would clearly strengthen the link between gp78 and Usp13. Moreover, the effect of gp78-depletion on the Usp13/p97 interaction is very weak and only one shRNA against gp78 is shown; this experiment needs to be repeated with multiple shRNAs (or better, rescue constructs), allowing the researchers to obtain a potential correlation between strength of knockdown and phenotype.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01369.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Overall, especially the experiments in the first part of the paper are very well performed and interpreted; moreover, addressing the paradox of a dual requirement for DUBs and ubiquitin ligases is very important for the field.

We agree with the reviewers that the second part of our study, which links hyper-ubiquitination of the ERAD machinery protein Ubl4A to impaired Bag6 function is less developed. In fact, in our original manuscript, we described that a fraction of Bag6 undergoes a cleavage process to generate what we called Bag6* in USP13 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The characterization of this cleaved product is an ongoing project that we initially wished to develop into an independent story. In light of the reviewers’ suggestions, we decide to include some results we obtained while characterizing this Bag6 cleavage product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We hope that this will help explain why hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A is detrimental to ERAD.</p><p>Specifically, we show that hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A, either as a result of lack of USP13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) or increased gp78 (E3) ligase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7B, C</xref>), is associated with increased cleavage of Bag6 by a yet-to-be identified cellular protease. This results in the accumulation of a truncated Bag6 variant lacking the essential BAG domain at the C-terminus. We believe that these results provide strong evidence to support our conclusion that the function of Bag6 is impaired when Ubl4A accumulates in ubiquitinated form. Importantly, when gp78 is co-depleted with USP13, it rescues Bag6 cleavage caused by USP13 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 6 vs 5), strongly indicating that the two enzymes are functionally antagonizing each other to regulate Bag6. We initially wished to publish these results after we identify the cellular enzyme(s) responsible for this proteolysis reaction and map the cleavage site. Since the reviewers question how ubiquitination of Ubl4A can lead to inactivation of Bag6 without involving proteasome dependent turnover of the Bag6 complex, we hope that the inclusion of these results will to some extent alleviate this concern. We hope that the reviewers will agree that further characterization of this cleavage reaction is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p><italic>1) One major weakness in this paper is the lack of direct evidence to demonstrate that USP13 removes the ubiquitin conjugates on Ubl4A. Obviously the most compelling data would be to show that purified recombinant USP13 can deubiquitinate the ubiquitin conjugates attached to Ubl4A. Given that USP13 did not display any deubiquitination activity in vitro (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>), is this experiment possible? The closest data to support the authors' view are presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5E</italic></xref><italic>, in which USP13 knockdown increased Ubl4A polyubiquitination. Whether this is due to the lack of USP13 or other indirect consequences of silencing USP13 is unclear. Can the authors rescue this phenotype by using WT but not catalytic-inactive USP13? Because this is a critical result, a positive control in which another irrelevant DUB is silenced (e.g., USP5) should be performed. Additionally, as catalytic-inactive DUBs often trap their substrates, can a catalytic-inactive USP13 bind preferentially to Ubl4A</italic>?</p><p>To further support our conclusion that USP13 acts specifically on Ubl4A, we include an additional control experiment in which we silenced another deubiquitinase in cells. In this case, we chose USP19, which is the only DUB that contains a C-terminal transmembrane segment. This DUB has been previously implicated in ERAD. Another postdoc fellow in the lab has been working on this DUB for a while. We initially thought that it might perform a similar function as USP13 to regulate Bag6 in conjunction with another ER E3 ligase. However, when he depleted USP19 from the cells, it did not alter the level of ubiquitinated Ubl4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The reviewers’ comments reminded us of this experiment that we did a while ago. Although it did not reveal what exactly USP19 is doing in ERAD, it provides the best control, showing that the effect of USP13 knockdown on Ubl4A ubiquitination is specific.</p><p>We also tried the in vitro deubiquitination experiments suggested by the reviewers. To overcome the issue of lack of activity, we screened several pH conditions as previous studies from us and others showed that increasing pH can often activate deubiquitinases because increased pH facilitates cysteine deprotonation. We find that purified USP13 indeed gains some activity at pH 8.0 compared to pH 7.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We then treated purified ubiquitinated Ubl4A with different doses of USP13 under pH 8.0 condition. Our data show that purified USP13 indeed can remove ubiquitin conjugates from Ubl4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). As anticipated, the deubquitination reaction can be inhibited by a DUB specific inhibitor ubiquitin aldehyde (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Intriguingly, in a parallel experiment, when we treated the purified ERAD substrate TCRα with USP13, we did not observe significant deubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). These results further support our model that USP13 acts directly on Ubl4A, but not on ERAD substrates, to influence ERAD.</p><p>Lastly, with regard to whether the catalytic inactive USP13 can trap Ubl4A, we actually showed in our original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> that the mutant USP13 does not bind Ubl4A better than wild type protein. The reviewers are absolutely right that some catalytically inactive DUB mutants can trap their substrates when overexpressed. Most of these cases involve USP DUBs that binds substrate primarily through ubiquitin conjugates. However, in the case of USP13, our results suggest that it does not contain high affinity binding site for ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). On the other hand, USP13 can bind a UBL domain in Bag6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which explains why the catalytically inactive USP13 binds the Bag6-Ubl4A complex with similar affinity as the wild type protein.</p><p><italic>2) More key data to support this model are presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7D</italic></xref> <italic>where USP13 knockdown disrupts the SGTA-Bag6 complex. However, because USP13 was shown to interact with the Bag6 complex in this paper, it is entirely possible that USP13 is simply acting as a scaffold to support the SGTA-Ubl4A-Bag6 complex. If so, USP13's catalytic function would not play any role in facilitating Bag6 complex formation. Again, can exogenous expression of WT but not catalytic-inactive USP13 rescue the formation of the SGTA-Bag6 complex? (Although the authors did demonstrate that WT USP13 over-expression can exert a dominant-negative phenotype during retro-translocation (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2F</italic></xref><italic>/G), this experiment was not performed in the context of silencing endogenous USP13.) Moreover, in this experiment, a double knockdown of USP13 and gp78 is expected to restore the SGTA-Bag6 complex. This finding would indicate that the lack of gp78-catalyzed Ubl4A ubiquitination negates the requirement of USP13 to deubiquitinate Ubl4A. The authors should do this experiment</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the physical interaction of USP13 with the Bag6 complex makes it hard to distinguish whether the effect of USP13 knockdown on Bag6-SGTA interaction is due to lack of deubiquitination by USP13 or its scaffolding function. The proposed rescuing experiments are important. In fact, we have thought about doing this experiment and have spent a lot of time creating the necessary reagent. Specifically, we were able to generate a USP13 knockout cell line using the CRISPR technology recently. We have repeated a few assays shown in the paper with the knockout cells, which essentially gave rise to similar results as the knockdown cells. For example, ubiquitination of Ubl4A is significantly increased in the knockout cells compared to wild type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), which can be partially suppressed by depletion of the E3 gp78 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Author response image 1: Ubl4A ubiquitination was analyzed using control or USP13 knockout cells expressing either control or gp78 shRNA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01369-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>However, when we expressed wild type USP13 in this cell line, it still caused a dominant negative effect, resulting in significant increase in TCRα level (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>Author response image 2: USP13 knockout cells transfected with control or USP13 expressing plasmid together with TCRa-YFP were imaged using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with a 20X objective. The images were taken with the same exposure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01369-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig></p><p>This result is consistent with our model that ERAD inhibition by USP13 overexpression is probably achieved by blocking functional protein–protein interactions required for ERAD through the binding of USP13 with gp78. It is noteworthy that dominant negative inhibition of cellular process by expression of wild type DUB is quite common, which makes the rescue experiment very tricky to do as we need to figure out a way to reproducibly express just the right amount of USP13 in order to avoid the dominant negative effect. Even making stable cell lines with retrovirus may not be sufficient because the expression of a transgene from a viral promoter is still going to be significantly higher than the endogenous one.</p><p>Although we cannot perform the suggested rescuing experiments, we feel that our new results showing that hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A is associated with increased Bag6 cleavage should offer a satisfying explanation as to how the functional integrity of the Bag6 complex is affected by USP13 depletion.</p><p>We also tried the proposed experiment to see if knockdown of gp78 could rescue the interaction between Bag6 and SGTA. To our surprise, we find that knockdown of gp78 just by itself (without USP13 knockdown) reduces the interaction of Bag6 with SGTA, as demonstrated by a crosslinking experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 3</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p>Author response image 3: Cells expressing either control or gp78 shRNA were treated with BMH. SGTA-containing complex was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting. A fraction of the whole cell extract was also analyzed. Note that the 250kD Bag6-SGTA crosslinking product was abolished in gp78 knockdown cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01369-resp-fig3-v1"/></fig></p><p>Because gp78 can interact with Bag6 directly, the result suggests that gp78 may serve a scaffolding function that promotes the interaction of Bag6 with SGTA. Importantly, the experiment also suggests that the crosslinked Bag6-SGTA complex is a result of an interaction that occurs in proximity to gp78. This result is consistent with our findings that ubiquitinated Ubl4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and the Bag6 cleavage product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) are all preferentially enriched in the ER membrane fractions. Although the correlations between these molecular events do not necessarily prove any causal relationships among them, our results suggest that hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A and cleavage of Bag6 are tightly coupled because expression of Ub-Ubl4A also induces Bag6 cleavage. Collectively, we think that our new data suggest two possible mechanisms by which depletion of USP13 can interfere with Bag6 function. One is to increase cleavage of Bag6 and the other is to cause reduced interaction with SGTA. Whether these two events are mechanistically linked awaits further study, but the results clearly demonstrate that USP13 participates in ERAD by an indirect mechanism that maintains the functionality of Bag6.</p><p>Because we cannot formally rule out the possibility that USP13 may also regulate Bag6 function by serving as a scaffold between Bag6 and SGTA, we now tone down our conclusion and mention this possibility in our paper. We also mention the possibility that increased Bag6 cleavage may also contribute to inhibition of Bag6 and SGTA interaction.</p><p><italic>3) From a mechanistic point of view, it is unclear why Usp13 would target Ubl4A, but not the substrate (i.e., an event that would inhibit ERAD). If the model provided by the authors is correct, then one would expect that the effects of Usp13 depletion of ERAD-degradation (such as those seen in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref><italic>) are rescued by expression of a Ubl4A-K48R mutant. Providing such evidence would immediately address the issue of physiological relevance in a very convincing manner</italic>.</p><p>Our in vitro binding experiments showed that unlike the homologous DUB USP5, USP13 does not bind ubiquitin with a high affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). On the other hand, the binding of USP13 with the UBL domain of Bag6 can be demonstrated using pulldown experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These experiments suggest that the interaction of USP13 with the substrate (the Bag6 complex) is distinct from the canonical DUB-substrate interactions, which are largely mediated by the ubiquitin conjugates on substrates. This provides a plausible explanation as to why USP13 won’t just act on any ubiquitinated proteins. We agree with the reviewers that rescuing the ERAD phenotype with a Ubl4AK48R mutant will provide valuable information on whether ubiquitination of Ubl4A on Lys48 is the only USP13 depletion-associated deficiency that causes ERAD defects. In the Ubl4A K48R cell line, depletion of USP13 still causes accumulation of ERAD substrate TCRα (data not shown). However, as we mentioned in our original manuscript, this cell line still contains endogenous Ubl4A, which is preferentially ubiquitinated when USP13 is depleted. To obtain a clean result, we need to knock down endogenous Ubl4A while maintaining the expression of ectopically expressed Ubl4A at a level comparable to that of the endogenous protein. This is technically challenging and will take a long time to complete (although we have started to play around with the CRISPR technology, we have not been able to establish a procedure to knock in a mutant gene). Additionally, it is also worth noting that although we describe ubiquitination of Ubl4A as a spurious event that damages the Bag6 function, we haven’t formally ruled out the possibility that transient ubiquitination of Ubl4A by gp78 may also contribute a positive function to ERAD, a possibility now mentioned in the Discussion. If this is true, one would not expect to rescue the ERAD defect in USP13 knockdown cells with the Ubl4A K48R mutant. Answers to these questions are important, but we feel that resolving these issues by new experiments will take an unreasonable amount of time and the required additional experiments are beyond the scope of the current study. We hope that the reviewers will agree with us on this issue.</p><p><italic>4) The direct link between gp78 and Usp13 is fairly weak and to a large extent depends on the analysis of Usp5/Usp13 chimera.
