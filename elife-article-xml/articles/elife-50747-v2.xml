evolutionarily conserved hub of nutrient sensing and metabolic signaling. In plants, a functional connection of TOR activation with glucose availability was demonstrated, while it is yet unclear whether branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are a primary input of TOR signaling as they are in yeast and mammalian cells. Here, we report on the characterization of an Arabidopsis mutant over-accumulating BCAAs. Through chemical interventions targeting TOR and by examining mutants of BCAA biosynthesis and TOR signaling, we found that BCAA over-accumulation leads to up-regulation of TOR activity, which causes reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and actin-associated endomembranes. Finally, we show that activation of TOR is concomitant with alteration of cell expansion, proliferation and specialized metabolism, leading to pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development. These results demonstrate that BCAAs contribute to plant TOR activation and reveal previously uncharted downstream subcellular processes of TOR signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TOR Signaling</kwd><kwd>branched-chain amino acids</kwd><kwd>actin cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>vacuole</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB1727362</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brandizzi</surname><given-names>Federica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MICL02598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brandizzi</surname><given-names>Federica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NPGI-1811055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schenck</surname><given-names>Craig A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-FG02-91ER20021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brandizzi</surname><given-names>Federica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE‐SC0018409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brandizzi</surname><given-names>Federica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Despite BCAAs being de novo-synthesized in chloroplasts, TOR activation by BCAAs is conserved in plants and triggers a re-organization of actin and actin-associated endomembranes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, target of rapamycin (TOR) is a conserved master regulator of metabolic signaling that integrates nutrient, energy, hormone, growth and stress inputs with cell growth and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Guan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shi et al., 2018</xref>). In yeast and mammalian cells, TOR associates with different interactors to form two functional complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). The Arabidopsis genome encodes functional homologs of TOR (AtTOR) and two TOR-interactors: LST8 (AtLST8-1 and AtLST8-2) and a specific component of TORC1, RAPTOR (AtRAPTOR1A and AtRAPTOR1B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shi et al., 2018</xref>). The Arabidopsis homologs of TORC2-specific components have not been identified yet.</p><p>The yeast and mammalian TORC1 and TORC2 receive specific inputs and regulate distinct downstream processes. For example, sensors of leucine (Leu) and other amino acids provide input signals to TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Guan, 2019</xref>), while mammalian TORC2 is primarily regulated by the insulin-PI3K signaling and is inhibited by mTORC1 effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xie et al., 2018</xref>). The current model of plant TOR signaling is built upon the three TORC1 components identified to date and envisions that TORC1 has essential functions, including promoting synthesis of proteins, nucleotides and lipids, and inhibiting autophagy for cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In plants, TOR has assumed critical and specific roles, including involvement in phytohormone signaling pathways (i.e., auxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schepetilnikov et al., 2017</xref>], cytokinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pfeiffer et al., 2016</xref>], brassinosteroid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>] and abscisic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2018</xref>]), as well as metabolic signaling (e.g., glucosinolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malinovsky et al., 2017</xref>], sulfur sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2017</xref>]). Despite these advances, it is not well elucidated which inputs activate plant TOR signaling. In yeast and mammalian models, nutrient sensing of amino acids, especially the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) Leu, isoleucine (Ile) and valine (Val), is the primary input underlying activation of TOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Guan, 2019</xref>). Studies in plants revealed a glucose-TOR signaling pathway that integrates light and sugar availability to control meristem activation in root and shoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pfeiffer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>), connecting TOR signaling to the generation and availability of photosynthates. A recent work identified isopropylmalate synthase 1 (IPMS1), a critical enzyme for Leu biosynthesis, as a suppressor of <italic>lrx1</italic>, a mutant that is defective in root hair development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schaufelberger et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, this research found that mutation of IPMS1 affects root development by reducing its sensitivity to chemical inhibition of TOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schaufelberger et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting alteration of Leu biosynthesis modifies the TOR network. Therefore, the level of conservation of TOR signaling input across kingdoms and in plant cells specifically is still a significant question.</p><p>Investigating the relationship between BCAAs and plant TOR signaling has been generally hindered by the innate capacity of plant cells to produce BCAAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xing and Last, 2017</xref>). In the chloroplast, the allosterically regulated enzymes threonine deaminase (TD), acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) and IPMS are subjected to feedback inhibition, and contribute to BCAA homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xing and Last, 2017</xref>). Mammalian cells are unable to synthesize BCAAs; consequently, starvation and repletion of BCAAs in the culture serum can be effective in stimulating TOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarbassov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacinto et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, for plant cells, exogenous feeding of a limited concentration of amino acids to the growth medium may not perturb BCAA homeostasis and trigger detectable activation of TOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, supplementation of a single or a combination of multiple amino acids may confer intertwined feedback inhibition to the biosynthetic pathway, and lead to unpredictable disruption of amino acid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galili et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maliga, 1984</xref>). Additionally, because TOR is the main negative regulator of autophagy and promotes protein synthesis, either chemical inhibition of BCAA biosynthesis and TOR activity or mutation of TOR signaling components does not specifically affect BCAAs but leads to substantial increases in almost all types of amino acids in plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mubeen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moreau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caldana et al., 2013</xref>). In light of these considerations, it is therefore not surprising that little is known about the functional and physiological consequences of an up-regulation of TOR signaling in plants, especially at a subcellular level. In yeast and mammalian cells, induced activation of TOR governs numerous cellular processes, most evidently the inhibition of autophagy by TORC1 and the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton by TORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). Although the mechanistic basis is not fully understood, it has been proposed that mTORC2 regulates reorganization of actin cytoskeleton through the AGC family protein kinases and Rho signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xie et al., 2018</xref>). Plants express AGC family-like homologs with specialized functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia et al., 2012</xref>) and Rho of Plants (ROP) members that signal to the cytoskeleton system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feiguelman et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, recent studies reported an interaction between ROP2 and TOR in the context of TOR-auxin crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schepetilnikov et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, direct functional connections between TOR signaling, cytoskeleton in plant growth and development are yet to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moreau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deprost et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salem et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Salem et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deprost et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xiong and Sheen, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The vacuole and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are the two organelles of largest membrane extension in plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stefano et al., 2014</xref>). The central vacuole fulfills essential cellular functions such as providing turgor pressure, protein turnover and metabolite storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The ER is the gateway to the secretory pathway and a membrane network that weaves through nearly all the other types of organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stefano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Despite of the essential roles of the vacuole and the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stefano et al., 2014</xref>), mechanisms underpinning their morphogenesis are still largely undefined although homotypic membrane fusion is known to be required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stefano et al., 2012</xref>). It is also yet unclear whether and how the dynamics of plant ER and vacuoles are controlled in response to different developmental and environmental clues. The dynamics of endomembrane system in plant cells are mechanistically different from mammalian cells. In the latter, the ER morphology, organization and dynamics are mainly driven by microtubules and microtubule-related motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Westrate et al., 2015</xref>). In net contrast, the plant ER is primarily anchored to and mobilized by the actomyosin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stefano and Brandizzi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ueda et al., 2010</xref>). Plant vacuoles are also in close proximity to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, interactions between plant ER and vacuolar membranes with bundled actin filaments form ER strands and <italic>trans</italic>-vacuolar strands (TVSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ueda et al., 2010</xref>). The regulatory mechanisms of these membrane structures are also unknown.</p><p>In this work, we report on the characterization of <italic>eva1</italic> (<italic>ER, vacuole and actin 1</italic>), a mutant with defects in vacuole morphogenesis and organization of actin filaments and endomembranes, which are associated mainly with actin in plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ueda et al., 2010</xref>). The <italic>eva1</italic> mutation is a loss-of-function allele of <italic>IPMS1</italic>, which encodes the first committed enzyme of Leu biosynthesis, resulting in elevated free Val levels. Through phenotypic and functional analyses of <italic>eva1</italic> and a series of other mutants of BCAA biosynthesis and TOR signaling, we demonstrate that the subcellular phenotypes of <italic>eva1</italic> specifically hinge upon up-regulation of TOR signaling, which in turn affects organization of actin and endomembranes, and plant development. Therefore, by focusing on mutants with constitutive TOR signaling mis-regulation due to altered endogenous BCAA levels, we demonstrated that plant TOR signaling is linked to BCAAs and is critical for the homeostasis of actin, endomembranes and growth. The broader implications of these findings are that, despite the acquisition of specialized functions of TOR signaling in plants, the activating inputs of TOR signaling and the subcellular consequences of TOR signaling mis-regulation are conserved across eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a mutant with defects in vacuole morphogenesis</title><p>We pursued a confocal microscopy-based screen on an EMS-mutagenized population to identify mutants with defects in the subcellular distribution of a GFP-tagged tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP), GFP-δTIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avila et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cutler et al., 2000</xref>). We focused on <italic>eva1</italic>, a mutant characterized by severe defects in vacuole morphology early in development. During the first 10 days after germination, in wild-type (WT) cotyledon epidermal cells, small vacuoles undergo membrane fusion to form a single large central vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast, 10 day old <italic>eva1</italic> cotyledon epidermal cells displayed numerous additional vacuolar structures that vary in shape and size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). To further characterize <italic>eva1</italic> vacuolar phenotypes, we focused on two prominent vacuolar structures that are rarely observed in wild type: TVSs and presumably unfused vacuoles. As we introduced, TVSs are strands formed upon association between vacuolar membrane and bundled actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ueda et al., 2010</xref>), which were greatly enhanced in number, length and thickness in <italic>eva1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–d</xref>). Besides, we defined presumably unfused vacuoles as spherical structures that are isolated from the large central vacuole and have diameter &gt;5 μm. Both two vacuolar phenotypes were attenuated in 20 day old <italic>eva1</italic> cotyledons, which closely resembled WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>). The <italic>eva1</italic> vacuole phenotypes were verified in 10 day old <italic>eva1</italic> cotyledons expressing γTIP-YFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>), which labels the large central vacuole and other vacuolar structures not marked by GFP-δTIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gattolin et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e–h</xref>).

Because TOR is the major negative regulator of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pu et al., 2017</xref>), the punctae are presumably autophagic structures resulting from the TOR inhibition by the chemicals. Untreated <italic>eva1</italic> cells contained numerous small vacuoles and conspicuous TVSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>); however, by 2 hr treatment with AZD-8055, these structures were reduced in appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). By 4 hr treatment, the <italic>eva1</italic> cells were indistinguishable from WT, including the appearance of the small punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e,f</xref>).

To do so, we used a variety of previously characterized BCAA mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xing and Last, 2017</xref>), combined with BCAA feeding. For example, <italic>ipms1-1<sup>D</sup></italic> was chosen because it has a modest Val decrease and Leu increase; <italic>ahass1-1</italic> has a small Val increase; <italic>ahass2-7</italic> has decreased Val and Leu; <italic>omr1-11<sup>D</sup></italic> has a &gt; 140 fold Ile increase compared to WT.

In addition to bundling of F-actin and enhancement of ER strands, supplementation of BCAAs also induced the formation of prominent TVSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these results support a general correlation between over-accumulation of BCAAs and distorted actin cytoskeleton and endomembranes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In eukaryotic cells, the TOR kinase coordinates cell growth and metabolism with nutrient sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Guan, 2019</xref>). In mammalian cells, the availability of BCAAs and other amino acids – as well as glucose and mammalian growth factors – regulates TOR signaling, which generally promotes growth via several downstream cellular processes, including mRNA translation, metabolism of nucleotides, sugar and lipids, protein turnover and cytoskeletal reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Guan, 2019</xref>). Prior to this work, in plant cells a functional connection between glucose availability and TOR activation had been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shi et al., 2018</xref>). Besides, a recent research found that mutation of IPMS1 leads to alteration of Leu biosynthesis and reduced sensitivity to TOR inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schaufelberger et al., 2019</xref>), but a role for BCAA homeostasis in TOR signaling was yet unknown. Furthermore, it was still unclear whether TOR signaling is connected to the morphogenesis and remodeling of subcellular structures, other than autophagic bodies. We demonstrated that TOR signaling senses BCAA homeostasis and modulates the organization of subcellular structures, including actin cytoskeleton and endomembranes. Indeed, we provide evidence that over-accumulation of BCAAs up-regulates TOR signaling, inducing actin bundling with formation of aberrant endomembrane structures and compromising overall growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Working model of TOR-regulated subcellular processes.</title><p>Over-accumulation of BCAA Val, Leu and Ile stimulates TOR signaling.

In plants, TOR-mediated meristem activation by sugar and light signals has been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pfeiffer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, a recent research suggested a connection between IPMS1-regulated Leu biosynthesis and TOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schaufelberger et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, this work identified another <italic>IPMS1</italic> mutant allele <italic>rol17</italic> with shorter primary root, and its primary root elongation is hyposensitive to TOR inhibitor treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schaufelberger et al., 2019</xref>). Considering that plants produce BCAAs de novo and their biosynthesis is stringently controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xing and Last, 2017</xref>), it is necessary to explore a general connection between TOR signaling and amino acid homeostasis.</p><p>In this study, using a series mutants of BCAA biosynthesis, exogenous feeding of BCAAs and mutants of TOR signaling, we provide evidence for a functional correlation between BCAA accumulation and TOR activity in plant cells. Indeed, we found that in early stage of growth (i.e., 10 days) BCAA over-accumulating mutants showed up-regulation of TOR, a phenotype that was recreated by BCAA feeding. Furthermore, a reduction in TOR signaling activation via dual and specific TOR inhibitors restored the actin and endomembrane phenotypes. Our results establish that plant TOR senses over-accumulation of BCAAs, and that up-regulation of TOR signaling alters the organization of actin cytoskeleton and associated endomembranes and controls plant growth. Our results indicate that plant TOR signaling and TOR-dependent growth regulation are highly responsive to BCAA availability, at least in early stages of growth, underscoring a previously unappreciated but significant role of these amino acids in TOR biology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>TOR signaling controls actin organization in plant cells</title><p>In yeast and mammalian cells, a reorganization of actin cytoskeleton was the first identified downstream effect specific to TORC2, which was also found to be independent of TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarbassov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmidt et al., 1996</xref>). The yeast and mammalian TORC2 phosphorylates other protein kinases, which signal to the Rho-coordinated cytoskeletal signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roelants et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, it has been demonstrated that Arabidopsis ROP2 interacts with TOR and mediates an auxin-to-TOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schepetilnikov et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting an interplay among TOR, ROPs and the cytoskeleton in plant cells. In terms of TORC2 activation, in mammalian cells, Rictor and mTOR, but not Raptor, are required for PKC phosphorylation and actin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarbassov et al., 2004</xref>), and nutrient repletion after starvation stimulates actin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacinto et al., 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, much less is known about the activation mechanism of mTORC2 than that of mTORC1. Therefore, how BCAAs activate a potential TORC2 in plant cells is still an open question (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The evidence provided in our work for promoted actin bundling phenotype in mutants with BCAA over-accumulation or upon BCAA supplementation to WT provides direct support for a functional interaction between TOR and the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, our evidence that the BCAA-induced actin reorganization relies on functional TOR but not RAPTOR, which defines TORC1, extends these conclusions at a mechanistic level about the exclusive functions of TOR interactors and specific downstream processes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Plant endomembrane homeostasis is correlated with TOR activity</title><p>In this work, we have shown that an over-accumulation of BCAAs affects the morphology of the tonoplast, ER and Golgi distribution. Our results also showed that attenuation of TOR signaling in BCAA over-accumulating mutants leads to a restoration of the defective actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane morphology. We propose therefore that in plant cells a stringent relationship exists between endomembrane organization and TOR-signaling, which occurs via a functional connection of TOR with the actin cytoskeleton. Depending on nutrient status, TORC1 regulates the size and number of yeast vacuoles and mammalian lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Michaillat et al., 2012</xref>). In light of the conserved functions of nutrient storage and turnover that are shared by plant and yeast vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), a TORC1-dependent control of the vacuolar homeostasis may be conserved in plant cells. An auxin-dependent actin remodeling has been also recently invoked in controlling vacuole occupancy in the plant cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Löfke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scheuring et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, a recent work reported regulation of vacuole expansion by extracellular LRX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>), whose mutation resulted in root hair defects that can be suppressed by mutation of IPMS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schaufelberger et al., 2019</xref>). In this work, we provided evidence for a remodeling of actin through TORC1-independent TOR signaling. Therefore, we propose that TOR activity is involved in morphogenesis of the central vacuole, but this may occur through mechanisms that are not conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Plant growth and TOR signaling</title><p>BCAAs are crucial nutrients that humans and other animals must obtain from diets. Significant deficits exist in the amino acid composition of plant feed sources for livestock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boisen et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, BCAAs serve as human dietary supplements, because they potently promote protein synthesis through TOR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shimomura et al., 2004</xref>). Fortification of crops with BCAAs is therefore desirable to improve plant nutritional content. However, studies in Arabidopsis reported that BCAA over-accumulation due to exogenous feeding or genetic manipulation of biosynthetic or catabolic pathways resulted in various defects in plant growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xing and Last, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Field et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Imhof et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we established a functional connection between BCAA over-accumulation and plant growth inhibition, which is likely linked to alteration of TOR signaling and disruption of subcellular structures. Despite an overall retardation of early plant development compared to WT, <italic>ipms1</italic> seedlings exhibited up-regulation of the growth-promoting TOR signaling in concert with locally promoted growth, such as larger and thicker cotyledons and higher activity of root apical meristem. At the subcellular level, we showed that BCAA over-accumulation via exogenous feeding or genetic mutations caused severe remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and endomembranes, which underlies certain growth defects such as delayed formation of root hairs and reduced abundance of lateral roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stefano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ketelaar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deeks et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, <italic>ipms1</italic> mutants show increase in leaf thickness and alteration of chloroplast ultrastructure, which is similar to a knockdown mutant of isopropylmalate isomerase (IPMI), the enzyme following IPMS for Leu biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Imhof et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting an association of BCAA accumulation with defective chloroplast development. Together, our results indicate that an inconsistency between nutrient status and the activity of metabolic signaling is detrimental to plant growth and development. By adding new insights into the fundamental understanding of plant growth control by metabolic signaling, our study supports that developmentally controlled manipulation of TOR signaling may be required for successful engineering of crops with improved yield and nutritional values.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

To the ground tissue, 350 μL of extraction buffer was added, vortexed for 10 s and heated at 90°C for 10 min. Tubes were cooled on ice for 5 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C at 13,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to a low-binding hydrophilic 0.2 μm centrifugal polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter (Millipore, UFC30LG25) and centrifuged for 5 min at 3,500 × g. 150 μL flow through was transferred to 2 mL glass vials with glass insert for LC-MS analysis.</p><p>Amino acid detection and quantification by LC-MS/MS was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xing and Last, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angelovici et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, a dilution series (12.2 nM to 250 μM) of each individual amino acid standard was made containing the same concentration of the heavy standards as was in the amino acid extraction buffer. Samples were injected into a Quattro micro API LC/MS/MS (Waters) equipped with an Acquity UHPLC HSS T3 1.8 μm column (Waters) using a three-function method. The 13 min LC method with solvent A (10 mM PFHA) and solvent B (acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/minute is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Amino acids were quantified by comparison to their standard curves using QuanLynx.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>EdU staining</title><p>EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) staining of root apical meristem was performed using Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Kit (Invitrogen, C10337), following a protocol that was adapted for plant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kotogány et al., 2010</xref>). Labeling was performed by incubating 10 day old Arabidopsis seedlings in 10 μM EdU in Arabidopsis growth medium (½ LS and 1% sucrose) for 30 min in a Percival chamber. All samples were then incubated with a fixation buffer (4% formaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 × PBS) for 30 min. All samples were washed for three times, 10 min each, with 1 × PBS after fixation. The EdU detection was conducted by 30 min incubation in dark with the Click-iT cocktail, which was prepared according to the manual of Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Kit. Each sample was immediately washed for three times, 10 min each, with 1 × PBS before imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>PI staining of root tip and measurement</title><p>PI (propidium iodide) staining was conducted by 3 min incubation of Arabidopsis seedlings in propidium iodide (Invitrogen, P3566) diluted to 1 μg/mL using Arabidopsis growth medium (½ LS and 1% sucrose). After staining, all samples were immediately washed for 1 min and then subjected to imaging. Confocal images of propidium iodide stained root tips were analyzed using Cell-O-Tape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">French et al., 2012</xref>), which is a plugin of ImageJ that automatically segments three zones in a root tip (the meristem, the transition zone and the mature zone) by comparing the lengths of adjacent cells in the same cortical layer. Adjacent cells with significant increase in cell length belong to the transition zone. Cells before and after the transition zone are categorized as cells in the meristem and the mature zone respectively. The program records the length of each cell and the cell number in each zone.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Protein preparation and immunoblotting</title><p>To detect the phosphorylation status of S6K, 50 mg plant aerial tissue was used for protein extraction using 1.5 mL extraction buffer of 1 × PBS, pH 7.4, containing 250 mM sucrose, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, P9599) and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor (Roche, 4906845001). Three times of centrifugation, 1 k × g for 5 min, 14 k × g for 5 min and 135 k × g for 30 min, were conducted to separate the soluble proteins. The supernatant from the last centrifugation was separated, concentrated to 200 μL using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal unit (Millipore, UFC501024), and then mixed with 40 μL 6 × Laemmli buffer. Proteins were denatured by incubation at 95°C for 10 min. Protein samples were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE with 8M urea and blotted to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, 1620177). Blots were blocked with 5% milk for 1 hr at room temperature. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies of either anti-S6K (Agrisera, AS12 1855) or anti-S6K-phosphorylated (Abcam, ab207399) overnight at 4°C and subsequently with secondary HRP conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, A0545) for 1 hr at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Extraction and measurement of anthocyanins</title><p>The aerial parts of 10 day old Arabidopsis seedlings were collected, and then lyophilized and measured for dry weight. Total anthocyanins were extracted using 1 μL extraction buffer (50% methanol containing 3% formic acid) per 50 μg dry weight. After overnight incubation with extraction buffer at room temperature, the supernatant was collected and measured absorbance of 532 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>TEM and measurement of leaf thickness</title><p>The electron microscopic imaging of the endomembrane structures and chloroplasts were performed following an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). In brief, 1 mm ×1 mm pieces of cotyledon samples were cut and fixed in TEM fixative buffer (2.5% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) with vacuum infiltration. The fixed samples were stained with 1% osmium tetroxide overnight at 4°C. After series of dehydration with acetone, the samples were infiltrated and embedded in Spurr’s Resin. Sections with 50 nm thickness were cut and mounted on the copper grid and 10 well slides. For TEM, the grids were post-stained in 2% uranyl-acetate for 30 min and then treated with 1% lead citrate for 15 min. JEOL 100CX TEM (JEOL USA) was used to observe the ultrastructure of cotyledon.</p><p>The thickness of cotyledons was measured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weraduwage et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, 2 mm ×1 mm samples cut from the center of the cotyledons were fixed in fixative buffer (4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 1 × PBS, pH 7.4) with vacuum infiltration. The fixed samples were stained with 1% osmium tetroxide overnight at 4°C. After series of dehydration with acetone, the samples were infiltrated and embedded in Spurr’s Resin. Sections with 500 nm thickness were cut and mounted on the copper grid and 10 well slides. For leaf thickness analysis, the sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue for 1 min and washed with running water. Images were taken using Axio Imager M2 (Zeiss), and measurement of leaf thickness was performed using AxioVision SE64 Rel. 4.9.1 (Zeiss) software. Three biological samples with three technical replicates were used to measure leaf thickness.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Natasha Raikhel for the kind donation of the EMS mutant line.

biological approaches to reveal how plant growth is linked to nutrition sensing. The authors’ forward genetic approach has identified isopropylmalate synthase 1 (IPMS1), a critical enzyme for Leu biosynthesis, as a modulator of vacuolar morphology. The authors’ in-depth characterization of this mutant revealed that the homeostasis of branched-chain amino acids impacts TOR activity and, thereby, modulates actin cytoskeleton organization. In addition, the authors provide evidence that this mechanism has an immediate influence on plant expansion.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Homeostasis of Branched-Chain Amino Acids Is Critical for the Activity of TOR Signaling in Arabidopsis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jürgen Kleine-Vehn as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were largely positive about your forward genetic approach and in depth characterization of how the homeostasis of branched-chain amino acids impact on TOR-dependent subcellular processes.

In general, it would be, hence, nice to truly quantify these subcellular phenotypes (lack of quantification is apparent in Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2; Figure 4—figure supplement 4; Figure 5; Figure 5—figure supplement 1; Figure 6; Figure 6—figure supplement 1; Figure 7; Figure 7—figure supplement 1).

This link has been well described in yeast and animal cells but was so far not established in plants. These findings are clearly of interest since the mechanisms linking TOR to nutrients are much less characterized in plants then in other eukaryotes.</p><p>The authors have used a forward genetic screen for defects in vacuolar morphology in Arabidopsis and have uncovered a mutation in an enzyme (IPMS1) involved in Leu biosynthesis. The authors then showed that disruption in BCAA homeostasis through <italic>ipms1</italic> mutations result in pleiotropic defects in AA metabolism, growth and developments of the mutant lines as well as perturbations in ER and actin networks. Finally, these defects were linked to activation of the TOR signalling pathway by pharmaceutical and genetic means.</p><p>The findings in this manuscript are novel, and the claims are most of the time well supported by the solid and convincing experimental results. This paper is very well presented and easy to read.</p><p>Nevertheless, I have a few issues which would need to be resolved by the authors.</p><p>1) In a very recent paper, Schaufelberger et al., 2019, found that a mutation in IPMS1 suppresses the <italic>lrx1</italic> phenotype (aberrant root hairs) that is also suppressed by TOR. This <italic>ipms1</italic> allele, called <italic>rol17</italic>, shows reduced sensitivity to the TOR inhibitor AZD8055 suggesting higher TOR activity. I believe that this publication should be cited and discussed. For example the effect of <italic>ipms1</italic> mutation on root hair morphology in response to TOR is already described in this published article, although in a different genetic context. By the way, the JEB special issue in which this paper appeared also provides some more recent reviews on the TOR pathway in plants which could be added in the Introduction section.</p><p>2) To better support their claims, I think that the authors could explore the effect of BCAA supplied to the plant growth medium on TOR activity.</p><p>3) In Figure 7, the authors convincingly show that TOR activity is needed to observe the effects of BCAA on actin organization. I wonder how was the &quot;red line&quot; defined and positioned? Are the fluorescence profiles consistent across the images? Maybe some kind of statistical analysis would be needed here to support the authors' conclusions.</p><p>4) From the analysis of a raptor mutant (a specific component of the TORC1 complex) in Figure 7, the authors concluded that the impact of BCAA is not linked to TORC1 but maybe to a putative plant TORC2 complex. While the TORC2 complex has been identified and well described in yeast and animals, the existence of such a complex in plants remains elusive. Moreover, there are two Raptor genes in Arabidopsis and the single raptor1 mutants displays limited phenotypic changes, while the raptor double mutants are more severely affected (see Anderson et al., 2005). Double raptor mutants could be used here but are barely viable. I think that authors should be more cautious in their conclusions on the role of TORC1 in BCAA activation of TOR. Moreover, Son et al. and Ericksen et al. recently showed (Cell Metabolism 2019) that Leu and BCAA effect is TORC1-dependent.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The analysis of <italic>eva1</italic> as a modulator of actin and vacuole development is interesting. The connection to TOR is interesting as well. However, the authors must have overseen the publication by Schaufelberger et al., 2019, demonstrating that mutations in IPMS1 influence TOR. Thus, the novelty of an IMPS1 mutation affecting the TOR network is not new; the type of data are still new since this other publication used a completely different approach and made other analyses. It is important, however, that the authors address this paper and take it into consideration in their Discussion. Several times in the manuscript, it is difficult for a non-specialist reader to understand how the analyses were done (e.g. Figure 7) and the conclusions were drawn.</p><p>The following points should be addressed (there are neither page nor line numbers, which makes it difficult to indicate the position in the text!):</p><p>1) The Abstract is not ideal; what does glucose have to do with BCAA (considering that at this point, the reader doesn't know about BCAA's role in TOR)</p><p>2) The Introduction should contain information on vacuole development and introduce the experimental set-up.

In fact, the authors show that TOR is the link between Leu biosynthesis and these observed cellular effects.</p><p>6) Explain, how the experiment on the retention of SEC-RFP was done.</p><p>7) I don't understand Figure 7. what are the graphs? The explanation in the legend doesn't clarify. Please re-formulate</p><p>8) The Discussion remains rather superficial and does not really go into the details of the findings or just don't mention them again. For example, what do we learn from the change in chloroplast/grana structures? How come that a short root has more and longer cells and a more active meristem? TOR activity seems increased, which would produce longer roots (inhibiting TOR by AZD or Torin treatment causes shorter roots). How do the findings fit with the literature on vacuole development.? Importantly, put it in the context of the Schaufelberger et al. (JXB). There, inhibiting TOR mimics the effect of the mutation in <italic>ipms1</italic>, which is different from the findings described here. Also, <italic>imps1</italic> and inhibiting TOR by AZD suppresses a mutation in an LRR-extensin gene, encoding a type of protein that influences vacuole development (Dünser et al., 2019). Thus, there is published evidence that support the findings described in this manuscript, and this should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50747.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] 1) The reviewers did not insist on the genetic interaction data, but encourage you to include it in case the experiments are currently ongoing.

Lower concentrations (0.1 and 0.2 μM) of AZD-8055 promote growth; however, as plausible because of TOR inhibition, higher concentrations (0.4, 0.6 and 1.0 μM) of AZD-8055 inhibit <italic>ipms1</italic> primary root elongation. By comparison, even a minimal concentration of AZD-8055 inhibits wild type primary root elongation.</p><p>As we explained in the manuscript, wortmannin is a PI3K/TOR dual inhibitor, and therefore it may exert multiple effects on plant growth. Barberon et al., 2014 PNAS, Supplementary Figure 3 presents a minimal but significant inhibition of wild type primary root elongation by 1, 10 and 33 μM wortmannin (n ≥ 8). Consistently, our investigation found that 33 μM wortmannin significantly inhibits primary root elongation of wild type and three <italic>ipms1</italic> lines (Figure 5—figure supplement 3C, n = 50 and 100). However, 1 or 10 μM wortmannin did not significantly inhibit wild type primary root elongation.

Besides, Raptor 1a is likely redundant and hence the lack of single mutant phenotype is not conclusive.</p></disp-quote><p>In this manuscript, we do not show evidence or propose that potential plant TORC1 and TORC2 are differentially activated. The study of potential differential activation is essentially constrained because TORC2 has not been identified. So far only a single TOR and two TOR interactors, Raptor and LST8, have been identified in plants. In yeast and mammalian models, the Raptor homolog is the defining component of TORC1 and the LST8 homolog exists in both TORC1 and TORC2. Besides, sensors and signaling components of the amino acid sensing pathway upstream of TOR are also unknown in plants.</p><p>We used a well-characterized T-DNA insertion mutant of <italic>AtRaptor1B</italic> (also known as <italic>Raptor2</italic>) because of several considerations. Deprost et al., 2005 found disruption of <italic>AtRaptor1A (Raptor1</italic>) has no visible effects on embryo and plant development; Anderson et al., 2005 found <italic>raptor1a</italic> mutant shows almost no changes in their morphology and development; Pu et al., 2017 found <italic>raptor1a</italic> mutant shows minimal defects in autophagy. Therefore, later studies only used <italic>raptor1b</italic> mutant to characterize the functions of TORC1(Salem et al., 2017; Salem et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). Besides, the <italic>raptor1ab</italic> double mutant is possibly not informative, because its growth is severely affected and barely viable after embryogenesis (Anderson et al., 2005). Moreover, it is important to consider the multiple layers of reciprocal regulation between TORC1 and TORC2 in yeast and mammalian cells (covered by reviews of Saxton and Sabatini, 2017, and Xie et al., 2018). Therefore, it may not be possible to find a situation, such as the <italic>raptor1ab</italic> double mutant, where TORC1 is completely disabled, while TORC2 is still not affected.</p><p>To address your point on quantification, we revised the following figures. Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1: To provide quantitative data to describe the vacuolar phenotypes of <italic>eva1/ipms1</italic>, we measured the number of unfused vacuoles and the length of trans-vacuolar strands (TVSs) in cells expressing the tonoplast marker GFP-δTIP. We clarified that we defined unfused vacuoles as spherical structures that are isolated from the large central vacuole and with diameter &gt; 5 μm. Notably, the TVSs were rarely, if ever, observed in 10-day old cotyledon cells of wild type, but very abundant in the mutant. We underlined this marked differences in the text and legend relevant to Figure 1. Because of the obvious phenotype, we did not quantify TVSs in the later figures.</p><p>In Figure 1—figure supplement 1, we used γTIP-YFP to show the <italic>eva1</italic> vacuolar phenotypes are not an artefact due to the choice of GFP-δTIP marker. However, compared to GFP-δTIP, γTIP-YFP labeled numerous additional vacuolar structures. The nature of these vacuolar structures is still not well understood (Gattolin et al., 2010), and the unfused vacuoles are not clearly shown by γTIP-YFP. Therefore, we did not see the necessity to quantify the TVSs and but we provided magnified images showing the enhanced TVSs in <italic>eva1</italic> background for comparison to wild type.</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 2: We quantified the number of unfused vacuoles in each cell.</p><p>Figure 4—figure supplement 4 presents photographs showing primary root elongation on Lat B medium, which are already accompanied with quantification of primary root elongation.</p><p>Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1: We measured the number of unfused vacuoles in each cell, in wild type and in mutant, before and after inhibitor treatment.

First, the unfused vacuole phenotype is observed in <italic>ipms1</italic> mutants (Figure 1A; Figure 1—figure supplement 2D) and wild type growing with BCAA supplementation (Figure 7—figure supplement 3), which we showed are associated with up-regulated TOR signaling. Furthermore, the unfused vacuole phenotype is recovered by TOR inhibitor AZD-8055 and Torin2 (Figure 6A-F; Figure 6—figure supplement 1; Figure 7—figure supplement 3). These results have been discussed in light of a large number of recent publications in yeast and mammalian cells, which indicate that the dynamic fusion, fission and size of vacuoles and lysosomes are controlled by TOR signaling through yet unknown mechanisms. We included discussion of two representative publications (Yu et al., 2010; Michaillat et al., 2012) showing that depending on the nutrient status TORC1 regulates the size and number of yeast vacuoles and mammalian lysosomes (subsection “Plant endomembrane homeostasis is correlated with TOR activity”).</p><p>Wortmannin inhibits PI3K and PI4K activity and phospholipid synthesis in plant cells (Matsuoka et al., 1995 JCB), and therefore it directly effects the membrane fusion machinery (Wickner, 2010 Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol). Wortmannin-induced vacuole fusion has been demonstrated by several studies in plant cells (Wang et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2014; Alvarez et al., 2016 JXB; Zheng et al., 2014). Importantly, Wm and LY294002 are effective inhibitors of mammalian TOR (Brunn et al., 1996) and are considered as PI3K/TOR dual inhibitors (Benjamin et al., 2011). Our work supports that caution should be taken when interpreting wortmannin’s effects on vacuole and actin in the study of membrane traffic in general. Indeed, our work supports that the role of TOR as master regulator of actin organization is conserved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I have a few issues which would need to be resolved by the authors.</p><p>1) In a very recent paper, Schaufelberger et al., 2019) found that a mutation in IPMS1 suppresses the lrx1 phenotype (aberrant root hairs) that is also suppressed by TOR.

To our knowledge, such a drastic reorganization has been reported in mammalian cultured cells upon TOR stimulation, but has not been reported in intact organisms. In order to clarify the experimental setup and the interpretation, we revised the description in figure legends. Higher fluorescence intensity of the actin marker suggests more bundling of actin filaments. Using ImageJ, we drew a 50 μm arrowed line to detect the fluorescence intensity of the pixels covered by such a line. In each image, the arrowed line is positioned where we detected the highest fluorescence intensity in non-saturating imaging conditions. A chart beneath the image presents plotted fluorescence intensity along the red arrowed line. Without actin bundling, fine actin filaments have fluorescence intensity about 1000 (relative units). In contrast, induced actin bundling show fluorescence intensity peaks of 3000 – 4000 (relative units). The images were acquired with the same confocal image settings of laser, detectors and pinhole aperture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) From the analysis of a raptor mutant (a specific component of the TORC1 complex) in Figure 7, the authors concluded that the impact of BCAA is not linked to TORC1 but maybe to a putative plant TORC2 complex. While the TORC2 complex has been identified and well described in yeast and animals, the existence of such a complex in plants remains elusive. Moreover, there are two Raptor genes in Arabidopsis and the single raptor1 mutants displays limited phenotypic changes, while the raptor double mutants are more severely affected (see Anderson et al., 2005). Double raptor mutants could be used here but are barely viable. I think that authors should be more cautious in their conclusions on the role of TORC1 in BCAA activation of TOR.

Son et al., found that a metabolite of Leu promotes Raptor acetylation and mTORC1 activation. Ericksen et al., found that loss of BCAA catabolism enhances mTORC1 activity during tumor development. These two papers provide important evidence supporting that amino acid sensing is upstream of mTORC1. However, considering the complexity of amino acid sensing mechanisms (e.g., various sensors for specific amino acids and signaling components, mostly reviewed by Kim and Guan, 2019), BCAAs may also signal to mTORC2 in a mTORC1-independent manner. In two seminal studies of mTORC2, Sarbassov et al., 2004, found Rictor and mTOR, but not Raptor, are required for PKC phosphorylation and actin organization; Jacinto et al., 2004, found nutrient repletion after starvation stimulates actin organization. Nevertheless, much less is known about the activation mechanism of mTORC2 than that of mTORC1. Therefore, we discussed this issue in the manuscript and added a question mark for TORC2 activation by BCAAs in the proposed model (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The analysis of eva1 as a modulator of actin and vacuole development is interesting.

Despite <italic>ipms1</italic> root tips having longer zones and more cells in each zone compared to wild type, <italic>ipms1</italic> cell length is shorter than wild type, which is shown by a new chart Figure 3— figure supplement 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In &quot;loss of function of IPMS1….&quot;: homotypic vacuoles and F-actin bundling are affected and influenced by TOR, but there is no evidence that this is directly caused by the altered Leu biosynthesis. In fact, the authors show that TOR is the link between Leu biosynthesis and these observed cellular effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results and conclusions are not centered on altered Leu biosynthesis. Using BCAA profiling of <italic>ipms1</italic> mutants, other BCAA biosynthetic mutants and exogenous feeding of BCAAs, we revealed a generalized causal relationship between BCAA over-accumulation, up-regulated TOR activity, and reorganization of subcellular structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Explain, how the experiment on the retention of SEC-RFP was done.</p></disp-quote><p>As we introduced in the subsection “The organization of ER network and actin cytoskeleton is altered in <italic>eva1</italic>”, SEC-RFP is a bulk flow marker and its secretion to apoplast indicates proper activity of bulk-flow secretion, which is an important function of secretory pathway and endomembrane system. On the other hand, retention of SEC-RFP inside cells indicates defects in secretion, such as protein sorting in the trans-Golgi network in citation 51 and 52 (Renna et al., 2013; Renna et al., 2018). In both wild type and <italic>eva1</italic>, SEC-RFP is secreted to apoplast and not retained inside cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A), posing that although in <italic>eva1</italic> the organization of ER and Golgi is altered, but bulk-flow traffic is not affected. This has been verified also in other mutants, such as <italic>gom8/rhd3-7</italic> (Stefano et al., 2012) and <italic>g92/sec24b</italic> (Faso et al., 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) I don't understand Figure 7. what are the graphs? The explanation in the legend doesn't clarify. Please re-formulate</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the experimental setup and the interpretation of the results. Higher fluorescence intensity of the actin marker indicates more bundling of actin filaments. Using ImageJ, we drew a 50 μm arrowed line to detect the pixel fluorescence intensity beneath such a line. In each image, the arrowed line is positioned where we detected the highest fluorescence intensity using non-saturating imaging settings. A chart beneath the image presents plotted fluorescence intensity along the red arrowed line. Without actin bundling, fine actin filaments have fluorescence intensity about 1000 (relative unit). In contrast, induced actin bundling show fluorescence intensity peaks of 3000 – 4000 (relative unit). The images were acquired with the same confocal image settings of laser, detectors and pinhole aperture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The Discussion remains rather superficial and does not really go into the details of the findings or just don't mention them again. For example, what do we learn from the change in chloroplast/grana structures? How come that a short root has more and longer cells and a more active meristem? TOR activity seems increased, which would produce longer roots (inhibiting TOR by AZD or Torin treatment causes shorter roots). How do the findings fit with the literature on vacuole development.? Importantly, put it in the context of the Schaufelberger et al., 2019. There, inhibiting TOR mimics the effect of the mutation in ipms1, which is different from the findings described here. Also, imps1 and inhibiting TOR by AZD suppresses a mutation in an LRR-extensin gene, encoding a type of protein that influences vacuole development (Dünser et al., 2019). Thus, there is published evidence that support the findings described in this manuscript, and this should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your encouragement to discuss all <italic>ipms1</italic> phenotypes. To our knowledge the subcellular characterization proposed in our work is novel and establishes <italic>ipms1</italic> as a model to study up-regulation of TOR signaling in planta at a cell and organ level. Therefore, we provided further discussion, as recommended. Here, we briefly summarize the new points as the follows. One of the most notable <italic>ipms1</italic> plant growth phenotypes is the increase in leaf thickness and alteration of chloroplast ultrastructure, which is similar to a knockdown mutant of isopropylmalate isomerase (IPMI), the enzyme following IPMS for Leu biosynthesis (Imhof et al., 2014). These results support an association of BCAA accumulation with defective chloroplast development. Loss of stroma thylakoid was reported in a mutant defective in photosystem I assembly (Liu et al., 2012 Plant Cell), but the underlying mechanism is unclear.</p><p>Furthermore, our data indicate that TOR activity in <italic>ipms1</italic> mutants is higher than wild type. In <italic>ipms1</italic> mutants, an inconsistency between nutrient status and the activity of TOR metabolic signaling is detrimental to plant growth and development. A supplemented measurement of primary root length on medium with increasing concentrations of AZD-8055 provides direct evidence, because low concentrations of AZD-8055 promote <italic>ipms1</italic> primary root elongation (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). We also found that abrupt activation of TOR affects root development possibly through actin organization, because <italic>ipms1</italic> mutants show severely delayed formation root hairs (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) and defective development of overall root system, despite of a higher activity of root apical meristem.</p><p>We also discussed our findings about vacuole morphogenesis and root development in light of the reports by Schaufelberger et al., 2019, and Dünser et al., 2019, in the context of BCAA activating TOR and TOR regulating vacuole morphology (Discussion, first paragraph and subsection “Plant endomembrane homeostasis is correlated with TOR activity”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
