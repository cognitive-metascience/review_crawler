Its asymmetric distribution goes through three steps: emergence of cortical dots, development of island-like structures with dynamic amorphous shapes, repeating fusion and fission, and polarized clustering of the islands. Our findings also showed that these islands contain a meshwork of unit-like segments. Furthermore, Par-complex patches resembling Par-islands exist in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitotic neuroblasts. Thus, this reconstruction system provides an experimental paradigm to study features of the assembly process and structure of Par-dependent cell-autonomous polarity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Par complex</kwd><kwd>reconstruction</kwd><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>synthetic biology</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>super resolution microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006264</institution-id><institution>RIKEN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuzaki</surname><given-names>Fumio</given-names></name><name><surname>Fujita</surname><given-names>Ikumi</given-names></name><name><surname>Kono</surname><given-names>Kalyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Par-complex-dependent cell polarity can be cell-autonomously conferred to non-polar <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, unveiling temporal patterns toward the cortical localization of Par-complex aggregates that include a meshwork containing unit segments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polarization is a fundamental cellular property that plays a vital role in various biological processes in multi-cellular as well as single-cell organisms. Par-complex system is a conserved mechanism that regulates cell polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kemphues et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suzuki and Ohno, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">St Johnston, 2018</xref>). The core Par-complex consists of Par6, Par3, and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kemphues et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tabuse et al., 1998</xref>). Domain structures of these components and their interactions have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lang and Munro, 2017</xref>). Par3 exhibits membrane-binding affinity through its C-terminal domain and the ability to self-oligomerize via its N-terminal CR1 domain, which is essential for its localization and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benton and St Johnston, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mizuno et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krahn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harris, 2017</xref>). Structural studies have revealed that the CR1 domain forms helical polymers of 10 nm diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Par6 and aPKC, which form a stable subcomplex, interact with the CR3 and PDZ domains of Par3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Izumi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Renschler et al., 2018</xref>). Phosphorylation of this domain by aPKC inhibits this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morais-de-Sá et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soriano et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, Par-complex assembly is a dynamic process. Cdc42 binds to the aPKC-Par6 subcomplex and anchors it to the cell membrane as a diffusible cortical form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joberty et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aceto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) On the other hand, Lgl and/or Par1 kinase act as inhibitory factors against aPKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo and Kemphues, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betschinger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamanaka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plant et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hurov et al., 2004</xref>), and distribute complementarily to the core Par complex. Interplay between these components results in cytocortical asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doerflinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sailer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cell polarization involving the Par-complex in situ is linked to various other processes. The Par-complex creates epithelial cell polarity during interphase at the subapical domain (including tight junctions) that is tightly associated with adherens junctions, where Par3 primarily localizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suzuki and Ohno, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, cell polarization is coupled with mitosis during asymmetric divisions, and autonomously induced or triggered by an external cue, depending on the cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>). Because of such association between Par-dependent polarization and other processes, the Par-complex exhibits different behavioral characteristics in an individual context, making it difficult to determine general features of the dynamic process taking place during cell polarization by the Par-complex. To understand the general and dynamic characteristics of the cell polarization process induced by the Par-complex, we attempted to reconstruct Par-complex-dependent cell polarization system in a cell-autonomous manner using non-polar cells. We used <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider cells (S2 cells) of mesodermal origin, as host cells for cell-autonomous reconstruction of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider, 1972</xref>). They are neither polarized nor adhere to the substratum and between cells. To date, Baas <italic>et al</italic>. reconstructed epithelial cells that can form epithelial sheets from a cultured cell line bearing a partial epithelial character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baas et al., 2004</xref>). Johnston <italic>et al</italic>. expressed a fusion protein of a cell adhesion molecule and aPKC in S2 cells, allowing a pair of transfected S2 cells to adhere each other via this fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>). This resulted in the restricted cortical distribution of aPKC in the non-cell autonomous manner. However, there is no study in which cell polarity is successfully conferred to non-polar cells such as S2 cells in the cell autonomous manner. The three core components of the Par-complex are endogenously expressed in S2 cells but are distributed in the cytoplasm throughout the cell cycle. Thus, S2 cells appear to be an ideal system for cell polarity induction. We succeeded to reconstruct polarized Par-complex clustering by overexpressing Par3 in S2 cells. Using this polarity reconstruction system, we investigated the temporal pattern and dynamics of Par-complex clustering, and the fine structure of the Par-complex clusters at the super resolution level.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>S2 cells polarize by an elevated expression of Par3</title><p>First, we tested the effect of overexpressing each core component of the Par-complex in S2 cells, which distribute these components evenly throughout the cytoplasm and divide symmetrically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that all core components of the Par-complex cortically co-localized in an asymmetric manner when Par3 was overexpressed, but did not cortically localize, when Par6 or aPKC was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, and data not shown).

Asymmetric distribution of the Par-complex induced by Par3 overexpression required endogenous aPKC and Par6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

ASI is defined by the maximum difference in the cumulative intensity of fluorescence (such as Par3-mKate2 and Par6-GFP) between a half cell perimeter and the other half at the equatorial plane of the cell, normalized via dividing by the cumulative intensity of the entire cell perimeter. (<bold>B</bold>) ASI distribution was compared between cells expressing memGFP and those expressing Par3-mKate2 at the cell cortex, both of which were driven by the Act-Gal4xUAS system.

Since memGFP, in principle, has no ability to polarize, such a wide distribution originated from the fluctuation of random distribution along the equatorial cell perimeter and also from the existence of local membrane flairs. Distribution of ASI for cells showing cortical Par3 distribution (mean = 0.34 ± 0.18) may be categorized into two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>); a group of cells show low ASIs overlapping with those of cells expressing memGFP in the range from 0 to 0.35, indicating that cells belonging to this group are essentially non-polarized.

When the distribution of Par6-GFP and Par3-mKate2 along the S2 cell cortex were examined at 3 hr post-induction, where small Par-islands have been formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we confirmed that both proteins show a nearly identical cortical pattern in islands and dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C,E</xref>) with a minor difference in the local fluorescent intensity gradient between them. We also checked the relationship of this overlapping cortical distribution of Par3 and Par6 with that of Cdc42, which is known to form a complex with aPKC-Par6 separately from Par3-Par6-aPKC complex. We confirmed cortical distribution of Cdc42 in a punctate or short string shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Slaughter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sartorel et al., 2018</xref>).

For this measurement, we chose the ‘non-neighboring region’ defined as the regions along the cell membrane more than 5 μm away from the edge of neighboring Par-islands. This is to avoid the influence of the presence of Par-islands (see Materials and methods section for details).

These results indicate that the curvature radius of Par-islands is significantly smaller than that of cell membrane curvature in non-neighboring regions, which is virtually consistent with the radius of S2 cells that we used for experiments.

In order to determine whether there was regularity in these structures, we measured contour lengths of the Par3-mKate2-stained meshwork, including separate rods and polygons. This measurement yielded distribution of lengths with multiple peaks in the density plot. We then searched the regularity of these multiple peaks. We found that it was well fitted with a combination of seven Gaussian curves, which exhibited a peak interval of 0.38 ± 0.06 μm (mean ± s.d., hereafter); (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,D,F</xref>). We also performed spectral analysis of the density plot, and obtained a single major frequency of 2.4 μm<sup>–1</sup>, which gives a peak interval of 0.42 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>).

The Par-complex was broadly distributed over the cell cortex in the initial stages, when dots were very faintly visible. Although brighter fluorescence spots (similar to Par-islands) formed later, they were relatively smaller than the Par-islands in size, and mostly faint with ambiguous contours, compared to those formed by wild-type Par3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). Eventually, distribution of these Par-aggregates was little polarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>). These results suggested that the CR1 domain was important for all processes during the development of macro-scale structures of the Par-complex.</p><p>However, the endogenous Par3 expression may contribute to this phenotype under this condition. Therefore, we next examined the effect of Par3ΔCR1 overexpression after knocking down the endogenous Par3 by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1</xref>). RNAi treatment reduced the endogenous Par3 expression to 10% of the normal Par3 expression level. As the next step, we introduced silent mutations into the RNAi sequence part of the full-length Par3 and Par3ΔCR1 in the overexpression constructs to prevent the expression of these exogenous proteins from being knocked down by RNAi. We confirmed that the expression levels of the exogenous proteins bearing silent mutations, myc-Par3sm-GFP and flag-Par3ΔCR1sm-GFP, were not affected by simultaneous RNAi treatment of cells, and that the expression level of both exogenous proteins were nearly at the same level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We first examined the distribution of myc-Par3sm-GFP and flag-Par3ΔCR1sm-GFP by STED super-resolution microscopy. We confirmed a various size of Par-islands including large ones with a regular meshwork structure when full-length myc-Par3sm-GFP was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D</xref>, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). On the contrary, in the cells overexpressing flag-Par3ΔCR1sm-GFP, we often observed bright spots with an amorphous shape, and could rarely find clear island structures with a regular meshwork structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>). Thus, our STED observations strongly suggest that in the absence of Par3 CR1 domain, Par-islands consisting meshworks with unit-like segments were not formed.</p><p>We also measured the size of islands in S2 cells expressing Par3sm and that of bright regions of Par3ΔCR1sm at the steady state after RNAi suppression of the endogenous Par3 (see Materials and Materials and methods for details). The results show that the distribution of spot size after Par3ΔCR1 overexpression, which was independent of the knockdown of endogenous Par3 (data not shown), was quite different from that of Par-islands formed by the overexpression of Par3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12F,G</xref>); approximately 90% of bright spots are smaller in area than 1 μm<sup>2</sup> (the mean value = 0.44 ± 0.37 μm<sup>2</sup> (s.d.)). The size distribution of bright spots of Par3ΔCR1 was indistinguishable from most bright spots of Par-dots 2.5 hr after myc-Par3-GFP induction, when only a small fraction becomes Par-islands (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12G and H</xref>). These observations raise the possibility that Par3ΔCR1 still has an ability to form some cortical aggregates, either via (1) an un-identified domain in Par3 or (2) via Par6-aPKC, or (3) via the other components, while the development of Par3ΔCR1-containing aggregates is very limited.</p><p>All together, we conclude that the CR1 domain of Par3 is critical for Par-complex to form Par-islands with the regular meshwork and to asymmetrically localize in S2 cells. This conclusion is consistent with the previous finding that CR1 domain is an essential domain of the Par3 function to form the normal asymmetry in the cell cortex in the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benton and St Johnston, 2003</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the effect of aPKC-dependent phosphorylation at Serine 980 in the CR3 domain, which is necessary for dissociation of Par3 from aPKC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morais-de-Sá et al., 2010</xref>). Overexpressing the non-phosphorylatable form, Par3S980A, which tightly binds aPKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morais-de-Sá et al., 2010</xref>), rapidly promoted aPKC complex aggregation, and the polarized region initially assumed a bowl-like shape, in which clustering of the Par-islands was so tight under this condition that the island structure was not easy to be discriminated (see images at 3 hr 20 min in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>).

Using this polarity reconstruction system, we revealed that large Par complex clusters are composed of a meshwork containing unit-like segments, which dynamically associated and dissociated with each other. S2 cells endogenously express Par3, Par6 and aPKC, but never cortically localize them nor asymmetrically in the natural state. The cell polarity reconstructed by our strategy requires endogenous Par6, aPKC, and Lgl, and hence this reconstruction system appears to reproduce the fundamental properties of Par-dependent polarization in vivo, at least in part. Especially, the apical crescent of Par-complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts turned out to have a large structure similar to Par-island structures that evolves in S2 cell system. This would be another evidence that this reconstruction is useful model in order to extract general properties of polarization of the Par-complex.

We will discuss the advantages and limit (or points to be improved) of this system.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Temporal patterns of Par-complex aggregation</title><p>In our reconstruction system, cortical asymmetry began with the formation and growth of cortical dot-like structures, which were also reportedly associated with anterior localization of the Par-complex in <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dickinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Munro et al., 2004</xref>). Par-dots in the S2 cell system included all three Par-complex components. Thus, these dots appear to be the common initial process of Par-complex cortical aggregation. In parallel with the growth of Par-dots, string-like structures often emerged. The subsequent process of asymmetric localization proceeded in the form of Par-islands with amorphous and dynamic behavior. To our knowledge, this type of Par-complex form with such a dynamic behavior has not been explicitly described in cortical Par-complex assembly in <italic>C. elegans</italic> one-cell embryo or <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts. We indeed found the island-like structures in the Par complex distribution in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitotic neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We also realized that a similar behavior of Par aggregates is detectable in the movies of <italic>C. elegans</italic> one cell embryo, whereas it is not explicitly described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, Par3 is known to show punctate localization at the early stage of <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris and Peifer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris and Peifer, 2007</xref>). Par3 is also localized as a small patch form on the niche side of interphase female germline stem cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, while its behavior is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inaba et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these, we suggest that Par-island structure is not specific to this artificial apolar S2 cells but a universal form of Par-complex aggregates.</p><p>Interestingly, initial dot formation appeared to be biased toward the region opposite the cleavage point, where the centrosome also appeared to be located, which was consistent with a recent study on <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loyer and Januschke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Januschke and Gonzalez, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the cleavage point and/or the centrosome may be a general positional cue for the initiation of Par-complex-dependent cell polarity. In this context, polarization process of the S2 cell system is likely to be cell-autonomous and dependent on the induction of polarity proteins, wherein the orientation of polarity appeared to be dependent on internal cue(s).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The difference between S2 cell reconstruction system and <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts</title><p>Whereas our synthetic polarity shares a similar meshwork organization of Par-complex aggregates with <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitotic neuroblasts, there are two major differences between them: (1) cell cycle phase at which polarity is formed and (2) time constant of polarity formation (see the following section ‘Dynamic behaviors of Par aggregation and mechanisms for clustering<bold>’</bold> for the time constant). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, Par-polarity starts to form G2 phase and mainly operates in the mitotic phase, disappearing once they enter G1 phase. In contrast, in our artificial polarity system of S2 cells, Par-polarity is formed during interphase, and disappears upon mitotic entry. This difference in cell cycle phase of polarization affects the spatio-temporal relationship of Par-complex and other components; Lgl distributes cortically throughout interphase and prophase but relocalizes to the cytoplasm during prophase. Thus, Lgl cortically distributes when cell polarity is artificially formed in our S2 system, hence their complementary distribution lasts as long as Par-complex cortically distributes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7D,E</xref>). In contrast, in neuroblasts, their complementary distribution occurs only in a short period within the mitotic phase when Par complex localizes asymmetrically in neuroblasts, because Lgl rapidly relocalizes to the cytoplasm during prophase.</p><p>As for the disappearance of the cortical Par complex at mitosis, our artificial polarity system might resemble epithelial cells, in which apical components including aPKC, Par3 and Crumbs disappear from the apical side during the mitotic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergstralh et al., 2013</xref>). Neuroblasts that lose adherens junctions during delamination from epithelial layer must acquire a specific mechanism to maintain Par-polarity during mitosis. The Par-complex is activated by AuroraA kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wirtz-Peitz et al., 2008</xref>). A possibility is that different levels of such mitotic kinases including AuroraA and Polo kinase may cause the disappearance of Par-complex clustering at mitosis in the S2 cell system.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The morphology and dynamics of Par-islands</title><p>Par-complex assembly at the cortex of S2 cells appears to stabilize the cell membrane because membrane filopodia extensively formed in areas where Par-islands were absent (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Also, cell membrane curvature was higher where Par-islands were attached, compared with that of the surrounding areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9B</xref>). Membrane curvature may be determined by the balance between elasticity of the cortical cytoskeleton, the affinity of the Par-complex toward the cell membrane, and possibly the surface tension of the Par-island. Membrane affinity of the Par-complex is mediated by Par3 MAR, which interacts with phosphoinositides (PIPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krahn et al., 2010</xref>) and/or by Par6-cdc42 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joberty et al., 2000</xref>). The convex shape of the Par-island and its higher membrane curvature reflects its relatively high surface tension. This is supported by the fact that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by Latrunculin B treatment leads to a curled or spherical Par-island, inducing dynamic cell membrane protrusions. This phenomenon may be explained as follows; disruption of the cortical cytoskeleton leads to the loss of its elasticity, which had balanced the surface tension of the Par-island. The resulting imbalance in surface tension may cause the Par-island to shrink into a bowl or sphere shape, thereby bending the cell membrane outward and conferring protrusive activity to the cell membrane. In contrast, when membrane affinity is quite low, as in the case of Par3ΔMAR, Par-island shape is not affected by either cortical cytoskeleton elasticity or membrane affinity, and its shape would be determined only by the surface tension of Par3-islands. Under these conditions, we found that the Par-complex forms small cytoplasmic droplets, which subsequently coalesce into a spherical, densely packed structure, suggesting that phase separation takes place between the Par-complex aggregates and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). A similar cytoplasmic droplet formation for a C-terminal truncated form of Par3 has been observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benton and St Johnston, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Molecular network of the Par-complex in the island state</title><p>In this study, we revealed that a Par-island is a meshwork of various polygonal shapes, which appear to be built up of unit-like segments with an average length of approximately 0.4 μm. Isolated fragments such as single fragments and structures made up of a few connected fragments were observed during the development of Par-islands via live-imaging. These observations suggested that these isolated fragments assembled into a meshwork to form islands. Par-islands change shape rapidly during their movement along the cortex, and sometimes fuse with small pieces and also release pieces of different sizes, raising the possibility that Par-islands and small free fragments are mutually exchangeable. The factors that determine the size of these unit segments need further investigation.</p><p>Par3 is known to polymerize in vitro via the CR1 domain at its N-terminus to form a helical polymer of 8-fold symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feng et al., 2007</xref>). Whether Par3 polymers are involved in the cortical cluster of the Par complex remain unclear. Our super-resolution microscopic observations and the ability of Par3 to form filaments lead to the simple hypothesis that the unit segment of a Par-island is formed by Par3 polymers as the core structure. This hypothesis is compatible with our observation that the overexpression of Par3ΔCR1 no longer forms a regular meshwork of Par-complex aggregates. While there are many possibilities via which Par3 filaments may form a unit segment, a single Par3 polymer may form a single segment. Another possibility is for Par3 polymers to be aligned along the long axis of the segment. Since Par6 and aPKC bind the PDZ and CR3 domains of Par3, respectively, Par6 and aPKC can act as cross-linkers between segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feng et al., 2007</xref>). Given the phenotype of ParS980A overexpression, the association of Par3 and aPKC by aPKC phosphorylation may confer flexibility and dynamism to the structure and/or assembly of the segmental elements. These hypotheses need to be tested in future studies. A surprising finding is that Par3ΔCR1 still has an ability to form Par-complex aggregates while those aggregates show a small size with no regular meshwork structure. We speculate that even in the absence of the CR1 domain, Par6 and aPKC cross-link multiple Par3ΔCR1 to form small aggregates via their multiple binding sites on Par3.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Dynamic behaviors of Par aggregation and mechanisms for clustering</title><p>We have reproducibly obtained the data showing no significant effect of Y27632 on the behavior of Par-islands. Because cortical flow involving Myosin II is a major driving force for <italic>C. elegans</italic> polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Munro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Motegi and Sugimoto, 2006</xref>), the dynamic behavior of Par-islands is not likely to depend on the typical Myosin II cortical flow. Moreover, we observed no directional movement of Par-dots or Par-islands during the process of asymmetric clustering nor at the steady state. These two observations suggest no significant involvement of cortical flow in Par-island dynamics in the S2 cell reconstruction system, while we do not exclude the possibility that Y27632-insensitive Myosin might work for the dynamics of Par-islands even though it is unlikely to operate in a directional way.</p><p>How can Par islands cluster asymmetrically and dynamically behave? A possible mechanism underlying Par-island dynamics is diffusion and/or tension. We think that the situation where advection such as cortical flow surpasses diffusion for transportation is the following two cases. Firstly, the scale of the system is large enough. <italic>C. elegans</italic> one-cell embryo and <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes are good examples. In these cases, the random diffusion and capture mechanism without advection will take a much longer time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goehring et al., 2011</xref>). While <italic>C. elegans</italic> one-cell embryo is approximately 50 µm long along the anterior-posterior axis, the size of S2 cells is approximately 10 μm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), which seems to be nearly marginal about which of advection and diffusion is efficient to polarize cells. The mutual capture of islands might work well to cluster islands in one pole.</p><p>Secondly, the time scale of clustering in S2 cell system is an order of hours, while the polarization of <italic>C. elegans</italic> one-cell embryo or of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts occurs in an order of minutes (within 15 min, and 5 min, respectively). Such a big difference in the time scale of Par-island polarization, together with its non-directional movement, is likely explained by the notion that polarized clustering of Par-islands occurs through diffusion and mutual capture that might be driven by phase separation with surrounding cortex.</p><p>In conclusion, while we do not exclude the involvement of myosin motor in Par island dynamics, it is more likely to be driven by diffusion mechanism on the two-dimensional cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>The two states of the Par-island distribution at steady state</title><p>An interesting property of Par-islands is that they are not unified into one large island under the cell membrane, even when polarized. Overexpression of Par3ΔMAR or Par3S980A is an exception. In the latter case, rapid and enhanced formation of the cortical Par-complex does not seem to initially permit separate island formation, and a large, transient dome is formed instead. In the former case, the Par-complex aggregates to form one large sphere. This cytoplasmic phenomenon is likely to be due to a phase separation between the Par-complex and the cytoplasm. Considering this property of the Par-complex, the unique feature of Par-islands associated with the cell membrane may reflect phase separation in two dimensions.</p><p>Steady-state Par-island distribution in a cell may be classified into two different states, polarized and non-polarized. While we failed to identify a single parameter correlating these two states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), our analysis shows that the two states of island distribution are nearly fixed during the formation of islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Because the position of island formation appears to be stochastic, variation in the position of Par-island formation across the cell may explain the two localization patterns of Par-islands. Since Lgl distribution is largely complementary to dots and islands, this molecule may contribute to stabilize the two states of island distribution at the cellular scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betschinger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo and Kemphues, 1995</xref>). Thus, these two different states of Par-island distribution may be the outcome of two stable solutions of the reaction diffusion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goehring et al., 2011</xref>), where a negative regulator Lgl is involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betschinger et al., 2003</xref>). The initial condition, which is possibly determined by a stochastic distribution of islands, may select one of the two stable patterns in a cell. We propose that such cell-scale patterning is coupled with local phase separation of Par-islands as previously described for the membrane lipid domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">John and Bär, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have developed a potential Par complex-polarization system upon induction of Par3 in non-polar S2 cells, which provides a useful model for cell-autonomous cell polarization, allowing us to easily manipulate gene expression and image at the super-resolution level. One intriguing challenge will be the coupling of mitosis with cell polarization in this system to induce asymmetric division.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">y, w, Baz-GFP</td><td valign="top">Bloomington <break/>Drosophila Stock <break/>Center</td><td valign="top">BDSC:51572; <break/>FLYB:FBtc0099880</td><td valign="top">FlyBase symbol: <break/>P{PTT-GC}baz <break/>CC01941</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">S2</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen, Thermo <break/>Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen:R69007</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal <break/>anti-aPKC</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz</td><td valign="top">Santa_Cruz:sc-216</td><td valign="top">IHC (1:1000) <break/>WB (1:3000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal <break/>anti-Par3</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohshiro et al.

The cell perimeter was traced by a 0.5 µm-width line and the signal intensity along the line was measured with Fiji. The signal intensities were summed up along the half (L) of the total perimeter length (2L). The difference between this value and that of the other half was calculated and normalized by the total signal intensity along the perimeter. This measurement was done starting from every pixel along the perimeter (one pixel = 0.108 µm), The maximum value of them was defined as ASI. Cell with an ASI larger than 0.35 was defined as polarized cell. Each experiment to measure the distribution of ASI was independently duplicated, and the results of the two experiments were combined to make a single histogram for ASI distribution. The statistical significance of polarized cell population was analyzed by Fisher's exact test with post-hoc Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10E,F</xref>). Statistical analyses were performed with R software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantification of membrane curvature</title><p>The equatorial z-plane of each cell was analyzed for the estimation of membrane curvature radius. The cell membrane was defined by membrane-GFP signal. A Par-island region was defined as a continuous compartment of the cell membrane that co-localized with continuous myc-Par3-mKate2. A non-neighboring region was defined in cells with Par-islands as a continuous membrane compartment of less than 5 µm at a distance of more than 5 µm from Par-island regions. A membrane region in non-island cells was defined as a continuous membrane compartment of less than 5 µm in cells without Par-islands. For non-island cells, 5–6 regions were analyzed per cell. Coordinates of two ends and a mid-point of each region were taken. The circle that passes through the three points was solved from the coordinates, and its radius was shown as a curvature radius in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Measurements was performed with Fiji. Calculations and statistics were performed with R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification of the size of Par aggregates</title><p>Bottom surface images of cells were analyzed to measure the size of Par aggregates. Region of interests (ROI) were made along the perimeters of Par aggregates by tracing manually with Fiji. Aggregates that contacted with a limit of an optical section were excluded from the analysis. The area of each ROI was measured, and shown as the size of Par aggregates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Whole cell extracts of the untransfected S2 cells and the transfected S2 cells were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Primary antibodies used were anti-Par3 antibody (rabbit polyclonal, used at 1:1000), anti-alpha-tubulin (rat monoclonal, Santa Cruz). Secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (sheep polyclonal, used at 1:3000, GE Healthcare), HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (sheep polyclonal, used at 1:3000, GE Healthcare) and HRP-conjugated anti-chicken antibody (donkey polyclonal, used at 1:250, SA1-300, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein level was analyzed by chemiluminescence with Chemi-Lumi One L (Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and quantified with an image analyzer LAS-3000 system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). To compare the expression level of the overexpressed fluorescent protein per cell between two different transfectants or with the endogenous Par3 proteins, transfection efficiency for each sample was calculated by counting fluorescence-positive cells and negative cells. The ratio of the expression level per cell was calculated by dividing the measured staining intensity on the western blot by the transfection efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Knock-down experiment</title><p>Long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) were used for RNA interference (RNAi) in S2 cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bettencourt-Dias and Goshima, 2009</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Yukiko M Yamashita as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission has also agreed to reveal their identity: Hongyan Wang (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Matsuzaki and colleagues describes the induction of Par protein polarization in a normally non-polarized cell-type, <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, and characterizes structural aspects of Par complexes formed. They found that overexpression of Par3 in S2 cells is sufficient to induce polarization, where Par3's partners (aPKC and Par6) also polarize together. This polarization depends on Lgl, suggesting that this system recapitulates antagonistic system of cell polarization between Par complex and Lgl.</p><p>By utilizing temporal induction system, which provided a unique opportunity to study the process of polarization, they found that Par3 emerges as 'dots' on the cortex, and self-organizes into larger islands. By STED microscopy, they further show that Par3 'islands' likely have uniform/regular structure, indicating that it may be a self-assembled structure based on smaller units. In addition, they found that the functional domains of Par3 (CR1 and Serine 980 of CR3 domains) and the interactions between these domains contribute to the Par polarization in these polarity-induced S2 cells. Finally, actin cytoskeleton prevent the dynamic redistribution of islands into a spherical shape.</p><p>Overall, this is a very interesting study with novel findings on the dynamic assembly of Par-complex during polarization. This is a well-written paper with logical flow, making it easy to follow. This is an important contribution to the field, providing new understanding of how cell polarity may be established by Par3-Par6-aPKC system. The topic will be of great interest to readers of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions that may require additional experiments:</p><p>1) The structures of the clusters formed with Par-3 or Par-3 lacking CR1 (the oligomerization domain) were not clearly different in the images shown. Perhaps the authors' super-resolution approach would reveal a clearer difference. This further assessment would be important for assessing whether the oligomerization domain has a role in forming filaments in cells. Depleting endogenous Par-3 may be needed for seeing a clear role of CR1.</p><p>2) Since the induction of clusters depended on the expression level of the Par-3, the expression levels of the full length and deltaCR1 constructs should be compared.</p><p>3) The authors say that cell membrane curvature was higher where Par-islands were attached. However, the plasma membrane is not shown. Thus, it is unclear what the curved, Par-3 detections represent (detections that were not obvious in all images). Imaging of a membrane marker in combination with Par-3 should be attempted to assess the membrane curvature directly.</p><p>4) The use of Par-6-GFP to monitor complexes induced by Par-3 over-expression is a concern. The Par-6-GFP clusters may be associated with Par-3 or may be a separate complex promoted by Par-3 (e.g. Par-6-aPKC in complex with Cdc42).</p><p>Please note that a concern was raised regarding the novelty of work, with much of data confirming the existing knowledge in the in vivo system. Thus, the authors are encouraged to emphasize the novelty of the work (re-constitution of asymmetry in non-polar cells) by textual editing, and/or by addressing the points above, which may be sufficient to address this concern.</p><p>Essential revisions that can be addressed by textual modifications:</p><p>1) The author showed that ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, did not significantly affect the behavior of Par-islands (subsection “Roles of Par components and the cytoskeleton in polarity formation”). Does it mean that the Par-islands dynamics is independent of Myosin cortical flow that requires ROCK function? If this is the case, will the dynamics of Par-islands require other actin-based motor proteins or not? I would like to see a discussion on this result.</p><p>2) Lgl and Par3 distribution was observed as opposite &quot;crescents&quot; in induced polarized S2 cells (Figure 2B). As far as I know, Lgl localization is uniformly cortical in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitotic neuroblasts. It will be nice to include a short discussion/explanation on this different distribution of Lgl in these two cell types. In Figure 2B, &quot;&gt;UAS-Baz&quot; was labelled in the figure. Should it be UAS-Par-3?</p><p>3) The authors should acknowledge the observation of Benton and St Johnston of spherical CR1 aggregates in the cytosol of oocytes (PMID: 12906794; Figure S1).</p><p>4) The authors say that Par-3 islands with amorphous and dynamic behavior have not been observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> or <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but such organization seems similar to the clusters of Par-3 described in the one-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo or during initial epithelial polarization in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45559.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions that may require additional experiments:</p><p>1) The structures of the clusters formed with Par-3 or Par-3 lacking CR1 (the oligomerization domain) were not clearly different in the images shown.

If the CR1 was a sole domain that were involved in Par3-Par3 interaction, the lack of this domain should not generate Par3-oligomeric form or large structures such as the Par-islands. Indeed, there is a big difference between the aggregation state of Par complex after the overexpression of wild type Par3 and that of the Par ΔCR as described in the previous manuscript; the steady state S2 cells overexpressing wild type Par3 formed large islands, some of which were larger in area than 2 μm<sup>2</sup> (the previous Figure 4A and the histograms in the new Figure 12). On the contrary, the overexpressed Par3ΔCR1 came to the cell cortex of S2 cells, and no longer form large islands. However, bright spots with a relatively small size and ambiguous contour were formed on the background of high level of Par complex distribution over the cortex (the previous Figure 10B). The question is why some aggregation structures were formed in spite of the lack of the known aggregation domain. To pursue this problem, we performed the combination of 3 new experiments; (1) elimination of the endogenous Par3 by RNAi, (2) observations by STED super resolution microscopy, and (3) the quantitative comparison in size between Par3-islands and Par3ΔCR1 bright spots at the steady state. Firstly, as suggested by the review, we tried to eliminate the endogenous Par3 by RNAi, and successfully reduced it to approximately 10% of the wild type S2 cells (Figure supplement 2). As the next step, we needed to introduce silent mutations into the RNAi sequence part of the wild type and Par3ΔCR1 in the overexpression construct so that the exogenous full-length Par3 and Par3ΔCR1 were not affected by RNAi. We confirmed by gel electrophoresis that the introduction of silent mutations into Par3 and Par3ΔCR1 did not significantly affect their expression level, when they were overexpressed under the same condition (Figure supplement 3). As the conclusion, the quantitative measurement indicated no significant contribution of the endogenous Par3 to the formation of these bright spots formed by the overexpression of Par3ΔCR1 (see below).</p><p>2) Under the RNAi condition, we examined the S2 cells overexpressing Par3-GFP and those expressing Par3ΔCR1-GFP in a STED microscope to obtain a super resolution images, as also suggested by the reviewers. We confirmed a various size of Par-islands including large ones with a regular meshwork structure when full length Par3-GFP was overexpressed (as we showed in the previous Figure 9). On the contrary, in the cells overexpressing Par3ΔCR1-GFP, we often observed bright spots with an amorphous shape, and could rarely find clear island structures with a regular meshwork structure. Thus, our STED observations strongly suggest that in the absence of Par3 CR1 domain, Par-islands consisting a meshwork with unit-like segments were not formed (see the new Figure 12).</p><p>3) To analyze how these bright spots formed by Par3ΔCR1 overexpression are different or similar to the islands formed by wild type Par3 overexpression, we measured the size of islands in S2 cells expressing Par3 (with silent mutations) and that of bright regions in S2 cells expressing Par3ΔCR1 (with silent mutations) after RNAi suppression of the endogenous Par3 at the steady state, and compared their distribution. We also compared the distribution of spot size with and without RNAi. We found that size distribution of bright spots did not significantly change upon RNAi suppression of the endogenous Par3, suggesting that those spots are not formed by the presence of the endogenous Par3 (data not shown). The results also show that the distribution of spot size after Par3ΔCR1 overexpression was quite different from that of islands formed by the overexpression of Par3; approximately 90% of bright spots are smaller in area than 1 μm<sup>2</sup> (the mean value ± s.d. = 0.44 ± 0.37 μm<sup>2</sup>). These observations raise the possibility that Par3ΔCR1 still has an ability to form some cortical aggregates either via (1) an un-identified domain in Par3 or (2) via Par6-aPKC, or (3) via the other components. However, these aggregates do not form the regular meshwork as does the wild type Par3, and the majority of Par3ΔCR1-GFP distributes broadly in the cell cortex without a particular structure as revealed by STED imaging.</p><p>All together, we conclude that the CR1 domain of Par3 is critical for Par complex to form Par-islands with the regular meshwork and to asymmetrically localize in S2 cells. This conclusion is consistent with the previous finding that CR1 domain is an essential domain of the Par3 function to form the normal asymmetry in the cell cortex in the epithelium (Benton and St Johnston, 2003).</p><p>We have added these data in the new Figure 12 and Figure12—figure supplement 2 and Figure 12—figure supplement 3, and described these new results in a concise form in the text (subsection “Structural analysis of the assembly state of the Par-complex”) in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Since the induction of clusters depended on the expression level of the Par-3, the expression levels of the full length and deltaCR1 constructs should be compared.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks a lot for a comment regarding a prerequisite for the comparison of the effect of Par3 overexpression with Par3ΔCR1 overexpression. We compared the expression levels of the full length Par3 and that of Par3ΔCR1 under the same condition used for the experiments (8 h after induction by metallothionein promoter). We performed Western blotting after gel electrophoresis of cells transfected by the expression plasmids for those proteins. As shown in Figure supplement 3. the result indicates that the expression level of the full length Par3 and Par3ΔCR1 is nearly at the same level. We, therefore, described this result in the text as follows; we measured the expression level of the full length Par3 and Par3ΔCR1 by Western blotting of cells transfected by the expression plasmids for those proteins, and confirmed that their expression levels are nearly at the same level (Figure12—figure supplement2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors say that cell membrane curvature was higher where Par-islands were attached. However, the plasma membrane is not shown. Thus, it is unclear what the curved, Par-3 detections represent (detections that were not obvious in all images). Imaging of a membrane marker in combination with Par-3 should be attempted to assess the membrane curvature directly.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for the lack of the image that simultaneously shows the plasma membrane and Par3 distribution and also the quantitative comparison of the curvature between the Par3 islands and the plasma membrane curvature. We have added these data as the new Figure 9 and described how the curvature of the islands is different from that of the plasma membrane after the first sentence of the subsection, ‘Structural analysis of the assembly state of the Par-complex”.</p><p>We expressed memGFP by the <italic>actin</italic>-promoter to visualize the cell membrane, together with myc-Par3-mKate2 that was induced by the <italic>metallothionein</italic>-promoter. The images for quantification were taken at eight hour after induction. The curvature radius for individual islands was obtained from three different points on the plasma membrane of individual islands. On the other hand, the curvature radius of the plasma membrane was calculated from the three different points along the cell membrane of less than 5 μm long. For this measurement, we chose the ‘non-neighbor region’, which was defined as the region along the cell membrane more than 5 μm away from the edge of neighboring Par-islands. This is to avoid a potential influence of Par-islands on neighbouring membrane curvature (please see Materials and methods section for technical detail). As shown in the new Figure 9, the curvature radii of Par-islands were in the range 0.7 μm to 5 μm with the median of 1.70 μm. (n = 69 islands in 34 cells). On the contrary, the majority of curvature radii for the plasma membrane was in the range between 2 μm and 20 μm with the median of 4.07 μm in the non-neighboring regions (n = 87 plasma membrane regions in 29 cells). We also measured the curvature radii of non-Par-islands cells lacking Par-island formation, which gave us the median of 4.56 μm with the range of 2 μm and 20 μm (n = 76 regions in 13 cells). These distributions of the curvature radii of the three different regions indicate that the curvature radius of Par-islands is significantly smaller than that of cell membrane curvature in non-neighboring regions, which is virtually consistent with the radius of S2 cells that we used for experiments. Accordingly, Par-islands show a more convex shape than the ordinary plasma membrane curve of S2 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The use of Par-6-GFP to monitor complexes induced by Par-3 over-expression is a concern. The Par-6-GFP clusters may be associated with Par-3 or may be a separate complex promoted by Par-3 (e.g. Par-6-aPKC in complex with Cdc42).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out a key point of our experimental design.</p><p>We initially checked whether the distributions of Par3-mKate2 and Par6-GFP are identical to each other, when we used the metallothionein induction system as a promoter to monitor the temporal pattern of Par complex aggregate formation. We needed a fluorescent marker, intensity of which was kept constantly during induction until reaching the steady state, because at the early stage of of induction of Par3-mKate2, mKate2 fluorescence was too weak to detect. Par6-GFP was a good marker, because its intensity is kept nearly constant during Par3-mKate2 induction, as shown in Discussion Figure supplement 1 in the initial manuscript.</p><p>We, therefore, compared the cortical expression pattern of Par3-mKate2 and Par6-GFP at 4 hours in S2 cells after induction of Par3-mKate2. We found that the spatial expression pattern of both fluorescences almost overlapped at the resolution of the confocal microscopy while some differences in the local intensity gradient between Par6-GFP and Par3-mKate2 (this may partly come from the difference in the setting of fluorescence detection for each wavelength). There were also a few small dots that appears to contain only either fluorescence in one cell image.</p><p>We understand reviewers’ concern because Par3-Par6-aPKC complex and cdc42-Par6-aPKC complex are exclusively formed, playing different roles (for example, Rodoriguez et al., 2017). During revision of the manuscript, we therefore, compared the distribution of Par3-mKate2, Par6-GFP and Cdc42 4 h after Par3-mKate2 induction by immunostaining of fixed samples. At 3 hours post induction, small Par-islands have been formed. As described above, the distribution of Par3-mKate2 and Par6-GFP are almost identical with each other. In contrast, Cdc42 distribute quite differently from these of Par components. Cdc42 distributes in a dotty or short string patterns (Slaughter et al., 2013, and Sartrel et al., 2018). Essentially, the pattern of Cdc42 distribution has no correlation with those of Par3-mKate2 and Par6-GFP, while some Cdc42 dots appear to be located at the edge of Par-islands. At 8 hours, we have confirmed the nearly identical spatial distribution of Par3-mKate2 and Par6-GFP during observations of many cells expressing both Par3-mKate2 and Par6-GFP for the SRRF analysis (the previous Figure 9 → new Figure 11). We have insert several sentences at the beginning of the subsection “Temporal patterns of Par-complex polarization”,to describe the rationality for the monitoring Par-complex temporal pattern with Par6-GFP during induction and at the steady state is based on the observations of (1) their almost identical distribution at 3 h after induction and (2) not apparent relationship of their relationship with that of Cdc42. We have also added these data as the new Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p> <italic>Please note that a concern was raised regarding the novelty of work, with much of data confirming the existing knowledge in the</italic> in vivo system. Thus, the authors are encouraged to emphasize the novelty of the work (re-constitution of asymmetry in non-polar cells) by textual editing, and/or by addressing the points above, which may be sufficient to address this concern.</p><p>Essential revisions that can be addressed by textual modifications:</p><p>1) The author showed that ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, did not significantly affect the behavior of Par-islands (subsection “Roles of Par components and the cytoskeleton in polarity formation”). Does it mean that the Par-islands dynamics is independent of Myosin cortical flow that requires ROCK function? If this is the case, will the dynamics of Par-islands require other actin-based motor proteins or not? I would like to see a discussion on this result.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reproducibly obtained the data showing no significant effect of Y27632 on the behavior of Par-islands. Because Myosin II is essential for <italic>C. elegans</italic> cortical flow, this observation suggests that the dynamic behavior of Par-islands is not dependent on the typical Myosin II cortical flow. As we described in the Discussion section in the previous manuscript, we have also observed no directional movement of Par-dots or Par-islands during the process of asymmetric clustering and at the steady state. Based on these two observations, we described in the previous manuscript that we failed to obtain evidence showing an involvement of cortical flow in Par-island dynamics (subsection “Temporal patterns of Par-complex aggregation”). As far as we checked literature, Y27632 compromises the function of all Myosins bearing MLCs either or both via inhibiting MLCK and activating MLC phosphatase. However, if there is a myosin isotype insensitive to Y27632, we do not exclude the possibility that such Y27632-insensitive Myosin might work for the dynamics of Par-islands even though it is unlikely to operate in a directional way. In summary, we have currently no positive evidence that Myosin and cortical flow are involved in the dynamics of Par-islands.</p><p>How can Par islands cluster asymmetrically and dynamically behave? We can argue another possible mechanism underlying Par-island dynamics, which is diffusion and/or tension. We think that the situation where advection such as cortical flow surpasses diffusion for transportation is the following two cases. Firstly, the scale of the system is large enough. <italic>C. elegans</italic> one cell embryo and <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes are good examples. In these cases, the random diffusion and capture mechanism without advection will take a much longer time (Goehring et al., 2011). While <italic>C. elegans</italic> one cell embryo is approximately 50 μm long along the antero-posterior axis, S2 cells are approximately 10 μm in diameter, which seems to be nearly marginal about which of advection and diffusion is efficient to polarize cells. The mutual capture of islands might be sufficient to cluster islands in one pole.</p><p>Secondly, the time scale of clustering in S2 cell system is an order of hours, while the polarization of <italic>C. elegans</italic> one cell embryo or of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts occurs in an order of minutes (less than 5 min for <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts). Time scale of polarization of Par-islands, together with its non-directional movement, is likely explained by the notion that polarized clustering of Par-islands occurs through diffusion and mutual capture. Mutual capture of Par-islands might be driven by phase separation with surrounding cortex.</p><p>Measurement of the trajectory of Par-island movement and plotting the mean square distance will be the best way to test whether the movement depends on diffusion or advection, but frequent mutual fusion and fission of islands makes it technically difficult to accurately trace the trajectory. This will be an important future issue while it is beyond scope of this paper. In conclusion, while we do not exclude the involvement of myosin motor in Par-island dynamics, it is more likely to be driven by diffusion mechanism on the two-dimensional cortex.</p><p>We have made a section, ‘Mechanism of clustering of Par-islands,’ and discussed this issue in a more concise way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Lgl and Par3 distribution was observed as opposite &quot;crescents&quot; in induced polarized S2 cells (Figure 2B). As far as I know, Lgl localization is uniformly cortical in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitotic neuroblasts. It will be nice to include a short discussion/explanation on this different distribution of Lgl in these two cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that in the first manuscript the differences between our S2 cell polarity system and <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts were not sufficiently explained. Essentially, Lgl relocalizes to the cytoplasm during mitosis while it is cortically retained during interphase.</p><p>According to the previous literature (Ohshiro et al., 2000, and Pen et al.,2000), Lgl uniformly distributes along the cell cortex of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic neuroblasts ‘at interphase’, but once neuroblasts enter ‘mitotic phase’, Lgl quickly drops off the cortex into the cytoplasm. Later on, it was shown that Lgl becomes complementary to the distribution of the apical complex during early prophase, and shortly disappears from the entire cell cortex via the function of Aurora A kinase by the end of prophase (Wirtz-Peitz, et al., 2008). This was shown by using of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory precursor cells and larval neuroblasts. More recently, Lgl relocalizes to the cytoplasm via phosphorylation of two of among the three functional phosphorylation sites on Lgl by AurA and B in <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial cells (Bell et al., 2015). aPKC phosphorylation site is the third one, which operates on polarized distribution of the cortically localizing Lgl.</p><p>Because AurA and B become active only during mitotic phase in ordinary cells, Lgl normally localizes at the cell cortex during interphase. This is also the case for S2 cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts. In this study, we overexpressed Par3 in S2 cells, majority of which is at interphase (approximately 24 hour cell cycle length), and could have polarized them upon Par3 overexpression at interphase. Therefore, the complementary cortical distribution of the Par complex and Lgl was stably maintained during interphase. This situation is different from the case of neuroblasts where Par complex is activated by AurA upon mitotic entry.</p><p>We have mentioned to Lgl distribution briefly in the Discussion part describing the differences in cell polarization between in our S2 cell system and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts in the Discussion section.</p><p>In Figure 2B, &quot;&gt;UAS-Baz&quot; was labelled in the figure.

Below are our responses.</p><p>1) <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, we are confident that any previous work has not described the structure of the apical crescent in detail about whether the shape of Par-complex clusters are amorphous or robust, or how dynamically the fusion and fission of clusters take place.</p><p>2) <italic>C. elegans</italic> one cell embryo; there are so many studies on the Par complex clusters and their behavior, some of studies classified Par-complex cluster in size (and bright) as described in the DevCell paper from Goldstein lab (Dickinson et al., 2017). However, the shape of the large Par-cluster was not examined in this paper. As for the behavior, they analyzed extensively and separated the advective component and random (maybe Brownian) component. Their analysis shows that the advective flow component is major for large bright spots, which might correspond to our Par-islands regarding the size of particles, while we could not separate the movement and association/dissociation of Par-islands. On the other hand, a random behavior is dominant in dim spots. In addition, there is no description about association and dissociation behavior. High resolution image analysis is not included in this paper because of a difference of scope. There is also no description about internal structures. So, we cannot judge whether these clusters are similar or not. Another paper was also published in 2017 from Fumio Motegi lab in Singapore (Wang et al., 2017). In this paper, there is a lot of movies as supplemented data. Some of them, for example, video 13 includes Par-complex particles showing a behavior similar to the Par-islands. There was no description about it in the manuscript, however.</p><p>3) Initial epitheialization in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. It has been known that there are patches of Baz and other adhesion-related molecules in early epithelial polarization, mainly by contributions of Tony Harris and Mark Peifer.

So we decided to describe and cite two papers (Harris and Peifer 2005, Harris and Peifer, 2007).
