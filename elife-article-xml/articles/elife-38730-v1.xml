disorders. Substantial progress has been made in identifying effector mechanisms driving axon fragmentation, but less is known about the upstream signaling pathways that initiate this process. Here, we investigate the behavior of the actin-spectrin-based Membrane-associated Periodic Skeleton (MPS), and effects of actin and spectrin manipulations in sensory axon degeneration. We show that trophic deprivation (TD) of mouse sensory neurons causes a rapid disassembly of the axonal MPS, which occurs prior to protein loss and independently of caspase activation. Actin destabilization initiates TD-related retrograde signaling needed for degeneration; actin stabilization prevents MPS disassembly and retrograde signaling during TD. Depletion of βII-spectrin, a key component of the MPS, suppresses retrograde signaling and protects axons against degeneration. These data demonstrate structural plasticity of the MPS and suggest its potential role in early steps of axon degeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd><kwd>axon degeneration</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>spectrin</kwd><kwd>neurotrophins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM122487</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhuang</surname><given-names>Xiaowei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhuang</surname><given-names>Xiaowei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS089786</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tessier-Lavigne</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neurotrophin deprivation leads to rapid caspase-independent disassembly of the actin-spectrin-based membrane skeleton and spectrin-dependent retrograde signaling in axon degeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons and their axons are produced in excess during mammalian development, followed by a wide-spread culling of excess axons or axonal branches as the nervous system matures. This is exemplified in the development of the peripheral nervous system where sensory axons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) compete for limited quantities of target-derived neurotrophins that promote axon survival. Axons that receive sufficient trophic support survive and mature, whereas axons that are insufficiently supported by neurotrophins degenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo and O'Leary, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schuldiner and Yaron, 2015</xref>). Trophic deprivation (TD) triggers the axon to degenerate in three broad steps. Upon TD, the axon first generates a retrograde signal to the neuronal cell body; next, this retrograde signal initiates a pro-degenerative transcriptional response in the cell body; finally, the cell body generates an anterograde signal that propagates to the axon and gates the activation of a latent apoptotic cascade within the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maor-Nof et al., 2016</xref>). A major unanswered question is to define the early signals that induce retrograde signaling to initiate axon degeneration. These upstream pathways represent attractive therapeutic targets to mitigate pathological axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao and Lee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le Pichon et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown recently that actin, spectrin and associated molecules form a Membrane-associated Periodic Skeleton (MPS) in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), as well as some dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Este et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2017</xref>), of neurons. The neuronal MPS contains molecules homologous to the components of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett and Baines, 2001</xref>) but adopts a different ultrastructural organization. In the MPS, actin is arranged into ring-like structures, and these actin rings are connected by heterotetramers of α- and β-spectrin, forming a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) periodic lattice structure underneath the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). The MPS is assembled early during axon development, forming initially in the axonal region proximal to the cell body and then propagating outward to span the entire axonal shaft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>). The MPS is also found in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Este et al., 2015</xref>) but with lower propensity and developmental rate than in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2017</xref>). The MPS is present in all neuronal types examined in the central and peripheral nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D’Este et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2016</xref>) and is evolutionally conserved across diverse species ranging from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2016</xref>). Genetic perturbations of components of the MPS suggest its importance in processes such as stability and survival of axons under mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>), touch sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krieg et al., 2014</xref>), the formation of axon initial segments (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Este et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2017a</xref>), and the maintenance of axon morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leite et al., 2016</xref>). The MPS is also found to be important for organizing some membrane proteins, such as ion channels and adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Este et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Este et al., 2017</xref>), membrane filtering at the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albrecht et al., 2016</xref>), and maintenance of axonal microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qu et al., 2017</xref>). Disruption of the MPS causes widespread neurodegeneration and a variety of neurological impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2017b</xref>) and has been implicated in neuronal toxicity in Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ordonez et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Understanding the function of the MPS requires observing and altering its behavior and functional organization in the context of specific biological processes. Here, we studied the MPS in the context of sensory axon degeneration. We found that trophic deprivation (TD) induced a rapid disassembly of the MPS, an observation also reported independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Unsain et al., 2018</xref>) while our paper was in preparation. Beyond this shared observation, our data further revealed that MPS disassembly occurred early during TD-mediated axon degeneration, prior to detectable caspase activation and protein loss in axons. Importantly, MPS disassembly proceeded even when activation of the apoptotic pathway was blocked, indicating that this structural reorganization is not simply a secondary consequence of TD-dependent proteolysis but may act as a cellular signal early in TD-induced axon degeneration. Furthermore, we showed that acute pharmacological destabilization of actin, which disrupted the MPS, phenocopied TD and generated a pro-degenerative retrograde signal. In contrast, pharmacological stabilization of actin blocked MPS disassembly and prevented TD-induced retrograde signaling. Finally, and surprisingly, genetic knockdown or knockout of βII-spectrin, which inhibits the formation of the MPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2017</xref>), prevented retrograde signaling and protected axons from degeneration induced by both TD and actin destabilization. Together, our findings suggest a model that disassembly of the MPS and its associated proteins, which occur early after TD, may play an important role in retrograde signaling during sensory axon degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The MPS is disassembled early upon TD</title><p>Sensory axons rely on neurotrophic factors (e.g. nerve growth factor, NGF) for their survival. During TD, multiple pathways converge to drive activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and caspase-dependent cytoskeletal disassembly and axon fragmentation. Genetic deletion of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Caspase-9, and Caspase-3 each potently protects axons from degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cusack et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Unsain et al., 2013</xref>). To promote degeneration, Caspase-3 cleaves a number of key substrates including Calpastatin, an endogenous inhibitor of Calpains. Together, Caspases and Calpains execute axon degeneration by cleaving many proteins including cytoskeleton components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Caspase activation is thought to be one of the early steps of axon degeneration as it precedes observable signs of degeneration such as blebbing of the plasma membrane and fragmentation of the microtubule network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schoenmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simon et al., 2012</xref>). The early Caspase activity can cleave proteins and induce more subtle ultrastructural changes in the axon before larger scale axon fragmentation.</p><p>We monitored the structure of the MPS during TD using a super-resolution imaging method, Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rust et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2008</xref>). We performed a time course of TD and quantified MPS structural changes by autocorrelation analysis of the 3D STORM images of βII spectrin, a key component of the MPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Axons with a highly periodic MPS organization produce a periodic autocorrelation curve with a high amplitude, and the amplitude decreases as the structure is degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2017</xref>). Analysis of the MPS in this study was focused on distal axons that were less bundled and exhibited a more regular MPS structure than proximal axons in DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We initially hypothesized that MPS would be disassembled after Caspases and Calpains are active in the axon, because they cleave protein components of the MPS such as spectrin and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). To our surprise, we observed significant disruption of MPS within 6 hr of TD when there was neither obvious axon fragmentation nor detectable increase in immunoreactivity for cleaved (activated) Caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38730.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MPS disassembly upon TD precedes observable Caspase-3 activation and axon fragmentation.</title><p>Dissociated and re-aggregated wildtype (WT) DRG neurons were cultured for 7 days in the presence of 50 ng/ml NGF and subsequently deprived of NGF (trophic deprivation, TD) for the indicated times.

We therefore repeated the TD time course in sensory axons that overexpressed the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Bcl-xL inhibits Bax, which is in turn required to activate effector Caspases, and it has been shown that the overexpression of Bcl-xL potently blocks axon degeneration following TD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vohra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2016</xref>).

One of the earliest steps by which TD causes axon degeneration is through the generation of retrograde signals from the axon to the cell body, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of key downstream transcription factors including c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2016</xref>). Retrograde signaling functions upstream of caspase activation and depends critically on multiple kinases including the MAPKKK Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase (DLK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>). During TD, DLK activity promotes phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larhammar et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, in the context of axon injury, retrograde signaling by activated DLK can also promote axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hammarlund et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Activation of DLK during TD is associated with an increase in its apparent molecular weight on a western blot, reflective of TD-associated phosphorylations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to the case of TD, we observed an increase in the molecular weight of DLK in axons upon LatA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we found that acute application of LatA strongly increased c-Jun phosphorylation and this effect was blocked by co-addition of a small molecule DLK inhibitor, GNE-3511, also similar to the case of TD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Similar activation of c-Jun in sensory axons has been observed following acute disruption of actin and microtubules with cytochalasin D and nocodazole, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Valakh et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that retrograde signaling induces a transcriptional response in the cell body and the generation of an anterograde signal from the cell body to the axon that activates a latent pool of Caspase-3 in the axon. Activation of axonal Caspase-3 in turn triggers axon fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maor-Nof et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, physically isolating the axon from its cell body blocks the anterograde signaling and hence the TD-induced axonal Caspase-3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore examined whether LatA treatment activates axonal Caspase-3, and whether this process, as in the case of TD, requires anterograde signaling from the cell body by severing the axons from their cell bodies immediately prior to LatA treatment. To enable this experiment, we expressed a cytoplasmic variant of the biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT1 (cytoNMNAT1) in wild-type axons, a widely used tool that blocks injury-induced Wallerian degeneration of the axon without interfering with Caspase-3 activation during TD-induced axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sasaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, we found that application of LatA, like TD, induced an increase in cleaved (activated) Caspase-3 in intact axons but not in axons severed from the cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In addition, we also observed an increase in Caspase-3-like enzymatic activity (‘DEVDase’) in intact axons, but not in isolated axons, in a way similar to TD, although the magnitude of TD-induced axonal DEVDase activity was consistently greater than that elicited by LatA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These findings indicate that LatA treatment, like TD, does not directly activate the apoptotic pathway in axons, but instead activates a somatic pro-degenerative pathway that in turn activates axonal Caspase-3 via an anterograde signaling pathway from the cell body.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Pharmacological actin stabilization preserves MPS during TD and inhibits pro-degenerative retrograde signals</title><p>Next, we asked whether stabilizing F-actin had the opposite effect on TD-induced MPS disassembly and retrograde signaling. We used Jasplakinolide (Jasp), a toxin that promotes actin polymerization and thereby stabilizes F-actin. We note that the addition of Jasp occasionally caused depletion of the MPS in a fraction of axonal segments, but the majority of axonal regions exhibited intact MPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We repeated a time course of TD in the presence of Jasp and found that Jasp effectively prevented disassembly of the MPS upon TD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This observation is consistent with the independent finding that actin stabilization can inhibit MPS disassembly and axon fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Unsain et al., 2018</xref>), but TD-induced retrograding signaling has not been studied in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Unsain et al.

To examine the effect of Jasp treatment on TD-induced retrograde signaling in axon degeneration, we examined phosphorylation of c-Jun and found that application of Jasp prevented the TD-induced rise in phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>), which is required in part for TD-induced degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2016</xref>).

Remarkably, we found that knockdown of βII spectrin strongly protected axons from TD-induced degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). TD is known to induce a rise in Caspase-3-like enzymatic activity (‘DEVD-ase’) in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2016</xref>), and we found that βII spectrin knockdown also blocked this rise in ‘DEVD-ase’ activity upon TD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To further validate this finding, we established cultures from βII spectrin conditional knockout mice and infected these cultured neurons with Cre recombinase via lentiviral constructs to achieve a comparable removal of βII spectrin. Consistent with our shRNA knockdown results, genetic deletion of βII spectrin also protected axons from degeneration following TD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). In contrast to the protection observed against TD, loss of βII spectrin offered no appreciable protection against axon degeneration caused by direct activation of the apoptotic pathway (by the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Bcl-w antagonist ABT-737), or direct damage to the mitochondria (by rotenone) or to the microtubule cytoskeleton (by vincristine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Several MPS components are themselves Caspase substrates, and we and others have observed low-level Caspase activation that precedes apparent signs of axon fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schoenmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simon et al., 2012</xref>), thus the MPS disassembly could potentially be a simple consequence of the activation of the axonal apoptotic pathway during axon degeneration. However, unexpectedly, we find that MPS disassembly occurs without a change in the abundance of its component proteins. Additionally, the disassembly still proceeds normally in axons deficient in apoptotic pathway activation, suggesting that the disassembly happens upstream of Caspase-dependent proteolysis. Together these findings indicate that MPS disassembly is an early event in the TD-induced degeneration pathway, independent of Caspase-dependent proteolysis.</p><p>We also observe extensive TD-induced phosphorylation on MPS components, spectrin and adducin. Increased phosphorylation of β spectrin has been reported to decrease membrane mechanical stability in erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manno et al., 1995</xref>). In addition, analogous phosphorylation on a βΙΙ-spectrin isoform reduces its interaction with αΙΙ spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bignone et al., 2007</xref>) and analogous phosphorylation on adducin inhibits formation of the spectrin-actin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuoka et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matsuoka et al., 1998</xref>). While the biological significance of TD-induced phosphorylation on spectrin and adducin in axons remains to be determined, it is possible that these phosphorylation events could potentially facilitate MPS disassembly by affecting the stability of the actin-spectrin complex. Furthermore, MPS disassembly upon TD is prevented by pharmacologically stabilizing F-actin, suggesting that TD-induced activation may activate one or more actin modifying enzymes, which may in turn contribute to driving the observed MPS structural changes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Depletion of βII-spectrin inhibits retrograde signaling and protects axons from degeneration</title><p>Loss or mutation of α/β spectrin family members from birth has profound consequences on nervous system development and integrity from <italic>C. elegans</italic> through mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pielage et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krieg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krieg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2017b</xref>). Because of the known importance of spectrin in development, to investigate its role in axon degeneration by genetic manipulation, we removed βII spectrin from established neuronal cultures using virally delivered shRNA or Cre recombinase. Our data uncover a novel post-developmental role for βII spectrin that is required for axon degeneration at an early step, likely through the regulation of retrograde signaling. We observed that the depletion of βII spectrin protects axons from degeneration following TD, and that this effect is downstream of the activation of DLK but upstream of c-Jun activation. In addition, loss of βII spectrin also inhibits the pro-degenerative effects of acute F-actin breakdown by the actin depolymerization drug LatA. It has been shown previously that beta-II spectrin depletion disrupts the MPS in cultured hippocampal neurons based on actin and adducin imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2017</xref>). Because the longitudinal actin filaments mask the periodic structure more strongly and that adducin signal is relatively weak in distal axonal regions in DRG neurons, it is challenging to use these markers to assess MPS integrity in DRG neurons. However, we observed that beta-II spectrin knockdown led to substantial decrease in the abundance of some other MPS components, such as alpha-II spectrin and ankyrin-B, suggesting that the MPS is likely also disrupted in beta-II spectrin depleted DRG neurons.</p><p>Our data suggest that βII spectrin functions, possibly in the context of the MPS, as a novel factor in TD-induced retrograde signaling and axon degeneration. Precisely how βII spectrin is involved in retrograde signaling in the axon remains to be determined. TD-induced retrograde signaling involves at least two pathways in sensory axons. The first is loss of pro-survival Akt activity, culminating in activation of the downstream transcription factor Foxo3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2016</xref>). The second is a gain of pro-degenerative MAPK signaling, mediated by DLK, and culminating in phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2016</xref>).

Loss of βII spectrin does not block DLK activation following TD, but largely blocks phosphorylation of c-Jun and nuclear translocation of Foxo3a, suggesting that βII spectrin is potentially involved in both pathways, but the extent to which βII spectrin interacts with each remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Structural plasticity of the MPS potentially functions to initiate retrograde signaling</title><p>Our data show that actin stabilization by Jasp prevents MPS disassembly and occludes the somatic response to TD (i.e. inhibits activation of DLK and c-Jun), suggesting that F-actin turnover is critical to this early phase of axon degeneration. Conversely, acutely destabilizing actin with LatA largely phenocopies TD, inducing MPS disassembly and promoting retrograde signaling (i.e. activation of DLK and c-Jun), culminating in activation of the somatic pro-degenerative program. βII spectrin depletion blocks the pro-degenerative effects of LatA-induced acute F-actin breakdown. Together with the observed early disassembly of MPS upon TD and the protection against TD-induced degeneration by βII spectrin depletion, these data suggest a possibility that structural plasticity of the MPS is important for pro-degenerative retrograde signaling.</p><p>The MPS lacks a net polarity toward the distal axon or cell body, so it is unlikely to act as a ‘track’ for pro-degenerative retrograde signal propagation. Instead, the MPS structure may possibly serve as a platform to coordinate the activation of this retrograde signal. The sub-membrane lattice structure of the MPS provides a mechanism for anchoring transmembrane proteins, likely in a way similar to the erythrocyte membrane skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoover and Bryant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett and Baines, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baines et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, some functional membrane proteins are organized into periodic distributions along the axons by the MPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Este et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Este et al., 2017</xref>). It is thus possible that the MPS sequesters and thus functionally inactivates some pro-degenerative signaling molecules in healthy axons to prevent aberrant signaling, but also primes axons for degeneration by recruiting these molecules to the appropriate region of the axons. MPS disassembly might then activate retrograde signaling by releasing these signaling molecules. On the other hand, inhibiting establishment of the MPS may lead to mislocalization of these signaling molecules, resulting in failure of retrograde signaling. This model could explain why stabilization of the MPS (with Jasplakinolide) or inhibition of its formation (with knockdown/knockout of βII spectrin) both blocks pro-degenerative retrograde signaling and axon degeneration, while MPS disassembly (by TD or LatA treatment), can promote retrograde signaling and axon degeneration. Another possibility is that MPS breakdown during TD (or following LatA treatment) produces a pool of soluble MPS components, such as spectrin and ankyrin, which could participate in retrograde trafficking. Of note, biochemical reconstitution of dynein-driven retrograde signaling in the axon has demonstrated a prominent role for PH domain-containing β spectrins, including βΙΙ spectrin, in bridging vesicular membranes to dynein-driven retrograde motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muresan et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, AnkB, which is associated with the MPS, has been shown as a motor protein adaptor important for retrograde transport of multiple organelles, such as endosomes and mitochondria, in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>). The disassembly of the MPS to free these MPS components could promote the role of these proteins in retrograde transport, which might in turn facilitate retrograde signaling in TD-induced axon degeneration.</p><p>Finally, we note that it is difficult to disentangle the roles of different cytoskeleton structures due to their interactions and due to the fact that pharmacological and genetic manipulations often perturb multiple cytoskeletons simultaneously and may induce transcriptional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Massaro et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, while acute manipulations that modify F-actin by LatA and Jasp have clear effects on the MPS, we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed effects of pharmacological manipulations on the initiation of axon degeneration occur through other actin structures. Similarly, the depletion of βΙΙ spectrin could also affect microtubule structure and microtubule-dependent retrograde transport in addition to the structure of the MPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qu et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, while our manipulations of F-actin and βΙΙ spectrin converge on the MPS, it is also possible that other cytoskeleton structures may contribute to the observed effects on axon degeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Sptbn1-flox</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galiano et al., 2012</xref></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5431637">MGI:5431637</ext-link></td><td>Dr. Matt Rasband (Baylor College of Medicine)</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Bax KO</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knudson et al., 1995</xref></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:1857429">MGI:1857429</ext-link></td><td>Dr. Stanley Korsmeyer (via Jackson Labortory)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>mouse monoclonal anti-βII spectrin, clone 42</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>Cat. # sc-136074;

Briefly, E12.5 DRGs were isolated from spinal cords and dissociated in 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies) for 20 min, washed once in DMEM media containing 10% FBS, then resuspended in culture media: Neurobasal (Life Technologies) containing 2% (v/v) B27 (Life Technologies), 0.45% (v/v) Glucose, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and supplemented with 50 ng/mL NGF (Promega). Cells were plated on dried substrate in multi-well chamber slides at a density of ~15,000 per 1–1.5 microliters, allowed to adhere in a humidified incubator for ~12–15 min, at which time the chambers were filled with media and cultures returned to the incubator. The plating configuration allows for radial axon outgrowth away from a pool of cell bodies located near the center of the well. For imaging proximal axons, we used dissociated cells uniformly plated at a reduced density of ~4000 per well to avoid axon bundling. Cells were treated with mitotic inhibitor (5 µM 5-fluorouracil and 5 µM uridine) the morning after plating.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Vann Bennett (Reviewer #1)</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Wang and colleagues report several interesting observations connecting the recently discovered axonal spectrin/actin rings with signaling leading to axon degeneration in cultured sensory neurons following removal of NGF (a surrogate for physiological axon pruning during development). The periodicity of the rings is disrupted within a few hours of NGF withdrawal well before onset of apoptosis and even when apoptosis is prevented altogether. Multiple sites of phosphorylation of αII and βII-spectrin and adducin that occur following NGF deprivation are described, although this is not followed up. The effects of manipulating spectrin/actin rings are examined by targeting actin with pharmacological agents and by knocking down βII-spectrin.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper represents a set of intriguing and generally well-executed experiments, however it does not add up to a coherent story. The results are strong but somewhat conflicting. Stabilizing actin prevents degeneration, but so does eliminating βII-βspectrin. A possible (likely) resolution is that both actin and β-spectrin have roles in addition to assembly of spectrin-actin rings. One issue is that the lack of in vivo data. The study is a bit thin on mechanistic insight on (i) how NGF withdrawal leads to rapid MPS disassembly, and (ii) how MPS remodeling promotes retrograde degenerative events including DLK and c-Jun activation. The paper could be strengthened by addressing the following essential points:</p><p>1) Both actin and spectrin have pleiotropic roles that can complicate interpretation of inhibitors/knockdowns. A more precise target (such as a dedicated component of the spectrin/actin rings if one can be identified) could help. The authors should develop the unexpected finding that βII-spectrin elimination prevents/slows degeneration. Although inconvenient and difficult to explain in the short term, this could be the most interesting observation.</p><p>2) One suggested experiment is to induce degeneration with LatA in neurons that lack β-spectrin, according to the authors model the axons should be protected, as the actin depolymerization will not be able to transmit the signal to the cell body.</p><p>3) The authors provide evidence from a phosphoproteomic screen that MPS components may be phosphorylated following trophic deprivation and speculate that aberrant phosphorylation may lead to destabilization of MPS. Some direct evidence supporting this in sensory axons following TD would strengthen the study. Could the authors use phospho-deficient or phosphomimetic mutants of βII-spectrin to test their model? Furthermore, in a recent study (Unsain et al., 2018) that the authors cite, it was reported that NGF withdrawal results in a rapid 50% loss of βII-spectrin and actin in the MPS. Is this the case here? Does NGF withdrawal lead not only to aberrant phosphorylation but also a loss of MPS components? How can a rapid loss of MPS components following TD be reconciled with the proposed model here that MPS components are required to initiate axon degeneration?</p><p>4) In the absence of a clear-cut mechanism, the authors should provide stronger support for the link between rapid MPS disassembly and DLK phosphorylation/stability/retrograde transport by including more rigorous analyses similar to that reported by Larhammar et al., 2017. For example, quantification of DLK abundance in βII-spectrin null neurons, evidence of retrograde transport of DLK/P-<italic>JNK</italic> to cell bodies in mutant neurons, quantification of p-c-Jun results for Figures 3 and 5 rather than just showing images. Similarly, for the DLK1 western blots shown in Figures 3 and 4 supplements, there is no information if this is from a single experiment or representative of multiple analyses. Moreover, DLK phosphorylation should be probed by a phospho-specific DLK antibody if available. These analyses are necessary to provide more convincing support for the notion that βII-spectrin, an essential component of MPS, is required for well-characterized degenerative signaling events during trophic deprivation.</p><p>5) In the context of MPS disassembly initiating retrograde degenerative signaling, is the periodicity affected equally in all axonal segments after NGF withdrawal or does it show a specific pattern? Specifically, is there a progressive loss of periodicity from distal to proximal axon segments following NGF deprivation? It is not clear which regions of the axons were selected for imaging.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38730.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper represents a set of intriguing and generally well-executed experiments, however it does not add up to a coherent story.

Based on these comments, we have performed additional experiments and analyses and made text revisions, which have strengthened our manuscript.</p><p>Most of the comments in this general statement have been elaborated in the specific points below and hence we will address these comments in our response to the specific comments below. Here we only address the comment “One issue is that the lack of in vivo data” which has not been further mentioned below.</p><p>We agree that studying axon degeneration in vivo is an important goal. However, at any given time in vivo, of all axons, which travel in tight bundles of several hundred axons, only a small subset is degenerating, which has prevented us and other labs from having the spatial resolution to observe these few dying axons in the background of many more healthy ones. Indeed, we developed the whole-mount immunolabelling protocol iDISCO in part to attempt to visualize sensory axon degeneration in vivo, but have thus far been unable to visualize this process.</p><p>Hence, the use of cultured primary neurons to study the detailed molecular mechanisms of axon degeneration is the general practice in the field, particularly because, by initiating NGF deprivation at a fixed time we are able to see near-synchronous degeneration of axons. It is worth noting that we and others have extensively documented that the pathways of axon degeneration uncovered in vitro do indeed relate to the ultimate survival/death of these axons in vivo. For example, mouse mutants that delay (<italic>Puma, DR6, APP, Puma</italic>) or block (<italic>Bax, Caspase-3</italic>) axon degeneration display an increase in un-pruned axons in the visual system and an excess of sensory axons projecting to the periphery at later embryonic stages (Nikolaev et al., 2009; Simon et al., 2012, Olsen et al., J.Neurosci., 2014; Maor-Nof et al., 2016).</p><p>Finally, an additional challenge for this study is that super-resolution imaging in vivo has also been generally challenging. Moreover, the tight bundling of sensory axons in vivo (see above) would further hinder our ability to efficiently visualize the MPS and its disruption in the subset of axons that degenerate at any moment using super-resolution imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper could be strengthened by addressing the following essential points:</p><p>1) Both actin and spectrin have pleiotropic roles that can complicate interpretation of inhibitors/knockdowns. A more precise target (such as a dedicated component of the spectrin/actin rings if one can be identified) could help. The authors should develop the unexpected finding that βII-spectrin elimination prevents/slows degeneration. Although inconvenient and difficult to explain in the short term, this could be the most interesting observation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that both actin and spectrin have pleiotropic roles that can complicate the interpretation of pharmacological actin manipulations or knockdown/knockout of βII spectrin. It would indeed be great to find more precise targets that only affect the MPS. To this end, we have made substantial effort trying to achieve this goal:</p><p>a) We tried generating a mutant mouse where the actin-binding domain of βII spectrin can be conditionally deleted in culture using Cre-Lox recombination, with the hope of disrupting the MPS in more specific ways while still maintaining the presence of βII spectrin proteins and actin filaments. We tried this conditional knockout strategy because we are concerned that germline knockout would be lethal to the animal. However, even when we infected the culture neurons from this mutant mouse with a very high dose of Cre virus, only a fraction of βII spectrin had the actin-binding domain successfully deleted, as assayed by western blot. The problem of insufficient deletion could be either a result of low recombination rate for distantly spaced LoxP sites (the actin-binding domain encompasses 73 kb of genomic DNA) or due to the un-degraded full-length βII spectrin produced before the incidence of recombination. While we are exploring means to increase the recombination efficiency, these approaches require significantly more time than the scope of this revision. We plan to follow up on this in our future work.</p><p>b) We also generated a germline knock-in mouse model with the K2207Q mutation in the PH domain of βII-spectrin which has been shown to abolish binding affinity of βII-spectrin for phosphoinositides in MDCK cells (He et al., J Cell Biol 2014 Jul 21; 206(2)). This mutant also has the benefit of maintaining the original length of βII-spectrin. Our logic was that, by abolishing the binding to phosphoinositides, we could potentially remove βII-spectrin from the plasma membrane and thus disrupt the MPS. However, we found that the MPS still persisted along axons, albeit with a discontinuous distribution containing gaps devoid of the MPS. We also did not observe protection against TD-induced degeneration in these cultures, not unexpectedly because the MPS is still present in axons.</p><p>c) We observed TD-associated phosphorylation of MPS components, which could potentially facilitate dissociation of the MPS. Hence, it is possible that the MPS structure may be disrupted by engineering phospho-mimetic (S/T&gt;D) amino acids into the sequence of βII spectrin. We therefore generated a panel of S/T&gt;D (phospho-mimetic) and S/T&gt;A (phospho-deficient) mutations into a cDNA encoding the βII spectrin (<italic>Sptbn1</italic>) gene. However, <italic>Sptbn1</italic> cDNA is ~7.5kb long, far exceeding the maximum packaging sizes for both lentivirus and AAV, which has prevented us from successfully introducing these constructs to DRG neurons. We also made several attempts to introduce these mutations by cDNA transfection, each of which resulted in toxicity. Similar toxicity has been described for cDNA transfection in DRGs by other groups (Yu et al., Front Mol Neurosci. 2015 Feb 2;8:2.). In addition, we have explored adenovirus as a viral delivery system, which can typically package open reading frames up to ~6kb, and unfortunately these efforts also failed to express the full-length product of this cDNA in neurons.</p><p>Therefore, despite several months of effort, we were not able to generate mutants that can completely disentangle the role of the MPS from the role of other cytoskeletal structures or isolated βII spectrin. Therefore, even though the simplest explanation of our observed effects of actin and spectrin manipulations converge on the MPS, we revised the Discussion section of the manuscript to explicitly acknowledge that other cytoskeleton structures or other roles of actin and spectrin outside the MPS may also contribute to the observed effects of actin manipulations and spectrin perturbation on axon degeneration (see subsection “Structural plasticity of the MPS potentially functions to initiate retrograde signaling”, last paragraph).</p><p>We also agree with the reviewers that it would be interesting to develop the unexpected finding that βII spectrin elimination prevents/slows degeneration. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have performed additional experiments on retrograde signaling induced by TD in βII spectrin knockdown neurons to show that the loss-of-βII spectrin acts downstream of the activation of DLK kinase but upstream of the activation of the transcription factor c-Jun (see subsection “Depletion of MPS component βII spectrin protects axons from degeneration”, first paragraph and Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We have also performed additional experiments on LatA-induced axon degeneration in βII spectrin knockdown neurons to show that βII spectrin depletion also protect axons from degeneration under LatA treatment by measuring the Caspase3-like enzymatic activity (‘DEVDase’) in axons (see subsection “Depletion of the MPS component βII spectrin protects axons from degeneration”, last paragraph; Figure 5—figure supplement 3). Finally, we elaborated the implication of the finding that βII spectrin depletion protect axons from degeneration by providing two possible models to explain this result: 1) It is possible that the MPS sequesters pro-degenerative signaling molecules in healthy axons to prevent aberrant signaling, but also primes axons for degeneration by recruiting these molecules to the appropriate region of the axons. MPS disassembly might then activate the retrograde signaling by releasing these signaling molecules. On the other hand, inhibition of the formation of the MPS by βII spectrin depletion could lead to mis-localization of these signaling molecules, resulting in failure of retrograde signaling. 2) Another possibility is that MPS breakdown during TD (or following LatA treatment) produces a pool of soluble MPS components, such as spectrin and ankyrin, which could participate in retrograde trafficking of pro-degenerative signals. Both spectrin and ankyrin B have been shown to interact with motor proteins that move on microtubules. The disassembly of the MPS to free these MPS components could promote the role of these proteins in retrograde transport, which may in turn facilitate retrograde signaling in TD induced axon degeneration. Please see subsection “Structural plasticity of the MPS potentially functions to initiate retrograde signaling”, second paragraph for these discussions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One suggested experiment is to induce degeneration with LatA in neurons that lack β-spectrin, according to the authors model the axons should be protected, as the actin depolymerization will not be able to transmit the signal to the cell body.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this informative experiment. We have performed this additional experiment and added the results to the revised manuscript. As suggested by the reviewer, our model predicts that βII spectrin deletion will protect axon from degeneration induced by LatA. This is indeed what we observed. We elaborate this finding below:</p><p>In our original manuscript we showed that application of LatA led to activation of axonal Caspase-3 and that axonal Caspase-3 activation does not occur when LatA is added to isolated axons that have been severed from their cell bodies (Figure 3E). These results indicate that acute breakdown of F-actin in the axon generates a retrograde signal to the cell body, followed by an anterograde signal from the cell body to the axon that activates axonal Caspase-3, similar to the mechanism by which TD activates axonal Caspase-3.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we now performed new experiments to study whether LatA treatment still induces axon degeneration in βII spectrin knockdown neurons. Our new results showed that βII spectrin knockdown indeed prevented increase in axonal Caspase-3-like enzymatic activity in this case, similar to the case of TD-induced axon degeneration (see subsection “Depletion of the MPS component βII spectrin protects axons from degeneration”, last paragraph, Figure 5—figure supplement 3A). We note that βII spectrin knockdown did not prevent c-Jun activation in the case of LatA treatment (see the aforementioned paragraph, Figure 5—figure supplement 3B, C), even though TD-induced c-Jun activation was prevented by βII spectrin knockdown. This is likely because LatA treatment, which disrupts all forms of F-actin, initiates additional, less specific and βII spectrin-independent signal to activate c-Jun, which does not occur during TD. Nevertheless, the observation that βII spectrin knockdown blocks both LatA-induced and TD-induced axonal Caspase-3-like enzymatic activity indicates that βII spectrin is critical to retrograde signaling on the TD-induced (and related LatA-induced) axon degeneration pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors provide evidence from a phosphoproteomic screen that MPS components may be phosphorylated following trophic deprivation and speculate that aberrant phosphorylation may lead to destabilization of MPS. Some direct evidence supporting this in sensory axons following TD would strengthen the study. Could the authors use phospho-deficient or phosphomimetic mutants of βII-spectrin to test their model?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be very interesting to obtain direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that TD-induced phosphorylation of MPS component may lead to destabilization of MPS. We have made several attempts to address this issue by generating both phospho-deficient (S/T&gt;A) and phospho-mimetic (S/T &gt; D) mutation variants of βII spectrin. However, the βII spectrin (<italic>Sptbn1</italic>) gene, which is ~7.5kb long, far exceeds the maximum packaging sizes for both lentivirus and AAV, which has prevented us from successfully introducing these constructs to DRG neurons. We made several attempts on introducing these mutations by cDNA transfection, each of which resulted in toxicity. Similar toxicity has been described for cDNA transfection in DRGs by other groups (Yu et al., Front Mol Neurosci. 2015 Feb 2;8:2.). In addition, we have explored adenovirus as a viral delivery system, which can typically package open reading frames up to ~6kb. Unfortunately, these efforts also failed to express the full-length product of this cDNA in neurons. We therefore were not able to perform this suggested experiment despite several months of effort. Because we have not been able to address the functional role for these phosphorylations, we have further softened our discussion regarding their relevance to MPS disruption and axon degeneration (see subsection “The early disassembly of MPS is independent of apoptotic pathway activation and protein loss”, last paragraph and subsection “Depletion of βII-spectrin inhibits retrograde signaling and protects axons from degeneration”). Despite this, we feel that the inclusion of the identification of these sites has value and will be of great interest to labs that are exploring the biology of the MPS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, in a recent study (Unsain et al., 2018) that the authors cite, it was reported that NGF withdrawal results in a rapid 50% loss of βII-spectrin and actin in the MPS. Is this the case here? Does NGF withdrawal lead not only to aberrant phosphorylation but also a loss of MPS components? How can a rapid loss of MPS components following TD be reconciled with the proposed model here that MPS components are required to initiate axon degeneration?</p></disp-quote><p>We note that (Unsain et al., 2018) did not probe the abundance of βII-spectrin, actin or other MPS components. Instead, Unsain et al. reported the so-called MPS abundance, which is defined as the fraction of axonal regions that exhibited periodic distribution of βII-spectrin or actin. Hence, this study only concluded that the MPS structure is disrupted upon NGF withdraw, but did not conclude on any loss of βII-spectrin, actin or other MPS components.</p><p>In our manuscript, we showed that the MPS disassembly upon TD occurs early and prior to the activation of the apoptotic activity and that the TD-induced MPS disassembly still occurs in axons where the apoptotic pathway is blocked. These results suggest that the observed MPS disassembly is unlikely a result of the reduced abundance of MPS components.</p><p>However, in light of this reviewer comment, we performed additional experiments to probe whether there is a decrease in abundance of the MPS molecular components upon TD.</p><p>a) We measured the total abundance of βII spectrin in axons, reflected by the average fluorescence intensity, and found that the βII spectrin remains unchanged during the entire 12 h observation period after TD (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), whereas MPS disassembly has already occurred substantially before the 12 h time point (MPS is substantially disrupted already by 3-6 h time after TD, see Figure 1, 2).</p><p>b) We extended our analysis to test whether other MPS components are lost during the relevant window of TD. Towards this end, we performed a series of Western Blots on axonal proteins to examine the abundance of MPS components, αII spectrin, βII spectrin, and actin, during a time course of TD.</p><p>Our key observations (Figure 2B) are:</p><p>i) Total protein abundance of βII spectrin and actin remained constant during the entire 18hr assay window.</p><p>ii) Proteolysis of αII spectrin did occur during TD, but only beginning at the 12hr time point and in a Caspase-dependent manner.</p><p>In sum, the behavior of the MPS that we observed is not a consequence of reduced abundance of MPS component proteins. These data additionally contribute towards our hypothesis that MPS disassembly potentially has an upstream role during axon degeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the absence of a clear-cut mechanism, the authors should provide stronger support for the link between rapid MPS disassembly and DLK phosphorylation/stability/retrograde transport by including more rigorous analyses similar to that reported by Larhammar et al., 2017. For example, quantification of DLK abundance in βII-spectrin null neurons, evidence of retrograde transport of DLK/P-JNK to cell bodies in mutant neurons, quantification of p-c-Jun results for Figures 3 and 5 rather than just showing images. Similarly, for the DLK1 western blots shown in Figures 3 and 4 supplements, there is no information if this is from a single experiment or representative of multiple analyses. Moreover, DLK phosphorylation should be probed by a phospho-specific DLK antibody if available. These analyses are necessary to provide more convincing support for the notion that βII-spectrin, an essential component of MPS, is required for well-characterized degenerative signaling events during trophic deprivation.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we performed additional experiments to examine the DLK abundance in βII spectrin null axons and found that it was not appreciably different than that in WT axons (See Figure 5I). Interestingly, although loss of βII spectrin protected axons from degeneration and inhibited the activation of c-Jun, it did not block DLK activation (assayed by the phosphorylation-dependent shift in DLK molecular weight) (Figure 5I), suggesting that βII spectrin likely functions downstream of DLK activation but upstream of c-Jun.</p><p>Also as suggested by the reviewer, we have added quantification of the magnitude of c-Jun phosphorylation in Figures 3 and 5 to show more clearly the c-Jun activation in TD cultures and LatA treated cultures and the reduction in c-Jun activation with DLK inhibition and βII spectrin depletion. In addition to quantifying phosphorylated c-Jun, we also added an additional assay to quantify increase in c-Jun mRNA abundance induced by TD. This induction is also largely blocked by βII spectrin knockdown (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D).</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to include information about our sample size. We have updated our figure legends of Figure 3 and Figure 4 supplements (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2) to include the number of DLK1 western blot experiments performed for each representative figure shown (3 independent experiments).</p><p>Regarding the reviewer’s comment about detection of DLK activation: DLK is activated by phosphorylation near its active site and unfortunately no phospho-specific antibodies to these sites have been published or are commercially available. There are phosphospecific antibodies to phosphorylation sites outside of the activation site that work in 293T cells (Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013), but we have been unable to obtain a convincing signal in our axonal samples using these antibodies. Nevertheless, the molecular weight shift that we employed is both widely used and well-validated as a DLK activation assay in the previous studies (Watkins et al., 2013; Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013; Larhammar et al., 2017; Larhammar et al., J.Neurosci., 2017), and therefore we are confident in its use as a surrogate for DLK activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the context of MPS disassembly initiating retrograde degenerative signaling, is the periodicity affected equally in all axonal segments after NGF withdrawal or does it show a specific pattern? Specifically, is there a progressive loss of periodicity from distal to proximal axon segments following NGF deprivation? It is not clear which regions of the axons were selected for imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not making this clear in our manuscript. Our results here focus on the distal axons. In light of this reviewer comment, we have performed additional experiments to image the proximal axon segments adjacent to the cell body, but interestingly, the MPS is not as well formed (i.e. βII spectrin exhibits relatively poor periodicity) in the axon region proximal to the cell body of DRG neurons even in the presence of NGF (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We have now included this result in the revised manuscript. In the distal axons, without the presence of the cell body in the same field of view, it is difficult to determine which end of the axon segment is closer to the cell body. In general, the density of the axons makes it challenging to trace the axons all the way back to the cell body to determine orientation of the axon segments, which prevents us from making a conclusion on whether the disruption of the MPS propagates from distal to proximal axon segments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
