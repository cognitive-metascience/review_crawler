In photosynthetic eukaryotes and many bacteria, glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR) is the most tightly controlled enzyme upstream of ALA. Higher plants possess two GluTR isoforms: GluTR1 is predominantly expressed in green tissue, and GluTR2 is constitutively expressed in all organs. Although proposed long time ago, the molecular mechanism of heme-dependent inhibition of GluTR <italic>in planta</italic> has remained elusive. Here, we report that accumulation of heme, induced by feeding with ALA, stimulates Clp-protease-dependent degradation of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GluTR1. We demonstrate that binding of heme to the GluTR-binding protein (GBP) inhibits interaction of GBP with the N-terminal regulatory domain of GluTR1, thus making it accessible to the Clp protease. The results presented uncover a functional link between heme content and the post-translational control of GluTR stability, which helps to ensure adequate availability of chlorophyll and heme.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tetrapyrrole biosynthesis</kwd><kwd>5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis</kwd><kwd>GluTR</kwd><kwd>heme</kwd><kwd>posttranslational regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>317556048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grimm</surname><given-names>Bernhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Heme-dependent feedback inhibition of rate-limiting ALA-synthesis of plant tetrapyrrole biosynthesis depends on binding of heme to glutamyl-tRNA reductase-binding protein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tetrapyrrole biosynthesis (TBS) is one of the vital biochemical pathways found in organisms. Besides providing heme and its breakdown products, which are essential constituents of almost all organisms, the pathway supplies the chlorophyll (Chl) crucial for photosynthesis in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tanaka and Tanaka, 2007</xref>). In plants, the plastid-localized TBS is initiated by the reduction of a tRNA-coupled glutamate to glutamate-1-semialdehyde (GSA) by glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR). The unstable GSA is then converted into 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) by GSA aminotransferase (GSAT). ALA is the universal precursor of all tetrapyrroles, and its synthesis is considered to be rate-limiting for TBS as a whole. Eight molecules of ALA are converted into the macrocyclic protoporphyrin IX (ProtoIX) in subsequent reactions. Thereafter, ProtoIX is directed into either the iron or magnesium branch for the synthesis of heme or Chl, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tanaka and Tanaka, 2007</xref>). For heme synthesis in plants, two related ferrochelatases (FC1 and FC2) are available, which are characterized by distinct and partially overlapping functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Espinas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scharfenberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Woodson et al., 2011</xref>). Synthesis of Chl is initiated by the insertion of Mg<sup>2+</sup> into ProtoIX, catalyzed by the Mg-chelatase (MgCh) complex. Two additional steps convert the catalytic product Mg protoporphyrin IX (MgP) into protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) which, in angiosperms, is reduced to chlorophyllide (Chlide) by the light-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Chlide is converted to Chl <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> by enzymes of the Chl cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tanaka and Tanaka, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Various regulatory mechanisms of TBS have been reported, which modify the activities and amounts of the TBS enzymes, including GluTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brzezowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms ensure the provision of adequate levels of active GluTR to ensure balanced ALA synthesis rates. Post-translational modifications of GluTR include redox regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Richter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wittmann et al., 2018</xref>), dark- and low-light-dependent suppression of its activity by interaction with FLUORESCENT IN BLUE LIGHT (FLU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meskauskiene and Apel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Meskauskiene et al., 2001</xref>), folding by the chaperone chloroplast signal recognition particle 43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), as well as the conditional proteolysis of GluTR by the caseinolytic protease (Clp) and regulation of its stability by the GluTR-binding protein (GBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apitz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czarnecki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nishimura et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The plastid-localized <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Clp protease uses the selector proteins ClpS1 and ClpF1 and the chaperones ClpC1/2 and ClpD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nishimura and van Wijk, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nishimura et al., 2013</xref>). These subunits are required for recognition and ATP-driven unfolding of the substrate proteins prior to the proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Olinares et al., 2011</xref>). Binding of the N-terminus of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GluTR1 to ClpS, ClpF, and ClpC induces its proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apitz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nishimura et al., 2015</xref>). Turnover of bacterial GluTR is analogously catalyzed by Clp and the Lon protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 1999a</xref>). Plant GBP, which has no homolog in bacteria, competes with the Clp subunits for binding to the N-terminus of GluTR, and thus counteracts GluTR breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apitz et al., 2016</xref>). The GluTR site recognized by both GBP and Clp subunits includes a 30-amino-acid N-terminal peptide, which was previously designated as the ‘heme-binding domain’ (HBD). Deletion of the HBD was found to compromise heme-dependent inhibition of GluTR activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vothknecht et al., 1998</xref>) and Clp-dependent degradation of GluTR in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apitz et al., 2016</xref>). Due to the negative impact of heme on GluTR activity, it was proposed that heme feedback-controls GluTR and, consequently, ALA synthesis rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cornah et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Terry and Kendrick, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Terry and Kendrick, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vothknecht et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>We set out to identify factors that affect heme-dependent regulation of GluTR activity and stability. Here, we present experimental evidence for a direct role of heme in regulating the proteolysis of GluTR1 by the Clp protease. The results presented in this study reveal that the N-terminus of GluTR – a putative heme-binding domain (HBD) – is not involved in heme binding. The importance of heme for GluTR1 stability derives from its interaction with GBP. Based on these new findings, and in light of recent data that underline the regulatory impact of the N-terminal region of GluTR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), we refer to the ‘HBD’ as the ‘<underline>re</underline>gulatory <underline>d</underline>omain’ (RED) of GluTR1 in the following.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Induced destabilization of GluTR upon ALA feeding</title><p>To explore the impact of TBS metabolites on the stability of GluTR and several other plastid-localized proteins, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> wild-type plants (WT, Col-0) were transferred to buffer supplemented or not with 1 mM ALA.

GBP, Mg-protoporphyrin IX (MgP) methyltransferase (CHLM), and ClpS were detected in reduced amounts in both control and ALA-fed leaves. Hence, these effects are not a direct consequence of ALA feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, we identified two proteins with differential accumulation patterns. Accumulation of FC1 was strongly induced, and GluTR1 content decreased in control leaves in the dark, but these effects became markedly more pronounced in the presence of supplied ALA. In comparison to the light-grown seedlings at t(0), GluTR1 amounts were slightly reduced after 4 hr and reduced by 40% after 24 hr of darkness without ALA supply. But even short term (4 hr) ALA feeding triggered a drastic loss of GluTR1 (76% reduction relative to t(0)), while the enzyme was barely detectable after 24 hr of ALA treatment (96% reduction relative to t(0), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This strong ALA-induced proteolysis was exclusively observed for GluTR1. Furthermore, Chl <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> (Chl a + b, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and non-covalently bound (ncb) heme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) content were not changed in ALA- and mock-treated leaves during 24 hr darkness compared to t(0). In contrast, the Pchlide levels increased by 10- and 20-fold in control and approximately 100- and 300-fold in ALA-fed leaves after 4 hr and 24 hr of dark treatment, respectively, in comparison to the steady-state levels detected in the light-grown seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To dissect the molecular mechanism behind the remarkable decrease in GluTR1 content after ALA feeding, qRT-PCR analyses of genes encoding TBS enzymes were performed. Irrespective of ALA supplementation, levels of <italic>HEMA1</italic> (encoding GluTR1), <italic>CHL27</italic>, <italic>GSA1</italic> (encoding GSAT) and <italic>FC2</italic> mRNAs were decreased by at least 60% and up to 95% after 4 hr and 24 hr of dark incubation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,H,G,J</xref>). The <italic>HEMA2</italic> transcript content remained high during dark incubation and was slightly induced by 24 hr of ALA feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), while <italic>FC1</italic> mRNA content increased steadily upon incubation of leaves with ALA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).

In summary, it can be concluded that the decreased GluTR1 content observed upon ALA feeding is not a consequence of altered <italic>HEMA1</italic> transcription, but is instead attributable to post-translational destabilization of the protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ALA-induced destabilization of GluTR involves the Clp protease</title><p>For the analysis of the impact of the Clp protease on ALA-dependent GluTR degradation, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> WT, <italic>clpc1-1,</italic> and <italic>clpr2-1</italic> leaves were incubated in buffer without or with ALA for 4 hr in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

In the presence of excess ALA, GluTR1 is more stable in the functional knockdown mutants <italic>clpc1-1</italic> and <italic>clpr2-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nishimura and van Wijk, 2015</xref>) than it is in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Consequently, deletion of the RED renders GluTR1 insensitive to ALA-induced Clp degradation in darkness and prevents proteolysis of ΔRED-GluTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, knockout of <italic>GBP</italic> (which otherwise counteracts proteolysis) resulted in faster breakdown of GluTR than that seen in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Firstly, accumulation of Pchlide has been reported to induce the FLU-dependent repression of GluTR activity in darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Meskauskiene et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richter et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, dark supplementation with ALA, which would drastically increase levels of TBS intermediates, in particular Pchlide, could also function as a feedback signal for the immediate breakdown of GluTR1. Secondly, heme-dependent feedback regulation of GluTR was suggested in previous studies, and an N-terminally truncated recombinant GluTR1 was shown to be insensitive to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Terry and Kendrick, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Terry and Kendrick, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vothknecht et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence support heme-mediated control of GluTR amounts in plants. 1. Inhibition of Pchlide and heme accumulation at the levels of PPOX, FC and oxidative cyclase, respectively, prevents ALA-induced GluTR1 proteolysis in a photoautotrophic cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). By using two chemically unrelated inhibitors of the TBS pathway, we ruled out unspecific effects of these compounds on the Clp protease and excluded the possibility that ALA or an intermediate upstream of ProtoIX serves as the signal for GluTR1 degradation. 2. Supplementation of purified <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chloroplasts with various tetrapyrroles identified heme as the stimulatory factor for GluTR1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). 3. The ALA-fed <italic>gun5-2</italic> knockout mutant exhibits ALA-induced GluTR1 degradation, revealing that the process is not triggered by metabolites of the Chl-synthesizing branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). 4. The final proof for the feedback regulatory function of heme was obtained when ALA-fed <italic>fc2-2</italic> leaves were found to retain GluTR1 in the darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also observed significantly different contents of ‘free’ heme in ALA-fed WT and <italic>fc2-2</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). This latter result reflects the expected phenotype of deficient heme synthesis in the chloroplast, where FC2 is the dominant isoform. The increased FC1 content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) only partially compensated for the deficit of FC2 activity and did not lead to adequate heme synthesis in plastids. The specific role of FC2-derived heme for the control of ALA synthesis is further emphasized by the WT-like stability of GluTR1 in <italic>FC1</italic> knockdown mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, it is proposed that heme synthesized by FC2 is allocated for GBP-binding, while FC1 provides heme for other cellular compartments, as it has been proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Espinas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scharfenberg et al., 2015</xref>). In this context, although measurements of ‘free’ heme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Espinas et al., 2012</xref>) were used to show reduced FC activities in <italic>fc2-2</italic> compared to WT, the heme responsible for GluTR1 breakdown is most likely bound to a (regulatory) protein and belongs to the ncb fraction.</p><p>In conclusion, lack of heme synthesis by FC2 correlates with greater stability of GluTR1 during short-term ALA feeding in the darkness. Thus, the involvement of heme in the regulation of ALA synthesis constitutes one among the many post-translational mechanisms that control GluTR. GluTR1 degradation was indeed also observed in <italic>fc2-2</italic> after 24 hr of incubation with ALA, but was significantly less pronounced than in the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating the existence of an additional proteolysis pathway that is independent of FC2-synthesized heme. Alternatively, the elevated FC1 content seen in <italic>fc2-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) could also contribute to the synthesis of regulatory heme.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Model: Binding of heme by GBP makes GluTR1 available for Clp-dependent proteolysis</title><p>Previous studies revealed a structural homology between GBP and the bacterial heme oxygenase HugZ, which converts heme into biliverdin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Although the order of domains differs in GBP from that of HugZ and its mode of heme-binding has not been analyzed, co-filtration and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) have demonstrated binding of heme to GBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). The hemin-agarose-based binding assays described here unequivocally validate GBP as a heme-binding protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The inability of GluTR1 to bind hemin in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) agrees with the absence of bound heme in GluTR1 crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The regulatory model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> depicts binding of heme-free GBP to GluTR1. Thus, we propose that GBP can bind either to GluTR or to heme, and as long as the GBP is bound to GluTR1, the recognition site for Clp subunits near the GluTR N-terminus is masked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apitz et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, GluTR1 is tightly controlled to avoid unwanted tetrapyrrole synthesis, for example, during darkness, but is needed for high ALA synthesis rates in light-grown tissue. Hence, an effector molecule is needed to regulate the conditional stability of GluTR1. We propose that heme functions as the trigger for reduced ALA synthesis by binding to GBP. This assumption is supported by heme-dependent attenuation of the GluTR1-GBP interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>) and the strongly decreased affinity of heme-bound GBP for GluTR1 demonstrated by MST measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). The negative impact of heme on the GBP-GluTR interaction is in agreement with decreased stimulation of GluTR activity by GBP in the presence of heme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>).

However, GluTR2 is not degraded during ALA feeding in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Although binding to FLU likely prevents Clp-dependent degradation of GluTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou et al., 2019</xref>), we propose that FLU and heme act in concert to control ALA synthesis in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goslings et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for the understanding of TBS pathway regulation</title><p>Photosynthetic cells in plants thus rely on at least two mechanisms to rapidly respond to changing needs for tetrapyrroles (FLU and heme). In contrast, heterotrophic tissues, which do not synthesize Chl (e.g. roots), do not utilize the FLU-POR-Pchlide inactivation complex to control ALA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kauss et al., 2012</xref>). Here, heme presumably serves as the sole signal that triggers the adjustment of GluTR amounts and ALA synthesis rates. Although the precise mechanism is still unknown, the heme status also controls GluTR amounts and activity in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Armas-Ricard et al., 2011</xref>), implying that the GluTR proteolysis mechanism evolved early in evolutionary history. Phylogenetic analysis reveals, however, that homologs of GBP and the RED of GluTR1 are only found in land plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). In light of the fact that angiosperms lacking dark-dependent POR (DPOR) need to control ALA synthesis during light-dark cycles tightly, it is reasonable to assume that GBP and RED have coevolved for the regulation of GluTR stability by heme. In this line, regulation of Chl synthesis by modulated GluTR stability was proposed to play a minor role in Chlamydomonas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nogaj et al., 2005</xref>) suggesting a posttranslationally adjusted GluTR activity.</p><p>The presented model also explains phenomena and experimental results published in the past.

This observation can now be explained by the diminished synthesis of heme functioning as the stimulus for GluTR1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>aurea</italic> (<italic>au</italic>) and <italic>yellow-green 2</italic> (<italic>yg-2</italic>) mutants of tomato, which are defective in the phytochromobilin synthase and heme oxygenase (HO/HY1) respectively, show a pale-green phenotype which is related to enhanced inhibition of ALA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Terry and Kendrick, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Terry and Kendrick, 1999</xref>). Accumulation of heme owing to impaired heme conversion to phytochromobilin in these mutants was assumed to inhibit GluTR activity. This was also observed in assays with a recombinant plant GluTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vothknecht et al., 1998</xref>).

decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The GluTR-binding protein is the heme-binding factor for feed-back control of glutamyl-tRNA reductase&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mats Hansson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Richter et al. presents data in support of a role for heme in controlling ALA production in plants via regulation Clp proteolysis of GluTR. The basic model proposes that GBP normally binds to an amino-terminal extension of GluTR thereby preventing Clp-mediated proteolysis of GluTR but when cellular heme is in excess, the heme binds to GBP causing it to release from GluTR and allow degradation of GluTR to occur. The data presented in this manuscript is consistent with this model. In general, the paper is technically sound. But reviewers have raised important concerns which need to be addressed prior to a final decision. Major concerns are (a) the novelty of the findings in light of published work from the same group (example: Apitz et al.,2014 and 2016); (b) presentation style which will require proof-reading and careful editing; and (c) calculating statistical significance. I have summarized the three reviewers' comments below.</p><p>Essential revision requirements:</p><p>1) As mentioned throughout the manuscript, the report here builds on your previous work. In particular the Apitz et al. paper, while not containing replicated data, does contain much of the information presented herein. The clear novel finding in the current work is the demonstration that heme, which was previously shown to bind to GBP, does not bind to GluTR. Thus, you suggest renaming the &quot;heme binding domain&quot; of GluTR as the &quot;regulatory domain&quot; since it is GBP-binding domain, not a heme binding domain. In the end, we conclude the central finding is important enough advance; however, some text revision focusing more attention on this finding and less on recounting past results in Apitz et al. is required.</p><p>2) Another shortcoming is the written presentation. There is very considerable repetition between the Introduction, Results and Discussion. There is too much discussion in the Results section and the Discussion is overly long. The first paragraph of subsection “Implications for the understanding of TBS pathway regulation” is superfluous to the aim of the manuscript since by that point in the manuscript the model has been presented and discussed multiple times. Any resubmission of the current offering should be reduced in length by at least a third.</p><p>3) The first two sentences of the Abstract are not completely accurate: whether &quot;ALA synthesis is rate-limiting in <italic>all</italic> organisms&quot; is overly broad and lacks proof.</p><p>4) A major concern is that the authors should go through the figures and think of the statistical values, i.e. which numbers are actually significant in general and how should standard deviation be calculated on ratios which are presented?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46300.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revision requirements:</p><p>1) As mentioned throughout the manuscript, the report here builds on your previous work.

Because the previous work builds the framework for the presented experiments, the new results are intentionally discussed with respect to the previous findings. It is important to note that, although already presented before, the Clp-GBP-dependent regulation of GluTR stability is better understood in the view of our new findings, when heme as an important regulator is included in the model. However, we reduced the amount of repetitions wherever possible, moved or deleted discussions from the Results section and carefully revised the Discussion to emphasize the novelty of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The first paragraph of subsection “Implications for the understanding of TBS pathway regulation” is superfluous to the aim of the manuscript since by that point in the manuscript the model has been presented and discussed multiple times.
