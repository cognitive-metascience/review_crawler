processes, including autophagy, endocytic sorting, phagocytosis, anabolic responses and cell division. VPS34 forms various complexes that help adapt it to specific pathways, with complexes I and II being the most prominent ones. We found that physicochemical properties of membranes strongly modulate VPS34 activity. Greater unsaturation of both substrate and non-substrate lipids, negative charge and curvature activate VPS34 complexes, adapting them to their cellular compartments. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) of complexes I and II on membranes elucidated structural determinants that enable them to bind membranes. Among these are the Barkor/ATG14L autophagosome targeting sequence (BATS), which makes autophagy-specific complex I more active than the endocytic complex II, and the Beclin1 BARA domain. Interestingly, even though Beclin1 BARA is common to both complexes, its membrane-interacting loops are critical for complex II, but have only a minor role for complex I.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane defects</kwd><kwd>phospholipids</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>sorting</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositide 3-kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105184308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Roger L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C14801/A21211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Roger L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC-A024-5PF9L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Roger L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The lipid kinase VPS34 complexes I and II are both activated by unsaturation of substrate and non-substrate lipids, curvature, electrostatics and polyphosphoinositides, which play roles in localisation and cellular function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lipids form membranes that delimit cellular compartments, but they also can act as signalling molecules that recruit proteins to membranes. The chemical and compositional diversity of lipids help to establish the identity of intracellular compartments and the nature of subdomains within these compartments. For example, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains low levels of cholesterol and high levels of unsaturated glycerophospholipids, whereas the plasma membrane has an abundance of cholesterol and saturated sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</xref>). Differences in lipid composition give membranes their physicochemical characteristics, which can control the activities of membrane-associated enzymes. The lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) plays important roles in the regulation of various intracellular events including autophagy, endocytosis, phagocytosis, and vacuolar protein sorting. In mammals, PI(3)P is generated mainly by the Class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase VPS34/PIK3C3, which phosphorylates the 3-OH position of phosphatidylinositol (PI). However, in cells, VPS34 is not found alone. Instead, it forms two principal complexes, complexes I and II. Both complexes have core components VPS34, VPS15 and Beclin 1 (Vps30 in yeast) bound to a specific component, which is either ATG14L (Atg14 in yeast) in complex I or UVRAG (Vps38 in yeast) in complex II. This single subunit difference between these two complexes localizes them to different membrane compartments. Complex I is active on autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matsunaga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Itakura et al., 2008</xref>) and some ER compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nascimbeni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axe et al., 2008</xref>), in response to starvation. In contrast, complex II is mainly active in endocytic pathways by partially co-localizing in mammalian cells with Rab5- and Rab7-positive endolysosomal compartments as well as with Rab9-positive compartments important for endosome to TGN sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Itakura et al., 2008</xref>). As the membranes of these different compartments vary, we have undertaken to determine how lipid composition affects the lipid kinase activity of VPS34 complexes.</p><p>The PI(3)P generated by complex I appears in puncta at ER-mitochondria contact sites, at ER-plasma membrane contact sites and on ER sites known as omegasomes, which are recognized by PI(3)P-specific binding proteins such as DFCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nascimbeni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prinz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axe et al., 2008</xref>). These findings indicate that complex I is recruited to specific sites on membranes for its activation. This recruitment involves an upstream complex, the ULK1 complex (Atg1 complex in yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Russell et al., 2013</xref>). However, how complex I itself associates with membranes and is activated on them is unclear. Complex II recruitment to early endosomes and activation is aided by Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christoforidis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray et al., 2002</xref>), although the mechanism by which this occurs is poorly characterized. PI(3)P produced by complex II, in turn, leads to recruitment of various PI(3)P binding proteins that function in endocytic pathways such as Hrs, EEA1, and sorting nexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaullier et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2001</xref>). We have previously shown that yeast complex II has a Y-shaped structure, with the one arm bearing Vps34 and Vps15 acting as the catalytic arm, while the other arm bearing Vps30 and Vps38 is the adaptor arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rostislavleva et al., 2015</xref>). A similar structural organization has been observed for human complexes I and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Young et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baskaran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). The aromatic finger motif in the BARA domain of Vps30 is important for membrane binding and kinase activity of complex II, shedding light on the importance of the adaptor arm for membrane binding and kinase activity. Many previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of Class III PI3K have used pure PI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fassy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Munson and Ganley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Russell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) or a lipid mixture of only PI and PS as the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brier et al., 2019</xref>). This approach underestimates the effects that membrane complexity could have on VPS34 activity. For this reason, we have devised alternative VPS34 assays to measure the activities of Class III PI3Ks on membranes whose character we can control.</p><p>Protein binding to membranes is affected by three important physicochemical parameters: membrane electrostatics, lipid packing, and membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</xref>). The negative charge of intracellular membranes arises mainly from phosphoinositides and phosphatidylserine (PS). PS is known to enhance membrane-protein interactions by binding to basic residues of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yeung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yeung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhu et al., 1999</xref>), whereas protein affinity for a phosphoinositide may depend on both the net charge (the number of phosphates on the inositol ring) or stereochemistry of the phosphoinositide.</p><p>Lipid packing is determined by the shape of polar lipid headgroups and by saturation of acyl chains. Unsaturated acyl chains only loosely pack into membranes due to the kinks introduced by unsaturated bond(s), whereas completely saturated acyl chains provide a more uniform geometry and can therefore pack tightly to restrict membrane flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</xref>). Packing also depends on global membrane properties, such as stretching/compression, membrane curvature, or membrane stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marsh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McMahon and Boucrot, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</xref>). Membrane flexibility is important for processes such as vesiculation, endocytosis and phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calder et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Degreif et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jackson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schroit and Gallily, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manni et al., 2018</xref>). Phospholipids usually have a saturated fatty acyl chain at position <italic>sn1</italic> of the glycerophospholipid, while the <italic>sn2</italic> fatty acyl chain can be saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. Phospholipids with two polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains make membranes more flexible, but very permeable, while the more common <italic>sn1</italic>-saturated-<italic>sn2</italic>-polyunsaturated enable flexibility with low membrane permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manni et al., 2018</xref>). Acyl chain saturation status also influences membrane curvature. Unsaturated lipids can tolerate high membrane curvature, whereas the shapes of saturated lipids are cylindrical, making membranes containing them flatter. ER membranes are enriched with unsaturated phospholipids, enabling high membrane curvature. This facilitates protein secretion from the ER. In contrast, PM membranes are more tightly packed, due to the abundance of saturated phospholipid, which creates a thick boundary between the cell and its environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holthuis and Menon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have developed a purely <italic>in vitro</italic> system with purified VPS34 complexes I and II in which we can directly control membrane bilayer properties, including acyl chain saturation of both substrate and non-substrate lipids, membrane charge and membrane curvature. By combining HDX-MS with mutagenesis and lipid kinase assays, we have investigated which domains and motifs of complex I and complex II are important for membrane binding and kinase activity, and which physicochemical parameters of membranes have the greatest impact on complexes I and II.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To assess how membrane properties modify the activities of VPS34 complexes, we have developed a quantitative confocal microscopy assay to measure the activity of the human Class III PI3K complexes on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), which have a radius of ~ 1–30 µm.

This lipid headgroup composition resembles the ER membrane and we will refer to it as the base lipid composition or ‘DO base’. On DO base lipids, human complex I showed higher activity than complex II. Complex I showed a 7-fold higher initial rate compared with complex II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, we examined whether the difference in activity between complexes I and II could be because complex II, which is normally active on early endosomes, was not assayed on endosome-mimicking membranes. There is evidence that early endosomes are rich in cholesterol and sphingomyelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bissig and Gruenberg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arumugam and Kaur, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi et al., 2002</xref>).

This showed that even with this membrane composition, complex I remained more active than complex II. In order to compare the ability of complexes I and II to bind membranes, we carried out a flotation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This revealed that fractions 1–3, which contained floating liposomes, included much more complex I when compared to the same fractions with complex II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The correlation of the activity assays with the membrane binding assay strongly suggests that complex I is more active than complex II because complex I binds membranes more tightly than complex II.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Both substrate and non-substrate lipid unsaturation as well as membrane curvature greatly increase VPS34 activities</title><p>We examined how lipid packing affects VPS34 activities by varying the saturation status of the acyl chains. For each complex, we compared VPS34 activity on GUVs composed of different percentages of phospholipids with either stearoyl (18:0) or oleoyl (18:1) acyl chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As stearoyl acyl chains are saturated, they cause a tighter lipid packing than the mono-unsaturated oleoyl chains. Whereas SO lipids are made with one stearoyl and one oleoyl acyl chain, DO lipids carry two oleoyl acyl chains. Three different lipid compositions were examined: 82% DO lipids (18:1-18:1), 82% SO lipids (18:0-18:1), and 55% SO with 27% DO lipids (55% SO+27% DO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In each case, we varied only the acyl chain saturation of the non-substrate lipids while we kept the source of the PI and the relative proportions of PI, PS, PE and PC the same. GUV assays revealed that complexes I and II were only active on 82% DO lipids and not on 55% SO+27% DO or 82% SO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), suggesting that loose lipid packing activates complexes I and II. However, Z-stack analysis of ten Z slices, which covers a range of vesicle sizes revealed some activity on smaller vesicles with 55% SO+27% DO, but not on vesicles with 82% SO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). To examine this further, the curvatures (1/radius) for each GUV mixture were plotted against their fluorescence intensities. GUVs with 55% SO+27% DO displayed a positive correlation between increasing membrane curvature and activity for both complexes I and II, but 82% SO GUVs did not exhibit this correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>).

Sequence analysis suggests that the BATS domain has an amphipathic α-helix referred to as the amphipathic lipid packing sensor (ALPS) (residues 471–492), and hydrophobic residues 484W, 485F, and 488Y within this motif are important for the binding of the BATS domain to SUVs and for the localization of ATG14L to autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2011</xref>). Using the GUV assay, we compared activities of complex I carrying a BATS mutation in which the ALPS motif was truncated (ΔALPS 471–492) with the wild-type complex I (WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). On DO base lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), the ΔALPS mutant showed no activity, suggesting that the motif is essential for the complex I activity on membranes. Even on GUVs made with DO high PS, the ΔALPS mutant of complex I showed hardly any detectable activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Surprisingly, complex I ΔALPS displayed significantly less activity than VPS34 alone on GUVs containing 25% PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This suggests that the non-catalytic subunits of complex I partially inhibit basal VPS34 activity in the absence of the ALPS motif. To determine whether the increase in activity conferred on complex I by the BATS domain is an intrinsic property of the domain, we fused the BATS domain to the C-terminus of the full-length UVRAG subunit and co-expressed it with other complex II subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This fusion complex was shown previously to increase membrane binding of complex II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). We found that the fusion complex II (UVRAG+BATS) showed increased activity, about 7-fold compared with the wild-type complex II (CII WT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The human UVRAG has a 235 amino-acid long C-terminal extension compared to its yeast orthologue Vps38. When this UVRAG-specific extension was deleted and the BATS domain was fused to the truncated UVRAG, the resulting complex II variant (UVRAG ∆C+BATS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) showed an even higher activation of 11-fold over the WT complex II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This suggests that the presence or absence of the UVRAG C-terminal region alters the orientation of the BATS domain with respect to the membrane. Interestingly, both UVRAG+BATS and UVRAG ∆C+BATS exhibited even higher activity than complex I WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Our activity results are consistent with the previous studies showing that the presence of the BATS domain increased membrane binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). Together with our HDX-MS results, this strongly indicates that the BATS domain activates complex I through a mechanism that involves an increase in membrane binding, and that the BATS domain can act as an autonomous membrane-interacting module that confers gain of function to VPS34 activity.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Influence of the Amphipathic Lipid Packing Sensor (ALPS) motif in the ATG14L BATS domain on the activities of complexes I and II.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Constructs used to examine the influence of the BATS domain on VPS34 activity in the contexts of complex I and a complex I/II chimera on GUVs.

Variations in acyl chain composition of glycerophospholipids can give rise to thousands of lipid species. Nevertheless, mammalian cells have some distinct patterns of acyl chain enrichments. One notable example of this is that 40–85% of PI is present as SAPI (18:0/20:4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barneda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blunsom and Cockcroft, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bozelli and Epand, 2019</xref>). We showed that VPS34 kinase is activated by unsaturation of its substrate PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This is consistent with the observation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that depletion of an enzyme that incorporates polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the <italic>sn-2</italic> position of PI significantly decreased PI(3)P content and size of early endosomes, without reducing total PI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). More surprising was our result that increasing unsaturation of the background lipids also dramatically increased activities of complexes I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The effect of background lipids unsaturation is likely to be mediated largely by the adaptor arm, since VPS34 alone shows no activity on DO base (10% PS) lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), whereas complexes I and II on the same lipid mixture are active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity is important for early steps in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ogasawara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Köhler et al., 2009</xref>), and recent lipidomic analyses have shown that autophagic membranes of budding yeast contain as much as 60% lipids with two unsaturated fatty acyl moieties, and only 2% with no double bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schütter et al., 2020</xref>). The potent effect of lipid unsaturation on VPS34 complexes combined with the compartment-specific lipid unsaturation suggests an important means of modulating VPS34 activity on cellular organelles. The importance of lipid unsaturation for VPS34 activity is analogous to what was reported for another lipid kinase involved in the generating polyphosphoinositides. Increasing acyl chain unsaturation for substrate and non-substrate lipids in detergent micelles activates phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shulga et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The human VPS34 complexes were activated by increased membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which is consistent with results for the yeast complexes I and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rostislavleva et al., 2015</xref>) and human complexes I and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brier et al., 2019</xref>). An alternative possibility that cannot be excluded is that smaller GUVs incorporate more unsaturated lipid during their formation and hence are able to recruit the two complexes more efficiently. Membrane curvature causes tilting of lipids and decreased lipid packing, thereby opening hydrophobic cavities that can be sensed by protein motifs like the ALPS motif from complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vanni et al., 2014</xref>) and motifs from the BARA domain of both complexes I and II. Although the VPS34 complexes make protein/protein interactions that help localize them to specific lipid compartments, the preference for high curvature and lipid unsaturation may contribute to the lack of activity of these PI3K complexes at the PM, which is enriched with saturated lipids and has a lower curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</xref>). Rab5 is a primary determinant for recruiting complex II to early endosomes. Interestingly, like complex II, Rab5 has a preference for target membranes with high curvature and monounsaturated lipids, and this preference derives from the unsaturated prenyl lipids attached to Rab5 fitting into packing defects in the target membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kulakowski et al., 2018</xref>). Curvature and lipid packing are closely linked, consequently, the loss of VPS34 activity caused by tight lipid packing of saturated lipids can be counteracted by an increase in membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>As the third physicochemical parameter, we tested the effects of electrostatics on the activities of VPS34 complexes by increasing the concentration of phosphatidylserine (PS). PS is enriched on the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM) and endocytic vesicles mainly at recycling endosomes (RE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fairn et al., 2011</xref>). The PS on the cytosolic leaflet plays important roles in the regulation of endocytic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Uchida et al., 2011</xref>). We found that PS activates complexes I and II, and also VPS34 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). Significantly, GUVs with 25% PS enabled complex II to achieve the same activity as complex I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), whereas on membranes with 10% PS, complex I was much more active than complex II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The ability of high PS content to strongly activate complex II might contribute to complex II activity on early endosomes, which have more PS than the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hullin-Matsuda et al., 2014</xref>). It is reasonable to hypothesize that PS, together with Rab5, may contribute to activation of complex II on early endosomes. Increased PS in combination with high curvature and loosely packed lipids may contribute also to activation of complex I during autophagy. In cells, PS is synthesized by PS synthases (PSS) I and II at the ER-mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lagace and Ridgway, 2013</xref>). Upon starvation, complex I is recruited to the MAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamasaki et al., 2013</xref>). The PSS I co-localizes with FIP200, a member of autophagy-initiation complex, which is necessary for the recruitment of complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nishimura et al., 2017</xref>). ER membranes are enriched in loosely packed lipids, and the site of initiation of the phagophore is a highly curved structure known as an omegasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axe et al., 2008</xref>). This would provide an ideal platform to activate complex I. However, membrane properties alone would not explain the proclivity of complex I to provide PI3K activity in autophagy compared with complex II. Additional interactions could contribute to enrichment of complex I on autophagosomes. Recently, it was shown that the ATG14L BATS domain may be acting as a coincidence detector, using its ALPS motif to interact with membranes and its LIR motif to interact with autophagic GAPARAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birgisdottir et al., 2019</xref>). Along with the ULK1 complex, they may contribute to autophagosome-specific localization and activation.</p><p>Both the HDX-MS results and the mutational analyses suggest that complexes I and II have some complex-specific as well as common interactions with membranes. On GUVs made with DO base lipids, human complex I is considerably more active than complex II, which stands in contrast to our results for yeast VPS34 complexes, where complex II was more active than complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rostislavleva et al., 2015</xref>). The contrasting behaviour of human and yeast VPS34 complexes likely arises from extensive sequence differences between human and yeast Atg14, particularly in the region corresponding to the C-terminal BATS of ATG14L. The complex I BATS domain interaction with membranes is the most striking of the complex-specific membrane interactions in the human VPS34 complexes. The BATS dominates the complex I membrane interaction. When the BATS domain is deleted, almost all of complex I activity is eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, complex I binds to membranes more strongly than complex II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). Adding the BATS domain to either full-length UVRAG or a UVRAG fragment lacking the C-terminus dramatically increased complex II activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) and membrane binding <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). Our results suggest that the differences in activities for complexes I and II reflect a lower affinity of complex II for lipid vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). In cells, this weak membrane affinity of complex II may be compensated by its binding partners, such as Rab5, which help to recruit complex II to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christoforidis et al., 1999</xref>). Our results also show that the activities of complexes I and II become equalized on lipid vesicles with increased PS, and this is consistent with a previous report that complexes I and II have identical activities on LUVs formed with 50%PS and 50%PI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brier et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To our surprise, the ALPS deletion mutant showed even lower activity than VPS34 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting that the influence of the ATG14L subunit is intrinsically inhibitory, but that this inhibition is overcome by the much stronger membrane binding conferred by the BATS domain, resulting in an overall gain of function. A similar mechanism has been reported for the H-Ras-PI3Kα complex, where H-Ras binding is inhibitory for PI3Kα, but the inhibition is overcome by increased recruitment of PI3Kα to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buckles et al., 2017</xref>). The presence of the ATG14L subunit alters the interactions of the rest of the complex with membranes. This subunit appears to enhance the association of the VPS34 kinase domain with membranes (giving rise to protection of the kα1-kα2 region of VPS34; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It also alters the interaction of Beclin 1 with membranes, so that while the BARA domain AF1 motif has a role in membrane binding for both complexes, AF2 and HL motifs are important only for complex II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). However, in the context of the dominant role of the BATS domain on complex I activity, the influence of the Beclin 1 AF1 on activity is minor, and there is no significant influence of AF2 or HL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This is consistent with the previous report that mutation of AF1 only mildly affects the autophagosome generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). It may be that the BATS domain affects the orientation of complex I, so that AF2 and HL no longer interact with membranes. In contrast to complex I, complex II depends critically on AF1, AF2 and HL to enable its maximal activity on membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The yeast complex II activity also depends on AF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rostislavleva et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that the activation mechanisms of these two orthologous complexes are similar. The HL motif in the BARA domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) has S295 that can be phosphorylated by Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), which enhances interactions of Beclin 1 with 14-3-3 and vimentin intermediate filament proteins. On the other hand, the S295A mutation enhances autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). In cells, the S295 phosphorylation by Akt and/or interaction with 14-3-3 may negatively affect membrane binding of complexes I and II.</p><p>In addition to the AF1 motif in the Beclin 1 BARA domain, another region showing decreased HDX in both complexes I and II is the CC2/BARA linker of Beclin 1 (residues 262–274 in complex I and residues 262–270 in complex II). It was proposed that hydrophobic residues Phe270 and Phe274 in this linker interact with lipid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with this, mutation of Phe270 and Phe274 eliminated membrane binding and activity of complex II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2019</xref>). The somewhat distant position of these two residues from the putative membrane-binding surface marked by AF1, prompted the proposal that the adjacent BARA β1 and β2 strands become unlatched to allow Phe270/Phe274 to reach the membrane. Although these two hydrophobic residues were protected from HDX in the presence of lipid membranes in our studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), the peptides covering the β1-β2 of the BARA domain β-sheet 1 (residues 275–287, 276–294, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary files 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">5</xref>) did not show significant HDX changes. In addition, in yeast, membranes cause this region to increase in HDX (residues 312–327 in Vps30) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rostislavleva et al., 2015</xref>). Consequently, the question whether the CC2/BARA linker becomes more protected due to direct interaction with membranes or due to an indirect ordering in the presence of membranes remains an open question.</p><p>Both complexes I and II are activated by PI(4)P, This phosphoinositide is enriched on the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammond and Balla, 2015</xref>), early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henmi et al., 2016</xref>), and autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Judith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), where complexes I and II are activated. The coincidence of Rab5, PS, and PI(4)P at early endosomes might help to specifically enhance complex II activity on this compartment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Judith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Munson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sridhar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) We also found that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> modestly increases activity of complex I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). This could be mediated by binding of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to the ATG14L BATS domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, it was recently shown that PIPKIγi5, which phosphorylates PI(4)P to produce PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, binds to ATG14L and localizes to autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). Compared with the effects of the three membrane physicochemical parameters, phosphoinositides PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> have only modest effects <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Overall, our results uncovered the importance of lipid packing dictated by acyl chain unsaturation of both substrate and background lipids, negative charge, and membrane curvature for the activation of both complexes I and II. However, these complexes have unique cellular localization and HDX-MS analysis revealed differences in membrane binding modes between complexes I and II that are likely to contribute to their different roles.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The final concentrations of complex I, complex II or VPS34 alone are described in figures and their legends. The PX domain was used at the final concentration of 7 μM. Images were obtained every 2–3 min for 60–120 min. For the Z-stack analysis, the Z-Stack option was ticked in the Zen software. For the Z-Stack, slices were kept, and the first and last positions were manually set and 10 slices were acquired.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Images were opened with Fiji software using Bio-Formats importer plugin. For the time course analysis, partial or whole circles from GUV sections were selected using the ROI (region of interest) selection tool, and added to ROI manager. Fluorescence intensities were analyzed using a macro (GUV_intensity.ijm. See ‘Confocal microscopy macro’ section below). A baseline signal of the AF647 channel originating from unbound PX domain and small membrane particles or vesicles, was subtracted from all frames. To estimate this baseline, 10 regions without GUVs were selected and their intensity profile over time was obtained with the ImageJ command ‘Plot Z-axis Profile’. These 10 profiles were averaged together to obtain a single temporal baseline that was later subtracted from intensity measurement at the corresponding time points. Because this baseline signal appears earlier than the actual enzyme activity, negative values are typically generated in the lag phase just before the initial rate is achieved. In the case of the kinases with very weak or no activities (<italic>e.g.</italic>, for the BATS domain mutant and for VPS34 alone), the signal from the baseline is stronger than the signal accumulated on the GUVs, thereby resulting in negative values after baseline subtraction. The initial rate was calculated by carrying out linear regression with Prism7 (GraphPad Software) using the points in the region of the AF647-PX signal reaction progress curve that showed a linear increase. This region was located manually and typically started after a lag phase and before the plateau of the AF647-PX signal. For the radius <italic>versus</italic> fluorescence intensity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), whole GUV circular sections were selected using Oval selection tool and added to ROI manager, and analyzed using a macro (GUV_intensity1dimension.ijm). Ten random areas for baseline subtraction were selected using the ROI selection tool, and the mean values were subtracted from the actual fluorescence intensities. Results were further analyzed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft) and GraphPad Prism7 (GraphPad Software).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Expi293 suspension cells (ThermoFisher A14527) were grown at 37°C, 8% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 125 rpm shaking in Expi293 Expression Medium (ThermoFisher A1435102).

The LUVs and proteins were incubated on ice for 30 min. In the meantime, a sucrose gradient was prepared. Several sucrose solutions were layered from bottom to top in a Beckman centrifuge tube (343775 Thickwall Polycarbonate Tube): 40 μL 30% sucrose solution, 52 μL 25% sucrose solution, 52 μL 20% sucrose solution. Then 16 uL of the LUV/protein sample was carefully pipetted on top of the gradient without disturbing the layers. 2.5 μL of the remaining LUV/protein was kept as an input sample. The gradient was then centrifuged for 3 hr in a TLS-55 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 55,000 rpm and 4°C. Afterwards, 6 fractions of 26 μL were carefully collected from the top of the gradient.

Human complex II was purified in the same way as the complex I, except that the NaCl concentration is at 300 mM throughout the procedures. All complex I and complex II mutants were purified in the same conditions as the wild-type complexes. For the purification of human VPS34 alone, a plasmid (pSM41) was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> C41(DE3) RIPL cells. The transformed bacteria were cultured in 2xTY medium containing 0.1 mg/mL ampicillin at 37°C to an OD 600 of 0.8–1.0 and induced with 0.3 mM IPTG at 12°C for 15.5 hr. For a 4 L scale purification, cell pellets were resuspended in 100 mL of sonication buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche, 11873580001), 0.1 mg/mL DNaseI, and 50 mL BugBuster (Novogen 70584) and sonicated on ice for 3 min, which was repeated three times in total. Lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 <italic>g</italic> for 40 min at 4°C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter (Millipore, SE2M230I04), before being passed through two connected 5 mL Ni-NTA FF columns (GE Healthcare 17-5255-01). The bound protein was washed with 100 mL Ni A1 buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol), 100 mL Ni A2 buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol), and eluted with an imidazole gradient with about 80 mL of Ni B1 buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol). The N-terminal His6 tag was cleaved with TEV protease (made in house) and incubated overnight with gentle rocking at 4°C. On the next day, the protein was further purified on a 5 mL Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare 17040701) by first washing with 20 mL HA buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT) and then eluting with 100 mL HB buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM DTT, 1 M NaCl). The heparin peak fractions were pooled and brought to 100 mM NaNO<sub>3</sub> to prevent precipitation during concentration in a 30,000 MWCO Amicon Ultra15 concentrator (Millipore UFC903024). The final purification step was carried out on a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare, 17-1069-01) that was pre-equilibrated with running buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT). The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 5.2 mg/mL (51 μM). For the purification of human phox 40 (construct GST-TEV cleavage site-Cys-PX), a plasmid (pYO1125) was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> C41(DE3) RIPL cells. The transformed bacteria were cultured in 2xTY medium containing 0.1 mg/mL ampicillin at 37°C to an OD 600 of 0.6 and induced with 0.3 mM IPTG at 30°C for 16 hr. 6 L of cells were pelleted by 20 min centrifugation at 4,000 <italic>g</italic> and the pellets were resuspended in 150 mL lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 0.05 μL/mL universal nuclease (ThermoFisher, 88702), 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme (MP Biomedicals, 195303)). The cells were sonicated 6 min on ice (10 s on/10 s off, 60% amplitude), and the lysates were spun at 30,000 <italic>g</italic> for 45 min at 4°C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter (Millipore, SE2M230I04), and an aliquot of 2.5 mL of washed Glutathione Sepharose beads was added (Glutathione Sepharose 4B, GE Healthcare 17-0756-05). The lysate was incubated on the beads for 45 min with gentle rolling at 6 rpm at 4°C. The beads were then transferred to a gravity flow column (Bio-Rad, 731–1550) and washed with 100 mL lysis buffer, 100 mL wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP) and 100 mL TEV buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP). The N-terminal GST tag was cleaved with TEV protease and incubated overnight with gentle rocking at 4°C. Next day, elution fractions were collected and concentrated in a 10,000 MWCO Amicon Ultra15 concentrator (Millipore, UFC901024). The concentrated protein was loaded onto a Superdex 75 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare 17-1068-01) and gel filtration was carried out in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP.

For the final labeling reaction 250 μM PX, 2.5 mM TCEP, 385 μM AF647 dye was mixed with labeling buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 200 mM KCl) to a total volume of 1 mL, and the reaction was left for 2 hr at room temperature on a roller at 10 rpm. After the incubation, 1 mM of DTT was added and the protein was loaded on a 5 mL Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare 17040701). The column was first washed with HA buffer (50 mM HEPES PH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP) and then eluted with HB buffer (50 mM HEPES PH 8.0, 1 M KCl, 1 mM TCEP).

An aliquot of 5 μL of this stock solution was mixed with 45 μL of D2O Buffer [consisting of 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 1 mg/mL LUVs (added from a 5 mg/mL LUV stock in LUV Buffer) and 74.6% D2O (Acros Organics)] for a defined period of time at 23°C. In the lipid-free experiments, the solution contained LUV Buffer instead of LUVs. The exchange reaction was quenched using 20 μL of ice cold 5 M guanidinium chloride and 8.4% Formic Acid, pH 1. The final pH of the sample was 2.2. Five time-points were produced (0.3/3/30/300/3000 s), with each exchange reaction executed in triplicate. The 0.3 s time point was obtained by carrying out an exchange for 3 s at 4°C, instead of 23°C.

Peptides were identified from three non-deuterated samples for complex I and for complex II. Deuterated peptides were analysed using DynamX 3.0 software (Waters, U.K.). Peptide inclusion criteria was a minimum intensity of 5000, a minimum sequence length of 5 amino acids, a minimum of 0.1 products per amino acid, a maximum MH+ error of 5 ppm, and a positive identification meeting these criteria in at least 2 of the three non-deuterated files. An initial automated spectral processing step was conducted by DynamX followed by a manual inspection of individual peptides for sufficient quality.

Measurements were performed using a Wyatt Heleos II 18 angle light scattering instrument coupled to a Wyatt Optilab rEX online refractive index detector. Samples for analysis (human complex I at 1 mg/mL) and complex II (0.8 mg/mL) were resolved on a Superose 6 10/300 analytical gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) coupled to an Agilent 1200 series LC system running at 0.5 mL/min before then passing through the light scattering and refractive index detectors in a standard SEC-MALS format. Protein concentration was determined from the excess differential refractive index based on 0.186 ∆RI for 1 g/mL or with the sequence based UV extinction coefficient determined in ProtParam. The measured protein concentration and scattering intensity were used to calculate molecular mass from the intercept of a Debye plot using Zimm’s model as implemented in the Wyatt ASTRA software.</p><p>The experimental setup was verified using a BSA standard run with the same sample volume. The monomer peak was used to check mass determination and to evaluate interdetector delay volumes and band broadening parameters that were subsequently applied during analysis of complexes I and II.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Confocal microscopy macro</title><p>The mean intensity for each label on the GUVs' membranes was extracted using a custom ImageJ macro. The rings corresponding to the 2D section of the GUVs were segmented by applying a threshold to the response of a difference of a Gaussian filter applied for each channel and at each time point. The logical union of the masks of the two segmented channels was then computed in order to obtain a unique mask for each time point. After smoothing, the inner part of the rings was filled and an internal morphological gradient provided the contours of the GUVs with a calibrated thickness. Finally, the membrane of the GUVs are obtained as the intersection of these thick contours and the original segmentation, allowing to discard any potential spurious signal within the GUVs. Within a set of manually selected regions of interest, the mean intensities of the signal in the segmented membranes for each channels and time points were recorded and assigned to the corresponding region thus circumventing the problem of tracking possibly complex regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Lipid mixtures</title><p>All GUV and LUV lipid mixtures are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Plasmids</title><p>All plasmids are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Aurélien Roux and Annika Hohendahl (University of Geneva) for help with assay development.

We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the group of Roger L. Williams performed an extensive biochemical characterization of two PI3K kinase complexes, I and II, which both include the same VPS-34 catalytic core but have different regulatory units that confer them different avidity for membrane-bound organelles. Complex I, which contains ATG14L, is involved in autophagy whereas Complex II, which contains the subunit UVRAG, is involved in endocytosis. The experimental strategy used here is novel, and allows the authors to address membrane physical parameters important for complex I and/or complex II activity and membrane recruitment in a quite extensive and exquisite manner. They use giant unilameller vesicles incubated with a fluorescent PX domain that is specifically recruited by PI3P, the product of the PI3 kinase activity of the two complexes. Because liposome binding of this fluorescent reporter is weakly affected by bulk membrane parameters, the PX domain is a fair reporter of PI3P production and enables real time measurements at the GUV surface. The authors reported very large changes in complex I and/or complex II activity by changing lipid membrane unsaturation, curvature or overall electrostatics. However, the two complexes do not respond in the same manner to these parameters, suggesting interesting hypothesis for their differential localization and activation in cells. Technically, this is a superb study. The effects are large and confirmed by different independent analysis procedures (e.g. GUV imaging vs LUV flotation). The rationale is thorough and easy to follow. The Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry experiments are very informative. Conceptually, some findings were expected, but the work provides a clear-cut demonstration of the importance of membrane physical parameters in the activation of these kinases.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A general concern is in the physiological significance of the results. Is it possible to use lipids compositions similar to the ER for complex I and endosomes for complex II to validate some of the key conclusions (especially the effect of BATS domain and BARA domain)? Alternatively, is it possible to perform some experiments in the presence of Rab5-GTP attached to GUVs by a hisx6 tag? (using Ni-NTA lipids). It would be interesting to see if complex II in the presence of Rab5 can reach the same activity as complex I in the absence of Rab5-GTP but with an optimal lipid composition (e.g. unsaturation, curvature).</p><p>2) Another concern (which is probably a semantic) is how and whether the authors can differentiate between &quot;activity&quot; (in the sense of actual enzymatic activity of the protein) and &quot;binding affinity&quot; (that is, the amount of proteins recruited per unit area to a GUV. Particularly, the authors write &quot;This indicates that complex I is more active than complex II because complex I binds membranes more tightly than complex II.&quot;. Is the measured increase in PI3P amounts solely based on increased fraction of the kinase present in those GUVs? Or the lipid microenvironment where the kinase sits also influences its intrinsic enzymatic activity? Protein binding experiments are shown only in Figure 1D. It would have been interesting to have such parallel experiments for the other lipid compositions (especially in Figure 3), but this is not something we expect in the revision. In any case, the authors should explain well what their conclusions are actually showing (binding/activity or a combination of both).</p><p>3) The last set of experiments using PI(4)P or PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> GUVs show very modest effects of these lipids. However, the authors interpret these experiments in a rather exaggerated manner. It seems that these experiments simply show that complex I and II are not sensitive to these phosphoinositides.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58281.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A general concern is in the physiological significance of the results.

Unfortunately, determining an accurate lipid composition of a cellular compartment is a greatly needed, evolving area of study that is progressing in development of better methods of isolating compartments and improved MS techniques for analysing lipid populations. As described at the beginning of the section “Human complex I is more active than complex II” in the Results, our base lipid composition is similar to ER membranes. We chose this because ER membranes are interconnected to all organelles including endosomes, and lipids are shuttled between the ER and other compartments (Prinz et al., 2020). It is believed that early endosomes share a similar lipid composition with the plasma membrane, since they are both part of the same recycling pathway (Bissig and Gruenberg, 2013). Like the plasma membrane, early endosomes are rich in cholesterol and sphingomyelin (Arumugam and Kaur, 2017; Kobayashi et al., 2002). Therefore, in the revised manuscript we present the activities of complexes I and II when the initial composition is enriched with 10% cholesterol and 10% sphingomyelin (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript). This revealed that even with this composition, complex I remains more active than complex II. While this early endosome mimic did not make complex II have equal activity to complex I, we know that the lipid composition can affect the relative activities of the two complexes, as we showed in Figure 4G for 25% PS-containing GUVs where the activities are equal. Although this is an unrealistic PS content for early endosomes, it is likely that the higher PS content of early endosomes along with Rab5 will favour complex II activity. We have described the results of our cholesterol/sphingomyelin assays in the same section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>The BATS experiments in Figure 7, and the BARA experiments for complexes I and II in Figure 8 were performed on the ER-mimicking DO base lipid GUVs, where it is physiologically relevant for the BATS domain of complex I. Regarding the complex II experiments for the BARA characterisation, the effects of the aromatic finger 1 mutation on activity and membrane binding have been reported using several different lipid compositions and sizes (Chang et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2012; Rostislavleva et al., 2015), indicating that the importance of the mutations are relevant for a range of lipid compositions.</p><p>Although determining the influence of Rab5 is very important, and indeed it is one of our future objectives, this will measure the effect of Rab5 on the complexes, rather than the effect of lipid properties on them. Therefore we feel this is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another concern (which is probably a semantic) is how and whether the authors can differentiate between &quot;activity&quot; (in the sense of actual enzymatic activity of the protein) and &quot;binding affinity&quot; (that is, the amount of proteins recruited per unit area to a GUV.

We have clarified our writing to distinguish that what we are generally measuring is activity. Increased membrane binding is one possible mechanism of increasing activity. We have restated our interpretation of Figure 1 in the section of the results “Human complex I is more active than complex II” and in the Results section “The ATG14L BATS domain is critical for the activity of complex I on membranes”, describing Figure 7. For the other figures we believe that we had stated what the results are showing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The last set of experiments using PI(4)P or PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> GUVs show very modest effects of these lipids.

The effects of the polyphosphoinositides are less substantial, however, they may be more dynamic. The polyphosphoinositides are, in general, minor components of lipids, but the rapidly respond to signalling. We have revised and simplified this in the Discussion section in the paragraph before the last paragraph. We have also modified the Results section “Phosphoinositides have modest effects on activities of complexes I and II”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
