The highly conserved stress hormone response influences many brain regions, particularly the hippocampus, a region important for memory function. The effect of acute stress on the unique population of adult neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) that resides in the adult hippocampus is unclear. We found that acute stress increased hippocampal cell proliferation and astrocytic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression. The effect of acute stress occurred independent of basolateral amygdala neural input and was mimicked by treating isolated NPCs with conditioned media from corticosterone-treated primary astrocytes. Neutralization of FGF2 revealed that astrocyte-secreted FGF2 mediated stress-hormone-induced NPC proliferation. 2 weeks, but not 2 days, after acute stress, rats also showed enhanced fear extinction memory coincident with enhanced activation of newborn neurons. Our findings suggest a beneficial role for brief stress on the hippocampus and improve understanding of the adaptive capacity of the brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00362.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00362.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00362.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A little stress can be good for you. Just over 100 years ago, psychologists Robert Yerkes and John Dodson suggested that cognitive performance improves as stress increases, although it falls off again if stress levels continue to rise. The hippocampus is a key brain region for both memory and the regulation of emotion, and is highly sensitive to the main class of stress hormones, glucocorticoids. One particular subregion of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, contains a high density of glucocorticoid receptors, and is also notable for being one of only two regions in the adult mammalian brain that can give rise to new neurons via a process called neurogenesis.</p><p>Chronic stress is known to impair memory and to reduce neurogenesis. However, the effects of acute stress are less clear-cut: early studies suggested that it suppressed the generation of new neurons, whereas several recent studies have observed no effect. Other work has shown that acute stress increases the expression of growth factors—substances that stimulate cellular growth and proliferation—which would seem to suggest that stress could enhance neurogenesis.</p><p>Now Kirby et al. have obtained further insights into the effects of acute stress on the proliferation of cells in the dentate gyrus. Exposing rats to a moderate acute stressor, namely being restrained for a few hours, led to increased neurogenesis in the dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampus. Injecting rats with the stress hormone corticosterone had the same effect. In both cases, the enhanced neurogenesis was accompanied by increased expression of a growth factor called FGF2, which is produced by glial cells called astrocytes.</p><p>Intriguingly, Kirby and co-workers found that the stressed rats performed better than control animals in a memory test. Moreover, the beneficial effects were seen if the rats performed the task 2 weeks after their stressful experience, but not if they performed the task 2 days after being stressed. This is pertinent because new neurons in the dentate gyrus become functional 2 weeks after being generated, which suggests that the stress-induced increase in neurogenesis could account for the rats' improved memory.</p><p>The work of Kirby and co-workers has thus identified a mechanism by which moderate acute stress could have beneficial effects on cognition. Given that acute stress can be harmful in other instances—leading, for example, to post-traumatic stress disorder—further work is required to identify the factors that determine whether a response to stress is adaptive or pathological.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00362.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00362.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>FGF2</kwd><kwd>astrocyte</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Mental Health, Biobehavioral Research Awards for Innovative New Scientists (NIMH BRAINS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH087495</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaufer</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD) Young Investigator Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS066005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaufer</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Exposing rats to acute stress increased the generation of new neurons in a subregion of the hippocampus, and improved the animals' performance in a memory task two weeks later.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stress is a powerful and essential mediator of mammalian behavior. Proper response to a perceived stressor facilitates survival at the individual level and species propagation at the population level. Despite this necessity, stress responses can become maladaptive. Chronic stress, for example, leads to a host of adverse health consequences, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, and exacerbation of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McEwen, 2004</xref>). Acute stress, defined as a single exposure on the scale of minutes to hours without cycles of recovery and re-exposure, has proven more enigmatic.</p><p>One model of stress effects on the brain, an inverted U function, explains the variable consequences of acute stress for brain health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lupien and McEwen, 1997</xref>). In this model, while severe or prolonged stressors are detrimental, brief or moderate stressors actually enhance neural function. Behavioral studies focusing on the memory functions of the hippocampus have demonstrated such a relationship in rodents, where moderate stress enhances memory performance yet more severe stress impairs it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conrad et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The hippocampus is exquisitely sensitive to stress and the primary stress hormone class, glucocorticoids (GCs). Within the dentate gyrus (DG) sub-region, in particular, there exists a high density of GC receptors that respond to elevated circulating GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Kloet et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, the DG is strongly connected via the entorhinal cortex and medial septum to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain region involved in emotional processing and an important mediator of many stress effects on the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGaugh, 2004</xref>). Both of these mediators of stress (GCs and BLA input) have been shown to regulate the unique population of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) that reside in the adult DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kirby and Kaufer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kirby et al., 2012b</xref>).</p><p>Dentate NPCs proliferate and give rise to new neurons throughout the lifespan in several mammalian species, including rats, mice and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrous et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kirby and Kaufer, 2009</xref>). They become electrophysiologically active, integrate into local circuitry, play important modulatory roles in hippocampal memory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrous et al., 2005</xref>) and can respond to stress and stress hormones at multiple phases of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kirby and Kaufer, 2009</xref>). Moreover, recent work indicates that newborn, immature neurons integrate multiple signals more readily than mature neurons and that they have enhanced excitability, possibly contributing to a disproportionately large role in new memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marín-Burgin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies show that chronic stress, in addition to impairing memory function, suppresses proliferation, survival and differentiation of new neurons in the adult DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wong and Herbert, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mirescu and Gould, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kirby and Kaufer, 2009</xref>). The effect of acute stress on neurogenesis, however, is unclear. While early work indicated suppression of proliferation following acute stress or GC injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cameron and Gould, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gould et al., 1997</xref>), subsequent studies have yielded mixed results, often reporting no change in proliferation following a variety of acute stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thomas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dagyte et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanson et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, investigations of hippocampal growth factor secretion have shown that acute stress enhances expression of mitogenic growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) and nerve growth factor (NGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mocchetti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Molteni et al., 2001</xref>), implying a potential for increased neurogenesis following acute stress. Indeed, a number of interventions that stimulate GC release such as acute exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kronenberg et al., 2006</xref>) and acute sexual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leuner et al., 2010</xref>) actually increase neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. Combined, these studies suggest that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may follow an inverted U function similar to hippocampal memory—decreasing following chronic stress yet increasing in response to acute stressors.</p><p>We examined the effect of several forms of acute stress on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, seeking to resolve the contradictory evidence for enhanced vs impaired hippocampal plasticity. We found that acute stress or corticosterone (CORT, the primary rat GC) administration increased dorsal but not ventral hippocampus cell proliferation in adult rats. This increase was not dependent on input from the BLA and was accompanied by an increase in FGF2 expression in dorsal hippocampal astrocytes. Furthermore, we show that astrocyte-secreted FGF2 is necessary for CORT-induced enhancement in NPC proliferation in vitro. 2 weeks after acute stress, when newborn neurons are first becoming functional, we also find enhancement in hippocampus-dependent memory accompanied by enhanced activation of newborn neurons. These findings have important implications for understanding regulation of hippocampal plasticity in the face of environmental challenge and in distinguishing adaptive vs pathological stress responses. Moreover, they suggest that stress effects on adult neurogenesis may follow an inverted U function similar to that already demonstrated for hippocampal memory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lupien and McEwen, 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Acute stress increases dorsal hippocampus NPC proliferation</title><p>To investigate the effect of acute stress on adult neurogenesis in the DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we chose three common models of acute stress in rodents: 30 min novel environment, 30 min footshock or 3 hr immobilization. Rats were handled for 5 days prior to stress exposure then perfused 3 hr after the beginning of the stressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Immobilization stress significantly increased the number of cells immunopositive for the proliferation marker Ki67 in the dorsal DG 3.23-fold above control (27.51 ± 2.74 control vs 88.99 ± 12.49 immob) while novel environment or footshock did not significantly alter Ki67+ count compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Plasma CORT was significantly elevated above control levels both 30 min and 3 hr after stressor initiation in immobilized rats but not in novel environment- or footshock-exposed rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This finding suggested that an increase in CORT might underlie the immobilization-induced increase in DG proliferation. To test that hypothesis, we next habituated handled rats to daily oil injections for 3 days, injected them with exogenous CORT (0, 5 or 40 mg/kg body weight) and assessed cell proliferation 3 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). 40 mg/kg CORT significantly increased the number of Ki67+ proliferative cells in the dorsal DG 1.92-fold above oil-injected controls (26.19 ± 2.83 0 mg/kg CORT vs 50.29 ± 7.74 40 mg/kg CORT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). Plasma CORT levels were also consistently elevated 30 min and 3 hr after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), similar to the levels seen in immobilized rats. Notably, injection of 5 mg/kg CORT yielded similar plasma CORT levels to footshock (approximately 119 and 121 ng/ml, respectively) and also did not produce an increase in the numbers of Ki67+ cells. If rats were not habituated to injection, no difference in cell proliferation was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J,K</xref>). We next assessed short-term survival of newly-born cells following acute stress. 3 hr after the start of immobilization or CORT injection, rats were injected with the proliferative marker 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) then perfused 24 hr later. Both immobilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,I</xref>) and 40 mg/kg CORT injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>) significantly increased the number of cells immunopositive for BrdU surviving 24 hr after termination of the stressor in the dorsal DG by 1.92 and 1.48-fold, respectively (34.88 ± 8.70 control vs 68.96 ± 10.23 immob; 39.80 ± 6.89 0 mg/kg CORT vs 58.95 mg/kg CORT).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00362.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dorsal versus ventral DG.</title><p>Areas of dorsal (<bold>A</bold>) and ventral (<bold>B</bold>) dentate gyrus used for cell proliferation quantification are highlighted in red.

This was accomplished by quantifying the response of isolated adult rat hippocampal NPCs grown in vitro (as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gage, 2000</xref>) to acute CORT exposure. NPCs were FGF2 deprived for 24 hr then treated with 1 μM CORT (equivalent to approximately 350 ng/ml, the level measured in plasma of immobilized rats) or EtOH vehicle in either high (20 ng/ml) or low (0 ng/ml) FGF2. After 3 hr, BrdU was added to the cells and they were fixed 2 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Cultured rat hippocampal NPCs depend on FGF2 signaling for proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chipperfield et al., 2002</xref>). We found that while high FGF2 increased the percentage of proliferating BrdU+ NPCs over low FGF2 (1.21-fold in EtOH, 1.48-fold in 1 μM CORT), exposure to CORT did not affect the percent of proliferative cells in either high or low FGF2 media as compared to vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These data indicate that NPCs do not respond to acute CORT in isolation, but likely rely on input from another cell type in the neurogenic niche. A growing body of work indicates that astrocytes can strongly regulate NPC dynamics through secreted factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Song et al., 2002</xref>), so we next tested whether astrocytes might participate in the regulation of NPCs in response to CORT.

Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forget et al., 2006</xref>), media from untreated astrocytes showed no detectable FGF2 (0.12 ± 0.46 pg/ml). In contrast, astrocytes treated with 1 μM CORT for 3 hr secreted 3.5 ± 0.68 pg/ml FGF2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). We next tested whether levels of FGF2 as low as 4 pg/ml were sufficient to stimulate NPC proliferation. Treating with 4 pg/ml rat recombinant FGF2 caused a significant 1.39-fold increase in BrdU labeling compared to vehicle (0 pg/ml FGF2), suggesting that the levels of FGF2 present in CORT-ACM were sufficient to stimulate NPC proliferation (11.95 ± 1.22% BrdU+, 0 pg/ml; 16.65 ± 1.72% BrdU+, 4 pg/ml, p=0.04). We next investigated whether blocking FGF2 function could prevent acute stress-induced enhancement of NPC proliferation using a neutralizing antibody against FGF2 (nAb). An ELISA for rat FGF2 revealed that the nAb decreased available FGF2 over a wide range of concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The nAb did not, however, affect the availability of FGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), a closely related member of the FGF family. When tested in vitro, we found that FGF2 neutralization blocked FGF2-induced stimulation of NPC proliferation without affecting proliferation in FGF2-free conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). These findings suggest that the nAb blocks FGF2 signaling specifically and does not have nonspecific toxic effects on NPC growth. We then pretreated ACM from EtOH- or CORT-treated astrocytes with FGF2 nAb before exposing NPCs to the treated media.

Immobilized and control rats were given 10 unsignaled, 1 s, 1 mA shocks in a fear conditioning chamber. The next day, they received five 10 min extinction trials where they were exposed to the fear conditioning chamber without shock.

This increase in proliferation is correlated with selective activation of the hyper-plastic newborn neurons and enhanced retention of fear extinction 2 weeks after the stressor. Taken together, these findings suggest a beneficial role for acute stress on hippocampal plasticity. Consistent with our findings, previous studies using similar stress paradigms show stress-induced enhancements in memory consolidation and growth factor expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roozendaal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Molteni et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roozendaal et al., 2009b</xref>). Acute stress may also support hippocampal LTP, another factor implicated in stimulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korz and Frey, 2005</xref>). Notably, other manipulations that increase stress hormone secretion, such as exercise, sexual experience and mild immune challenge, similarly stimulate adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kronenberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wolf et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leuner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buwalda et al., 2012</xref>). Recent work in adult squirrel monkeys also shows that coping with intermittent social stress through multiple pair separations and new pair formations both stimulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis and improves hippocampal memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lyons et al., 2010</xref>). These studies, along with our findings, evoke the interesting possibility that acute stress may be beneficial for brain health in general and hippocampal plasticity in particular.</p><p>Previous studies of adult NPC response to acute stress have yielded mixed results. While some initial work suggested that acute stress causes a decrease in NPC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cameron and Gould, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gould et al., 1997</xref>), more recent publications have not replicated these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thomas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dagyte et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanson et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, while we found that acute CORT enhanced proliferation in well-handled, habituated rats, we did not find any effect of acute CORT on neurogenesis in rats that were not habituated to injection. Our findings therefore demonstrate that factors present before the stressor begins may alter the effect of acute stress, perhaps by changing the susceptibility of controls or stressed animals to manipulation. Not surprisingly, a rich literature exists regarding the role of handling on altering the rodent stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korosi and Baram, 2010</xref>). Such experimental differences could explain discrepancies in the literature.</p><p>Previous research concerning the long-term effects of acute stress in rodents focuses primarily on models of traumatic stress and the resultant PTSD-like symptoms. Most prominently, the single prolonged stress model of PTSD uses three acute stressors in series (restraint, forced swim and ether) and results in delayed deficits in fear extinction, as well as enhanced anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knox et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2012b</xref>). However, if any one of the three components of this stressor protocol are eliminated, deficits are no longer evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knox et al., 2012a</xref>), suggesting that stressor effects depend on the severity and length of the stressor, perhaps following the inverted U function previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lupien and McEwen, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Previous work in primates has provided additional evidence for an inverted U relationship between stress and neural function. In multiple non-human primate species, for example, mild early life stress can lead to resilience against stress later in life, a phenomenon referred to as stress inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lyons and Parker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker and Maestripiero, 2011</xref>). In contrast, more severe early life stress can have the opposite outcome, increasing stress vulnerability later in adulthood. When combined with our current findings, these studies fit well with the proposed inverted U function for stress effects on brain health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lupien and McEwen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salehi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luksys and Sandi, 2011</xref>). At high, traumatic levels, acute stress may result in maladaptive pathology (e.g., PTSD-like symptoms in the single prolonged stress model). At more moderate levels, though, such as immobilization in well-handled rats, acute stress may actually enhance function. Future research will be needed to more precisely define the limits of stimulating vs detrimental acute stress.</p><p>Many acute-stress-induced changes in hippocampal plasticity rely on functional input from the BLA. For example, while stress enhances hippocampal memory consolidation and LTP, lesion of the BLA blocks these enhancements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quirarte et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roozendaal et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2009b</xref>). We have recently reported that hippocampal cell proliferation and the activation of the newborn neurons in a fear-conditioning paradigm both depend on BLA neural input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kirby et al., 2012b</xref>). In the current study, we found that while BLA lesion suppressed hippocampal cell proliferation as we have shown before, it did not affect the acute stress-induced increase in neurogenesis. These findings imply that acute stress regulation of neurogenesis may not rely on the same systems-level in vivo circuitry that mediates acute stress regulation of memory consolidation and LTP. In support of this hypothesis, we were able to model CORT-induced NPC proliferation in isolated NPCs. We found that while NPCs did not respond to acute CORT treatment independently in vitro, they did proliferate more in response to conditioned media from CORT-treated primary astrocytes, suggesting a role for secreted factors from local astrocytes in mediating stress effects on NPCs.</p><p>The dynamic role of astrocytes in facilitating neuronal function through secreted factors has gained much recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eroglu and Barres, 2010</xref>). In addition to aiding in synaptic glutamate recycling, astrocytes secrete several factors such as thrombospondins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eroglu and Barres, 2010</xref>), Hevin, SPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kucukdereli et al., 2011</xref>) and glypicans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2012</xref>) that regulate synaptic formation and function in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eroglu and Barres, 2010</xref>). Astrocytes express the glucocorticoid receptor, GR, and when they are exposed to high levels of GCs, GC-bound GR translocates to the nucleus and enhances FGF2 gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Molteni et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gubba et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Unemura et al., 2012</xref>). FGF2 is a potent and necessary proliferative factor in adult NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chipperfield et al., 2002</xref>). We found that acute stress stimulated FGF2 expression in the dorsal hippocampus and in primary hippocampal astrocytes. We further showed that in the DG and hilus, the enhancement in FGF2 levels following stress is largely restricted to GFAP+ astrocytes. Notably, changes in FGF2 protein levels following acute stress closely paralleled the neurogenic response; that is, FGF2 levels were increased only in stress conditions that also stimulated neurogenesis. Neutralizing the astrocyte-secreted FGF2 prevented enhanced proliferation in cultured NPCs. These findings suggest a novel role for astrocytes in supporting hippocampal plasticity in response to an environmental stressor through secreted FGF2. Further research will be required to fully dissect the molecular mechanisms by which stress induces FGF2 secretion from astrocytes.</p><p>Newly-born neurons are implicated in numerous hippocampal memory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aimone et al., 2010</xref>), particularly contextual fear conditioning. Contextual fear conditioning activates immature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kirby et al., 2012b</xref>) and when new neurons are selectively knocked down, fear extinction is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stone et al., 2010</xref>). Sahay et al. have further shown that prolonging survival of newly-born neurons through targeted knockdown of apoptotic pathways enhances discrimination between similar contexts in a fear conditioning task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sahay et al., 2011</xref>). We found that 2 weeks, but not 2 days, after acute stress, immobilized rats showed enhanced contextual fear extinction retention compared to controls. We also found that immobilized rats had greater activation of newly born neurons in response to fear extinction recall. This time window coincides with the period in which the newborn cells are hyper-plastic and more likely to be recruited to active circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kirby et al., 2012b</xref>). Given that immobilized rats had a similar number of newborn neurons as controls, these data suggest that immobilized rats better utilize the pool of immature neurons, possibly contributing to their enhanced memory. However, this connection does not preclude the potential contribution of other aspects of hippocampal plasticity to the enhanced memory. Future research will be necessary to fully determine the role of immature neurons vs existing circuitry in enhancement of hippocampal memory.</p><p>A recent hypothesis posits that the dorsal and ventral hippocampus support different behavioral functions, with the dorsal region being important for spatial and declarative memory while the ventral region facilitates affective regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>). This division may also apply to neural stem cell regulation within the DG of each region where chronic stress preferentially effects the ventral over the dorsal hippocampus, perhaps reflecting the negative affective consequences of chronic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanti et al., 2012</xref>). In the present study, we found that acute stress or stress hormone exposure increased neurogenesis and FGF2 expression in the dorsal, but not in the ventral, hippocampus. Moreover, the memory benefits observed 2 weeks after stress were in contextual fear extinction, a task that relies on the kind of spatial memory hypothesized to depend on the dorsal DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>). This selective involvement of the dorsal hippocampus implies that our acute stressor model functions as a cognitive stimulant for the declarative domains of hippocampal function rather than as a modulator of emotional responsivity.</p><p>The brain's response to acute stress can define the line between life-saving adaptation and long-term pathology. The current study suggests that moderate, acute stress may stimulate heightened brain plasticity via increased neurogenesis. These findings have important implications for understanding adaptive vs pathological responses to stress.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River) were pair-housed on a 12 hr light dark cycle with lights on at 07:00 hr.

We measured FGF2 expression in astrocytes using double immunohistochemical labeling for FGF2 protein and the astrocyte marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), in fixed hippocampal tissue sections from rats described in Figure 2 (con, immob, 0 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg CORT), all perfused 3 hr after immobilization or injection, as appropriate.</p><p>Consistent with previous reports [1], FGF2-immunoreactive cells were found throughout the DG and the hilus, with staining primarily in the cell body and nucleus. Z-stacks of the dentate gyrus and hilus were acquired using confocal microscopy, and used to identify GFAP+ vs GFAP- cells. The dentate gyrus is primarily composed of dentate granule neurons and while almost every cell expressed FGF2, we found very few GFAP+ cells within the DG, as expected. Given the ubiquitous and closely-packed FGF2 immunoreactivity in the DG, we had to measure mean optical density (with background correction) throughout the Z-stack of FGF2 expression in the DG (rather than in individual cells). No effect of stress or CORT injection on DG FGF2 expression was found using this measure.</p><p>In contrast, in the hilus, we could clearly identify and measure individual GFAP+ (and GFAP-) cells. Almost all GFAP+ cells were FGF2+. Given the mixed cell population but ubiquitous presence of FGF2 in GFAP+ cells, we measured integrated optical density of individual FGF2+ cells that were either GFAP+ or GFAP-. We found increased FGF2 signal in GFAP+ but not GFAP- cells in the hilus following both immobilization and 40 mg/kg CORT injection. These findings suggest that the FGF2 increase seen in whole hippocampal lysates by real time quantitative PCR and western blot (Figure 6) are most likely due to astrocytic FGF2 secretion. Moreover, while other cell types in other hippocampal subregions not quantified here could contribute to overall changes in FGF2, the DG and hilus are the regions flanking the neurogenic niche in the subgranular zone, and are therefore the most likely sources of growth factor changes that influence neurogenesis. These data are presented in the Results section following the section describing Figure 6. The relevant methods have also been added to the Materials and methods section where appropriate.</p><p><italic>4) A related concern is the certainty that no other members of the FGF family are involved. Is the FGF2 blocking antibody specific to that form</italic>?</p><p>Of all the 23 members of the FGF family, FGF2 is the most potent growth factor for NPCs [2]. It is also one of the few FGFs known to be predominantly secreted by astrocytes (as opposed to neurons) [2] in the adult CNS. However, FGF1 has been reported to both stimulate NPCs [3] and be secreted from adult CNS astrocytes [4]. Previous work using the FGF2 nAb that we used in the present studies confirm that the nAb does not cross react with bovine or human FGF1 [5–7]. To confirm that the nAb does not neutralize rat FGF1, we performed ELISAs with either rat FGF2 or rat FGF1 and compared standard curves of protein dilutions with or without preincubation with the nAb. We found that while FGF2 was significantly neutralized at all concentrations tested, FGF1 availability in the assay was not significantly affected by the nAb. These data are now presented in Figure 9B,C. Given these specificity data and the prominent, nearly exclusive role of FGF2 in adult NPC proliferation, we feel relatively confident that the effects of this FGF2 nAb are specific to FGF2 neutralization in these studies.</p><p><italic>5) In addition, can you show actual levels of FGF2 present rather than relative levels, and is any FGF2 released from untreated astrocyte cultures (an important question since untreated ACM has no effect on NPC proliferation)</italic>?</p><p>The FGF2 levels are now expressed in pg/ml from a rat FGF2 ELISA. Consistent with previous work, when astrocytes were only exposed to vehicle, FGF2 levels were similar to blank, suggesting very low basal secretion of FGF2 [8]. However, when treated with 1 μM CORT, FGF2 was found in the media at 3.5 pg/ml on average (Figure 9A). To confirm that FGF2 at concentrations in this range were sufficient to stimulate NPC proliferation, we treated adult rat NPCs with 0 and 4 pg/ml rat recombinant FGF2 for 3h, pulsed with BrdU and then fixed the cells 2h later (design in Figure 5A). We found that as little as 4 pg/ml rat rFGF2 increased the percent of BrdU+ NPCs (reported in the text of the results section for Figure 9). These data demonstrate that the levels of FGF2 found in ACM after CORT stimulation are sufficient to enhance NPC proliferation.</p><p><italic>6) The fear extinction data are interesting, but they feel like they belong in a different paper</italic>.</p><p>Though the fear extinction data do represent a departure from the mechanistic data focusing on time points close to the stressor, we feel that including these data, and in particular the new neuron activation findings, are important to the behavioral relevance of the rest of the manuscript. Adult NPCs require 2–4 weeks to mature and become physiologically active in the adult rat [9]. Therefore, the relevance of an enhancement in proliferation immediately after stress is questionable without some longer-term effects. Since we do not see more new neurons persisting in immobilized rats two weeks after the stressor (Figure 10G,H), it might seem that the effect of acute stress does not have any functional output.</p><p>However, our finding that the neurons that have survived over the two weeks activate more in response to fear extinction in immob than control rats, and that these rats have a coincident behavioral memory benefit that does not appear at earlier time points, strongly suggests that the enhanced neurogenic potential of the hippocampus, following acute stress, has important behavioral relevance. Including behavioral and neuron activation data such as this is a common practice in the adult neurogenesis literature [10–12]. We therefore request to keep these data in the manuscript as we feel many researchers in the adult neurogenesis field will find them helpful in interpreting our data and integrating it into their understanding of how both stress and adult neurogenesis relate to memory and hippocampal function. We have added some additional explanation to the Figure 10 results sections to emphasize these points.</p><p>References</p><p>1. Bhatnagar, M et al.
