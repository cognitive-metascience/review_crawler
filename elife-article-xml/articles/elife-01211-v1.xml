Hin is a member of the DNA invertase subclass of serine recombinases that are regulated by a remote recombinational enhancer element containing two binding sites for the protein Fis. Two Hin dimers bound to specific recombination sites associate with the Fis-bound enhancer by DNA looping where they are remodeled into a synaptic tetramer competent for DNA chemistry and exchange. Here we show that the flexible beta-hairpin arms of the Fis dimers contact the DNA binding domain of one subunit of each Hin dimer. These contacts sandwich the Hin dimers to promote remodeling into the tetramer. A basic region on the Hin catalytic domain then contacts enhancer DNA to complete assembly of the active Hin tetramer. Our results reveal how the enhancer generates the recombination complex that specifies DNA inversion and regulates DNA exchange by the subunit rotation mechanism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01211.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01211.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01211.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many processes in biology rely on enzymes that break both the strands in a DNA molecule, then rearrange the strands, and finally join them back together in a new configuration. These recombination reactions can, for example, change the positions of genetic elements such as enhancers and promoters within the DNA molecule and, therefore, influence how a given gene is expressed as a protein. Cells need to be able to control recombination reactions because they can lead to leukemia and lymphomas if they go wrong.</p><p>The enzymes that catalyze these recombination reactions are called recombinases. One type of recombinase binds to specific sequences of DNA bases and uses an amino acid in the enzyme–usually serine or tyrosine–to break and rejoin the DNA strands. Recombination reactions require the assembly of complexes containing many proteins bound to DNA. Tyrosine recombinases form relatively simple protein-DNA complexes, and these have been studied in detail. Serine recombinases, on the other hand, form more elaborate protein-DNA complexes, and much less is known about these.</p><p>Now McLean et al. have unraveled the mechanism that a serine recombinase called Hin uses to reverse the direction of a stretch of chromosomal DNA in the bacteria <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>. Inverting this stretch of DNA–which contains about 1000 base pairs–changes the position of a gene promoter that is responsible for the production of flagellin, which is the protein that enables the bacterium to move. This is one of the tricks that <italic>Salmonella</italic> uses to evade the immune system of its host.</p><p>Previous research has established that four Hin subunits and two copies of a protein called Fis are needed to invert this stretch of DNA: two Hin subunits bind to each of the two <italic>hix</italic> recombination sites, and the Fis proteins (which are dimers) bind to each end of an enhancer that is located between the <italic>hix</italic> sites. A protein called HU then causes the DNA to bend and form a loop, and the four Hin subunits and the two Fis dimers all come together at the enhancer to form a structure called the invertasome where the recombination reaction occurs. All four DNA strands at the crossover point are broken as a result of a near simultaneous attack by the catalytic serine amino acids in the Hin subunits. One pair of Hin subunits–and the two DNA strands attached to them–then rotate by 180 degrees around the other pair of Hin subunits. This means that the stretch of DNA between the <italic>hix</italic> sites is inverted when the DNA strands are rejoined at the end of the reaction.</p><p>Enhancers often regulate transcription and other reactions from a distance. McLean et al. reveal how an enhancer of a DNA recombination reaction works. The pairs of Hin subunits that initially bind to the DNA are not catalytically active, but when they are brought together by the enhancer and form a tetramer, they become active. Two of the Hin subunits are clamped onto the enhancer by the Fis dimers and by directly interacting with the enhancer DNA, but the other two (and the DNA strands attached to them) are free to rotate within the tetramer. In the <italic>Salmonella</italic> chromosome the enhancer is located close to one of the <italic>hix</italic> sites (∼100 base pairs away from it), so the length of the DNA between the enhancer and <italic>hix</italic> site physically limits the number of Hin subunit rotations to just one.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01211.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01211.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic></kwd><kwd>site-specific DNA recombination</kwd><kwd>serine recombinase</kwd><kwd>recombinational enhancer</kwd><kwd>synaptic complex</kwd><kwd>DNA strand exchange</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM038509</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McLean</surname><given-names>Meghan M</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name><name><surname>Dhar</surname><given-names>Gautam</given-names></name><name><surname>Heiss</surname><given-names>John K</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Reid C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health, National Research Service Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM07104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McLean</surname><given-names>Meghan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of the recombination complex responsible for flagellar antigen switching in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, and the mechanism that regulates the site-specific DNA inversion reaction, have been determined.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Site-specific recombination reactions have evolved as a relatively simple solution to a myriad of biological problems including gene regulation, viral integration, DNA transposition, chromosome segregation, and the programmed creation of genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Craig, 2002</xref>). Most site-specific recombinases can be classified into two structurally and mechanistically unrelated groups that are named for the use of either a serine or tyrosine as the active site residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grindley et al., 2006</xref>). Some reactions, such as those mediated by the tyrosine recombinases Cre and FLP, only require the recombinase and its cognate DNA binding sites, whereas others involve additional accessory proteins and assemble elaborate synaptic complexes that provide tight control over chemical and mechanical steps of the reaction.</p><p>The synaptic complexes formed by serine recombinases contain the two recombining DNA segments on the outside of a tetrameric protein core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nollmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2005</xref>). All four DNA strands are cleaved by near simultaneous attack on the DNA backbone by the catalytic serines to form 5′-phosphoserine linkages, thereby generating double-strand breaks at both recombination sites. DNA strands are then exchanged by a subunit rotation mechanism where one pair of synapsed subunits, together with their covalently-bound DNA strands, rotates 180° relative to the other pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stark et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhar et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2011</xref>).

It functions to ensure that intramolecular DNA inversion is the exclusive outcome of the reaction, promotes the Hin conformational changes required for DNA chemistry and exchange, and limits most subunit rotation reactions to a single 180° step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanaar et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heichman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moskowitz et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merickel and Johnson, 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Whereas wild-type Hin is chemically inactive without the Fis/enhancer system, mutants that no longer require the Fis/enhancer element or DNA supercoiling have been isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klippel et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanders and Johnson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heiss et al., 2011</xref>). These hyperactive mutants catalyze recombination promiscuously, being no longer restricted to promoting inversion between recombination sites on the same DNA molecule and no longer confined to a single round of subunit rotation.</p><p>Three residues on one of the mobile β-hairpin arms of the Fis dimer are required to activate Hin-catalyzed DNA inversion through direct contact with Hin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koch et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Osuna et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Safo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhar et al., 2009a</xref>). In the present work we first identify residues within the DNA binding domain (DBD) of Hin that are contacted by the β-hairpin arms of Fis and identify which two of the four Hin subunits within the tetramer are associated with Fis in the active invertasome. We show that Fis contacts to inactive Hin dimers at an early step of invertasome formation lead to assembly of catalytically-active tetramers. Unexpectedly, we find that a localized basic surface on the Hin catalytic domain is also required for enhancer-dependent assembly of active tetramers and demonstrate using tethered chemical nucleases that it is associated with enhancer DNA between the two Fis dimers. These contacts enable us to construct a molecular model for the assembly of the invertasome structure at a plectonemic DNA branch that explains how the Fis/enhancer system controls orientation-specific synapsis, promotes the quaternary changes in Hin required for DNA cleavage and exchange, and prevents multiple subunit rotations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fis contacts the DNA binding domain of Hin</title><p>We first used site-directed crosslinking approaches to identify regions on Hin that are required for association with the Fis/enhancer element. For these experiments, a cysteine (Q21C) was introduced into the tip of the Fis β-hairpin arms that are critical for activating Hin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Invertasomes trapped in a DNA-cleaved state were assembled using Hin, Fis-Q21C, and a supercoiled plasmid substrate and subjected to crosslinking using the heterobifunctional agent AMAS (N-(α-maleimidoacetoxy) succinimide ester). AMAS chemically links Cys21 on Fis via the maleimide group to a lysine residue on Hin via the succinimidyl group. After quenching the crosslinking reaction, the <italic>hix</italic> recombination sites were separated from vector sequences using EcoRI, the EcoR1 ends were <sup>32</sup>P-labeled, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhar et al., 2009a</xref>).

Because the two functional groups of AMAS are separated by only a 4.4 Å spacer, the crosslinked Hin lysine(s) are expected to be close to Cys21 on Fis.

Two of the four lysines in the DBD are located in the unstructured C-terminal segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiu et al., 2002</xref>), which is not present in other DNA invertases and can be deleted from Hin without affecting Fis-activated DNA inversion. The remaining eight lysines were each individually mutated to alanine and tested for crosslinking with Fis-Q21C; a truncation mutant missing the two C-terminal lysines was also evaluated. Each of the mutants accumulated substantial amounts of cleaved invertasomes at the time of crosslinking (10 min incubation), as also shown by the levels of covalent Hin-(<sup>32</sup>P-DNA) products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Hin-K146C at the N-terminus of helix 1 within the DBD generated ∼15% crosslinked Fis-Hin products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>), a level similar to that of wild-type Hin crosslinked to Fis-Q21C by AMAS. Hin-K158C at the C-terminus of the DBD helix 1 generated low levels of BMOE-mediated crosslinks with Fis-Q21C. No cysteine substitutions within the catalytic domain generated crosslinks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that the alanine mutations (e.g., Hin-K51A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>) may have disrupted the AMAS-mediated crosslinking via an indirect mechanism (see below). Additional solvent-exposed residues within the DBD helix 1 region were converted to cysteine and those that generated substantial levels of DNA-cleaved invertasomes were tested for BMOE crosslinking with Fis-Q21C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Hin-H147C, Hin-E150C, and Hin-Q151C within the α-helix formed crosslinks with Fis-Q21C, but H160C in the loop connecting to DBD helix 2 did not generate crosslinks. The 8 Å crosslinks between Fis-Q21C and five positions within helix 1 of the Hin DBD demonstrate that the Hin DBD is in close proximity to the Fis β-hairpin arms in the DNA-cleaved invertasome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Arg154 and Leu155 on the Hin DBD are critical for Fis-activated DNA inversion</title><p>An alanine scan of the DBD helix 1 was performed to determine the specific residues required for Fis/enhancer activation.

Like the helix-1 region of the DBD, the helix-B region is specifically required for Fis/enhancer activation because mutations within this region have no effect on Fis-independent recombination by hyperactive Hin mutants. This region forms a localized basic surface, which is positioned against the DNA segment connecting the two Fis binding sites of the enhancer in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A,C</xref>), as demonstrated by scission by the chemical nuclease FeBABE coupled to residue 54 located adjacent to helix-B. Arginines and lysines from the helix-B region protrude towards AT-rich (ATTTA and TAATG) minor grooves in a manner reminiscent of histone-DNA interactions in nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). The increased electronegative potential of the AT-rich, narrowed, minor groove may enhance interactions by these basic residues on Hin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rohs et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, enhancer sequences that are G/C-rich rather than A/T-rich exhibit moderately reduced activation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The mutations could also be causing small changes in DNA curvature of the enhancer that impact invertasome assembly.</p><p>The basic character of key residues within the helix-B region is also uniquely conserved among the DNA invertase subclass of serine recombinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Of the 15 DNA invertases we have aligned, residue 47 is always a lysine, and residues 48 and 51 are equally represented by lysine and arginine, suggesting they are not involved in base-specific interactions. Members of the resolvase or integrase subclasses of serine recombinases, which are not regulated by a Fis/enhancer system, tend to not have lysines and arginines at the same positions, and the electrostatic surface over this region in the resolvase tetramer is much less basic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, as discussed further below, both γδ/Tn3 and Sin resolvases contain nearby regulatory residues that mediate critical protein-protein contacts during assembly of their respective synaptic complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murley and Grindley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mouw et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olorunniji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The invertasome model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> represents a late complex in the activation pathway in which all four DNA strands are cleaved and poised for exchange by subunit rotation. However, the Fis/enhancer system initially functions much earlier in the pathway to promote synapsis and remodeling of Hin dimers into the active tetramer, as wild-type Hin is unable to form active tetramers without the Fis/enhancer element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanders and Johnson, 2004</xref>). We demonstrate here that Fis is able to productively contact inactive Hin dimers and that Hin dimers covalently crosslinked to Fis can transition into an active tetramer competent for DNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> DNA-bound Hin dimer models are docked to the Fis dimers on the enhancer in a manner approximating the Fis-Hin subunit contacts in the invertasome model. The two Hin dimers are sandwiched between the Fis β-hairpin arms such that the catalytic domains are adjacent to each other and thus optimally positioned to isomerize into a tetramer. Remodeling into the active tetramer may occur through an intermediate captured by the crystal structures of TP901 integrase (PDB ID: 3BVP) and γδ resolvase (PDB ID: 2GM5). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> we model this pre-activated Hin tetramer intermediate based on the TP901 integrase tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yuan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heiss et al., 2011</xref>). The quaternary changes accompanying the remodeling of the dimers into the pre-activated tetramer result in a compact structure that more readily fits between the Fis dimers on the enhancer, similar to the DNA-cleaved tetramer model (see also <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-01211-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01211.024</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><p>Assembly of the Hin invertasome and DNA exchange by subunit rotation within the invertasome structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–E</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01211.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01211.024</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>During the modeled conformational changes from pre-activated to DNA-cleaved tetramer the position of the Hin DBDs relative to the Fis dimers undergo relatively small changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). However, the position of Hin helix-B changes substantially relative to the enhancer. Initially, helix-B is at a ∼50° angle with respect to the enhancer DNA with its C-terminal end (Lys51) near the phosphate backbone and the remainder of the helix oriented away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Further movement of the catalytic domains driven by coulombic forces between the helix-B region and the enhancer DNA will clamp the basic helix-B region onto the enhancer DNA, locking the subunits into the active conformation competent for DNA cleavage and subunit rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These DNA interactions by the catalytic domain of Hin subunits bound to <italic>hix1L</italic> and <italic>hix2R</italic> augment the relatively weak interactions between the DBDs of the same subunits and Fis to stabilize the active invertasome structure.</p><p>Our model for Hin invertasome assembly reveals how the Fis/enhancer element functions to regulate recombination at multiple levels. Initially, Fis-Hin interactions, together with the propensity of plectonemically supercoiled DNA to form branched DNA structures containing 2 (−) nodes, localize the two <italic>hix</italic>-bound Hin dimers at the enhancer. As Fis-Hin interactions have not been observed by standard solution assays, conformational energy from DNA supercoiling appears essential to promote synapsis. Formation of the active Hin tetramer could then be driven by mass action forces. For example, dynamic scissor-like movements between subunits of each dimer may transiently expose the hydrophobic surfaces of the apposing dimer interfaces to initiate remodeling into the tetramer. Conformational energy from the Fis/enhancer segment may also be harvested to drive tetramer assembly forward. This energy could be transduced from the twist deficit present in the negatively supercoiled DNA and/or by the mobile Fis β-hairpin arms to facilitate compaction of the two dimers into the tetramer. Spring-like mechanisms contributing to assembly of active recombination complexes also have been proposed for the Tn10 transpososome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chalmers et al., 1998</xref>). Finally, attractive electrostatic forces between the helix-B region and the enhancer DNA promote the final conformational change into the active tetramer structure.</p><p>In our invertasome model the supercoiling energy in the looped DNA between the enhancer and <italic>hix</italic> sites drives the clockwise rotation of the top pair of subunits relative to the static bottom subunit pair that is fixed onto the enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). A single clockwise rotation of subunits together with their linked DNA strands will result in inversion of the DNA between the <italic>hix</italic> sites with an accompanying loss of four supercoils, as shown for Hin- and Gin-mediated DNA inversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanaar et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merickel and Johnson, 2004</xref>). When the distance between a <italic>hix</italic> site and the enhancer is short, as in the native configuration in the <italic>Salmonella</italic> chromosome (∼100 bp between <italic>hixL</italic> and the proximal Fis binding site), the small loop will inhibit additional subunit rotations because of torsional strain generated from multiple DNA windings (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, additional rotations can occur under conditions where the loop is expanded by release of the Fis/enhancer from the Hin tetramer during the reaction or with substrates containing long segments of DNA between <italic>hixL</italic> and the enhancer. The structures of the resulting knotted DNA products are fully consistent with DNA exchange initiating within our invertasome model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanaar et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heichman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crisona et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merickel and Johnson, 2004</xref>). Thus, the multiple connections stabilizing the Hin tetramer onto the Fis/enhancer element function to restrict processive subunit exchanges. We experimentally demonstrate in this work that the final chemical step in the reaction, Hin-catalyzed DNA ligation, can efficiently occur when Fis and Hin remain physically connected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), implying that the invertasome normally remains intact over the course of the entire reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Summary and relationship with other serine recombinases</title><p>To summarize, we propose a multistep pathway for assembly of the recombinationally-competent Hin invertasome. Step 1 begins by the association of inactive Hin dimers bound to each of the <italic>hix</italic> sites with Fis dimers bound at the ends of the enhancer segment at the base of a supercoiled DNA branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In step 2 the localized Hin dimers are reconfigured into a pre-activated tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We propose this occurs via simultaneous opening of the dimer interfaces, which then transition into the tetramer in a process that may be facilitated by energetic forces transmitted by the Fis/enhancer segment. Formation of the initial tetrameric structure positions the C-terminal ends of helix-B towards enhancer DNA. In step 3, attractive electrostatic forces then ‘pull’ the basic helix-B region of the catalytic domains towards the enhancer DNA, clamping it against the enhancer segment between the two Fis dimers and completing the assembly of the tetramer that is competent for DNA cleavage and exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).</p><p>A hallmark of reactions promoted by the invertase/resolvase subfamily of serine recombinases is the formation of supercoiling-dependent, topologically-defined, higher-order synaptic complexes that are responsible for uniquely specifying the recombinant product. Whereas the invertasome structure utilizes a remote enhancer to align the recombination sites appropriately for inversion, resolvases assemble tightly interwrapped synaptosomes containing non-catalytic resolvase subunits bound to extended recombination sites, sometimes together with auxiliary DNA bending proteins, to align recombination sites for deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grindley et al., 2006</xref>). Even though the molecular architectures of the complexes are very different, there are some striking similarities in the regulatory protein interfaces, which provide general insights into the control of this family of recombinases.</p><p>In the Sin-catalyzed deletion reaction, synapsis is initiated by an interaction between regulatory dimers bound to each recombination site via residues in their DBD helix 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mouw et al., 2008</xref>). This interface can be related to the Fis-Hin interaction involving helix I of the Hin DBD that initiates invertasome formation. As with Hin, the DBD interaction by the Sin regulatory dimers is dispensable in the context of hyperactive mutants that promote recombination in the absence of the regulatory sub-sites. A second protein interface required for recombination by Sin, as well as the γδ/Tn3 resolvases, occurs between regulatory and catalytic subunits and can be related to the helix-B—enhancer DNA interface in the Hin invertasome. For Sin this interaction involves residues Phe52 and Arg54 that are located immediately adjacent to helix-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mouw et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>). For γδ/Tn3 resolvases a cluster of residues (Arg2, Arg32, Lys54, and Glu56; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) comprising the so-called 2–3′ interface between regulatory and catalytic dimers is important for assembly of the active synaptosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murley and Grindley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olorunniji et al., 2008</xref>). The surface of the γδ resolvase tetramer exhibits a basic patch that contains some of the 2–3′ interface residues but whose location is shifted from the basic region on Hin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Like Hin, the interaction between regulatory and catalytic subunits in the resolvase reactions is dispensable in the context of strong hyperactive mutants that promote indiscriminant recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olorunniji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>). Taken together, the Hin, Sin, and γδ/Tn3 results imply that protein-protein or DNA-protein forces acting on this region of the catalytic domain may not only stabilize the active recombination complex but promote remodeling of this subfamily of serine recombinases into their active tetrameric conformation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mutagenesis and purification of Hin and Fis mutants</title><p>Site-directed mutagenesis of the <italic>hin</italic> gene cloned into pET11a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Merickel et al., 1998</xref>) was performed using the QuikChange method.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Leemor Joshua-Tor, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic>. It has been carefully reviewed by three reviewers. All agreed that this is an important model system for both a general understanding of how multiprotein complexes assemble on DNA targets with well-separated binding sites and where supercoiling is involved, as well as more specifically for serine recombinase-family proteins. In addition, the paper presents a clever and comprehensive set of experiments that reveal the important contacts of the Hin invertasome both with Fis and with the enhancer DNA. The model for Hin/Fis assembly on DNA provides a satisfying explanation for how Fis stimulates inversion and how the system is wired to specifically carry out inversion with production of primarily unknotted product. A particularly appealing aspect of the work is that it makes use of existing structural models to carry out specific, targeted cross-linking experiments, along with targeted hydroxyl radical cleavage mapping, all of which are technically challenging. However, one of the most interesting findings, the unexpected similarity between invertases and resolvases, e.g., between Hin and Sin, in regions used to make interfaces in their respective synaptic complexes, could be highlighted more clearly in the manuscript.</p><p>The reviewers had several specific comments:</p><p>1) Role of the catalytic domain residues (47-51) in stimulating inversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and related Discussion). The explanation of how Fis-Hin interactions could stabilize a synaptic tetramer of Hin subunits seems very plausible and is well supported by a lot of data. The explanation of how the catalytic domain residues contribute also seems reasonable, but one can't help but think that perhaps something else is going on as well. The interaction with enhancer DNA could help promote stable formation of the tetramer, but it is less clear why loss of these interactions leads to a higher frequency of multiple rotations and knotted products. The explanation given is that the Fis/enhancer can more easily detach, leading to less control of the reaction as the short loop increases in size. An additional/alternative source for an explanation can be considered from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, where the ‘unknotted recombinant’ is predicted to have DNA crossing over the catalytic domains in a way that does not exist in the parental configuration. Is it not possible that residues 47-51 could interact with this new DNA and contribute to product stabilization in a similar manner? This is more difficult to model than the enhancer DNA, but would be worth mentioning. On the other hand, local stiffness of the DNA might be enough to prevent it from making its way down to helix B even with a little extra torque as shown for the product. It might be useful to clarify your explanation of the topology experiment. Is it correct to say that, with the small loop, if the enhancer stays put, multiple rounds of recombination are energetically uphill because of the conformational strain they'd introduce in the dinky loop. If the enhancer wanders off, the loop can expand to accommodate additional nodes. The control experiment showing that loop size matters for the WT but not for the mutant is very satisfying in this regard.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> describes nice experiments that show the helix B mutations are only needed if Fis is. The paper would be more interesting if it included some comparison with Rowland et al.'s quite similar experiments on Sin.</p><p>3) Discussion and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>: the number of K and R near the end of helix B doesn't look significantly different in the invertases vs resolvases.</p><p>4) It should be discussed that the region of the C-terminus of helix B also includes the long-studied 2-3' γδ mutants (R52 and K54) and Sin mutants with analogous phenotypes (F52 and R54). Especially given that Hin, Sin, and γδ have otherwise-different synaptic complexes, and that this corner of the protein contacts other subunits in Sin and (presumably) γδ, but contacts DNA in Hin, it is reasonable to suspect that there is probably deeper significance to its recurrence in screens. Are the contacts made to the C-terminus of helix B only stabilizing the binding of other entities in the complex, or could they be some sort of “pull tab” by which the accessory proteins/DNA can actively destabilize the dimer and tip the conformational equilibrium toward the active tetramer? The sentence “Finally, attractive electrostatic...” suggests this idea, but better comparisons with γδ and Sin would bolster it nicely.</p><p>5) It isn’t evident that the mutants in the initial crosslinking experiments (K51 and K158 in particular) are folded properly, though this appears to be taken care of by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. Perhaps the H107Y controls could be more easily explained.</p><p>6) If one is unfamiliar with this system, it is sometimes hard to follow where some of the features, helix B etc. that are being discussed in various figures were positioned relative to the tetramer. Even some indication of which part of the structure was the DBD and which was the catalytic domain of Hin would be helpful, especially since this journal is aimed at a more general audience. How is the orientation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> related to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>? One suggestion is to show the rest of the complex as some sort of pale, transparent ghost.</p><p>In summary, there is substantial enthusiasm and we hope you would address the specific comments in a revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01211.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>The editor's and reviewers’ comments (comments 2–4) suggested that we more fully relate and compare our results with Hin with those concerning the regulation and assembly of recombination complexes in related resolvase reactions.

We highlight relevant regulatory residues in the Sin and γδ/Tn3 resolvase systems in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and specifically state that resolvase hyperactive mutants containing regulatory mutations analogous to the Hin DBD (Sin) and helix-B (Sin and γδ/Tn3) interfaces are able to catalyze recombination in the absence of accessory sub-sites. We have added a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>) comparing the electrostatic surfaces of Hin and resolvase, which illustrates the differences in charge over the helix-B region as well as the alternative basic patch (part of the 2-3′ interface) on resolvase.</p><p><italic>1) Role of the catalytic domain residues (47-51) in stimulating inversion (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>, and related Discussion). The explanation of how Fis-Hin interactions could stabilize a synaptic tetramer of Hin subunits seems very plausible and is well supported by a lot of data. The explanation of how the catalytic domain residues contribute also seems reasonable, but one can't help but think that perhaps something else is going on as well. The interaction with enhancer DNA could help promote stable formation of the tetramer, but it is less clear why loss of these interactions leads to a higher frequency of multiple rotations and knotted products. The explanation given is that the Fis/enhancer can more easily detach, leading to less control of the reaction as the short loop increases in size. An additional/alternative source for an explanation can be considered from</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4D</italic></xref><italic>, where the ‘unknotted recombinant’ is predicted to have DNA crossing over the catalytic domains in a way that does not exist in the parental configuration. Is it not possible that residues 47-51 could interact with this new DNA and contribute to product stabilization in a similar manner? This is more difficult to model than the enhancer DNA, but would be worth mentioning. On the other hand, local stiffness of the DNA might be enough to prevent it from making its way down to helix B even with a little extra torque as shown for the product. It might be useful to clarify your explanation of the topology experiment. Is it correct to say that, with the small loop, if the enhancer stays put, multiple rounds of recombination are energetically uphill because of the conformational strain they'd introduce in the dinky loop. If the enhancer wanders off, the loop can expand to accommodate additional nodes. The control experiment showing that loop size matters for the WT but not for the mutant is very satisfying in this regard</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers propose an additional/alternative model for why mutations in helix-B of the catalytic domain lead to processive DNA exchanges. If we understand correctly, the reviewers suggest that the DNA strand in the small loop is “captured” by the catalytic domains of the top subunits (as drawn in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) after DNA exchange, thereby inhibiting further exchanges. Although this is an intriguing idea, it seems to us to be unlikely. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, the green DNA emanating from the yellow Hin subunit would have to become severely kinked in order to associate with the helix-B region of the top subunits. As the reviewers note, local DNA stiffness, particularly if the DBD of the yellow subunit remains bound to DNA, would strongly disfavor such a configuration.</p><p>We have revised the section of the Discussion explaining the topological argument for why release of the enhancer (or the presence of long DNA segments between recombination sites and enhancer) can permit additional subunit rotations. We hope this revision plus small modifications in the Results help make the revised version clearer.</p><p><italic>4) It should be discussed that the region of the C-terminus of helix B also includes the long-studied 2-3' γδ mutants (R52 and K54) and Sin mutants with analogous phenotypes (F52 and R54). Especially given that Hin, Sin, and γδ have otherwise-different synaptic complexes, and that this corner of the protein contacts other subunits in Sin and (presumably) γδ, but contacts DNA in Hin, it is reasonable to suspect that there is probably deeper significance to its recurrence in screens. Are the contacts made to the C-terminus of helix B only stabilizing the binding of other entities in the complex, or could they be some sort of “pull tab” by which the accessory proteins/DNA can actively destabilize the dimer and tip the conformational equilibrium toward the active tetramer? The sentence “Finally, attractive electrostatic...” suggests this idea, but better comparisons with γδ and Sin would bolster it nicely</italic>.</p><p>As noted in the top paragraph, most of this comment is now addressed in greater detail in the final section of the Discussion, along with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>. We certainly agree with the idea that helix-B likely functions to “pull” the tetramer to its active conformation. To give this important point greater emphasis we have inserted “…driven by coulombic forces between the helix-B region and the enhancer DNA…” in the paragraph above the sentence referred to by the reviewers: “Finally, attractive electrostatic forces between the helix-B region and the enhancer DNA promote the final conformational change into the active tetramer structure.” We discuss this again in the final section at the end (both in the Hin summary and in relation to the resolvase systems).</p><p><italic>5) It isn’t evident that the mutants in the initial crosslinking experiments (K51 and K158 in particular) are folded properly, though this appears to be taken care of by</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref><italic>. Perhaps the H107Y controls could be more easily explained</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are correct that the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2F and 4C</xref> effectively rule out a folding problem by alanine substitutions at the critical residues in the DBD helix-1 and helix-B. This has now been specifically stated. While we cannot rule out a small effect on folding in the case of the Lys51 and Lys158 mutants, the amount of covalent Hin-DNA cleavage products in the crosslinking experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the BMOE crosslinking with K158C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>,) and the Hin inversion activities of K51A and K158A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), argue that at least a substantial fraction of these mutant proteins are correctly folded. Nevertheless, we have qualified the last sentence of the second paragraph of Results to say “These results provide an initial indication…”</p><p><italic>6) If one is unfamiliar with this system, it is sometimes hard to follow where some of the features, helix B etc. that are being discussed in various figures were positioned relative to the tetramer. Even some indication of which part of the structure was the DBD and which was the catalytic domain of Hin would be helpful, especially since this journal is aimed at a more general audience. How is the orientation in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>related to that in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>? One suggestion is to show the rest of the complex as some sort of pale, transparent ghost</italic>.</p><p>We have labeled the DBD and catalytic domains on the Hin structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and helix-B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. We prepared a version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> containing the rest of the complex as a transparent ghost. However, we feel this makes the figure much more complex, preempts <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and de-emphasizes the major point of the figure, which is the locations of the FeBABE cleavage sites. We now state in the figure legend that the Hin molecules are rotated 40° about the y-axis relative to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> showing the whole model. A figure supplement including the rest of the complex as a transparent ghost could be linked to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> if it is felt to be necessary.</p></body></sub-article></article>
